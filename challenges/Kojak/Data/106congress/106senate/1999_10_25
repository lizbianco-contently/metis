Mr. President, I come to the Senate Chamber this morning \nto comment about the untimely passing of our distinguished colleague, \nSenator John Chafee.\n  Senator Chafee died last night of heart failure, and I learned about \nit when I arrived in town this morning, at, I must say, a considerable \nshock. Senator Chafee sat next to me in the Senate. In addition to \nproximity, we were very close on many, many other lines. Senator Chafee \nleaves behind an extraordinary record as a great humanitarian, a great \nSenator, and a really great American. His political career is \nlegendary--four terms in the Senate, elected in 1976, 1982, 1988, and \nagain in 1994. Prior to that, he served three terms as the Governor of \nRhode Island. His biography on the web site states that Senator John \nChafee is the only Republican to be elected to the Senate from Rhode \nIsland in the past 68 years.\n  He brought a unique perspective to the Senate as a protector of the \nenvironment and as a firm advocate for expanding health care to every \nAmerican. During the contentious days in 1993 and 1994 when the Senate \nwas considering\n\n[[Page S13068]]\n\nthe extension of health care, Senator Chafee organized a small group of \ncentrists to meet in his office every Thursday morning at 8:30, and \ncame forward with a very solid bill on health care. More recently, \nSenator Chafee was the leader of a group of centrists, both Republicans \nand Democrats, to come forward with a Patients' Bill of Rights. He had \nan understanding and a political breadth that led to accolades from the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n  He was the leader of a small group of centrists, also known as \nmoderates, and he brought a degree of civility to this body and this \nCongress at a time when civility was sorely lacking. John Chafee could \nwalk into a room full of controversy and arguments, strike a middle \ncourse, and bring Senators and Members on all sides to a position of \ncoalescence and accommodation.\n  John Chafee was a strong family man, very close to his wife Ginny, \nand was also an active squash player. I tried to lure him to the squash \ncourts early in the morning. He would have nothing of 7 a.m. squash. My \nwife lives in Philadelphia; John Chafee's wife lives in Washington. He \ninsisted on first things first. You could find him in the afternoon \nfrequently playing squash with John Warner, both coming in for a vote \nfreshly showered.\n  John Chafee brought his son to our centrist meeting recently, who is \na mayor of Rhode Island's second biggest city and who is seeking to \nsucceed John Chafee in the Senate. I noted last Thursday afternoon that \nJohn Chafee missed three votes. We were on a bill and had three \ncontroversial votes at 5:30, and I worried a little bit about John \nChafee but had no idea that the situation was as serious as it \ndeveloped with his passing last night of heart failure.\n  John Chafee leaves a powerful legacy in many lives, a real giant in \nthe Senate, and he will be sorely missed on legislative lines and on \ncompassionate lines because he was such a good friend to all 99 of his \nfellow Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise with deep and heavy sadness to \nmourn the passing of a great statesman, my dear friend, John Chafee, \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  There will be a lot of eulogies on the floor over the next several \ndays. For the moment, I want to say a few words about a very great man, \na very close friend, someone who I think is one of the best Members of \nthe Senate in many, many years.\n  First, a little bit of history about John Chafee. He was born to one \nof the most prominent New England families. He could have coasted. He \ncould have gone into business. He could have gone into law. No, he did \nnot do that. What did he do? He chose service to his people. It was an \nextraordinary life of service.\n  John was a marine. John fought in the historic battle at Guadalcanal. \nA few years later, he reenlisted and led troops in combat in Korea.\n  On a lighter note, as far as I know, Senator Chafee was the only \nMember of the Senate who was also a member of the American College \nWrestling Hall of Fame. Move over, Jesse Ventura. We have a wrestler in \nthe Hall of Fame.\n  John, after serving in the armed services, later turned to public \nservice. He was a Governor of Rhode Island. He was a Secretary of the \nNavy. Since 1976, he was a Member of the Senate.\n  When I first joined the Senate about 20 years ago, the last thing in \nthe world I believed was over a period of time he and I would become \nvery close friends. We were sitting as junior Members, very far away \nfrom each other, on the Finance Committee and also on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I am from Montana. John is from Rhode \nIsland. In Montana, we even have ranches the size of the State of Rhode \nIsland. We were from very different States with different \nconstituencies. Nevertheless, it was a circumstance of seniority that \nbrought us together. I was very privileged to work with John. We \nexchanged chairmanships and ranking memberships on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. We developed a very close relationship.\n  He was one of the best persons, in my judgment, in the Senate. On the \nFinance Committee, he worked to balance the budget. He put fiscal \nausterity, on behalf of future generations, ahead of ideology. He \nworked for a system of free trade. Most important, John spoke for those \npeople in the shadows--the poor, the elderly, and children. Especially \nchildren with special needs, whether it was Medicaid or welfare reform, \nJohn was a very strong advocate. In fact, he was a stronger advocate by \nfar than most Members of the Senate.\n  On the Environment and Public Works Committee, which he chaired, he \ndid so in the great tradition of other New England Senators: Ed Muskie, \nBob Stafford and George Mitchell. Tremendous tradition on that \ncommittee.\n  His accomplishments are legion. We breathe cleaner air because of \nJohn Chafee. Because of his diligent work on the Clean Water Act, we \ndrink cleaner water because of John Chafee. We have a rich legacy, and \nJohn Chafee left that legacy to our children and grandchildren. In \naddition, he vigorously pushed through the Oil Pollution Act in the \nwake of the Valdez tragedy; the Safe Drinking Water Act; Endangered \nSpecies Act; the National Wildlife Refuge System is in place because of \nMuskie, Stafford, and, particularly, John Chafee; the Coastal \nBarrier Resources System--all bear John's mark.\n\n  Personally, I will remember John Chafee as a decent, civil, \ncourteous, commonsense gentleman. His issues and the legislation he \nworked for were very important. But it is the man who means the most to \nme and is remembered most by me. He reminds me of my father. He never \nraised his voice, never lost his temper, was always calm, always cool, \noften with a little twinkle in his eye, a sense of humor. He had \nrespect for life. He knew what was important and not important. He kept \nhis eye on the ball and wouldn't let conversations drift to gossip or \nextraneous matters that didn't matter; they prevented Members from \naccomplishing the objective.\n  Uncommon common sense. John Chafee had a sixth sense for common \nsense. He knew the basic, balanced, right thing to do.\n  Senator Specter mentioned the organizations he put together, the \nmoderates working on health care. That is only one of the many examples \nof John Chafee trying to get something accomplished for the good of \nAmerica.\n  Unquestioned integrity. We say around here that a man's word is his \nbond. It is true. We always strive toward it because we know it is \nnecessary, not only to get legislation passed but it is one of the most \nimportant things in life. We knew when John said something it was true. \nNo one ever questioned what John said.\n  My father's name was John. Maybe that is part of it. The two of them \nremind me so much of each other. Both were veterans and knew the \nimportance of America--maybe because they were veterans. John knew from \nfighting at Guadalcanal, fighting in Korea, fighting for American \nvirtues, American values and what is right in America. Maybe that is \nwhat enabled him to keep his perspective and calm.\n  It has been mentioned he is a family man. I saw it many times. Not \ntoo many days ago I was on the floor with John and he said: Gee, I \npromised Ginny I would be home by 2 o'clock today. His legs were \nbothering him. Gee, I want to get this bill passed; I will vote on \nthis.\n  He was torn for the right reasons, torn between family and duty. But \nhe gave honor to both because they were so important to John.\n  I, too, was stunned when I learned of John's death last night. We \nwill miss him terribly. He was a most wonderful man. His memory will be \nembedded strongly in all of us. It is a memory I know I will cherish \nforever and ever. I will always see John's twinkle, his smile, his \nearnest sense of trying to do the right thing.\n  On behalf of my wife, Wanda, and my staff, our deepest sympathy and \ncondolences go to Ginny and the family, as well as members of John's \nstaff, some of whom are on the floor. John was very close to his staff. \nIt is a wonderful, tight knit family. Our deepest condolences go out to \nall of them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, listening to Senator Baucus, I am \nreminded of a couple of other items about Senator Chafee which I think \nought to be mentioned. One is that he served as Secretary of the Navy, \nand, secondly, he served in the Marine Corps during\n\n[[Page S13069]]\n\nWorld War II and was part of the invasion of Guadalcanal, the largest \nof the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.\n  He was recalled during the Korean war. I had always wondered about \nthe fairness of the World War II veterans being recalled during the \nKorean war. I served myself during the Korean war stateside as a \nspecial agent in the Office of Special Investigations of the Air Force. \nAt that time, so many of my colleagues avoided military service by \ngoing off to law school or graduate school. I had noted at that time \nthat so many veterans were so called. Ted Williams stuck in my mind, a \ngreat baseball player, who served during World War II and went off to \nthe Korean war, cutting short his playing time.\n  I had a discussion with John Chafee about that one day. I asked him \nabout his views on being recalled to active service during the Korean \nwar when so many were not serving at all. In his characteristic \npatriotic way he said, no, there was a job to be done and he was going \nto do it. He was glad to serve again in Korea, a marine in the toughest \nkind of work.\n  That was John Chafee; always a great patriot and a great American.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week Paul Laxalt and I were talking \nabout some general items, and the name John Chafee came up. We had a \npleasant visit, Senator Laxalt and I, talking about John Chafee, \ntalking about how much we liked him, what a good guy he was, what a \ngood friend of ours he was. In my opinion, the United States has lost \none of its true heroes. John Chafee died last night. I say this not \nsimply to honor his time in the Senate, where he served with \ndistinction for 23 years; I say it because of the way John Chafee lived \nhis life.\n  From a very young age, he showed the characteristics of leadership he \nwent on to display throughout his whole life. When John was only 11 \nyears old, he saved the life of a young boy who had fallen into a \nfrozen pond where they were playing hockey. Everyone else stood around. \nLittle John Chafee went into the water to save this boy's life.\n  He was a student at Yale during the Second World War. He had \ncompleted 3 years of school at Yale when he joined the U.S. Marine \nCorps to go fight for his country, and fight for his country he did. On \nhis 20th birthday, he participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal--a \nmarine who served with distinction in the Second World War.\n  The definitive book written about the Korean War is a book called \n``The Coldest War,'' written by a man named Brady. The hero of that \nbook is John Chafee, a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps during that \ncoldest war. I have spoken on any number of occasions about John \nChafee, about what a hero he was to me and to the rest of the country. \nI am happy to do that today so this Record can be spread throughout the \nSenate for his family, his staff, and many, many friends.\n  John Chafee truly was a hero, as indicated in that book, ``The \nColdest War.'' He is a man who served as Secretary of the Navy during \nthe height of the war in Vietnam. He was a very, very effective \nlegislator. He was, as has been indicated by Senator Baucus, a very \nquiet, self-effacing man. He assumed positions of leadership that would \nhave been easy to simply avoid. On the committee on which I served with \nhim for 13 years, Environment and Public Works, he was a leader even \nbefore he became chairman of that committee.\n  Some of the finest work John Chafee did is not legislation that has \nbeen completed. One example is the Endangered Species Act, a very \ndifficult bill that had to come forward. He was able, 2 years ago, to \nput together a very important piece of legislation, and got the help of \nthe subcommittee, Governor Kempthorne, then-Senator Kempthorne, so we \nhad two Republicans and we had the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, Senator Baucus, and I was a ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. We all joined together. None of us wanted to be on that \nlegislation, but we had to be because it was the right thing to do, as \nthe leadership of John Chafee indicated. It was legislation that should \nhave passed. We are always going to look back at that piece of \nlegislation, saying if we had done that, the problems with the \nEndangered Species Act would be behind us.\n  He served as Governor of the State of Rhode Island, and his service \nin the Governorship of Rhode Island, even though many years before he \ncame to the Senate, was marked by the same dogged determination to get \nthings done. He did not believe in the status quo. He didn't believe in \ngridlock. He had determination and spoke up when he felt strongly about \nissues, and there were a lot of issues he felt strongly about, such as \nhealth and the environment.\n  He was elected Governor of the State of Rhode Island when he was 39 \nyears old. By that time, though, he had already served in two wars, had \ncome back to Yale and completed his degree there, and then got a law \ndegree from Harvard. That is pretty good. Even that was not the end of \nhis service. Before becoming Governor, he served 6 years in the General \nAssembly of the State of Rhode Island.\n\n  As Governor of the State of Rhode Island, he helped bring Rhode \nIsland into the modern era. He created the State's community college \nsystem, created the Rhode Island Public Transportation Administration, \nwhich did many things but is noted for the construction of Interstate \n95 and the Newport Bridge, two infrastructure projects that allowed \nRhode Island to flourish as it does today.\n  He fought for fair housing and unemployment laws. He fought to get \nthings done. He not only fought for them but was able to get them \npassed. He provided for State-provided heath care for the elderly long \nbefore Medicare came into being. He developed the Green Acres Program, \nwhich was a visionary concept of protecting Rhode Island's natural \nwonders for future generations, which is a precursor to this antisprawl \ntalk we are now hearing from the White House. They only need to look \nback 20 or 30 years ago, and John Chafee had done the same thing that \nis being talked about with this urban sprawl problem we now have.\n  The leadership John Chafee showed as Governor of Rhode Island in the \nmid-1960s led the Republican chief executives to name him their \nchairman. In 1969, President Nixon called upon this man, John Chafee, \nto take on the challenge--and it was a challenge at the time--to be \nSecretary of the Navy during the height of the Vietnam war.\n  I have heard several conversations, they love to joke about it, when \nJohn Warner--who is a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--when he and John Chafee get together to talk about their \nservice, one as Secretary, one as Assistant Secretary, and the \ndifficulties they had during the time the Vietnam war was going \nforward. He did a great job as Secretary of the Navy.\n  He then spent several years in the private sector, but in 1976 he was \nelected in a Democratic State--Rhode Island is perhaps the most \nDemocratic State in the Union, but John Chafee did not let that stand \nin his way--he was elected Governor. I identify with Senator Chafee. He \nwas elected Governor by about 400 votes. I have been in a number of \nclose elections myself. Perhaps that is one reason I identified so much \nwith Senator Chafee.\n  He served as Governor as if he were elected by 400,000 votes, and he \nserved in the Senate in the same manner. He was a person in the Senate \nwho quickly established himself as an authority on the Nation's budget.\n  Of course, as we know, he was a member of the Finance Committee, \nwhere he worked hard on tax policy, and was chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, where he worked hard on environmental \nprotection. He was one who always stood for civil rights and human \nrights.\n  He was an independent person, and we all know how independent he has \nbeen in the Senate. We all need to take a page out of John Chafee's \nbook, especially with the rank partisanship that has been taking place \nin this body for the last several years. John Chafee was a person who \ndid not believe in partisanship. He continued to stake out modern, \nconsensus-driven positions that marked his entire career. I admired his \nability to go to people on this side of the aisle to develop \nlegislation.\n  There are those who argue Senator Chafee spent many of his years \nadvocating positions that were outside the\n\n[[Page S13070]]\n\nmainstream view of the Republican Party in the Senate, especially when \nhe talked about issues of gun control, health care, and the \nenvironment. That probably is not the case. I believe John Chafee \nrepresented the mainstream of America. He was tremendously important \nand good for the Republican Party, as he was for this country.\n  At the core of his being, John Chafee believed the American people \nsent us all here to get things done, to compromise. And ``compromise'' \nto John Chafee was not a bad word. He knew that legislating was the art \nof compromise and that we had to compromise for the best of the \ncountry, not simply bicker with one another.\n  As I have indicated already, I had the pleasure of serving with \nSenator Chafee for 13 years in the Senate. For the last 5 years, he has \nbeen chairman of that committee. I have been so impressed with his \nwillingness to wade into difficult problems. I had so many meetings in \nhis office in the Dirksen Building where he would say: OK, where are we \non this? OK, we will get together tomorrow to see where else we can go.\n\n  He was a tenacious legislator. He knew legislation was more than \nstanding on the Senate floor giving speeches. I have learned a great \ndeal from him.\n  I will never forget his work to improve our Nation's air and water \nquality, improve highways, transit, and all the infrastructure \nprograms. He was so involved in toxic waste. He was a man who believed \nin Government working for the betterment of each of us.\n  It was not at all unusual at critical junctures of negotiations on \nimportant bills to find him working late at night. He did this from the \ntime he arrived in the Senate, I am told, to the present, and I can \nvouch for that personally.\n  Environmental issues are some of the most difficult issues we have to \ntackle in Washington, often bringing out sharp divisions, sometimes \neven partisanship. Senator Chafee was always looking for ways to cut \nthrough the rhetoric and get things done.\n  While we have not been able to report out a lot of legislation--\nSuperfund, endangered species--it was not his fault. He was frustrated, \nbut he never lost his determination to push forward, and he always did \nit in good spirits.\n  Some of the giants of the Senate in the 20th century are people who \nhave served as chairmen of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nmen such as Robert Stafford of Vermont, Jennings Randolph of West \nVirginia, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, of course, of New York. John \nChafee clearly deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as all of \nthem. He truly was a great Senator. In fact, it is fair to say when we \nlist the great Senators of the 20th century, it would not be complete \nwithout the name of John Chafee.\n  I close by saying I liked John Chafee. He was my friend. He was one \nof the rare people from the other side of the aisle who, during my \nelection--this last election--asked me: How are you doing? We knew each \nother well enough--he could not help me financially or give speeches--\nthat he cared about my legislative welfare. He is a man I will never \nforget. He set an example for me. If I can be the same type of Senator \nJohn Chafee was, I will certainly be happy.\n  I extend my condolences to John's wife Virginia, their 5 children and \n12 grandchildren, the citizens of Rhode Island, and the hundreds of \npast and present members of John's staff who worked hard for him and \nloved him dearly. The Senate and the Nation have lost a great man--John \nChafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from Nevada in saying \na few words about Senator John Chafee. I believe our Nation lost a \npillar of the Senate last evening. I found John Chafee to be a deeply \nprincipled and highly intelligent Senator. Additionally, he was one of \nthe nicest men I have ever had occasion to know in the Senate or \nanywhere else.\n  I had the pleasure a couple of years ago of being a dinner guest at \nthe home of John and Virginia Chafee in McLean, a warm, hospitable \nhome, a home that had 8, 10 people gathered around the table informally \nfor dinner, where both John Chafee and Virginia Chafee presided with a \nwarmth and a hospitality that made it the nicest evening I have ever \nspent in my 7 years in Washington.\n  I really liked John Chafee, and I had the pleasure of working with \nhim on a number of issues. His record on the environment, on health \ncare, and on gun control is second to none. As chairman of the Senate's \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee was a leading \nvoice in crafting the Clean Air Act of 1990 which strengthened the \nNation's emissions standards. Recently, he led successful efforts to \nenact oil spill prevention and response legislation and a measure to \nstrengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  John Chafee has won virtually every major environmental award in this \ncountry due to his tireless efforts to protect our Nation's resources. \nRecently, we worked together on an effort to rid California's gasoline \nof MTBE, and just last Thursday, standing right over there in the \nSenate Chamber, I said: John, when are you going to be able to pass \nsome legislation out of the committee on MTBE? We remarked how moving \non this issue has been made more difficult by the ethanol lobby.\n  I said: You know, John, we really have to move because, in \nparticular, of the California situation.\n  He said: I know, I know, and I really want to do something to help.\n  That is the way he was--a very special person who could see beyond \nhis own State's parameters and really reach deep into the hearts of \nmany of us who represent States even on the other side of this great \nNation.\n  I will never forget earlier this year when we stood at the White \nHouse together to call for meaningful gun legislation. A few years ago, \nhe even angered many conservatives when he pushed for a ban on the \nmanufacture, sale, and possession of handguns. He was a man who \nbelieved in his principles, and he brought them with him to the Senate. \nRegardless of political party, he responded to those principles when \nthe time came for such a response.\n  The series of events I went through with Senator Chafee which showed \nme the most about him was an earlier effort in a group called the \nCentrist Coalition. This had to do with developing a balanced Federal \nbudget. It took place around, I guess, 4 years ago. We worked for a \ncouple of years. There were 11 members on the Republican side, 11 on \nthe Democratic side. Senator Chafee chaired the Republican portion; \nSenator Breaux chaired the Democratic portion.\n  In meeting after meeting, I saw John Chafee's span of knowledge \nacross a whole host of budget items. The Centrist Coalition did, in \nfact, prepare a budget. We did, and with no hearings, put it on the \nfloor of the Senate. And believe it or not, it got 46 votes. It came \nclose to passing. Many of the major points in that centrist budget \nactually became part of the leadership understanding with the White \nHouse that effectively produced a balanced budget in this Nation. A lot \nof that diligence and pursuit, over a 2-year period of time, really is \na hallmark of the way in which John Chafee worked.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, Senator Chafee worked to \nsuccessfully expand health care coverage for women and children and to \nimprove community services for people with disabilities.\n  In 1990, he spearheaded his conference's Health Care Task Force and \nbecame a prominent figure in the national health reform debate. He went \non to lead a bipartisan effort, as has been spoken of on the floor \nearlier, to craft a comprehensive health care reform proposal in 1994.\n  He was also an adamant supporter of a woman's right to choose. He \nopposed the gag rule, which prohibited doctors at federally funded \nclinics from discussing family planning and abortion services with \ntheir patients.\n  I think Senator Reid, and also the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, mentioned his service in the Marine Corps in World War II. \nFrom talking to John Chafee on the floor of the Senate, it was hard to \nsee him as a robust marine at Guadalcanal. But one of the things I have \nlearned in my life is sometimes people you least suspect are the first \nones to jump in the river to save a drowning person. I rather suspect \nthat was John Chafee, that just\n\n[[Page S13071]]\n\nas he was a Senator's Senator, he could be a hero's hero. So he left \nbehind him a very distinguished military reputation, in which I hope \nhis wife and family will always take great pride.\n  John Chafee, to me, was a giant in this body. His civility, his \nmanners, his intelligence, his ethics, his credibility were never in \nchallenge by any member of either of our two great parties. As such, I \nbelieve he leaves an indisputable legacy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1774 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been sitting this morning and \nlistening intently to all the comments that have been made about our \nvery close friend, John Chafee. I do not have a prepared statement, but \nI do have some thoughts I think I want to share.\n  It happens that this weekend, at the time that this happened, I was \non the U.S.S. Eisenhower, where they were doing F-18 and F-14 maneuvers \nand trying to figure out how to get trained for something that is \ncoming up in their deployment to both the Mediterranean and the Persian \nGulf. So we were talking with some of the military types about John \nChafee. And about John you hear all these things. I have been listening \nthis morning about how he was such a great guy. But people forget what \na hero he was during the Second World War, and then again in the Korean \nwar.\n  In fact, I got on his committee when I was first elected, coming from \nthe House to the Senate in 1994. There is a tradition that John, every \nFebruary, would have his new members, along with all the other members \nof his committee, for dinner. It was a very festive occasion.\n  I used to look forward to going to that dinner and not saying \nanything but sitting quietly and listening to the war stories told by \nJohn Warner and John Chafee. You could sit there and relive the whole \nSecond World War in a way you will never read about.\n  When you think of him and the image that he has today, and the image \nof him that we have been exposed to in the recent years, you do not \nthink of him as being the type of person who would be a war hero. But \nhe was. He was. And every time he told his war stories, it always came \nback to talking about the love he had for America, what America meant \nto him, the reason it has to stay strong.\n  I think it is interesting, because you hear a lot about his political \nphilosophy, and some of the things he stands for are not consistent \nwith standing for a strong national defense, yet he did. He was very \nunique in that respect.\n  I listened to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. She did \nsuch a great job of describing this very gentle person. The Senator \nsaid in her comments, I believe three times, that he was a giant, and \nthat she knew John was a giant, and she could look at him and see the \nthings he did that nobody else could do--that he was a giant.\n  One of the things that is interesting in listening to those who have \nbeen saying such eloquent things about John is they are talking about \nwhat his stand was on different issues. As a conservative, who \ndisagreed with most of the issues they talked about, I still had a love \nand reverence and respect for John Chafee that is every bit as much or \nmore than some of the others.\n  I think it is kind of an interesting thing; you look at a guy who \ndoes not vote the way you vote on things, and yet every time he would \nsay something about the various issues Senator Feinstein talked about, \nI would stop and think it over: This is John, so maybe I need to be \nlistening a little bit more. I think he had a greater impact on people \nwho disagreed with him than he did on people who agreed with him.\n  I appreciate Max Baucus and the things he said. He has served for \nsome time as the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, a very significant committee and one that is handling things \nthat affect us in our everyday lives. And when he talked about John's \nunquestionable integrity, I cannot build on that. That is true. That is \nJohn. Senator Reid also talked about what a giant he was.\n\n  I would only add, that of all the characteristics John had, the word \nthat comes to my mind is love. You had to love John Chafee. A lot of \npeople don't like me, certainly a lot of them don't love me, but I \nthink of John Chafee and say: Who couldn't love John Chafee? I feel so \nrich that I have had the honor of serving with him and being close to \nhim.\n  This morning when Kay, my wife, and I were talking about John, she \nrecalled her last conversation with Ginny was during our February \ndinner, the very eloquent dinner he has had every 2 years that he \nhosted at, I believe, the Metropolitan Club. Kay had been talking to \nGinny for a long time. Their subject, Kay told me this morning, was he \nhad already announced 3 days before that dinner that he was going to \nretire from the Senate after all these years. Ginny was talking about \nhow they were looking forward to their traveling and all the things \nthey were going to do.\n  Now Ginny is left with 5 beautiful children and 12 grandchildren. I \nremember how proud John was when he talked about his son, Lincoln, who \nis running for his seat. So John was a family man. He loved his kids \nand loved his grandkids. Maybe that is what we all had in common. But \nthis place will not be the same without John Chafee. John Chafee was \nthe lovable giant.\n  I yield back, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, several speakers were intending to be here \nto talk in morning business. With the untimely death of our friend John \nChafee, I think this time is going to be reserved for Members who wish \nto talk about the Senator and his life. I would like to do that for a \nmoment.\n  I have had the opportunity, for my time in the Congress, to serve \nwith John Chafee on the committee of which he has been chair. I had the \nopportunity to become acquainted with certainly one of the most \noutstanding Senators who has ever been in the Senate. I will not go \nback over all the things our friends have already said. But each of us, \nI suppose, has a little different memory, a little different feeling.\n  John Chafee certainly epitomized the meaning of public service, from \nleaving college and going into the Marine Corps in World War II, to \nserving again in Korea, to serving his State as a legislator, as \nGovernor, serving the country as Secretary of the Navy, and serving \nfour terms in the Senate, devoting his life to public service and doing \nit in such a way that he will always be remembered.\n  Senator Chafee was dedicated, of course, to this country. He \ncherished freedom and risked his life and sacrificed for the freedom \nyou and I enjoy. So it is hard to lose a friend of that kind.\n  John Chafee and I didn't always agree on the issues. He came from \nquite a different world than I--he was from Rhode Island, and I am from \nWyoming--in terms of many of the issues, but we were always able to \ntalk about them.\n\n  John Chafee came to Wyoming at my request to take a look at \nendangered species, and he drove out into the wilderness to look. He \nrode around a ranch. He and a friend of mine got in a pickup, and he \nlooked at a different world than he was accustomed to--because of his \nservice, because of his friendship. So, certainly, no one personifies \nmore that feeling. Nobody was more gentlemanly and more friendly than \nJohn Chafee.\n  In terms of service on this floor and in terms of cooperation, we \nworked through a number of things, such as highway bills, endangered \nspecies bills, and EPA things, which are contentious. But John Chafee \nwould always listen. John had wisdom to share and was willing to share \nit.\n  So I am sure we all feel the tremendous loss of this Senate leader, \none of the best in America. I am sure many of\n\n[[Page S13072]]\n\nus will come to the floor to share their views and feelings. Senator \nChafee represented the best of this country in many ways. His \nleadership, statesmanship, and abilities will be sorely missed, not \nonly in Rhode Island but nationally. We all send our very best and our \nprayers to his family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \nrecognize the passing of a colleague and a very dear friend, Senator \nJohn Chafee of Rhode Island, and to express my condolences to his \nlovely wife Virginia and their family.\n  I was just elected to the Senate in 1996 and found I had the \nopportunity to serve on two committees with Senator Chafee. He \ncontinued to serve as chairman of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, and I also served with him on the Intelligence Committee.\n  I will take a moment here to recognize my good friend's \naccomplishments in life and how much I appreciated serving with him in \nthe Senate. He was truly a remarkable individual. He graduated from \nYale and then got a law degree from Harvard in 1950. He served in the \nMarine Corps as well as being Secretary of the Navy. He was a patriot, \na hero, serving this country's interests in World War II and Korea.\n  My wife and I had an opportunity to join him and Virginia at a dinner \nwhen I was just elected to the Senate and had just joined his \ncommittee. I think it was Senator Inhofe who said he traditionally held \ndinners for new members of his committee. I got an opportunity to visit \nwith him about some of his experiences, and he was a delight to visit \nwith, as was his wife Virginia. We had a great time that evening.\n  Senator Chafee worked hard on Social Security issues. He was a leader \non health care. In fact, he worked in the subcommittees on both of \nthose issues in Finance, and then as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I found he was extremely fair and encouraging, \nsomebody who could work with Republicans and Democrats.\n  Even though I disagreed with him, as I found myself at times \ndisagreeing with him because I did represent a Western State with some \ndifferent views, particularly in regard to water, in committee he \nalways gave me a fair chance. He gave me an opportunity to express my \nviews and to represent the citizens of Colorado. I really did \nappreciate him for his fairness.\n\n  He did a lot to help me be effective in that committee. He made sure, \nwherever possible, if he could work with me on environmental issues \nthat were important to Colorado, he did that.\n  I had an opportunity, which I took, to move from that committee to \nArmed Services. Even though I did not continue to serve on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with him, he continued to be \nhelpful and whenever I had environmental concerns I brought them to his \ncommittee. I appreciated his commitment to being a team player and \nhelping everybody in the Senate.\n  John was a great person; he was a nice person; he was a helpful \nperson. I will continue to remember his dedication.\n  Just to show how he grew on you, I like to look at his achievements \nin elected office. He ran for Governor in 1962 and was elected by a \nmere 398 votes. Then in 1964 and 1966, 2 years and 4 years after he \noriginally ran for Governor, he won both times by the largest margins \nin that State's history. Not only did he grow on those who knew him \npersonally, but in his public service he grew on those whom he \nrepresented. In fact, when he was elected, he became the only \nRepublican to be elected to the Senate from Rhode Island in the past 68 \nyears, and he served 4 terms in that capacity.\n  He was, indeed, a public servant, somebody who worked hard on \nenvironmental issues. At times I found I could agree with him, and I \nrecognized his efforts on conservation and open space preservation. I \nalso recognized his dedication and work on the Intelligence Committee. \nThe Intelligence Committee is one of those committees where much of \nwhat we do is not shared with the public. I want the public to know \ntoday, Senator John Chafee was a valuable resource on that committee, \nconsidering his experience in World War II, his experience in Korea, \nand having been Secretary of Navy.\n  I will always remember Senator Chafee as a friend. I want his family \nto know my wife Joan and I will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today with a saddened heart at \nthe passage of probably my best friend in the Senate, and the House.\n  It is not often we get to be close to someone in this body. \nOftentimes, we have friendships, but they are not personal friendships. \nThis was a personal one to me--starting from the time I first knew him \nin the House. When I came to this body in 1989, I was appointed to his \ncommittee, as I took the place of Senator Stafford from Vermont. And \nthus, I got to know John immediately and found there was little, if \nanything, on which we ever disagreed.\n  His leadership on difficult decisions was without parallel to those I \nhave known in this body. He was one of our greatest heroes in this \nNation. I know others have exalted his wartime service at Guadalcanal \nas a marine.\n  Also, I remember having met him when he was Secretary of the Navy. I \nwas in the Navy at the time. So my memories go back a long time.\n  But my friendship was mainly based upon John's tremendous personality \nand his dedication to work and his ability to get things done. He was a \nman of courage on the battlefield and in the political arena. I do not \nknow anyone who did not like and respect John Chafee.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1989, I served on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee with John as my ranking member. He took me \nunder his wing and helped guide me in the big shoes I had to fill in \nthe wake of Bob Stafford, as I mentioned.\n  We had many trying problems at that time. We had the reauthorization \nof the Transportation Act. But the most memorable experiences I had \ndealt with the Clean Air Act, and not only in the committee but also \nhaving been appointed, along with him, by the then-majority leader, \nGeorge Mitchell of Maine, to be on the Clean Air Task Force.\n  As one can remember, that was one of the most contentious pieces of \nlegislation with which we have ever dealt. It took the holding of hands \nand nursing each other along to make sure we could get the votes \nnecessary to pass that very controversial act. That placed me in even \ngreater awe of John's capacity to lead and to be listened to.\n  I also recall in 1995 and 1996 meeting day in and day out in John's \noffice to develop a centrist health care package. We spent a year as \nJohn toiled trying to pull together a middle ground on a health care \npackage. John's work to do that was well recognized. Although it never \ncame to fruition at that time, it did give an alternative to the plan \nwhich had come from the White House and did give us all something to \nwork on to try to develop a health care package that would serve this \nNation. Although it did not work then, and did not work more recently, \nit was tried from the center, and it did give to us many thoughts and \napproaches which have been adopted in the health care package which did \npass this body.\n  John's work to preserve the environment, especially for New England, \nto me, again, showed he was a leader.\n  John and I ate lunch together every Wednesday for the last 10 years, \nalong with some others, especially from New England, and also Arlen \nSpecter. But we always discussed the matters of policy on which we \nwould have agreement.\n\n[[Page S13073]]\n\n Also, I spent several evenings with John at dinner, when he would say, \nhey, let's go down to the Metropolitan Club, or elsewhere, and have \ndinner together. Those were also memorable moments in my life, as we \nhad many things to discuss; but it was as much about ourselves and our \nfamilies as it was about the great problems of the Nation.\n\n  John Chafee represented the State of Rhode Island with distinction \nand represented what was best about this institution. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his wife, Ginny, and their 5 children and 12 \ngrandchildren, and also to his wonderful staff, who I have gotten to \nknow over the years, who have most capably served him.\n  John's memory also goes to the time he came and campaigned for me in \nmy State, and all the other times we had a chance to work together. \nMost, I remember that if I ever had a question on how to vote or I came \nin at the last minute and did not know what the issue was--I hate to \nadmit to that--I would first look to see how John voted. I knew, if \nnothing else, if I voted as he did, I probably would not get in \ntrouble. I suppose we all have moments similar to that that we don't \ntalk about politically, but when you have that kind of an individual \nwhom you can count on to give you the right direction, it is very \nimportant here, especially on some of the tough issues we have where \nthose of us who are called moderates have to cast votes at times where \nwe don't get friends on either side of the aisle.\n  I also want to speak out to John's staff. I know how sad and \ntremendously burdened they now feel at his passing. But if it was not \nfor his staff and their tremendous capacity, I know John could not have \naccomplished the things he did as a Senator. They will miss him deeply, \nbut so will I and so will the other Members who got to know him and his \nstaff well over the course of time.\n  I know all of us are sad today. I am getting to the point where I \nbetter quit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today for a few words about \nSenator John Chafee, our wonderful friend who left us early this \nmorning.\n  I happened to be privileged to know both he and his wife Virginia \nvery well. My heart goes out to her today. I have not been able to \ncontact her because it is pretty difficult. The phone lines are busy, \nand she is busy. But my wife Nancy and I extend our sympathies and hope \nwe will see her very soon.\n  As I think about John Chafee, I see this mild-mannered person; but \nthen I read about him, and there is a great paradox. If you look at \nwhat he did as a patriot, he was a great war hero. He served with the \nU.S. Marines in Iwo Jima, a very gruesome life experience. Clearly, he \nhad to do some things that aren't so consistent with what we see in a \nvery mild-mannered person.\n  Believe it or not, after law school at Harvard, he volunteered and \nwent a second time. He went to Korea. Then you would think such a \ntalented man would probably want to be in the front office with \ngenerals and admirals. But he was head of a rifle team on the ground. \nThat was John Chafee. Yet you could hear him regularly, when he made \ndecisions on foreign affairs issues, talk about our country in a way \nthat you absolutely were sure you knew where his heart, conscience, and \nmind were. It went way beyond that.\n  So if anybody were striving to match him, they would have to take a \nlook at the next one, which is his fantastic public service. We all \nknew him in his last public service career. But many people knew him in \nthe earlier stages, when he was a representative and head of the \nminority party in the House of Representatives in his State and \nGovernor twice.\n  I remember vividly when I was elected to the Senate 26 years ago, \nthere were four Senators on the Republican ticket across America who \nwere expected to win. I remember getting a visit in my State then from \nRichard Nixon, and he had gone to Rhode Island, which was where John \nChafee was running, who had been Secretary of the Navy and was supposed \nto be elected; Senator Bartlett of Oklahoma; Senator McClure of Idaho; \nand myself. He lost.\n  So he was 2 years younger than I am. It took 2 years for them to \nrealize it, but then they finally elected him. He was here ever since. \nI can quickly state the legacy I see after all these years, as can \nothers who have been here 10, 15, 20 years. He had such a variety of \nthings he did that I am not sure the two things for which I know him \nbest will be his true legacy; maybe both will be.\n  Senator Chafee followed in the footsteps of great environmental \nSenators such as Ed Muskie when he became chair, on our side, of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I do believe, even though most \nof the legislation for clean air, water, and the like had already been \naccomplished before he went on, at least the policies were in place, as \nthe occupant of the Chair readily knows in his distinguished career. He \nquickly became known as a real environmentalist who understood and was \npractical yet stern in his beliefs. When it came to clean air and clean \nwater, pollution in general, and certainly conservation of open space, \nthere was no peer during his years as chairman and even before that.\n  Everybody will get up and speak, I am sure, about his distinguished \nefforts on the health care side. He happened to be on the Finance \nCommittee. When you say the Committee on Finance in the Senate, many \npeople don't think of health care, but they have a lot of health care \njurisdiction, including Medicare, Medicaid, and all the tax laws as \nthey relate to health care. There was no stronger advocate for getting \nmore people covered in health care than John Chafee and no stronger \nadvocate for the health of our children and the need to make sure we \nwere taking every precaution in getting health care to our children and \npassing laws that would get it there. He was truly a staunch advocate \nfor healthy Americans and Americans having a better chance to be \nhealthy, to get cured when they are sick, and taken care of when they \nare sick.\n  I am sure there are other things he has done of which I am not aware. \nBut if we got a chance to look at his record, it would be mentioned. \nThere will be plenty of opportunity. I thought if I found the Senate \nopen, I would drop by and say thank you, Senator Chafee, and thank you \nto his family for all they did for our country and for the Senate; \nthanks to his wonderful wife for all the sacrifices she and their \nwonderful family have made.\n  I hope, again, we will get to see that family during the next 2 or 3 \ndays. I hope the Senate will honor him appropriately. I hope we take \ntime off and go to his funeral. I am not in charge, but I hope we do \nthat. I think we ought to do that, wherever it is. Whatever we are \ndoing, we ought to take time off. That is just what we ought to do for \na real Senator and a real friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13073-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13073-S13074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, today is a sad day for America; today is a \nsad day for the Senate, for Rhode Island, but especially for John \nChafee's family.\n  Senator Chafee was, indeed, a remarkable man and a good friend. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with his family--his wife Ginny and five \nchildren--as they pass through this most difficult time.\n  I believe it can be said without hesitation that few individuals have \nserved America with the distinction that John Chafee exhibited in his \nmany years of public service. From his active duty in the Marine \nCorps--where he saw action in both the Second World War and Korea--to \nhis early years as a member of the Rhode Island House of \nRepresentatives, to his years as Governor and his work as Secretary of \nthe Navy, to, of course, his 23 years of service in the Senate, John's \npatriotism was beyond philosophical; it was pragmatic and it was \nconcrete.\n  He had a keen sense of duty--a profound sense of responsibility. As a \nSenator, he knew his constituents, and he served them with such \ndevotion that he was elected in 1976 and returned to Washington four \ntimes, despite the fact that he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly \nDemocratic State. Much of his effectiveness was in his ability to find \nbipartisan cooperation, and to stand fast on issues that were important \nto the individuals and families he represented. Among these issues was \na deep concern for the environment and for quality and affordable \nhealth care.\n  He was a tireless advocate of the underprivileged and a strong \nproponent of American leadership and economic opportunity. I understand \nhow important these issues were to John--not only because we served for \nso many years as colleagues and friends on the Senate Finance \nCommittee--but because, like John, I represent a small coastal State in \nthe Northeast, much like you, Madam President. Many of the issues and \nconcerns we faced were the same. In fact, one of the truly great honors \nI have received as a Senator is to be given the Ansel Adams Award by \nthe Wilderness Society. It is the highest award that prestigious \norganization gives out, and there are only two Republican Senators who \nhave ever received it. And I must say that it was awarded to John \nfirst--2 or 3 years before me.\n  Madam President, along with you and all our colleagues, I am saddened \nby his death. But I am grateful for the time we spent together; I am \ngrateful for his leadership and example; and I am grateful for his \nsupportive family. Along with all my colleagues, I express my \ncondolences to them as well as my most profound gratitude for sharing \nSenator Chafee with America.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I, like countless Americans, am very \nsaddened over the news that John Chafee is no longer with us. The news \nof his death was a shock to me. I was with Senator Chafee just last \nweek. I teased Senator Chafee about the fact that he was using a \nwheelchair, and I was accusing him of doing wheelies and racing down \nthe aisles. He spent at least an hour with many of us in the Finance \nCommittee discussing a number of issues, including health care, which \nwas one of the issues in which he was most interested and of which he \nwas a real champion for all Americans. This is a loss for so many, \nbecause of his great service to this country.\n  John Chafee spent 23 years in the Senate. He was concluding his \nfourth term as a U.S. Senator. He had a very exceptional Senate career \nthat encompassed many areas. He was a leader in education, health care, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, of which he was chairman, \ndealing with issues such as clean air and clean water, and \nreauthorization of many very vital programs.\n  His service was not only limited to the Senate, however. In addition \nto his 23 years in the Senate, he served 6 years as Governor of Rhode \nIsland. He also had about 7 years as a marine. He fought in both World \nWar II and in the Korean war. He fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal.\n  I remember when I was on a trip speaking with leaders in Korea, and I \nwanted to learn more about the Korean war. They suggested I read a \nbook. I believe the name of the book was ``This Kind of War.'' It is a \nvery thick book. I read it with great interest, and I read about Capt. \nJohn Chafee, who was a hero during the Korean war. That was something \nhe never mentioned. If you wanted to find out he was a hero, you had to \ntalk to somebody else.\n  If you go all the way back to his service as a marine officer in \nWorld War II and the Korean war, his service in Rhode Island in the \nState legislature and as Governor, and his 23 years in the Senate, it \nhas been a record of exemplary service. I think it is a total of 44 \nyears of public service, not counting his 7 or 8 years as a marine. In \nover 50 years of public service, John Chafee has dedicated his life to \nserving his State and his Nation. What great service, what great \nsacrifice he has made for our country.\n  I also was pleased to get to know him fairly personally. John and his \nwife Ginny were married 49 years. What a wonderful, beautiful example. \nI knew him also as a wrestler. He was inducted into the National \nWrestling Hall of Fame, which is quite an honor. Not many people know \nthat he was captain of the Yale wrestling team and undefeated in his \nwrestling career prior to the war. That is pretty special; that is not \nan easy accomplishment. It shows that he had a certain amount of \ntoughness and will.\n  He was always willing to compromise and always willing to negotiate, \nbut he was tough, he was sincere, he was energetic, he was a tireless \ncampaigner and a tireless worker. He was a very dedicated individual.\n  John Chafee is going to be missed in the Senate. His State will \nsurely miss him to. They have so much for which to be grateful, to have \nhad him as their leader, one of the real valued leaders, both as \nGovernor and Senator, as a captain in the Marines, and as a fantastic \ncolleague, devoted husband for 49 years, father of John, Jr., Lincoln, \nZechariah, Quentin, and his daughter Georgia--five wonderful kids who, \nI know, are very proud of their father.\n  I know John was very proud of his children. I was with Senator Chafee \nand his son ``Linc'' last week at a campaign event. You could sense, \nwhen Senator Chafee was introducing his son, the love and the bond they \nhad between them. It was a wonderful thing to behold.\n  I have a special comment about Senator Chafee and his wife Ginny. I \nhave had the pleasure of knowing them for my 19 years in the Senate. I \nhave been in their home--a wonderful, beautiful, loving couple. I just \nwant Ginny to know that our thoughts are with her and with her \nchildren. We want them to know we share their loss and they are very \nmuch in our thoughts and our prayers. I want them to know what a great \nhonor it has been for me personally, and I think for all Senators, to \nhave the privilege and pleasure of serving with John Chafee in the \nSenate. He will be missed in Rhode Island, and he will be missed \nthroughout the country.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in this era of partisanship, harsh sound \nbites and bitter politics, John Chafee wanted to have none of that. He \nwas, in my view, the gold standard as far as public service is \nconcerned. He wasn't full of himself, always humble and low key, always \nbipartisan.\n  I especially admired that he was always standing up for people \nwithout power and without clout. I think of all the times over the \nyears I had a chance to serve with him--close to 20 years--\n\n[[Page S13075]]\n\nthat John Chafee stood up for children, stood up for the disabled, \nstood up for folks who are always falling between the cracks in the \nhealth care system, people who never had a voice.\n  Reflecting on his background--a family of means, Ivy League \neducation--one would not think a person with those roots would be there \nfor the kind of causes and the kind of people John Chafee was for again \nand again during these years in public service.\n  His contributions are going to be documented in many areas but \nespecially in the areas of health care and the environment. We all \nought to take some time and reflect on what John Chafee contributed to \nour country. His fingerprints are on every hallmark piece of \nenvironmental legislation, going through two decades, in terms of clean \nair and clean water.\n  John Chafee, in his low-key, dignified way, always made it clear we \nshould push to do better. In debates where various interest groups \nsaid, it isn't possible, Mr. Chairman, to get as far as you would like; \nwe can't do it without wrecking the economy, John Chafee would always \npoint out time and time again when we pushed ourselves we could make \nthese huge strides in terms of cleaning up the environment.\n\n  One of the measures of an individual and an individual's work on \nCapitol Hill is what his staff thinks of him. I don't know of any staff \non either the House or the Senate side who stayed with a Member of \nCongress longer than John Chafee. Those were the most loyal people in \nWashington. It was because they were working for an individual who they \nknew was in public service for only honorable reasons.\n  I hope in the days ahead we think about what John Chafee contributed, \nthink about his approach to solving problems, always trying to find the \ncommon ground, always trying to bring people together in a bipartisan \nway for the kind of government people have a right to expect in the \n21st century. That is the kind of government Americans believe will \nhelp solve the intractable challenges of the day.\n  I hope when the rhetoric next gets a bit shrill in this body--it \nhappens from time to time--we remember that great Senator who sat just \na few feet from the dividing line between Democrats and Republicans in \nthis Chamber, and that all Members remember John Chafee's contributions \nwhich were so extraordinary in areas including health and the \nenvironment but were especially significant because of the way he \nbrought Members together.\n  Personally, I was involved in half a dozen conferences where tempers \ngot short and late at night everybody was ready to throw in the towel \nand wrap it up for the day. John Chafee would have put in longer hours \nthan anybody and he would keep people at it, trying to almost breed \nthat kind of good will and bipartisanship that were his trademark.\n  This is a sad day for our country. It is a sad day for the Senate. I \nhope all Members remember that very special John Chafee style in the \ndays ahead. That will be the Senate at its very best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened to the comments by my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and he expresses, as do all \nMembers of the Senate, our profound sadness over the death of our \nfriend and our colleague, Senator John Chafee from Rhode Island.\n  Senator Chafee was one of a kind. The 100 Members of the Senate, men \nand women who come from across the country, work hard and fight hard \nand get involved in a lot of public debate about some very \ncontroversial issues. We all have very different styles and different \nways of approaching all of these issues, and John's was unique.\n  Senator Chafee was in the Senate for a long while. He had \nachievements that will last forever. He was quite a remarkable Senator. \nHe was, as the Senator from Oregon indicated, about as bipartisan a \nSenator as there was in this Chamber. He cared about results. He cared \ndeeply about a wide range of public policy, including children, the \nenvironment, and so many other areas.\n  I used to visit with John a lot about his grandchildren. John \nChafee's grandchildren played soccer with my children. The way to bring \na gleam to Senator Chafee's eye was to go over to the area of the \nChamber where he sat and talk about his granddaughter Tribbe and her \nsoccer exploits. He so dearly loved those grandchildren and was so \nproud of them.\n  Senator Chafee was a war hero. He was a graduate of Yale University \nand Harvard Law School. Most important, he served this country in a \nvery distinguished way. As proud as I have been to be able to serve in \nthe Senate, one of the extraordinary opportunities to serve here is to \nbe able to work with people such as the late Senator John Chafee. I add \nmy voice to those of so many other colleagues who come here today to \nsay the Senate has lost truly a great Senator. I know all of us grieve \nwith his family and loved ones and so many Americans across this \ncountry today.\n  Senator Chafee worked right through last week. Towards the end of \nlast week, I asked Senator Chafee how he was feeling because he \nobviously was experiencing some difficult health challenges. But as was \nalways the case, last week when I asked him how he was feeling he said, \n``Oh, fine,'' because he was not someone ever to complain. They say \nhard work spotlights the character of people. Some turn up their \nsleeves, some turn up their nose, and some don't turn up at all.\n  When people think of Senator John Chafee, they will always remember a \nunique Senator who always turned up his sleeves and said let's get to \nwork together. The result of that is a legacy of accomplishment in the \nSenate in so many areas: The children's health insurance grant program; \nthe CARE Independence Act; extending Medicare coverage to poor women, \nchildren, and disabled individuals; LIHEAP--so many areas. As the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was probably \nthe leading voice in this country in crafting the Clean Air Act of 1990 \nwhich strengthened the pollution emission standards; the Safe Drinking \nWater Act--so many different areas of accomplishment.\n  But most of us in the Senate who had the privilege of working with \nhim will not remember him so much for his accomplishments as we will \nhis capacity as a human being. He was a colleague and friend. We will \nmiss him dearly. I join with my colleagues today to say that. His \ndaughter Georgia and son-in-law John have been dear friends for many \nyears. I talked to his daughter today. She indicated, again, how proud \nshe was of her father and how strongly she feels about the expression \nof sentiment today from Members of the Senate about her father and her \nfather's work. We will all miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I come to \nthe floor today to speak about John Chafee. I first met Senator Chafee \nstanding in line to register for Harvard Law School in 1947. We had \nboth returned from World War II and completed college and were freshmen \nin law school that year.\n  When you met John Chafee in those days, you knew you were meeting a \nman. He was really an extraordinary man, very capable physically and \nmentally. I remember kidding him a little bit that he was going to have \na tough time in one of our first classes because his uncle was the \nprofessor. His uncle, Zechariah Chafee, was one of the great professors \nof Harvard Law School in those days.\n  But John Chafee finished law school, and then he went back to war. He \nwent to Korea. He really never gave up his commitment as a patriot to \nthis country because he then became the Secretary of the Navy under \nPresident Nixon. I think he served with great distinction here as one \nwho had knowledge of what it means to have been in a war and was trying \nto assure peace.\n  He served with great distinction, as others have mentioned here \ntoday, on various committees of the Senate. It was not my privilege \never to serve with John on one of the committees in the Senate; our \npaths were different. As a matter of fact, at times we disagreed. But I \nwas chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee the year he \ngot elected.\n  He had a very distinguished record as Governor of Rhode Island, and \nhe came to us with a unique approach, really, of\n\n[[Page S13076]]\n\na very straight thinking man. He was not bound by partisan politics. He \nhad a Republican philosophy, but he had a commitment to this country \nthat was very deep and one from which I never saw him waiver. I never \nsaw him waiver from something in which he believed. He really didn't \ncare if he was the only person voting the way he decided was the best \nto vote for his constituents and his country.\n  I sat here last week and talked to him. He was, as we all know, then \nin a wheelchair. I was very surprised to see John in a wheelchair, for \njust 2 weeks ago today we had gathered together here, after the Senate \nrecessed, a group of some 60 of our Harvard classmates, to be with John \nafter he had made his decision not to run for reelection next year. It \nwas sort of a preretirement party, you might say, with the people he \nhad known and still knew very well from throughout the country. It was \na great tribute to John, again as a man, because our colleagues came \nfrom the west coast, Florida, all over the country, to be with him and \nGinny at his first retirement party. Sadly, it was his last because by \nFriday, when I saw him on the subway, he was again in his wheelchair \nand was quite despondent about his health at the time. It was sad to \nsee him in that condition, knowing what a vigorous man he was and a \ngreat friend.\n  The Senate has been much better off for having John Chafee for so \nmany years because he brought us such an extremely broad scope of \nopinion from his own experience in life. He was a graduate of Yale, and \nthen he went to Harvard Law School. That didn't happen much in those \ndays, but he decided he would pursue education where his family had a \npresence. I think his work in the Senate has been extremely significant \nbecause of his background in law and his background as a marine. I know \nthose who served with him when he was Secretary of the Navy swore by \nhim as one of the best.\n  It is sad to see the passing of another one from my generation. When \nI came here, I think 70 percent of the Senate had served in World War \nII. I don't know if I am counting right, but I think we are down to \nabout 7 now--about 7 percent. We see in his passing, really, the \nbeginning of the end of an era, of the generation that fought the last \ngreat world war. One of these days, I am going to have to write that \nbook of the story that was written by our generation. I have not done \nthat. But if there was any person who ever served in this body who was \na great, shining example of that generation, it was John Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this is a sad day for the Senate. I \nknow a number of Senators have spoken in memory of Senator Chafee. I \nmust add I really feel a sincere sense of loss today, and I know the \nSenate feels that collectively because we truly have lost one of our \nfinest Members.\n  John Chafee was a person who was not afraid to say what he thought \nabout any issue that would come before the Senate. He had, to use the \ncliche, the courage of his convictions. He had the courage to stand up \nand say what he thought should be said on any issue, without regard for \nhow it would affect the way he would be viewed by Members of the Senate \nor by the general public, but simply he felt compelled to say what he \nthought because he thought it was right and should be said and that was \nwhy he was here: to express his views, to try to be an influence in the \nprocess, to try to shape policies and legislation in a way he thought \nwould be helpful and for the good of the country.\n  I admired him considerably and respected him enormously. He was a \nperson of unquestioned character and integrity in every sense you can \nsay those words. He was someone we could all look up to because of \nthose traits, and we will miss him very, very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, there is a great sadness hanging over \nthe Senate today. I come to the floor to share in our personal thoughts \nand recollections of a wonderful man. We have all lost a dear friend. \nJohn Chafee was an extraordinary man, someone respected and loved and \nadmired on both sides of the aisle. I think all of us are stunned and \ndeeply saddened by this loss.\n  John Chafee was one of the most reasonable and, increasingly, one of \nthe most respected and important voices in the Senate. The fact that \nhis voice has been silenced is a loss not only to the people of Rhode \nIsland but to the people of our country.\n  He was a public servant in the fullest and finest sense. He was a \nsoldier, a State representative, a Governor, a Secretary of the Navy, \nand a Senator.\n  There aren't many people who have served or who are serving who \ndedicated themselves more to public life and to public service and did \nso with such integrity, such conviction, as did John Chafee. Few will \nleave a more significant legacy.\n  It has been noted on the floor that John was an accomplished wrestler \nin high school. Whatever talents he had physically, intellectually John \ncontinued to wrestle with ideas throughout his life. Ideas mattered to \nJohn Chafee. He didn't care whether they were liberal or conservative \nideas, Republican or Democratic ideas. He didn't care whether they were \nhis ideas or someone else's. John Chafee loved ideas and wrestled with \nthem daily.\n  There was certainly nothing doctrinaire about him. He was a man of \ndeep political conviction and unusual political courage. It seems \nfitting that the last desk he occupied on the Senate floor was once \nused by another independent and equally principled voice: Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith.\n  His achievements in education, in the environment, on health care, on \nmaritime issues, and for the people of Rhode Island will live on long \nafter those of us who served with him are gone. As ranking member and \nas chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, no \none was more instrumental in passage of the major environmental \nlegislation of the latter part of this century than was John Chafee.\n  The clean air and water laws, the efforts he made on the construction \nof important public projects throughout America, were his ideas. They \nwere his accomplishments. But it seems to me that of all of the bridges \nJohn Chafee helped build, it wasn't a bridge across a river as much as \nit was the bridge that spanned political divisions that represents his \ngreatest achievement.\n  John Chafee knew how to build bridges. He built them here every day \nwhen he came to work. They spanned the divisions based on race and \ngender and ethnicity and income and generation and every other sort of \narbitrary decision we all too often tend to make.\n  The blue-blooded son of a Rhode Island family, he was a man of \nuncommon gift and privilege. Yet he had such a common touch. He \nbelieved in the concept of noblesse oblige. He believed that to those \nto whom much is given, much is expected. And he kept that faith, that \ndictum.\n  In an interview with the New York Times in June of 1995, John Chafee \nworried aloud about the possible effects of the cuts of Medicaid then \nbeing proposed. He said: There are not many lobbyists around here for \npoor children or poor women. Today, sadly, there is one less lobbyist \nin the Senate for poor women and children, one less leader, one less \nfriend, one less advocate, one less giant.\n  It is right that we offer praise and admiration for John Chafee \ntoday. He more than earned it. But it seems to me the best tribute we \ncan offer our friend is to try to fill the considerable void he leaves \nnow, to try, as he did, to build bridges instead of walls, to try a \nlittle harder to respect each other's opinions and see things from each \nother's perspective, to speak for the people and principles he \nchampioned so eloquently for more than 40 years as a public servant \nfrom the State of Rhode Island.\n  John Chafee deserves at least that much from us. He was an \nextraordinary man. He was an extraordinary inspiration. Each of us can \nbe proud to say we knew him and could call him our friend.\n  Our hearts and our prayers go out to Virginia and to all the Chafee \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S13077]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to follow behind the distinguished minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, in his remarks about a great loss for the Senate and for our \ncountry; that is, the loss of the senior Senator from Rhode Island, \nJohn Chafee. We have all lost a friend. We have lost a man of immense \ndignity, a man of immense courage.\n  I have had the privilege of serving in this body for almost 3 years. \nOne of the individuals with whom I became acquainted early was Senator \nChafee. As our friendship developed, he and I would talk about his \nservice in World War II in the South Pacific, where it happens that my \nfather served at the same time, same places, Guadalcanal, Philippines, \nSolomon Islands, Australia. My father served in the Army Air Force; \nJohn Chafee served as a marine. Chafee never penalized my father for \nless service, being in the Army Air Force. If my father were alive \ntoday, he would be very proud of the friendship I established with John \nChafee. In fact, my father died when I was 16 years old. My father was \njust a day younger than John Chafee.\n  We don't often have an opportunity to get to know our colleagues in \nintimate ways, in ways that show the younger Senators what has \ndeveloped this amazing Senator, a Senator's Senator, but as you spend \ntime with your colleagues, you appreciate how they were molded, how \nthey were shaped, and why they had, in the case of John Chafee, such an \nimmense capacity to serve--as has been noted this afternoon, the \nillustrious career of this magnificent individual.\n  Let me share for a moment a couple of personal stories. When Senator \nChafee and I were in Kyoto, Japan, in December of 1997, we were on the \nopposite sides of that issue. He used to say to me: Hagel, you're a \nbright boy. One of these days you will understand what I am trying to \nteach you about the environment.\n  So after 4 days at Kyoto, I said to Senator Chafee: Why don't I take \nyou to China. Senator Chafee had been to China a number of times, as I \nhad been. So we went to China for 5 days, and I took him deep inside \nChina where he had never been. We spent some time at fertilizer plants. \nOn one occasion we were out in the field with a farmer in China, and he \ntook a picture of me. Then he had a picture taken of both of us around \na two-wheeled garden tiller. He had that picture framed when we came \nback to the United States, and he inscribed it and sent it to my \noffice. It still hangs in my conference room. It says: To my friend, \nChuck Hagel, just another typical day out on the Nebraska prairie with \na Nebraska tractor. Signed, your friend, John Chafee.\n  I am very proud of that picture, which will hang, as long as I am in \nthe Senate, in my conference room. And whenever I leave this great \ninstitution, I will take that photo with me. I think he was always a \nlittle amazed that I was able to get us in to see the Premier of China \nduring that trip. He asked me that night, after we were having dinner, \nhow I did that. I said I used his name. He was quite astonished that \nhis name would have that much appeal to the Chinese but actually the \nChinese knew all about Senator Chafee.\n  It is rare that an individual leaves an institution so much better \nthan he found it, as John Chafee leaves the Senate; it is rare that an \nindividual leaves the world so much better than he found it, as did \nJohn Chafee. We shall miss him for his counsel, his wit, his \nfriendship, but we will probably miss him most because he always \nelevated the debate. He did it with eloquence, elegance, and dignity.\n\n  As an old army sergeant, I sign off to a Secretary of the Navy, and I \ndo so with great pride and great humility, knowing that we are all \nbetter off because John Chafee touched us. We salute you, Secretary \nChafee.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I found out this morning, as many \nother Senators, that Senator Chafee passed away. I see the beautiful \nflowers on his desk. I have been in the Senate now for 9 years, and \nwhile I did not know Senator Chafee as well as some Senators here, I \nadmired him. I think he was tough in debate. He had positions that he \ntook on issues, but he was substantive. In a way, I think he was a \nmodel of what we are about because he was interested in the debate on \nthe issues. He was always a civil, warm, good person.\n  Sheila and I were talking to support staff today and they were saying \nwhat a nice man Senator Chafee was. That is what they said, that he was \nsuch a nice man. I think Senator John Chafee was a kind, decent, caring \nhuman being. He was a great Senator with a highly developed sense of \npublic service for Rhode Island and for the country. I know we are \ngoing to miss him and the country is going to miss him. I want to \nextend my love, as a Senator from Minnesota, to Senator Chafee's family \nand to the people of Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to have to note the \nunexpected passing of our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee of \nRhode Island.\n  I doubt that anyone expected that this week would begin by learning \nthat Senator Chafee had been felled by a heart attack last evening. He \nwas a man of relatively young age, great vigor and vitality. He was in \nhis last year of a distinguished Senate career of almost twenty-five \nyears, and I know he was looking forward to returning to Rhode Island \nto enjoy life with family and friends in what is a beautiful, coastal \nstate.\n  Senator Chafee was a proud New Englander, and he exhibited many of \nthe fabled characteristics of those who live in the northeastern region \nof our nation. He was a thoughtful man, as was demonstrated by both his \nconsideration for others, as well as the careful examination he would \ngive to the issues put before him. John Chafee marched in lockstep with \nno one, he was guided by his principles and beliefs and by a firm \nconviction of what was right and wrong.\n  Though most of us knew John Chafee from his tenure in the United \nStates Senate, he was already a committed public servant long before he \nwas elected to this chamber in 1976. As a United States Marine, he \nrisked his life in two conflicts, World War II and Korea, and like so \nmany of his generation, John sought to make a difference through public \nservice. He held office as a member of the Rhode Island House of \nRepresentatives, as Governor of Rhode Island, and as Secretary of the \nNavy under President Richard M. Nixon. Unquestionably, the experience \nhe gained throughout his career was most beneficial to him as a United \nStates Senator, for he always demonstrated a mastery and depth of \nissues that was almost unparalleled. Furthermore, John was a gentleman, \nand no matter how heated the debate, one could always count on him to \nweigh-in with what was a considered opinion; and, more often than not, \nwas one that reflected that famous common sense approach for which New \nEnglanders are renown.\n  Through his work, Senator Chafee leaves an impressive legacy of \nlegislation, and his contributions to this body and the United States \nwill not soon be forgotten. For his wife Virginia, daughter Georgia, \nand sons John, Jr., Lincoln, Quentin, and Zechariah, he leaves an even \nmore important and valuable legacy, that of a loving and devoted \nhusband and father. We mourn for the loss the Chafees suffered, we \nmourn for the loss of our colleague, we mourn for the loss of a good \nfriend and a good man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, 30 years ago this fall, I met John \nChafee. President Nixon had just been elected and he had appointed \nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird. I aspired to be the Secretary of the \nNavy. Laird called me to his office and he said, ``I want you to meet a \nvery special person.'' Now, mind you, I had been closely associated \nwith then-Vice President Nixon and worked on his campaign. Senator \nChafee had been very closely associated to Governor Nelson Rockefeller. \nThere was a little bit of a difference between Vice President Nixon and \nNelson Rockefeller. I felt that I should be the Secretary of the Navy \nbecause Chafee\n\n[[Page S13078]]\n\nhadn't been quite the supporter that I had been for these many years. \nBut Laird said to me, ``I am going to introduce you to a man that you \nwill respect, work for, and end up loving.'' I will never forget that. \nAnd so late in November, the two of us were informed, and he became \nSecretary of the Navy and I became his Under Secretary.\n  We served under Melvin Laird for 3 years of the most difficult period \nof the war in Vietnam. Unlike myself, with very modest military service \nin the closing days of World War II and again in Korea, John Chafee had \nbeen a rifleman at Guadalcanal. Those of us who had been privileged to \nwear marine green in the generation of the World War II era we knew \nfull well that those who had served on the canal had seen the roughest \nof the fighting. It was referred to as the ``old breed.'' Those who \ncame in later years were never quite the same as the old breed.\n  In the many years that I had been with John Chafee, very closely \nassociated, I never was able to get out of him all the facts--to this \nday--about his service in Guadalcanal. One day just a few weeks ago, we \nwere walking down the hall. I can't remember exactly the occasion, but \nwe saw a Marine general who had medals from up on the shoulder all the \nway down to his waist. I said: John, that is different than the old \ndays, where occasionally a decoration was given in the Corps. It must \nbe different today. He said, ``Yes.''\n  I said to him: Did you ever get a decoration besides the Purple \nHeart? He said: No; didn't deserve it; didn't get it. Mind you, he \nserved on Okinawa, on Guadalcanal, survived, got malaria, went to \nAustralia, recovered, was picked to go to officer candidate school, and \nserved in officer candidate school. He became a platoon leader on \nOkinawa. He survived the kamikaze attacks going in, and the fighting in \nthat battle was as rough as any of them. The Japanese knew they had \ntheir backs against the wall. It was very tenacious, very rough and \ntenacious.\n  He told me a few facts about those years. But then just a few years \nafter World War II, surprisingly--4 or 5 years--suddenly we were in \nanother war. We were in Korea. John called up for active duty. I am \nsure he could have found a way not to have gone because he had served \nso much in World War II. But he went. When he reported for duty and \nwent to Korea, he became a company commander. In the Marine Corps and \nin the Army, and the other services, that unquestionably is the \ntoughest of all jobs, with 230-plus men depending on you, with a \nreinforced company, an infantry company, whatever it may be. But John \nwas there.\n  I remember not long ago the author of this book, ``The Coldest War,'' \ncame through and visited with John and me. I had been in Korea, but I \nhad been in an air wing as a communications officer. He used to joke \nwith me about how I slept in the tent with a little bit of a stove, \nwhich was true, and he slept in a bunker out in the open. He always \nused to tease me. But in this book, they captured John Chafee. The \nauthor discussed his bravery as a company commander and his love for \nhis men--any man who served under John Chafee--whether it was in the \nMarine Corps or, indeed, in this institution.\n  How privileged I was to sit just in front of my distinguished big \nbrother in this Senate. Any man who served with John Chafee inherited a \ngreat deal. I say that modestly. But we all profited so much from our \npersonal association with this marvelous man.\n  I called former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and talked to him \nby phone. He sent me a short memo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Statement of Melvin R. Laird on Senator John H. Chafee\n\n       Our close and lasting friendship goes back for more than 45 \n     years and will always be remembered. All of John's friends \n     will remember his quick smile, his lack of pretense, his \n     loyalty, his warm compassion, his good common sense judgment, \n     and his special quality as a person. John, in every way, \n     showed he cared about all of us, his Rhode Island \n     constituents, and our country in a most wonderful way.\n       But his real love was his family. Ginny, most of all, was a \n     very special love. John loved his children--Zechariah (Zach), \n     Quentin, Lincoln, John Jr., and Georgia, and was a special \n     grand dad to his many grandchildren. They will all miss him \n     very much.\n       There were many unusual associations we had over these past \n     45 years--going back to Republican National Conventions, his \n     service as Governor, his service as Secretary of the Navy, \n     and his years in the United States Senate. His last interview \n     in office occurred just last Friday with Dale Van Atta, who \n     is working on a book on the Laird-Packard Pentagon Team.\n       I remember the call I received from John back in 1965 when \n     he was the Governor of Rhode Island criticizing me for my \n     planned attendance at a fund-raiser for my Democratic \n     colleague in the Congress, John Fogarty. The Brick Layers \n     Union had built a special library and so-called ``outhouse'' \n     in John Fogarty's Rhode Island back yard. The dedication \n     ceremony turned into a fund-raiser for Democrat John Fogarty \n     and it upset John Chafee somewhat that I, as a Republican, \n     was the speaker at the Fogarty building dedication and fund-\n     raiser. I told John of the close working relationship John \n     Fogarty and I had as the ranking members on the House, \n     Education, Welfare and Labor Appropriations Committee. My \n     advice to John was that the best thing he could do as far as \n     his future political career in Rhode Island was concerned, \n     was to be at the dedicatory program. John showed up and he \n     never regretted his attendance.\n       I remember calling John in December 1968 and asking him to \n     be Secretary of the Navy on the Laird-Packard Team in the \n     Pentagon. There were many candidates suggested for this \n     position--President Nixon had a candidate, as did Senator \n     Dirksen (IL), Senator Hugh Scott (PA), Senator George Murphy \n     (CA), and many others. Under the arrangement I had with \n     President Nixon, it was my choice and I never regretted that \n     choice--John Chafee was terrific!\n       John was an outstanding Secretary of the Navy. I hated to \n     encourage him to leave the Pentagon and return to Rhode \n     Island to prepare for a Senate bid, but knew that was his \n     heart's desire. The responsibilities of Secretary of the Navy \n     were turned over to his very capable Under Secretary, John \n     Warner. We had a Change of Command ceremony at the Marine \n     Corps base here in Washington and although we had a great \n     replacement (our friend John Warner) there was much sadness \n     in seeing John Chafee return to Rhode Island. We were all so \n     very proud of his accomplishments for the Navy and our \n     country, but sorry to see him leave the Pentagon. His \n     election victories for the United States Senate followed.\n       His magnificent record in the United States Senate is known \n     by all of you. John's leadership ability to forge a consensus \n     on highly contentious issues of our times is unparalleled in \n     the United States Senate. He will truly be missed.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, Mel Laird was a great public servant, \nand he still is. He said about John Chafee:\n\n       Our close and lasting friendship goes back for more than 45 \n     years and will always be remembered. All of John's friends \n     will remember his quick smile, his lack of pretense, his \n     loyalty, his warm compassion, his good commonsense judgment, \n     and his special quality as a person.\n       John Chafee knew who he was. He never had to boast, he \n     never had to brag, he never stopped to take credit, because \n     this man knew who he was. He had tremendous inner self-\n     confidence and a tremendous ability to be self-effacing.\n\n  Laird goes on:\n\n       John, in every way, showed he cared about all of us, his \n     Rhode Island constituents, and our country in a most \n     wonderful way. But his real love was his family. Ginny--\n\n  I talked to Ginny this morning at the crack of dawn. We exchanged a \nfew words. Then we immediately recalled the happy days together \nthroughout these 30 years--and laughter, for both of us, for a few \nminutes on the phone. She had the courage, like John, to muster \nlaughter in a moment such as this.\n  He loved his children--Zechariah, ``Zach,'' Quentin, Lincoln, John \nJr., and Georgia, and was a special granddad to his many grandchildren. \nThey will miss him very much.\n  Yes, John was a hero in every sense of the word. But he was the \ngreatest hero to his family.\n  Laird goes on:\n\n       There were many unusual associations we had over these 45 \n     years--going back to Republican National Conventions, his \n     service as Governor, his service as Secretary of the Navy, \n     and his years in the U.S. Senate. His last interview in \n     office occurred just last Friday with Dale Van Atta, who is \n     working on a book on the Laird-Packard Pentagon Team.\n\n  That was the team John and I joined 30 years ago.\n  For 2 hours I worked with John last Friday setting up a hearing on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, where I was privileged to \nbe his deputy, second always in command. I will never be first. Even \nthough he is not here, I will still get his orders. But we were there \nworking last Friday.\n  Yes, he was a little less spry in his step as he was recovering from \nhis operation. But we have to remember\n\n[[Page S13079]]\n\nevery day in this great institution that, yes, we have our debates, we \nhave our differences, but the man or the woman to your left or right in \nthis magnificent institution could be gone the next day by the will of \nGod. I always think of that. We have to treasure and value every moment \nwe have with each other in this great institution because it brings us \ntogether.\n  This paragraph in Laird's letter I am amused by:\n\n       I remember calling John in December of 1968 and asking him \n     to be Secretary of the Navy on the Laird-Packwood Team in the \n     Pentagon. There were many candidates suggested for this \n     position--President Nixon had a candidate, as did Senator \n     Dirksen, Senator Hugh Scott, Senator George Murphy, and many \n     others. Under the arrangement I had with President Nixon, it \n     was my choice, and I never regretted that choice--John Chafee \n     was terrific.\n\n  There are so many. I think in the days to come I will seek the \nprivilege of speaking again of John Chafee solely for the purpose of \nintroducing into the Record some marvelous statements. I worked with \nhis personal staff today in collecting some of his statements and with \nthe staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are so \nmany lives this great American touched.\n  He loved his work in the Pentagon for those 3 years because it \nbrought into focus everything he had learned as a young marine on \nGuadalcanal, as the platoon commander on Okinawa, and as a company \ncommander in Korea.\n  I remember one day so well. Laird called us up. Laird was short, got \non that phone, and issued an order quickly. It was Saturday. Of course, \nwe worked Saturdays. The war was on. Absolutely, we wanted to be there. \nIt was our choice. It was a heavy burden and responsibility. We were \nlosing tens of thousands of casualties every week.\n\n  We just finished this engagement in Kosovo casualty-free. In Vietnam, \nthousands of men and women were killed and wounded week after week. It \nis so hard to believe now. It is so hard to explain war to the current \ngeneration.\n  But anyway, Laird called up, and he said: You two guys go down to The \nMall and give me a report on what is going on.\n  There was a demonstration down there. Chafee and I were dressed in \nour blue suits as worn by the Navy today. We stripped them down and put \non some old khakis. We had some tennis shoes. He and I used to play a \nlittle squash in the Pentagon. We put on a couple of old T-shirts. We \ngot into an old car. We had chauffeur-driven cars in those days. Forget \nthem. We got in an old car and drove down to The Mall. I will never \nforget that sight. There were over 1 million young men and women, in a \npeaceful way largely, demonstrating against that war in the heart of \nthe Nation's Capital on The Mall between this building and the \nWashington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. There they were--1 \nmillion.\n  I could see John was so terribly upset because it brought back the \ncarnage he had seen in his previous military experience when the whole \nnation, every American, was solidly behind every person in uniform \n(abroad or at home). The Nation stood in solid support.\n  We went back to the Pentagon that afternoon, and we sat in Laird's \noffice.\n  As I reminisced this morning, Laird had only been in office a \ncomparatively short time and there was a lot of thought about how we \nwere going to get America disengaged from that conflict, how we were \ngoing to stop the casualties. John Chafee from that moment on became a \nvery special counselor to the Secretary of Defense and, indeed, to the \nPresident on the need to bring that conflict somehow to a termination \nwith regard to these losses. Over 50,000 young men and women were \nkilled in uniform in that conflict in Vietnam.\n  Tough? Yes, he was a tough man. He was tough as they come. They used \nto say at Yale he was a wrestler; you will not get John Chafee's \nshoulders to the mat; you will not get them to the mat. No one ever got \nthem to the mat. I never did. I tried. I don't think in his \ndistinguished career anybody in this great body ever did.\n  The interesting thing about that man, so full of courage and so full \nof toughness, I never heard him use a word of profanity, never a curse \nword. When John would get upset and he was concerned about something, \nhe would say: ``Oh, dear.'' Remember that, colleagues? How many of you \nheard him say, ``Oh, dear''? That was his way of saying, hey, we have a \nproblem, but we are going to solve it. A remarkable man.\n  We will remember him for his modesty. I searched his web page: 40 \nyears of public service condensed to one page. A modest man, never \nboasted. He had the self-confidence. I was asked, Who will take his \nplace? Without thinking I simply said: No one. No one will take his \nplace.\n  God bless you, John, and your family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank our wonderful dear friend from \nVirginia for his very moving and eloquent personal comments about his \nwonderful friend, a friend of all Members, John Chafee, whom we lost \ntoday.\n  Let me begin by expressing my deep sympathies to the Chafee family, \nto Ginny and the children and the grandchildren. I have come to know \nthem over the years, being the neighboring Senator of the wonderful \nState of Rhode Island. I express to his family, the people of Rhode \nIsland, and to his staff and friends and acquaintances over the years, \nwhat a terrible loss the death of John Chafee is, to all who care about \npublic service and care about this country.\n  The words of ``scholar,'' ``soldier,'' ``athlete,'' and ``statesman'' \nI use quite frequently to describe people. But in the case of John \nChafee, each one of those words has special meaning. He was truly a \ngreat scholar as we know from his academic work at Yale and Harvard Law \nSchool. He was truly a wonderful soldier, as John Warner has recounted. \nIf one did not take the time to discover the service John Chafee gave \nto this country in both World War II and Korea, one would not know it \nif one solely depended upon John Chafee to describe it.\n  John Chafee saw service in uniform to his country as not an \nextraordinary action but one that any good citizen would engage in \nduring a time of serious conflict. Certainly his service in the Marine \nCorps and the Pacific, and again in Korea, were remarkable periods of \nour Nation's history. He served our Nation so wonderfully well in that \ncapacity.\n  He was also a great athlete. Captain of the Yale wrestling team in \n1941, he went undefeated. He was also quite a squash player. My \nbrother-in-law, Bernie Buonanno, is from Rhode Island. Bernie and John \nChafee were regular squash competitors in Providence. I heard great \ntales about the battles between my brother-in-law and John Chafee on \nthe squash courts. I know Carl Levin and John Warner and others play \nnot very far from this Chamber. They have wonderful times there. He was \nalways in great shape, always had a tremendous amount of energy he \nbrought to his work in the Senate.\n  Last, he was a statesman. That is hardly last. I first got to know \nJohn Chafee almost 40 years ago. I was a freshman in college in \nProvidence, RI, when John Chafee became Governor of the State of Rhode \nIsland. He was elected with an overwhelming margin of 398 votes in that \nyear. He went on in 1964 and 1966 to huge margins. At that time in \nRhode Island, Governors only had a 2-year term. During my entire career \nas a college student, John Chafee was the Governor of the small State \nof Rhode Island. What a wonderful reputation he had as a Governor of \nthat State.\n  During the latter part of that term, the Vietnam war issue, which \nJohn Warner talked about, began to boil over on campuses. John Chafee \nhandled that leadership role as a Governor of his State with great \nstyle and with great leadership in terms of understanding the diverse \nconstituency, even of a small State such as Rhode Island.\n  In 1976, as we know, he came to the Senate. I arrived in 1981 and had \nthe privilege of serving with him for the past 20 years. We didn't \nserve on committees together. I never had the privilege of being a \nmember of one of the committees of which John Chafee was a member. \nHowever, he certainly led in so many areas, particularly in \nenvironment. There were few who were John Chafee's peers when it came \nto their longstanding concern about being good custodians and guardians \nof this planet Earth. Certainly throughout his career\n\n[[Page S13080]]\n\non numerous pieces of legislation John Chafee was the leader, the \nvoice, that we all looked to when it came to deciding what path to \nfollow as we tried to determine the best course of action, balancing \nthe economic and environmental interests of our Nation.\n  The Presiding Officer knows this year, as someone who has been deeply \ninterested in child care legislation, I lobbied hard to the Presiding \nOfficer if she would be a cosponsor with me of my child care bill. I \nwill never forget Senator Collins saying to me: I will go along with \nyou on your bill on one condition. I am thinking, here it comes; what \nis the condition, some new provision has to be written in, some new \namendment added. And she said: The condition is, if you can get John \nChafee to support your child care amendment, then I will join in your \nchild care bill.\n  I talked to John Chafee. I said: John, if I can have your support, I \ncan think of at least one or two, maybe four or five other Members of \nthis body who will work with us on this issue. He gave his support to \nthat issue.\n  This calendar year we have had four votes on child care amendments, \nand each has carried because John Chafee decided to be a working \npartner on this issue.\n  That is another example of the kind of quiet leadership John Chafee \ncould give to an issue that was important to not only his constituents \nbut to many across the globe and across this country, particularly.\n  The Presiding Officer, coming from New England, will appreciate this \nas well. We oftentimes find in antiques stores or flea markets the New \nEngland samplers. They are oftentimes framed. Home Sweet Home is the \none with which most are familiar. There is another sampler we can find \nfrom time to time throughout New England. The sampler says: Leave the \nLand in Better Shape Than When You Found It. It is an old New England \ntradition. Our land was not particularly well suited to agricultural \ninterests when that expression was coined; the rocky soil, the \ndifficult winters make it hard to eke out a living. Each generation of \nNew Englanders over the years has tried to clear another field, build \nanother barn or shed, in some way make the land they pass on to the \nnext generation healthier and better suited to serve the next \ngeneration.\n  John Chafee was the quintessential New England statesman, in my view. \nHe was not tight when it came to a dollar, but I called him a fiscal \nconservative when it came to budgetary matters. He was also a person \nwho believed one ought to carefully invest capital in areas that would \nbe critically important to the well-being of any enterprise. And in \npublic life, investing in the environment of our country, investing in \nthe educational needs, the transportation needs, seeing to it that all \nAmericans have a chance to enjoy the wonderful opportunities of our \nNation, and the Tax Code, are all wonderful examples of John Chafee \nmaking wise investments, the wise New England approach to the well-\nbeing of our Nation.\n  So in many ways, John Chafee epitomized, I suppose--for me, anyway--\nwhat a good Senator from New England ought to be. In many ways, as I \nthink about that old sampler you can find in these bazaars in New \nEngland from Maine to Connecticut, ``Leave the Land in Better Shape \nThan when You Found it,'' John Chafee epitomized that simple \nexpression.\n  Wherever he is at this moment--and I know he is with our good Lord \nand Savior--he will be looking down knowing--and he should know--that \neven for that brief amount of time, the few short years, 77 years, he \nhad as a scholar, as a soldier, as an athlete, and as a statesman, John \nChafee truly left his State and his country and the world in which we \nlive far better than when he found it. For the immense difference he \nhas made, we thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I understand the junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is on the floor and would like to make remarks, too. I ask \nconsent he be allowed to succeed my remarks in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, this morning I was actually in Lexington, \nKY, with my son and daughter and grandson. I think in a way that made \nme even more melancholy and mournful about this day and the loss of our \ngood friend John Chafee.\n  I started thinking about John and his life. It made me realize that, \nday by day, in our regular duties, we go busily about our business and \nwe do not stop, sometimes, to look at the beautiful surroundings, this \nhistoric building we are in. We don't stop, sometimes, to thank the \nstaff member who has been particularly helpful to us. Also, sometimes \nwe don't stop to think that we walk with men and women in this \ninstitution who have been giants in their lives. John Chafee was one of \nthose men. Sometimes we just forgot John Chafee had done so much for \nhis country, for his fellow man, for his State, and for his Nation. It \nwas easy to do that because John was not the kind of guy who demanded \nattention and demanded he be treated with reverence or any \nextraordinary respect. He was a soft-spoken gentleman, and he was truly \na ``gentle'' man. The word fit him perfectly.\n  I was just talking to Senator Warner, his good friend, his successor \nas the Secretary of the Navy. I never had quite thought about one other \nthing: John Chafee was not one given to temper, not one given to \nprofanity. He was just a dedicated, hard-working, good Senator for his \nState and for our country. So I believe we truly have lost one of the \nbest servants we have had in the Senate in my time here, our friend \nJohn Chafee, the senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I first got to know John Chafee some 30 years ago; it is hard to \nbelieve, I say to Senator Warner, who was his deputy over there at the \nNavy Department. John was the Secretary of the Navy. I had the occasion \nto meet with him as a staff member because there was a little \ndisagreement between his State and my State about a Seabee base. But he \nwas always so fair in all his dealings; it impressed me then. I didn't \nrealize at the time that he had already been Governor and he had such a \ndistinguished military career. There he was, the Secretary of the Navy.\n  Then, of course, he went on to be elected to the Senate. Only after I \ncame to the Senate did I realize he truly was a war hero, a marine. He \nwas very proud of it. He defended his country, and he was a highly \ndecorated combat veteran. He served his people so well as Governor of \nthat State, and he also served the people of that State as a Senator \nsince 1976.\n  I have given a lot of thought about Senator Chafee today; also, the \nfact the last time I saw him and spoke to him personally, last \nThursday, he was not feeling particularly well. He wanted to know if \nthere were going to be any more votes. But he was staying right back \nhere, waiting to see if he was going to be needed anymore, attending to \nhis duties, even on Thursday night of last week.\n  I think it is belated but appropriate that we say a few kind words \nabout Senator Chafee and his service. We extend our best to his wife \nGinny and to his family.\n  By the age of 39, John Chafee was already a combat veteran in two \nwars. You will not find it in his official biography, but he earned at \nleast two Purple Hearts, among many other service distinctions. He had \nleft his undergraduate studies at Yale University to first enlist in \nthe Marines. He served in the original invasion forces of the Battle of \nGuadalcanal during World War II. Following that, he resumed his studies \nat Yale and went on to earn his law degree at Harvard.\n  John was recalled to active duty in 1951, and while in Korea he \ncommanded Dog Company, a 200-man rifle unit in the 1st Marine Division. \nPerhaps Senator Warner has already recounted all of that, but it is \nsuch an impressive part of the man he was.\n  After 6 years in the Rhode Island General Assembly, including 4 years \nas his party's leader in the House of Representatives, John was elected \nGovernor of Rhode Island in 1962 by 398 votes--not one to waste any \nvotes, or anything else for that matter. He was reelected in 1964 and \n1966 by the largest margins in Rhode Island's history.\n  The newly-inaugurated President Nixon appointed John Chafee to be \nSecretary of the Navy in 1969, a post he held for 3\\1/2\\ years. He was \nelected to his\n\n[[Page S13081]]\n\nfourth term in 1994 with 65 percent of the vote. He was the first \nRepublican elected to the Senate from Rhode Island in 68 years.\n  In the Senate, he rose to become chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee where, once again, he worked very aggressively \non issues about which he felt strongly. He was a Senator who really did \ncare about the environment. But he tried to make it an issue where we \nreached across the aisle to each other. He wasn't interested just in \nmaking a statement or trying to drive up his ratings with one group or \nanother. He wanted to get results.\n  I remember he came to me when I had first been elected majority \nleader in 1996. He said: I believe we can pass this safe drinking water \nbill. It had been stalled in the Senate and the House, and it was \nstalled in conference.\n  I said: John, it's too late. We can't do it.\n  He said: If we come to agreement, will we get it up for a vote?\n  I said: If you can get Dirk Kempthorne and the others involved and \nget Democrats involved, and we can get a bill that will be good for \nAmerica, to have safe drinking water, why, surely we will do it.\n  I think it was the last day of the session, but right at the end we \ngot it done because John Chafee would not give it up. He wasn't \ninterested in making a statement. He was interested in getting a good \nbill for his country--Safe Drinking Water--a worthy cause and one of \nwhich John Chafee was very proud.\n  Even recently, he was working on efforts that are certainly \nworthwhile and have been very difficult to bring to closure. The day \nwill come when we will get a new Superfund bill, and when we do, we \nought to dedicate it to the memory of John Chafee because he has \ncharged that mountain as a good marine, time and time again. We never \nhave quite made it. One of these days we will top the crest, and we \nwill all think about John Chafee when we do.\n  He was an important member of the Finance Committee. He chaired the \nSocial Security and Family Policy Subcommittee. Again, just last week I \narrived late at a Finance Committee meeting before we went out to mark \nup a bill providing assistance for hospitals, nursing homes, and home \nhealth care, a bill that would put back some Medicare money as a result \nof the balanced budget agreement. It was about to come apart. The \nwheels were coming off. Senators were disagreeing. It looked as if what \nwas going to be a bipartisan package, easily passed out, that had been \ncrafted by the chairman, Senator Roth, and the ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan of New York, was going to fall apart right there in that \nlittle anteroom before we went into the Finance Committee meeting.\n  One of the last people to speak was John Chafee. He said: Good work \nhas been done on this; it is not everything we would want--typical of \nJohn Chafee to say that--but it is a good step. We ought to do it. We \nought to go out here right now, take this bill up, and pass it out of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Thirty minutes later, by a voice vote, with only two dissenting \naudible nays, we passed that bill out.\n  He did his part on the Finance Committee, too. He served as a member \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he had a real interest \nin making sure about the intelligence capabilities of our country, to \nmake sure we did not drop our guard in that area, and we started \nrebuilding our intelligence community after years of problems, going \nback, I guess, to the 1970s.\n  He was chairman of the Senate Republican Conference for 6 years, the \nNo. 3 leadership position in the Senate.\n  In the Senate, we knew John as a genuinely independent New Englander, \nrespected on both sides of the aisle, who worked to bring opposing \nsides together for the common good. All of us regretted his decision \nannounced earlier this year to leave the Senate, but it was \ncharacteristic of John to work to the very end. He leaves behind 5 \nchildren, 12 grandchildren, and a legacy of a lifetime of service to \nRhode Island and to his Nation.\n  If the Biblical quote ever applied to any Senator, this quote should \napply to John Chafee: Well done, thy good and faithful servant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join the majority leader and my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to the senior Senator from Rhode Island, \nJohn H. Chafee. I do so not only on my own behalf but on behalf of the \npeople of Rhode Island, for they have suffered a grievous loss.\n  First, I extend my condolences to Mrs. Chafee and the Chafee family. \nAbove all else, John Chafee was a devoted husband, a devoted father, \nand a loving and caring father and grandfather. Indeed, his family is a \nliving tribute to his remarkable life.\n  This is a personal loss to his family, to his friends, to his \ncolleagues, but it is also a personal loss to the people of Rhode \nIsland. For over 40 years, he has played a central role in the life of \nour State, and Rhode Island is a special place for many, many reasons, \nbut it is a special place in particular because it is a place where \neveryone knows everyone else, and literally every Rhode Islander knew \nSenator John H. Chafee.\n  If you had to ask Rhode Islanders what they felt and thought about \nthis man, one word would come quickly to their lips: respect. This \nrespect transcended party politics, social position, every category \nthat we ascribe, sometimes arbitrarily, to people.\n  This respect was a function of a recognition, first, of his qualities \nas a man. He was a man of integrity, intelligence, tenacity, and \nfairness. He was a gentleman. When I arrived in the Senate--and \npreviously as a Member of the other body--he treated me with \ngraciousness and cooperation and help, and I thank him for that from \nthe bottom of my heart.\n  The respect which Rhode Island holds for this great man is also a \nfunction of his selfless service to the Nation. He began that service \nas a young marine on Guadalcanal. He spent his 20th birthday there. \nJohn Chafee, the son of privilege, could have found an easier way to \nserve his country during World War II, but he chose the very hardest \nway, so typical of the man. He chose to go ashore with the invasion \nforce of Guadalcanal at a time when it was not clear we would prevail. \nIt was only clear we would give everything to win, and John Chafee was \nprepared to do that for his country, for his community, indeed, for \ndecency throughout the world.\n  Later, after serving in World War II and going back to law school, he \nwas ready to assume the privileges and the rights which such service \nwon him. But another war beckoned, and characteristically, John Chafee \nheard the summons of that trumpet and went to Korea to lead a marine \nrifle company. Again, he could have found less dangerous assignments \nbut, once again, if American sons were at risk, John Chafee would lead \nthem.\n  After his service in the Marine Corps, he did return home, finished \nhis law school studies, and came back home to Rhode Island. He served \nas a member of our general assembly with distinction, and in 1962, he \nwas elected Governor of our State, clearly the most Democratic State in \nthe country, but through arduous campaigning and through his personal \nqualities, he was elected by over 300 votes. Not a landslide, but \nenough to give him a chance to serve the people of Rhode Island, and \nserve he did.\n  Long before it was popular and chic to be an environmentalist, John \nChafee was an environmentalist. With innovative visionary legislation, \nhe began our State's acquisition of open spaces so our quality of life \nwould not be diminished by economic development. In fact, long before \nmany others, he recognized that a good economy and a good environment \nnot only can go hand in hand but must go hand in hand. This was the \nearly sixties, long before Earth Day, long before the organized \nenvironmental movement, but he knew in his heart that quality of life \nwas important to maintain. He knew also that our environmental legacy \nis a gift from God which we must revere, we must cherish, and we must \npass on. And he did so.\n  He was also a builder because it was this time in our history that \nroute 95 was being developed right through the heart of Rhode Island, \nand he was there. In fact, he joked that it was a great opportunity for \na Governor because every time they completed 2 or 3 miles of \ninterstate, he could hold a\n\n[[Page S13082]]\n\npress conference and talk about the progress. But it was something that \nwas close to him, not because of notoriety, but because he saw this as \na way to improve the economy of Rhode Island, to link us more closely \nto the national economy. Indeed, even up to his last days, he was \nworking to improve the infrastructure, particularly the transportation \ninfrastructure of Rhode Island, a mission he began as our Governor more \nthan 30 years ago.\n  As my colleague, the senior Senator from Virginia, pointed out, he \nserved with great distinction as Secretary of the Navy. After his \nfamily, his State of Rhode Island and the Marine Corps were his great \nloves. These two passions--his State and the naval service--helped mold \nhis life and, indeed, he in turn helped mold these great institutions--\nour State and the naval service.\n  He served with distinction at a time when the Navy was being \nstretched, the tumult of Vietnam was spilling out into our streets, and \nstill we had to fight a superpower adversary in the form of the Soviet \nUnion. He served with characteristic vision, innovation, and \ndistinction.\n  He was then elected to the Senate, and for four terms he has shown us \nall what it is to be a Senator. In fact, it is characteristic that \nSenator John H. Chafee literally died on active duty serving his Nation \nand serving his State as a Senator. He spent his whole life in service \nto the Nation.\n  The respect for Senator Chafee also emanated from the recognition \nthat he always had an unswerving commitment to principles. He was \nschooled in the hardest test: Always do the harder right rather than \neasier wrong.\n  There are extraordinary numbers of examples to attest to this \ndedication of principle. I can think of several, but let me just \nsuggest that, again, before so many people took up the cause of gun \ncontrol, Senator Chafee stood solidly to control the violence in the \nlife of America, to reasonably restrict access to weapons, to ensure \nthat the lives of our children are protected.\n\n  I can recall being with him at a rally he organized in Providence, \nRI, where he had Sarah Brady come in. We were literally enveloped by a \nlarge group of counterdemonstrators with bullhorns, pressing in on us, \ntrying to literally disrupt this rally to control guns in our society.\n  But anyone who waded ashore at Guadalcanal and fought in Korea was \nnot easily intimidated. And he was not. He not only stood his ground \nthat day, but he stood his ground every day to try to argue for more \nsensible rules with respect to handguns. And that is just one example \nof where he did, in some respect, the unpopular thing because it was \nthe right thing to do.\n  This respect also emanates from the recognition by my fellow Rhode \nIslanders that, more than so many others, he always sought to find the \ncommon ground that would bring different groups together, that would \nresult in progress, both in terms of legislation but more importantly \nprogress in terms of the lives of the American people.\n  He was a pragmatist. He was committed to advancing the well-being of \nhis constituents and the people of this country, and, indeed, the \npeople of the world. He was always looking for practical ways to do \nthat. He was wedded to the strong principles of the Constitution. But \nhe was able to find ways, through the details, to advance those \nprinciples, to bring others aboard, to move forward.\n  When he became impatient, it was an impatience borne of the \ndistractions that we sometimes find ourselves in in this institution \nand the posturing that we sometimes find ourselves in in this \ninstitution--because he was here to do the job of the people of Rhode \nIsland: To improve their lives, to give them more opportunities, to \ngive them more freedom, so they can use it not only for their \nadvancement and the advancement of their children but the advancement \nof this great country.\n  He had a special concern for children and those Americans with \ndisabilities. It was a concern that he did not trumpet about, but it \nwas a concern that resonated throughout his entire legislative career.\n  Today, we have done much to ensure that the poorest children of \nAmerica have health care through our Medicaid Program. And that was the \nhandiwork of John Chafee--not through press releases but through the \nhard work of legislation, the detailed intricacies of the Internal \nRevenue Code, and the Social Security laws. He expanded coverage \nbecause, while others would be disheartened by failure of comprehensive \nreform, he dug in and every day advanced the cause of health care, \nparticularly for children in this country.\n  He always had a special place in his heart and in his service for \ndisabled Americans. I know that because the disabled citizens in Rhode \nIsland revere and treasure this great man for what he has done--again, \nlong before public acclaim or public notoriety. And why did he do it? \nBecause it was the right thing to do.\n  In March of this year, Senator Chafee announced he was leaving the \nSenate and going home. Last evening, he began that final journey home--\nhome to Rhode Island, a State made infinitely better by his effort and \nexample, a place that mourns but will forever revere his service and \ntake pride in his achievements and inspiration from his life.\n  In the words of the Poet William Butler Yeats:\n\n     The man is gone who guided ye, unweary,\n     through the long bitter way.\n     Ye by the waves that close in our sad nation,\n     Be full of sudden fears,\n     The man is gone who from his lonely station\n     Has moulded the hard years. . . .\n     Mourn--and then onward, there is no returning\n     He guides ye from the tomb;\n     His memory now is a tall pillar, burning\n     Before us in the gloom!\n\n  Senator Chafee will allow us to mourn, but insist that we move \nforward to do the unfinished work, which is the hope and promise of \nAmerica. And with him as a guide we shall. And he would want it that \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 206, and I ask that \nthe resolution be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 206) relative to the death of the \n     Honorable John H. Chafee, of Rhode Island:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 206) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to express our \nprofound sorrow at the loss of a dear friend and an outstanding \nSenator. John Chafee was probably the finest gentleman ever to serve in \nthis body. We offer our sincerest regrets, our sympathies, and our \nprayers to his family.\n  I stopped by his office today and expressed my sense of loss to his \nstaff. We express, collectively, our deep sorrow to the people of Rhode \nIsland, but, beyond that to the people of the entire Nation who in many \ndifferent ways, in many different areas, were served so well by John \nChafee throughout his career.\n  We have just heard very eloquent remarks from the majority leader and \nhis colleague from Rhode Island, summarizing some of the many things \nthat\n\n[[Page S13083]]\n\nJohn Chafee has done. It would take several volumes of the \nCongressional Record to go through his list of achievements and the \nthings that he has done for the least among us to further the causes in \nwhich he felt so strongly.\n  But I rise today to express gratitude and to celebrate the legacy \nthat he left us. If you had to ask somebody: Who is the most decent \nperson that you know of in politics? chances are, John Chafee would be \nat the top of that list. He was a man, as has been said, who had very \nstrong feelings.\n  He fought hard for principles, but he fought so with unfailing \ncourtesy, with compassion and kindness and consideration for others who \nhad differing views.\n  I had the privilege of working with him on a health care task force \nin 1993 and 1994. I sat in a room and listened to him bring together \npeople of very strongly opposing views. Always, without fail, he guided \nthe discussions away from bitterness, away from harshness, into \nconstructive channels.\n  I was pleased to work with him on environmental and public works \nissues. And he was a great leader of a committee that has very \ncontentious issues. He worked together with his leadership. We made \nprogress, sometimes in areas where people thought progress could not be \nmade.\n  I followed his work on so many issues affecting health care and \nchildren from his position in the Finance Committee. He was there to \nmove not just this body but the country forward in assuring that we \nwould meet the needs of children. Whether it was Medicaid for poor \nchildren or the foster care bill that he was recently championing, he \nwas always looking out for those in need; but he did so in a manner \nthat is a good lesson for all of us.\n  When somebody got carried away and attacked him, perhaps a little too \nstrongly, he turned it away with a warm smile and understanding. When \nviews got very heated and the arguments got passionate, he would calm \nit down with a kind word and steer the discussion and the debate back \nin a constructive pattern.\n  When some of us had personal reverses, John Chafee was there quietly, \nas a friend, to lend support, to lend encouragement, and to let us know \nthat we had a friend, somebody who cared for us. If there is one thing \nI hope this body will remember, it is that record, that unfailing, \nconsistent pattern of being, first and foremost, a concerned human \nbeing who was a dear friend.\n\n  I hope that legacy can guide this body, that all of us can strive to \nemulate his service, his compassion, and his caring. As our thoughts \nand prayers go out to his family, his loved ones, and to all who will \nmiss him, I hope we will remember and hold high those principles which \nhe not only espoused but he lived.\n  I am from Missouri. One of our slogans is: Show me. John Chafee's \nlife showed us every day, every hour in this body what a fine human \nbeing can do to move the process of government forward on a \nconstructive path. I only hope we can hold dear and remember those \nlessons he taught us.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLLINS. Mr. President, with John Chafee's passing, the Senate \nhas lost a great leader, Rhode Island has lost a great Senator, and I \nhave lost a great friend.\n  This afternoon I had the honor of presiding over the Senate and was \nable to hear firsthand the tremendous outpouring of affection and \nrespect and sadness from my colleagues, as they came to the Senate \nfloor one by one to pay tribute to this remarkable man. Indeed, Senator \nChafee's legacy exceeds that for which any of us could have wished. He \nhas been a leader in his commitment to children, to improving health \ncare, to preserving our environment.\n  I wish to talk for just a few moments about what John Chafee meant to \nme personally. From my very first day in the Senate, John Chafee took \nme under his wing. He was always there for me. He encouraged me. He \ntaught me the ropes. He guided me, particularly on contentious issues. \nHe was always a steady voice of reason. He taught me how important it \nwas to reach across the aisle to attempt to achieve a consensus, \ncompromises based on common sense. Indeed, he very quickly enrolled me \nin one of his favorite projects, and that was the Centrist Coalition, \nwhich he chaired, along with our colleague from Louisiana, Senator John \nBreaux. Together this group of about 20 Senators would meet \nperiodically to hash out contentious issues, to try to achieve a \ncompromise on budget and other important issues of the day. Always we \nwere guided by John. John had a tremendous ability to pull people \ntogether, to bring out the best in everyone.\n  I also have so many other warm, personal memories of my time with \nJohn and his family.\n  Many of my colleagues may be unaware that John had tremendous ties to \nmy home State of Maine. His family for generations had a home there in \nSorrento. His father had lived in Portland, ME, and had owned a \nbusiness in Saco, ME, in the southern part of the State.\n  I visited John's home in Sorrento, and he very proudly took me all \nover the community, telling me of his favorite spots, taking me for a \nride in his motorboat. He loved Maine, almost as much as he loved his \nbeloved home State of Rhode Island. He was a New Englander through and \nthrough. He brought a sense of integrity and principles to the debates \nof the day, and he had a sense of pride in his native region of New \nEngland. In many ways, he was a Senator for all of New England. I know \nwe always used to joke that he was the third Senator from the State of \nMaine.\n  As I got to know John, his wife Ginny and their children, I became \nmore and more impressed with the tremendous accomplishments of this \nremarkable individual. But these accomplishments you never heard about \nfrom John Chafee himself; he was far too modest to ever blow his own \nhorn. Little by little, I learned from his family and his friends of \nhis heroic wartime service, for example, as well as his tremendous \nlegacy as a superb Governor, his service as Secretary of the Navy, and, \nof course, his service in the Senate.\n  I remember once talking to his daughter, Georgia. I said: Your father \nhas this tremendous background and people don't know about it because \nhe never toots his own horn. He doesn't tell people of his \naccomplishments. He is too modest to do so. I remember Georgia saying \nback to me, yes, truly her father's lifetime could fill up at least one \nbook, but that he would never be the one to write it.\n  I hope, by our tributes to him today and in the days to come, we will \nhelp to write that book so all of America may know what a great man, \nwhat a great Senator, what a great friend John Chafee was.\n  I am honored to have known him. The entire world has been enriched by \nhis service.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I first met Senator Chafee in December \nof 1984. We had a small incoming Republican freshman class that year. \nIt was the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and myself. Senator Gramm \nwas already a national figure. He had burst onto the stage in his home \nState of Texas and had served in the House of Representatives for \nawhile.\n  I had been in local government. Frankly, I didn't know many people, \nand it was sort of a lonely first year in many ways.\n  I met John Chafee in the Old Senate Chamber. That is where we had \nrather spirited elections for leadership in December 1984. The one most \npeople noticed was Bob Dole being elected Republican leader to replace \nHoward Baker. But also on that day, Senator Chafee was elected chairman \nof the Republican conference, as I recall, by one vote. I think John \ngetting elected chairman of the Republican conference by one vote kind \nof summed up the odds he was frequently up against, not only in our \nconference, where he was one of the most moderate Members and \nfrequently at variance with the majority of the conference, but he was \na survivor because people recognized his personal qualities.\n  I don't know a great deal about Rhode Island, but I am told only 8 \npercent of the people of Rhode Island consider themselves Republicans. \nSomeone earlier today described it as the most\n\n[[Page S13084]]\n\nDemocratic State in America. I suspect that is true. And yet we had \nhere a man with such enormous personal qualities that he was elected \nGovernor multiple times and served in the Senate from 1976 until his \ndeath. Clearly, there was something special about John Chafee that \npeople came to recognize and understand.\n  Most of the causes John pursued were, shall I say, not particularly \ngood for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He always thought it would be a \ngood idea to raise cigarette taxes. Well, as you can imagine, the State \nhas an enormous number of tobacco growers. That was rarely something I \nwas enthusiastic about. Also, at least part of our State of Kentucky is \nin the Tennessee Valley Authority. John always thought the TVA was \nsomething that ought to be terminated, and I must say over a period of \nyears, having watched TVA operate, I am more and more open to John's \nviews on the matter, although I haven't gone quite that far.\n  Other speakers have said it, but I think the hallmark of John Chafee \nwas the fact you knew no matter what he said and did, it was based upon \na great sense of objectiveness. He operated with enormous personal \nintegrity and clearly was one of the most popular Members of the \nSenate. He always had an open mind. He was willing to revisit an issue.\n  For example, just last week, in a rather contentious debate that we \nfrequently have around here on campaign finance reform, John, whose \nviews were fundamentally different from mine on the subject, actually \nended up agreeing with me on one of the proposals we had before us. It \nwas a tribute to his willingness to revisit an issue, or at least part \nof an issue, where he had a longstanding commitment. But he took a look \nat a particular version that we had before us and reached a different \nconclusion.\n\n  At the beginning of this Congress--we have our desks here on the \nfloor on a seniority basis--I had finally been around here long enough \nwhere I moved over in the area where a lot of senior Members are. John \nwas right here, two desks over. I think it was really during the \nimpeachment hearing, when we were all here so much of the time and I \nfelt I got to know John even better. We were frequently talking, both \nin the cloakroom and out here on the floor, during that very difficult \ntime.\n  It is hard for me to imagine a finer human being than John Chafee, \nwho was an effective Senator, an outstanding Senator, and really a fine \nhuman being. So we celebrate his remarkable life, which others have \nspoken about--from his courage under fire in World War II and again in \nKorea, to his exemplary service to the Nation in the U.S. Senate. So I \nsay to you, Ginny, and to all the family, we share your grief. We will \nmiss John more than words can express. Not only have you lost a \nhusband, but the Senate has lost a great Member, and America has lost \none of its finest statesmen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is a sad afternoon for all of us. \nSenator Chafee and I had been seatmates for nearly a decade. I can \ntestify that never once during those years did he comport himself in \nthe slightest manner to diminish his image--which was widely held--as a \nperfect gentlemen and a dedicated American. His whole life was such.\n  He was a man whose dedication to his wife and family was demonstrable \nin everything he did and said. Often were the times that we exchanged \ntidbits of news about his family and mine; we talked a lot about those \nwhom we love.\n  I was one of the many Senators who, with some frequency, did not \nagree with some of John's votes. And you know, it is a funny thing, Mr. \nPresident, he disagreed with me the same number of times but always \npleasantly. I never doubted that he was genuine, honest, and sincere in \nall that he did and said as a Senator and as a human being.\n  I never once heard him speak a harsh word about anyone, and I never \nwas aware of his losing his temper. He may have, but I never saw it.\n  Mr. President, John Chafee was a thoroughly decent and unfailing \ngentlemen who was respectful of the opinions and judgments of others \nbut unyielding in his own opinions. That is the way it is supposed to \nbe around here.\n  Did I like John Chafee? You bet. Did I respect his quiet \nindependence? Of course. Like the good U.S. Marine that he was in World \nWar II, he was demonstrably willing to give his life for his country \nand to serve his country in other capacities, such as Secretary of the \nNavy.\n  I shall miss his sitting next to me; I shall always remember our \nagreement to nudge each other when the rhetoric in this Chamber caused \nheads to begin to nod, which frequently happens when some long-winded \nspeaker takes up a lot of time, which I am not going to do at this \ntime.\n  John Chafee was a friend whom I shall forever miss, and Dot Helms and \nI extend our deepest sympathy to John's dear wife, Virginia, whom I \nadmire greatly, to his five children, and all of his splendid family \nwhich he loved so dearly.\n  One final personal note. I know how the staffs feel; he had two of \nthem--his personal staff and the committee staff. I know exactly how \nthey feel this afternoon. I extend my sympathy to them as well because \nI have been there and I have done that. I served as an administrative \nassistant to a distinguished U.S. Senator in the early '50s, and he \ndied unexpectedly; he had a heart attack. I remember the helplessness \nthat all of us felt. Coming here to make these remarks, I rode over on \nthe underground trolley that connects the Dirksen building with the \nCapitol. In the car with me was one of Senator Chafee's staff members. \nHe was sad, and I told him that I knew exactly how he felt. It is not a \ngood day. But it is so good that all of us, the staff members, his \nfriends and family, were able to know and be with John Chafee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Thoughts from \nSenator Chafee's Staff'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection. The material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Thoughts from Senator Chafee's Staff\n\n       Working for Senator Chafee was not a job, it was an honor, \n     and a great one at that. Each and every one of us--on the \n     personal staff in Washington . . . the Environment Committee \n     staff . . . and in the Senator's Rhode Island office--felt \n     privileged to be advancing his legislative priorities, his \n     values, his vision of government and public service.\n       In the many wonderful tributes that have been paid to \n     Senator Chafee, his concern over issues such as the \n     environment, health care, civil rights, and gun violence have \n     been highlighted. He also cared deeply about our nation's \n     economic future, and its impact on generations to come. \n     Senator Chafee cared about these issues because of their \n     implications for people generally, but, more specifically, \n     for the most vulnerable members of our society--children, the \n     disabled, the frail elderly, and the low-income. His guiding \n     motivation was the importance of human dignity, and the \n     belief that government could make a positive difference in \n     people's lives.\n       His sense of public spirit was infectious, and we have all \n     learned a great deal from him. But more important than any \n     lesson in civics is the example he set for all of us about \n     how to conduct our lives: listen to both sides; do what's \n     right; and even if you don't prevail, be of good cheer; and \n     always look for the good in people.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing our \ngreat sorrow for the loss of John Chafee. He was a really remarkable, \nspecial soul, a very gentle person, who nevertheless had a will of \nsteel. He was, in many ways, sort of an archetypal New Englander, for \nthose of us who come from that part of the country. There was a great \nquality of independence, a great ability to march to the beat of his \nown drummer. He did that. I think that in very special ways he was one \nof the bridges in the U.S. Senate.\n  I first crossed paths with John Chafee back during the Vietnam war. I \nam proud that his signature is on my medals. We talked a lot about that \nafter I came back. He had the great capacity to reach out across the \naisle. I recall this summer, as a matter of fact, how he came up to me \none evening and said, ``I am a bachelor; Virginia is not here.'' My \nwife, Teresa, wasn't here at the time. He said, ``Let's go to dinner.'' \nSo we went down to the Metropolitan Club, where I heard some other \ncolleagues say he often went to dinner. We just sat and talked a lot \nabout life,\n\n[[Page S13085]]\n\nabout war, about his experiences; and all the divisions of the Senate \nsort of melted away because of his gesture. But it was not strange for \nJohn to do that. Those of us who worked with him over the years here \nknow that he was always reaching across the aisle trying to build a \nbridge, trying to pull people together.\n  I remember when we were in the throes of a fight over the clean air \namendment in 1990. There were great meetings in the room back here with \nGeorge Mitchell. John Chafee, Senator Mitchell, and a few others with \ngreat calming voices, were reaching out trying to pull people together \nand find a path of common sense. That is really one of the great \nlegacies, the commitment that produced that amendment and also produced \na whole host of advances with respect to the environment.\n  I traveled with John to Rio. We were part of the delegation for the \nRio conference when we had that huge summit.\n  I traveled with him again to Kyoto. I remember one very peaceful \nmoment when we snuck away to a beautiful Japanese garden. He was busy \nlooking at the architecture, experiencing the remarkable peace of that \nplace, and laughing at the fact that he had stolen away from a \nconference for a few moments to do so.\n  John was one of the great calming influences in this body, a man of \nextraordinary common sense, a person who always tried to stand for \nprinciple--not for party, not for ideology, but for what was best for \nthe State, best for the country, and best, in his judgment, for \nfamilies and for the future.\n  He was passionate about Rhode Island, and passionate about the \ncountry. And in the end, I think his legacy will be measured not only \nby the legislation that he worked on, not only by his remarkable \nefforts to help us get a health care bill in 1993 and 1994, but \nmeetings which I will forever remember in his hideaway where he brought \npeople together trying to forge a centrist plan, which, ultimately, I \nmight add, helped pave the way for Kennedy-Kassebaum and for other \nthings that we have contemplated.\n  But he understood what his course was. He had a great sense of who he \nwas, of what this place meant to him, and what all of us could achieve. \nHe always placed those aspirations on the table as directly and as \nhonestly as anybody I know in the Senate.\n  John was also a warrior--a great warrior. Underneath the remarkable, \ndocile, and temperamental person that we grew to know, there was really \nthis other person who knew how to fight for country and for things that \nwere bigger than him. He did so at Guadalcanal, he did so in Korea, and \nhe did so in a remarkable way.\n  I will always remember Col. Terry Ball--he became a general, and he \nis now retired, just recently, about a week or two ago--telling me of \nthe remarkable journey he took with John, a journey he talked to John \nabout before he took it, to go back and visit in the South Pacific \nthose great places that he was part of with the Marine Corps.\n  I remember reading William Manchester's book, ``Return to Darkness.'' \nIn many ways, that was the journey John went on when he went back there \nto revisit those places where he had served with such distinction but \nwhere he also knew such a profound loss.\n  This past summer, we shared another great moment together. We had the \nprivilege of joining the Secretary of the Navy on the USS Constitution \nat Boston Harbor for a dinner. He was there with his family--the \ngreater part of his family. It was a dinner in honor of John and his \nservice. A number of us went up there to share that evening.\n  I must say the sparkle in his eye at being aboard the ship with the \nflags raised, the colors presented, with his presentation of a walking \ncane from the Constitution itself, the sparkle in his eye that evening \nis something I will always remember.\n  I will never forget his passion for the Armed Forces, and \nparticularly, of course, for his beloved Marines.\n  The Marines have their motto semper fi, ``forever faithful.'' It is \nclear that motto was the guiding light of John's life--forever faithful \nto his family, to his love, Virginia, to his children, his \ngrandchildren, to the Senate, to his State, and to the principles which \nguided them.\n  He is really Mr. President, with all respect for all of our \ncolleagues, the kind of person in this great institution who is worth \nemulating. I hope there will be others such as him in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, while traveling to Washington today from \nmy home in Colorado, I learned the sad news that our colleague, Senator \nJohn Chafee, passed away last evening from heart failure. It is with \ndeep sadness that I pay tribute today to this statesman, a great \nAmerican, and my friend.\n  John Chafee was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from \nYale University and Harvard Law School. He left Yale to enlist in the \nMarine Corps when the United States entered World War II, and then \nserved in the original invasion forces at Guadalcanal. He was recalled \nto active duty in 1951, and commanded a rifle company in Korea.\n  John served for six years in the Rhode Island House of \nRepresentatives, was elected as Rhode Island's governor in 1962, and \nwas reelected in 1964 and 1966.\n  In January 1969, John Chafee was appointed Secretary of the Navy, and \nhe began his career in the United States Senate in 1976. He was \nreelected to a fourth term in 1994, with 65 percent of the vote, and \nwas the only Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Rhode \nIsland in the past 68 years.\n  John Chafee has been a leader in the Senate and indeed the nation to \nimprove the quality of our environment. As an effective Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, John built a strong legislative \nrecord for clean air, clean water, conservation of wetlands, and \npreservation of open space.\n  He also will be long remembered for his tireless efforts as a senior \nmember of the Finance Committee to expand health care coverage for \nwomen and children and to improve community services for persons with \ndisabilities.\n  I extend my condolences to John's wife Virginia, their five children \nand twelve grandchildren.\n  I will miss my friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr President, I join my colleagues today in mourning the \nloss of our colleague, John Chafee. John was a good and honorable man \nwho served his state and his country with distinction. A devoted public \nservant and Member of this body for 23 years, Senator Chafee's \ninfluence extended beyond the aisles and transcended partisan rhetoric. \nHis accomplishments as a lawmaker and his unquestionable influence \namong his peers stand as a testament to his ability.\n  Senator Chafee will long be admired and remembered for his devotion \nto this country both as a soldier and public servant. His distinguished \nservice in the military, including serving in the Marines at \nGuadalcanal and commanding a rifle company in Korea, were indicative of \nthe man who would never shy away from duty or responsibility. His \nrecord as a legislator, governor, and senator in Rhode Island indicate \nthe amount of trust the people of Rhode Island put in John.\n  Although political views may vary from person to person, it is easy \nto put these differences aside and to recognize men of strong character \nand integrity. These are qualities which were abundant in John, and his \nsteadying influence in the United States Senate will be truly missed. \nMy thoughts and prayers extend to his family and all those whose lives \nSenator Chafee touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13085-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13085-S13086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE LATE FREDERICK ``RICK'' HART\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the most unpleasant tasks we \ncarry-out is to come to the Senate Floor in order to mark the passage \nof friends who have died. Today, it is my sad duty to share my memories \nof a man who was not only a valued friend, but one of the nation's \ntreasures, Mr. Frederick ``Rick'' Hart, who passed away unexpectedly in \nAugust.\n  All recognize that Washington is the capital of the United States, \nand almost all also recognize it as a beautiful city, with impressive, \ninspiring and humbling architecture and monuments. People from all over \nthe world travel to the District of Columbia to see and visit places \nsuch as the Capitol,\n\n[[Page S13086]]\n\nthe White House, the Vietnam War Memorial, and the National Cathedral. \nThrough their explorations of Washington, millions of people have been \nexposed to, and moved by, the art work of Rick Hart.\n  Rick Hart was one of the world's most talented and appreciated \nsculptors who created many impressive pieces during his career, but it \nis two pieces in particular with which visitors to Washington are most \nfamiliar. Though they may have never known that these two pieces were \ncreated by Rick Hart, countless individuals have been taken by the \n``Creation'' at the National Cathedral and ``Three Soldiers'' at the \nVietnam War Memorial.\n  It is appropriate that one of Rick's most famous sculptures is to be \nfound at the National Cathedral, for it was there that he began his \ncareer as an apprentice stone carver, working on the gargoyles that \nadorn the gothic structure. From the beginning of his involvement in \nart, it was obvious that Rick was a man of tremendous talent and \ncreativity. This was proven unquestionably when at age thirty-one his \ndesign for a sculpture to adorn the west facade of the Cathedral was \npicked after an international call for submissions.\n  One decade after his design for the National Cathedral was accepted, \nhis emotion evoking sculpture of ``Three Soldiers'' was dedicated in \nNovember of 1984 as a supplement to the Vietnam War Memorial. It \ncertainly must have been a challenge for this artist to go from \ncreating a work that helped to express the glory of creation and God \nwith a work that stands as a reminder to those who served and died in \nVietnam. Not surprisingly, Rick rose to the challenge and sculpted what \nhas become one of the most recognized and respected military sculptures \nin the world, and one that helps to pay appropriate homage to all those \nwho participated in that conflict.\n  All that Rick accomplished in his life is that much more impressive \ngiven his humble and hard beginnings. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Rick \nlost his mother at an early age and was reared in rural South Carolina \nfor much of his young life, until he and his father moved to \nWashington. Rick was a bright man with both his hands and his mind, and \nhis exceedingly high Scholastic Aptitude Test scores allowed his \nentrance in college at the young age of sixteen. Just as many who have \nbeen born and raised in the South have done, Rick chose to return \n``home'', and he enrolled in the University of South Carolina as a \nphilosophy student. Rick's higher education also include studies at the \nCorcoran and American University, where ironically, he was scheduled to \ngive the commencement address at next year's graduation and to be \nawarded an honorary degree.\n  My chief of Staff, R.J. ``Duke'' Short, his wife Dee, and our good \nfriend Harry Sacks have been friends of Rick for many year, and it was \nthey who introduced me to Rick back in 1995. Rick generously and \ngraciously volunteered to create a bust of me which has been donated to \nhe United States Senate and is on display not far from this Chamber, in \nSenate-238, also known as ``The Strom Thurmond Room.'' In order to \nscript by bust, Rick and I spent a considerable amount of time \ntogether. Rick was a warm, outgoing, and humble man and it was obvious \nthat creating works of art was a passion for him.\n  Though still very young, only in his fifties, Rick suffered a serious \nhealth setback last year when he was felled with a stroke. Strong and \nvital, Rick was making an impressive recovery when he was admitted to \nJohns Hopkins Hospital in August to be treated for pneumonia. \nTragically, doctors discovered that his body has been overtaken by \ncancer and he had quite literally only days to live. His death was \nsudden, unexpected, and tragic, and has left all of us pondering how \nsomeone so vital could be taken at such a young age. His passing \nsaddens all who knew him and his death leaves a tremendous void in the \nAmerican art community. My condolences and sympathies are with his wife \nLindy and sons Alexander and Lain. While their husband and father may \nno longer be here, Frederick ``Rick'' Hart has achieved a kind of \nimmortality through his great works of art.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13086-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13086-S13087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPERFUND RECYCLING EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, over the past three decades, concern for our \nenvironment and natural resources has grown--as has the desire to \nrecycle and reuse. You may be surprised to learn that one major \nenvironmental statue actually creates an impediment to recycling. \nSuperfund has created this impediment, although unintended by the law's \nauthors.\n  Because of the harm that is being done to the recycling effort by the \nunintended consequence of law, the distinguished minority leader, Mr. \nDaschle, and I introduced the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, S. 1528. \nThis bill removes Superfund's recycling impediments and increases \nAmerica's recycling rates.\n  We had one and only one purpose in introducing the Superfund \nRecycling Equity Act--to remove from the liability loop those who \ncollect and ship recyclables to a third party site. The bill is not \nintended to plow new Superfund ground, nor is it intended to revamp \nexisting Superfund law. That task is appropriately left to \ncomprehensive reform, a goal that I hope is achievable.\n  While the bill proposes to amend Superfund, Mr. President, it is \nreally a recycling bill. Recycling is not disposal and shipping for \nrecycling is not arranging for disposal--it is a relatively simple \nclarification, but one that is necessary to maintain a successful \nrecycling effort nationwide. Without this clarification, America will \ncontinue to fall short of its recycling goal.\n  S. 1528 was negotiated in 1993 between representatives of the \nindustry that recycles traditional materials--paper, glass, plastic, \nmetals, textiles and rubber--and representatives of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Justice, and the national \nenvironmental community. Similar language has been included in \nvirtually every comprehensive Superfund bill since 1994. With nearly 50 \nSenate cosponsors, support for the bill has been both extensive and \nbipartisan.\n  Since Senator Daschle and I introduced S. 1528, some have argued that \nwe should not ``piecemeal'' Superfund. They argue that every part of \nSuperfund should be held together tightly, until a comprehensive \napproach to reauthorization is found. And given the broad-based support \nfor the recycling piece across both parties, some think it should be \nheld as a ``sweetener'' for some of the more difficult issues. \nSuperfund's long history suggests, however, that the recycling \nprovisions--as sweet as they are--have done little, if anything, to \nhelp move a comprehensive Superfund bill forward. Rather, \n``sweeteners'' like brownfields and municipal liability are what keep \nall parties at the table.\n  Holding the recyclers hostage to a comprehensive bill has not helped \nreform Superfund, and continuing to hold them hostage will not ensure \naction in the future. What it does ensure is that recycling continues \nto be impeded and fails to attain our nation's goals.\n  This recycling fix is minuscule compared to the overwhelming \nstakeholder needs regarding Superfund in general, but so significant \nfor the recycling industry itself. It is easy to see why this bill has \nachieved such widespread bipartisan support among our colleagues.\n  S. 1528 addresses only one Superfund issue--the unintended \nconsequence of law that holds recyclers responsible for the actions of \nthose who purchase their goods. The goal of this bill is to remove the \nliability facing recyclers, not to establish who should be responsible \nfor those shares if the unintended liability is removed.\n  Senator Daschle and I have heard from various parties who want to add \nminor provisions outside the scope of the bill. Although many have \npresented interesting and often compelling arguments, I will continue \nto ask that any party wishing to enlarge the narrow focus of S. 1528 \nshow support on both sides of the aisle, as well as from the \nadministration and the environmental community.\n  Much time, energy and expertise went into crafting an agreement where \nfew thought it was possible. That agreement has been maintained through \nfour separate Congresses where all sorts of attempts to modify it have \nfailed. Congress should accept this delicately crafted product.\n  S. 1528 shows Congress' commitment to protect and increase recycling.\n\n[[Page S13087]]\n\n  S. 1528 repeats what we all know and support--that continued and \nexpanded recycling is a national goal.\n  S. 1528 removes impediments to achieving this goal, impediments \nCongress never intended to occur.\n  The nearly 50 Senators who have already co-sponsored this bill \nrecognize the need to amend Superfund for the very important purpose of \nincreasing recycling in the public interest. Let's act this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13087-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MODERNIZATION OF THE ABM TREATY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I rise today on a substantive issue \nwhich has caused me considerable concern recently. It has to do with \nthe issue of our national missile defense and the fact we passed \nlegislation earlier this year on that subject, and we now hear the \nadministration discussing its options under the National Missile \nDefense Act. We hear responses from around the world about the intent \nwe have that is now in our law to deploy a limited national defense \nsystem. I want to speak on that subject for a minute or two.\n  When we passed the National Missile Defense Act, we all realized, and \nthe President did, too, when he signed it, that the ABM Treaty, the \nantiballistic missile defense treaty, that exists between the United \nStates and Russia, prohibits the deployment of a national missile \ndefense system and that the treaty would have to be amended if it was \nto remain in force.\n  Some statements being made on the subject now by our own \nadministration, as well as by Russian officials, cause me considerable \nconcern. For example, the Secretary of State recently said that the \nadministration was examining ``the possibility of adjusting [the ABM \nTreaty] slightly in order to have a National Missile Defense.''\n  Since article I of the treaty expressly prohibits a national missile \ndefense, the Secretary's suggestion that only a slight adjustment is \nrequired in the treaty language is a huge understatement, and it is \nlikely to mislead the Russians and others as well.\n  The National Missile Defense Act acknowledges our policy of pursuing \narms control arrangements, but it requires the deployment of a limited \nnational missile defense which contradicts the initial premise of the \nABM Treaty.\n  A number of Russian Government officials have said they will not \nnegotiate changes in the ABM Treaty. A Russian foreign ministry \nspokesman has been quoted as saying it is ``absolutely unacceptable to \nmake any changes in the key provisions of the treaty and the Russian \nside does not intend to depart from this position.''\n  A Russian defense ministry official has said: ``There can be no \ncompromise on this issue.''\n  Additionally, it has been reported that Russian and Chinese \nGovernment representatives have introduced a resolution in the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly demanding the United States forego deployment of a \nmissile defense system and strictly comply with the treaty's \nprohibition on territorial defense.\n  It is entirely inappropriate for the U.N. to consider seriously a \nresolution that would presume to dictate to the United States what we \nshould or should not do in defense of our own national security. \nBallistic missile threats are real and have caused our Government to \nadopt a policy that requires a deployed national missile defense.\n  It is my fervent hope our own Government will acknowledge clearly \nthat the National Missile Defense Act means what it says and stop \nencouraging misunderstanding by the Russians, the Chinese, or anyone \nelse of our intentions to defend ourselves against ballistic missile \nattack. We also hope the point will be made that we are not trying to \nundermine or threaten Russia's missile deterrent.\n  Our relationship with Russia has improved considerably in recent \nyears. I hope this new era of mutual respect and understanding will \ncontinue to be strengthened. We are getting into an unfortunate \nsituation, however, where candor and honest exchange of information and \nintentions are taking a back seat to half-truths and bluster. The \nlatter course will lead to misunderstanding and possibly disaster. At \nno time in the history of the relationship have honesty and unequivocal \ndialog been more important between Russia and the United States. The \nABM Treaty is out of date and must be changed to reflect today's \nrealities. The sooner everyone acknowledges this fact and gets busy \nnegotiating the changes that are required, the better off we will all \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13087-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHARLES BATTAGLIA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to comment about a \ndistinguished American who is retiring from service in the U.S. Senate. \nCharles Battaglia has been associated with me in the Senate for the \npast 14 years. He came to help me as an assistant when I served on the \nIntelligence Committee and stayed with me to become staff director of \nthe Intelligence Committee during the 104th Congress when I chaired \nthat committee, and then, in the 105th Congress, moved over with me to \nbe the staff director when I chaired the Veterans Affairs Committee \nthrough the first session of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. Battaglia has a distinguished record. Following graduation from \nBoston College, he served 25 years in the U.S. Navy, serving in the \noffices of the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, and the \nNaval War College. In 1978, Mr. Battaglia was selected by the Director \nof Central Intelligence, Adm. Stansfield Turner, to be his special \nassistant at CIA. He received his MBA from Bryant University, and in \n1991 completed the Kennedy School of Government's international \nsecurity program, was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and \nhas an extraordinarily distinguished military record in the Navy, in \nthe intelligence community and CIA, as an assistant on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and later as staff director there.\n  He has earned retirement status.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nregulate certain 50 caliber sniper weapons in the same manner as \nmachine guns and other firearms; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             Military Sniper Weapon Regulation Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Lautenberg to introduce the Military Sniper Weapon Regulation \nAct of 1999. This bill will reclassify powerful .50 caliber military \nsniper rifles under the National Firearms act, thus making it much more \ndifficult for terrorists, doomsday cults, and criminals to obtain these \nguns for illegitimate use.\n  Let me just talk a little bit about what a .50 caliber gun is, and \nthen I will describe why I believe it is vital to tighten the rules \nsurrounding their use and purchase.\n  These .50 caliber firearms are weapons of such range and destructive \ncapability that it seems unthinkable for them to fall into civilian \nhands. These\n\n[[Page S13090]]\n\n.50 caliber guns, manufactured by a small handful of companies and \nindividuals, are deadly, military style assault rifles. The M82A1, one \ncommon example of these guns, was manufactured with one purpose in \nmind--the efficient destruction of enemy armaments and personnel. These \nguns, weighing 28 pounds and capable of piercing light armor at more \nthan 4 miles, enable a single shooter to destroy enemy jeeps, tanks, \npersonnel carriers, bunkers, fuel stations, and even communication \ncenters. As a result, their use by military organizations worldwide has \nbeen rapidly spreading during the course of this decade.\n  But with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also seen \nincreased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists around \nthe world.\n  The weapons are deadly accurate up to 2,000 yards. This means that a \nshooter using a .50 caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than \na mile away. In fact, according to a training manual for military and \npolice snipers published in 1993, a bullet from this gun ``even at one \nand a half miles crashes into a target with more energy than Dirty \nHarry's famous .44 magnum at point-blank'' range.\n  And the gun is ``effective'' up to 7,500 yards. In other words, \nalthough it may be hard to aim at that distance, the gun will have its \ndesired destructive effect at that distance--more than 4 miles from the \ntarget.\n  The weapon can penetrate several inches of steel, concrete, or even \nlight armor.\n  Many ranges used for target practice do not even have enough safety \nfeatures to accommodate these guns--it is just too powerful.\n  This gun was used extensively in the gulf war by American troops. \nIdeal for long range destruction of personnel, light armor or \ncommunications, there is no question that this gun is an effective \nwartime tool.\n  Recent advances in weapons technology, however, allow this gun to be \nused by civilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and \neven aircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the gun apparently \npromoted the weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars' worth \nof jet aircraft with one or two dollars' worth of cartridge.''\n  One new version of the .50 caliber weapon is a modified machine gun \ncapable of accepting ammunition belts, and yet is still allowed for \ncivilian use by BATF.\n  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover GAO \ninvestigators ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time \nbefore someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits \na school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50 \ncalibers. This gun is just too powerful.''\n  Mr. President, a recent study by the General Accounting Office \nrevealed some eye-opening facts about how and where this gun is used, \nand how easily it is obtained.\n  The GAO reports that many of these guns wind up in the hands of \ndomestic and international terrorists, religious cults, outlaw \nmotorcycle gangs, drug traffickers, and violent criminals.\n  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns \nand stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of \nrounds of ammunition and other guns.\n  At least one .50 caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities \nafter a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. \nThe gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the \nguns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide.\n  Accoring to a recent news story, another .50 caliber sniper rifle, \nsmuggled out of the United States, was used by the Irish Republican \nArmy to kill a large number of British soldiers.\n  And ammunition for these guns is also readily available, even over \nthe Internet. Bullets for these guns include ``armor piercing \nincendiary'' ammunition that explodes on impact, and even ``armor \npiercing tracing'' ammunition reminiscent of the ammunition that lit up \nthe skies over Baghdad during the Persian Gulf war.\n  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing \nammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the \ninvestigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored \nlimousine or maybe to ``take down'' a helicopter.\n  In fact, our own military helps to provide thousands of rounds of .50 \ncaliber ammunition, by essentially giving away tons of spent \ncartridges, many of which are then refurbished and sold on the civilian \nmarket.\n  The bill I offer today will begin the process of making these guns \nharder to get and easier to track.\n  Current law classifies .50 caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to \nthe least government regulation for any firearm. Sawed-off shotguns, \nmachine guns, and even handguns are more highly regulated than this \nmilitary sniper rifle.\n  In fact, many states allow possession of .50 caliber guns by those as \nyoung as 14 years old, and there is no regulation on second-hand sales.\n  Essentially, this bill would re-classify .50 caliber guns under the \nNational Firearms Act, which imposes far stricter standards on powerful \nand destruction weapons.\n  For instance:\n  NFA guns may only be purchased from a licensed dealer, and not \nsecond-hand. This will prevent the sale of these guns at gun shows and \nin other venues that make it hard for law enforcement to track the \nweapons.\n  Second, purchasers of NFA guns must fill out license transfer \napplications and provide fingerprints to be processed by the FBI in \ndetailed criminal background checks. By reclassifying the .50 caliber, \nCongress will be making a determination that sellers should be more \ncareful about to whom they give these powerful, military guns.\n  ATF reports that this background check process takes about 60 days, \nso prospective gun buyers will face some delay. However, legitimate \npurchasers of this $7,000 gun can certainly wait that long.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, placing a few more restrictions on who can \nget these guns and how is simply common sense. This bill will not ban \nthe sale, use or possession of .50 caliber weapons. The .50 caliber \nshooting club will not face extinction, and ``legitimate'' purchasers \nof these guns will not lose their access--even though that, too, might \nbe a reasonable step, since I cannot imagine a legitimate use of this \ngun.\n  The bill will simply place stricter requirements on the way in which \nthese guns can be sold, and to whom. The measure is meant to offer a \nreasoned solution to making it harder for terrorists, assassins, and \nother criminals to obtain these powerful weapons. If we are to continue \nto allow private citizens to own and use guns of this caliber, range, \nand destructive power, we should at the very least take greater care in \nmaking sure that these guns do not fall into the wrong hands.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1775. A bill to amend section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act to \n1961 to modify the matters taken into account in assessing the \ncooperation of foreign countries with the counter drug efforts of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing today for \nSenator Helms and myself legislation to help the Administration better \nunderstand the importance of representing the US national interest. I \nam sending to the desk a bill on additional considerations for \nassessment of cooperation of foreign countries with United States \ncounter-drug efforts. The purpose of this bill is to help the \nAdministration get its act together when it comes to the certification \nprocess on illegal drugs. Recent statements by the Drug Czar and other \nAdministration officials on certification, along with their actions in \nregard to such countries as Syria and Iran, show that they may have \nmisplaced US national interests when it comes to drug policy. I want to \nhelp them find it again.\n  Over a decade ago, Congress passed measures in the Foreign Assistance \nAct that require US Administrations to certify whether other countries \nare taking serious steps to deal with major illegal drug production or \ntrafficking in their territories. The view behind this legislation was \nto force an accounting, at least once a year, of what the US and other \ncountries were doing to address a major foreign policy concern that, in \nthe view of Congress, governments here and abroad would just\n\n[[Page S13091]]\n\nas soon have ignored. Administrations do not like accounting for \nthemselves. Not many foreign countries welcome it either. They would \nprefer that legislatures and the public give them the money and \napproval they want with no questions asked. It's less troubling than \nhaving to explain actions, account for shortfalls, or demonstrate that \nthe money being provided is achieving anything. Congress, however, \nthinks differently. It should and it must, in my view.\n  Today, the Clinton Administration, like its predecessors, is trying \nboth to ignore certification as a genuine responsibility and to undo it \nwhere it can. It has made efforts to get Congress to scuttle the \nrequirement. It has poor-mouthed the idea internationally while denying \nit has done so. It has resorted to lawerly gimmicks and low tricks to \ndrop from certification some of the worst countries imaginable. And \nlately it has been trying to broaden, as it says, the evaluation and \naccountability process in the Western Hemisphere to make it fairer by \nparticipating with the Organization of American States in the creation \nof what is called the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism (MEM). This is \na subterfuge for trying to get rid of the process by calling it \nsomething else. Given this Administration's poor performance on \ninternational drug control, I am not surprised at an effort to disguise \nshortcomings in some artful bureaucratic way. I am not surprised, but I \nam disappointed.\n  As part of the effort to discredit certification, the Administration \nhas resorted to distortions and misrepresentations about what it \ninvolves and has enlisted a set of arguments that, while sounding \nplausible, are really little more than the old magician's trick of \n``watch the birdie'' while hoping that you will not notice what he is \nreally doing with his other hand. Well, we deserve better than sleight-\nof-hand on an issue as important as this one. I thought it might be \nuseful to provide an antidote to these shenanigans with a few home \ntruths.\n  There are many arguments advanced against certification, and I have \naddressed many of these in earlier statements on this floor, but the \nbest one argues that while certification may once have been  useful--\ntime unspecified--it has served its purpose and is counter-productive \nbecause it hampers further cooperation with other countries that resent \nbeing subject to a unilateral, U.S. judgment of their performance. \nMexico is often advanced as an example. This view is fine if you are \nworking from the idea--which seems to be so much of the philosophy \nbehind our present foreign policy--that we should be guided by everyone \nin the world's interests before our own or in spite of our own.\n\n  Now, I have no doubt that other countries resent being evaluated. In \nmy experience, they resent being evaluated by any individual country or \ncollectively. This is not new, whether we are talking drugs or policies \non intellectual properties or nuclear proliferation. And I am sure that \nthis resentment over being judged can complicate negotiations. Both \nthese points, however, are irrelevant to the circumstances under \nconsideration. As a matter of our national interest, we are obliged to \nmake judgments about the actions of other countries whether they like \nit or not. Let me try to make this point clearer in a different \ncontext.\n  The United States is currently embroiled in a controversy with the \nEuropean Union over rules governing the importation of bananas. I am \nnot going to comment on the merits of the particulars of the case, \napart from noting that the United States, the present Administration, \nhas determined--has judged--that EU restrictions, quotas, and \npreferences on the importation of bananas are unfair and prejudicial. \nThis, folks, is an evaluation. And it is one deeply resented in Europe, \nas an infringement of the rights of not just one country but of an \nassociation of many countries, which happen to be our major allies. \nNevertheless, the Administration is prepared to pursue the case in the \nteeth of this resentment to force a change it wants. And in doing this \nit is prepared to invoke sanctions to achieve its goals.\n  Similarly, the Administration is prepared to condemn a gaggle of \nother countries for permitting the pirating of various intellectual \nproperties, such as books, videos, and copyrighted products. It is \nprepared to pursue sanctions to achieve a remedy. I can extend this \nlist to judgments about states that support terrorism or are engaged in \nsystematic human rights abuses. This Administration involved this \ncountry in a major military engagement--the ultimate sanction--to stop \nwhat it regarded as gross violations of human rights. I have no doubt \nthat Slobodan Milosevic and his cronies deeply resented U.S. judgments \nabout the fitness of his actions and even more objected to the steps we \ntook to change his behavior. I do not detect that this resentment at \nbeing judged or the knowledge that there were objections to the actions \nthen taken based on that judgment carried any weight in the decisions \nmade by this Administration to bomb and strafe military and civilian \ntargets in the former Yugoslavia.\n  What these examples show is that even this Administration \nunderstands, when it wants to, that there are matters of such import \nrequiring judgments about the actions of other countries and involving \nresponses based on those judgments that resentment or objections by \nothers do not signify when it comes to deciding what we should do to \nprotect interests we regard as important. Now, certification only \nrequires that we make the involvement of other countries in the \nproduction and transit of illegal drugs--which kill more Americans \nevery year that all the terrorists have in the last ten years or more \nthan Mr. Milosevic did at any time--a matter of judgment and possible \naction of a degree at least as important as bananas. I happen to \nbelieve that judgments about drugs coming to the U.S. are at least as \nmuch in our interest as judgments about bananas going to Europe.\n  I am puzzled by the Administration's reluctance to apply meaningful \nstandards of judgment to the actions of other countries when it comes \nto drug policy. I am further puzzled by its willingness to be so moved \nby the resentment of other countries when it comes to judgments about \ndrug policies and programs. The requirements in the law are not written \nin some mysterious dialect nor apply unfamiliar concepts. The idea is \nnot so alien to our experience or even to this Administration's own \nactions as to be beyond comprehension. Yet, the Administration seems to \nhave its own sources of bemusement when it comes to taking this issue \nseriously.\n  In essence, what the law requires is that the Administration \ndetermine first whether countries are major producing or transit areas \nfor illegal drugs. You would not think this terribly difficult or \ncontroversial, or too intrusive on the feelings of others. It then asks \nfor the Administration to determine whether these countries are acting \nin good faith to enforce their own domestic laws against these \npractices; are acting in conformity with any bilateral agreements with \nthe United States to address these activities; or are doing what is \nreasonable and responsible to do in light of international law that \ngoverns the conduct of all countries on this issue. I am hard pressed \nto see how this infringes on the sovereignty of other countries or what \nin it is so outrageous as to occasion abandonment of the effort.\n  The law then requires that if, in the judgment of the Administration, \nany given country is not acting in good faith, it may then be subject \nto sanctions. The law does not require that the efforts of another \ncountry be successful in order to be certified. It does not require \nthat judgments be without consideration of other national interests. It \ndoes ask, on this very important question, that the Administration \nsupply to Congress and the American people at least once a year its \nconsidered opinion of whether other countries where a truly pernicious \npractice is being engaged in that affects directly the lives of U.S. \ncitizens each and every day are, as a matter of fact, doing all that is \nreasonable to stop this practice. It then requires that if these \ncountries are receiving U.S. assistance--that is, money from U.S. \ntaxpayers--that this money be cut off--unless it is humanitarian aid or \nthis self-same counter-drug assistance.\n  While I understand perfectly why an aid recipient might squawk, I do \nnot know what act of imagination it requires to manufacture outrage on \nbehalf of other countries threatened with\n\n[[Page S13092]]\n\nlosing this assistance because in our judgment they are doing less than \ntheir best to cooperate with us. But that outrage is trotted out as an \nargument against certification. That aside, the most onerous part of \nthe certification decision, and what other countries truly object to, \nis what world opinion makes of a U.S. judgment that a particular \ncountry is not cooperating with U.S. and international efforts to stop \ndrug production or trafficking. What the Administration would have us \ndo is forgo this judgment lest it hurt the feels of other countries. \nAnd yet, it is this judgment or the threat of it that has, in fact, \nbeen the primary impetus to encourage the very cooperation that the \nAdministration says we do not need the certification process to \nachieve.\n  What the Administration would really like to do is to stop accounting \nto Congress and the public for its international drug policy. It knows \nthat this is a non-starter. So it has proposed instead to bury this \naccountability in an elaborate ruse in cooperation with the OAS to \nneuter the process. In doing this, it has helped to devise through the \nOAS a list of over 80 evaluation items to help in developing a so-\ncalled multinational evaluative mechanism. There are, of course, no \nteeth in the evaluation  process, and each of the member states \ninvolved has an effective veto over any adverse judgments of their \nrespective efforts. In this regard, I am reminded of the inhabitants of \nGarrison Keiller's Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above \naverage. The details behind the evaluation are to be kept confidential, \nwhich is okay since no one has much faith in the ability of most of the \ncountries party to the evaluation to actually collect and evaluate the \ninformation in the first place. The countries involved lack the \nnecessary reporting mechanisms, the budgets to sustain them, or the \nstaffs to ensure ongoing, consistent information. This farrago is then \nsupposed, gradually, to substitute for certification, somehow being \nfairer and more likely to ensure cooperation.\n\n  Ironically, the premise underlying this process is the same as that \ninforming certification, that is, that a judgment about performance \ndoes need to be made. The difference here is that somehow a \nmultilateral judgment would be better, and it wouldn't be offensive \nsince it would be collaborative. In my view, it won't be offensive \nbecause it won't be effective. You can make what you want to of a \nprocess that is supposed to involve judgments about the effectiveness \nof actions that are designed not to offend anyone being judged. But I \nam not reassured. And if this is the face of cooperation, then we are \nin for some rude shocks in our international relations.\n  Having said this, I am prepared to help the Administration in its \nefforts. In order to give the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism some \nchance of effective implementation, I am, along with Senator Helms, \ntoday introducing legislation that would require that in future \ncertification decisions the Administration incorporate the MEM as part \nof its deliberations in determining whether to certify other countries \nor not. Taking the Administration at its word that the mechanism is not \nan attempt to replace certification, but rather an effort to complement \nit, I offer this bill to enhance the process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Enzi, and \n        Mr. Grams):\n  S. 1776. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to revise the \nenergy policies of the United States in order to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, advance global climate science, promote technology \ndevelopment, and increase citizen awareness, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             the climate change energy policy response act\n\n  S. 1777. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for the voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and \nto advance global climate science and technology development; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the climate change tax amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, few issues present stakes as high for our \ncountry as global climate change. Worst case scenarios involving \nelevated temperatures and sea levels are disturbing to many people. On \nthe other hand, capping energy use at levels lower than those in the \ngrowth-oriented nineties could chill our economy faster than it would \ncool down the climate.\n  Responsible governance includes environmental stewardship. However, \nthe ultimate obligation of any government official anywhere is to win \nfreedom for the governed who do not now have it, and to protect freedom \nfor those who are already free.\n  By freedom, I mean the opportunity to achieve one's true potential, \nwhether as an individual, a community, or a nation. And isn't it \nmarvelous how freedom spawns discovery and innovation? And, in turn, \nhow discovery and innovation solve problems and create opportunities?\n  Mr. President, we need consensus on climate change. But there is no \nmagic dust that we can sprinkle on ourselves to make us all embrace the \nsame scientific and economic conclusions on this issue. Our only chance \nlies in good, hard work toward that end.\n  Where should we begin? Knowledge leads to understanding, and \nunderstanding to consensus. Mr. President, at the moment we have some \ncritical gaps in our knowledge of climate phenomena.\n  We know not nearly enough about the Earth's capacity to assimilate \ncarbon dioxide. We know not nearly enough about natural variability of \nthe climate over years, much less over centuries and millennia. Our \nability to measure and predict changes is not developed. Adequate \nmeasurement and modeling machinery is not even invented yet. Scientists \nat the National Research Council published a report in September, 1999, \nthat confirm these observations. In the preface of that Report, they \nstate:\n\n       It would be a misinterpretation of U.S. administration \n     policy and agreements at the Kyoto conference to conclude \n     that the causes and characteristics of global change are \n     sufficiently clear that scientific inquiry in this area \n     should be limited to mitigation measures.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       A great deal more needs to be understood . . . about global \n     environmental change before we concentrate on ``mitigation'' \n     science. We do not understand the climate system well enough \n     to clarify the causes and likelihoods of rapid or abrupt \n     climate changes.\n\n  Likewise, Mr. President, we need to understand the economic \nimplications of the leading policy alternatives. One year ago the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy published a sobering analysis of potential \neconomic impacts of implementing the Kyoto agreement. But shouldn't we \nhear from other agencies as well? What would the Department of Labor \nhave to say? How about Agriculture and Transportation? Let's look \nbefore we leap.\n  A third area we must explore is technology. What do we really know \ntoday about how energy will be produced in this country in 20 years? \nWhat do we know about how--and how much--it will be consumed? Can we \ndevelop policies to encourage real improvement in energy efficiency \nwithout trying to pick the market winners and losers?\n  Mr. President, we are now living in the Information Renaissance. But \nmany in government behave as though we are still in the Dark Ages. If \nsome of us in Congress have difficulty gaining access to government-\ncontrolled information in this area--and all too often we have--can you \nimagine the obstacles to private citizens?\n  Let's get all the information--science, technology, economics--\ntogether. Let's make it freely and widely available. All Americans have \na right to know what their Government knows--and what their Government \nis doing--about climate change.\n  Knowledge in the science, economics, and technology of climate change \nwill yield to understanding. We should all be open to unexpected \ndiscovery, whether in pleasant surprises or confirmation of today's \npredictions.\n  While we are waiting to close our knowledge gaps, why not go ahead \nwith some steps that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while \naccomplishing other benefits along the way? Every minute wasted in \ntraffic tie-ups is that much more carbon dioxide man releases into the \natmosphere. If we apply technology to solving traffic problems and the \ngreenhouse gas theory fizzles out, at least our efforts will have saved \ntime for busy travelers and commuters.\n\n[[Page S13093]]\n\n  Let's find ways to encourage individual citizens, farms and small \nbusinesses, communities and States, to take some no-regrets action to \nlower greenhouse gas emissions.

My legislation does not pretend to answer \nall the questions. Rather, it lays out a framework for reaching \nconsensus that begins by developing knowledge; and from knowledge \nunderstanding; and from understanding consensus.\n  Mr. President, let's get stared.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) to responsibly address climate change issues requires \n     examination of energy policies and practices;\n       (2) global climate change issues have profound scientific, \n     technological, economic, and public policy facets that must \n     be addressed in a comprehensive, integrated fashion;\n       (3) current scientific research, experimentation, and data \n     collection are not adequately focused on answering key \n     questions within the United States or internationally;\n       (4)(A) the lack of a coordinated climate modeling strategy \n     in the United States is hampering progress in high-end \n     climate modeling activities;\n       (B) the United States lacks the capabilities to perform the \n     requisite climate change modeling simulations and experiments \n     in order to be able to apply existing United States \n     intellectual expertise to important science and policy \n     questions related to climate change; and\n       (C) those deficiencies, among others, limit the ability of \n     the United States to--\n       (i) predict future climate characteristics and assess the \n     results of climate change;\n       (ii) formulate policies that are consistent with national \n     objectives; and\n       (iii) advance most effectively an understanding of the \n     underlying scientific issues pertaining to climate change and \n     variability;\n       (5) there has been a lack of progress made by Federal \n     agencies responsible for climate observation systems, \n     individually and collectively, in developing and maintaining \n     a credible, integrated climate observing system, consequently \n     limiting the ability of the United States to document and \n     understand climate change adequately;\n       (6)(A) developing and deploying technologies can speed the \n     transition to a lower level of greenhouse gas emissions in \n     the United States and throughout the world;\n       (B) the pace of technological change in the marketplace is \n     difficult to predict accurately; while breakthroughs in such \n     developments are often incremental, capital turnover, \n     consumer acceptance, technological compatibility, economics, \n     and other factors can alter the pace of such change; and\n       (C) such technologies need to be environmentally sound, \n     safe, cost-effective, and consumer-friendly;\n       (7)(A) public access to scientific, economic, and public \n     policy information regarding climate change is severely \n     limited;\n       (B) the public's right to know and to be fully informed of \n     all aspects of climate change is not being satisfied; and\n       (C) open and balanced discussion leading to public support \n     for the best environmentally and economically sound \n     approaches to climate change policy resolution is urgently \n     needed;\n       (8) sufficient scientific questions and public interest \n     exist to warrant tangible encouragement and acknowledgment of \n     responsible actions by private entities to reduce, avoid, or \n     offset greenhouse gas emissions, even though many scientific, \n     technological, economic, and public policy questions have not \n     yet been resolved;\n       (9) voluntary measures should be encouraged through \n     incentives rather than in anticipation of future domestic or \n     international regulatory mandates; and\n       (10) greenhouse gas emission improvements can be achieved \n     through voluntary measures even as we answer yet unresolved \n     key questions about global and regional climates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The reports are to contain any scientific conclusions, \n     interim status reports, and recommendations for subsequent \n     research and testing that DOE considers appropriate. A draft \n     report must be made available by DOE to appropriate \n     nongovernmental organizations for their review no later than \n     August 1 of each year. All reports under this section must be \n     made available to the public through the National Resource \n     Center on Climate Change.\n       For each of fiscal years 2000 through 2004, such sums as \n     are necessary are authorized to be appropriated for research:\n       to assess the ability of natural carbon sinks to adjust to \n     natural variations in climate and greenhouse gas emissions \n     including, crops, grassland, forests, soils, and oceans;\n       on natural climate variability;\n       to develop and assess the capabilities of climate models;\n       to ensure the integrity of data used to validate climate \n     models;\n       to develop carbon sinks in the United States (primarily \n     crop and forestry research); and\n       to develop and deploy monitoring technology\n\n               TITLE III--POLICY REVIEW AND COORDINATION\n\n\n    sec. 301--domestic and international assessment of policies for \n           addressing the effects of greenhouse gas emissions\n\n       This section provides that within two years after the bill \n     becomes law (and biannually thereafter) DOE, after \n     consultation with each of seven federal agencies, is to \n     prepare an economic analysis of climate change policy \n     alternatives. The Secretary of Energy is to select three or \n     more such policy alternatives for critical analysis only. \n     Each analysis is to look at short term (five years) and long-\n     term (fifty years) implications, and account for changes in \n     various factors, including economic indicators.\n       Each agency to be consulted is to contribute expertise as \n     appropriate on each policy alternative analysis in the \n     following areas:\n       energy supply and demand, and energy price implications;\n       agricultural production cost and market implications, \n     including overall impact on rural economies (discrete \n     scenarios including variations in commodity and livestock \n     prices);\n       health implications, if any;\n       implications for (1) workers, including wages and job \n     opportunities and potential for U.S. firms locating \n     operations abroad; and (2) for consumers in terms of \n     predicted changes to the Consumer Price Index;\n       implications on all modes of transportation and the effects \n     of the resulting cost changes on consumers, labor, \n     agriculture and businesses;\n       housing costs and urban planning (under different mortgage \n     and construction interest rate scenarios).\n       implications for U.S. exports and imports and trade \n     competitiveness.\n     Status of activities and commitments in other countries\n       In addition to the foregoing seven economic analyses, DOE \n     is to consult with the Department of State, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Administration \n     to assess actions taken, or likely to be taken, by each \n     United Nations member country to avoid, reduce, or adapt to \n     climate change. Each such assessment is to analyze political \n     and economic factors present in each country that may impact \n     the assessment. The status of the country's commitment to \n     international agreements relating to climate change, and the \n     projected ability and likelihood of each country committing \n     to binding international agreements with targets or \n     timetables, are to be assessed.\n     Integration of policy alternative analyses\n       Within 30 months after enactment, and biannually \n     thereafter, the President, with the advice and assistance of \n     the Secretary of Energy, is to submit to Congress a report \n     analyzing and integrating the combined findings of the \n     report. The conclusion is to contain recommendations of any \n     changes in law, international agreements, or public policy \n     that the President considers to be in the best interest of \n     the United States.\n     Scientific effect of policy alternatives\n       The Secretary of Energy is to request the National \n     Academies of Science and Engineering to assess the known \n     scientific effect of each policy alternative chosen for \n     analysis under this Title and its effect on technology \n     development and selection.\n     Environmental Protection Agency activities with climate \n         change implications\n       DOE is to report on the activities of EPA that \n     coincidentally affect actions by the private sector that, in \n     turn, affect greenhouse gas emissions. DOE is to consult with \n     the public and private sectors in preparing this report.\n     Reporting flexibility\n       The Secretary of Energy may suspend one or more of the \n     agency reporting requirements after two reports if it finds \n     that such\n\n[[Page S13099]]\n\n     reports will not likely provide information that \n     substantially supplements earlier reports.\n\n                    Title IV--Public Rights-to-Know\n\n\n                 Sec. 401--Annual Report to the Public\n\n       DOE is to publish an annual report on U.S. investment in \n     climate change activities that includes:\n       a description of current, prior year, and proposed spending \n     on climate change categorized by research, regulation, \n     education, and other activities;\n       estimate of current and prior year tax credits and \n     deductions claimed by U.S. taxpayers attributable to \n     greenhouse gas emissions reductions;\n       tables of spending proposals on climate change submitted by \n     federal agencies to OMB, compared with President's final \n     recommendations to Congress;\n       an index of all climate change grantees, cross-referenced \n     by name of institutions and persons carrying out the \n     projects;\n       an index of all grant proposals not funded by federal \n     agencies; and\n       a list of all persons and their affiliations participating \n     in peer review of climate change grant proposals.\n       Each such report is to be printed on recycled paper, made \n     public, and posted on the Internet.\n     Public comment\n       DOE is to provide for notice and opportunity for public \n     comment on the report. Such comments are to be catalogued and \n     made readily available to the public in electronic format.\n     National Resource Center on Climate Change\n       DOE, in consultation with the National Academy of Science, \n     is to establish a National Resource Center on Climate Change. \n     The Center is to preserve and make publicly available all \n     reports, information, studies or other information available \n     to the federal government on climate change. Reference items \n     may be made available in electronic format only. Public \n     availability of information is subject to laws protecting \n     national defense secrets, intellectual property rights, and \n     privacy rights.\n\n TITLE V--ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF RESPONSE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\n  sec. 501--review of federally funded energy technology research and \n                              development\n\n       Requires DOE by October 15 of each year to review any \n     federally funded energy technology research and development \n     activities. The review will assess the status of the energy \n     technology, including lead-time required until deployment, \n     cost, safety, potential barriers to deployment, and other \n     relevant factors.\n       Requires DOE to establish a technology information \n     clearinghouse to disseminate the results of federally funded \n     energy technology research and development activities.

The scope is both domestic and international. \n     Requires GAO to recommend to Congress any necessary changes \n     in law.\n\n  TITLE VI--INTERNATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TO MITIGATE \n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\n  sec. 601--international deployment of energy technology to mitigate \n                             climate change\n\n     Pilot program for financial assistance\n       Requires the Secretary of Energy to create a pilot program \n     to provide financial assistance, subject to available \n     appropriations, for not more than six (6) qualifying, \n     international, energy deployment projects. To qualify, the \n     projects must be built, operated, and used outside the United \n     States and must increase energy efficiency compared to the \n     technology that would otherwise be implemented. The Secretary \n     of Energy, after consultation with the Secretary of State, \n     the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative, \n     may make the selection based solely on the criteria set forth \n     in Sec. 601.\n     Financial assistance (for qualifying international energy \n         deployment projects)\n       A U.S. firm undertaking an international energy deployment \n     project which qualifies under the preceding section is \n     eligible for financial assistance in the form of a loan or a \n     loan guarantee. The loan amount would not exceed 75% of total \n     project cost, and the interest rate would equal that for \n     Treasury obligation then issued for periods of comparable \n     maturities.\n     Equity investment insurance (for firms selected to \n         participate in pilot project)\n       Under this section a U.S. firm that enters a binding \n     contract for a qualifying international energy deployment \n     project would, if approved by DOE to be part of the pilot \n     project, be eligible for insurance on investment the firm has \n     in the project.\n     Coordination with other programs\n       Provides that a qualifying international energy deployment \n     project, funded under this title, would not be eligible as a \n     qualifying clean coal technology under Section 415 of the \n     Clean Air Act.\n     Report and recommendations\n       No later than four (4) years after the date of enactment, \n     DOE must submit a report to the President on the results of \n     the pilot projects. After reviewing the report the President \n     is to recommend to Congress that the financial assistance \n     program be continued, expanded, reduced or eliminated.\n     Authorization of appropriations\n       Authorizes appropriations (such sums as are necessary) to \n     fund the programs under this title for fiscal years 2001-\n     2004.\n\n   TITLE VII--OPTIMAL OPERATING EFFICIENCY OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n\n              sec. 701--Traffic Congestion relief research\n\n       Amends Section 502 of title 23, United States Code. \n     Requires DOE to enter into an arrangement with the National \n     Academy of Sciences to conduct a study comparing the \n     effectiveness of various regional approaches for reducing \n     traffic congestion. At a minimum the study is to assess the \n     impact on traffic of: (1) expansion of highway capacity; (2) \n     improvement of traffic operations; and (3) programs for \n     demand management.\n     Relieving urban congestion without additional right-of-way\n       Requires DOE to fund a study and prepare a report analyzing \n     highway design concepts for projects to relieve congestion in \n     urban areas without acquisition of additional rights-of-way. \n     For fiscal years 2000 through 2002, $1,000,000 of the [sum \n     deducted by the Secretary under Section 104(a)] would be \n     available for these studies.\n\n                   TITLE VIII--VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES:\n\n\n   sec. 801--improved and streamlined reporting and certification of \n                           voluntary measures\n\n       Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to improve and \n     streamline reporting and certification of voluntary measures \n     to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n     Revised reporting guidelines\n       Requires DOE (with one year of enactment and every five \n     years thereafter), to revise reporting guidelines to reflect \n     changes made by this legislation. Establishes criteria for \n     review of the reporting guidelines. Requires that any \n     review pursuant to this section give appropriate weight to \n     (1) the purpose of encouraging voluntary greenhouse gas \n     emission reductions; and (2) the voluntary nature of \n     reporting under this section. Validates reported emissions \n     reductions so long as (1) the report meets then applicable \n     guidelines and (2) reported reductions are not adjusted by \n     Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n     Forms for accurate reporting\n       Requires DOE to develop forms for voluntary reporting and \n     to make the forms available to entities wishing to report. \n     Provides that entities reporting emissions reductions certify \n     the accuracy of the report.

The \n     credit would be equal to one-half of the applicable \n     percentage of the qualified investment in a ``reduced \n     greenhouse gas emissions facility.''\n       For example, if a taxpayer replaces a coal-fired generator \n     with a more efficient one that reduced greenhouse gas \n     emissions by 18 percent, compared to the retired unit, the \n     taxpayer would be entitled to a tax credit of 9 percent of \n     qualified investment in that ``reduced greenhouse gas \n     emissions facility''. Such facility is defined as a facility \n     of the taxpayer: the construction, reconstruction, or \n     erection of which is completed by the taxpayer; or the \n     facility my be acquired by the taxpayer if the original use \n     of the facility commences with the taxpayer; which replaces \n     an existing facility of the taxpayer; which reduces \n     greenhouse gas emissions (on a per unit of output basis) as \n     compared to the facility it replaces; which uses the same \n     type of fuel as the facility it replaces; the depreciation \n     (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) of which is \n     allowable; which meets performance and quality standards (if \n     any) jointly prescribed by the Secretaries of Treasury and \n     Energy; and are consistent with regulations prescribed under \n     Sec. 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act (relating to voluntary \n     reporting of greenhouse gas emission reductions).\n       Only that portion of the investment attributable to \n     providing production capacity not greater than the production \n     capacity of the facility being replaced qualifies for the \n     credit.\n       While unit efficiencies could be achieved if the credit \n     were allowed for replacing a unit with another that burned a \n     different fuel, such incentive for fuel shifting does not \n     directly stimulate efficiency technology development for each \n     fuel type. The objective is to improve efficiencies ``within \n     a fuel''; not to encourage fuel shifting ``between fuels.''\n\n\n                 qualified progress expenditure credit\n\n       With respect to qualified progress expenditures, the amount \n     of the qualified investment for the taxable year shall be \n     increased by the aggregate of each qualified progress \n     expenditure for the taxable year with respect to progress \n     expenditure property. Progress expenditure property is \n     defined as any property being constructed by or for the \n     taxpayer and which it is reasonable to believe will qualify \n     as a reduced greenhouse gas emission facility.\n\n\n                                election\n\n       A taxpayer may elect to take the tax credit in such a \n     manner (i.e. as an investment credit, or as qualified \n     progress expenditure) as the Secretary may by regulations \n     prescribe. The election will apply to the taxable year for \n     which it was made and to all subsequent taxable years. Such \n     an election, once made, may not be revoked except with the \n     consent of the Secretary.\n\n\n          recapture where facility is prematurely disposed of\n\n       If the facility is disposed of before the end of the \n     facility's depreciation period (or ``useful life'' for tax \n     purposes) the taxpayer will be assessed an increase in tax \n     equal to the greenhouse gas emissions facility investment tax \n     credit allowed for all prior taxable years multiplied by a \n     fraction whose numerator is the number of years remaining to \n     fully depreciate the facility to be disposed of, and whose \n     denominator is the total number of years over which the \n     facility would otherwise have been subject to depreciation.\n       Similar rules apply in the case in which the taxpayer \n     elected credit for progress expenditures and the property \n     thereafter ceases to qualify for such credit.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       Amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code apply to \n     property placed in service after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n\n study of additional incentives for voluntary reduction of greenhouse \n                             gas emissions\n\n       The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Transportation \n     are directed to study, and report upon to Congress along with \n     any recommendations for legislative action, possible \n     additional incentives for and removal of barriers to \n     voluntary non-recoupable expenditures on the reduction of \n     greenhouse gas emissions. An expenditure qualifies if it is \n     voluntary and not recoupable--from revenues generated from \n     the investment; determined under generally accepted \n     accounting standards; under the applicable rate-of-return \n     regulation (in the case of a taxpayer subject to such \n     regulation); from any tax or other financial incentive \n     program established under federal, State, or local law; and \n     pursuant to any credit-trading or other mechanism established \n     under any international agreement or protocol that is in \n     force.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1779. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel M/V Sandpiper; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       CERTIFICATE OF DOCUMENTATION FOR THE VESSEL ``SANDPIPER''\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndirect that the sailing vessel Sandpiper, Official Number 1079439, be \naccorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of \ndocumentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code.\n  The hull and interior of the Sandpiper were constructed in Taiwan in \n1998 by Ta-Yang Yacht Building Company, Ltd. She is a 48 foot Cutter \nRig presently used as a recreational vessel. Since construction, the \nvessel has been rigged and outfitted in the United States. It is \nestimated that 60% of the cost of the vessel has been spent on the \nmast, rigging, sails, electronics, navigational instruments, safety \nequipment, interior furnishings, and various other deck fittings. These \nitems were acquired in Annapolis, Maryland and refitting was completed \nin April, 1999.\n  The vessel is owned by Mr. and Mrs. David Maner of Augusta, Georgia. \nThe Maners would like to utilize their vessel in the coastwise trade of \nthe United States. However, because the vessel's hull was constructed \nin Taiwan, it did not meet the requirements for coastwise license \nendorsement in the United States. Such documentation is mandatory to \nenable the owner to use the vessel for its intended purpose.\n  The owners of the Sandpiper are seeking a waiver of the existing law \nbecause they wish to use the vessel for charters. The desired \nintentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise \ntrade in U.S. waters. If the Maners are granted this waiver, it is \ntheir intention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety \nrequirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to \nallow the Sandpiper to engage in the coastwise trade of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Millennium Digital Commerce \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) the growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     government transactions represent a powerful force for \n     economic growth, consumer choice, improved civic \n     participation and wealth creation.\n       (2) The promotion of growth in private sector electronic \n     commerce through Federal legislation is in the national \n     interest because that market is globally important to the \n     United States.\n       (3) A consistent legal foundation, across multiple \n     jurisdictions, for electronic commerce will promote the \n     growth of such transactions, and that such a foundation \n     should be based upon a simple, technology neutral, non-\n     regulatory, and market-based approach.\n       (4) The Nation and the world stand at the beginning of a \n     large scale transition to an information society which will \n     require innovative legal and policy approaches, and \n     therefore, States can serve the national interest by \n     continuing their proven role as laboratories of innovation \n     for quickly evolving areas of public policy, provided that \n     States also adopt a consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     to eliminate obsolete barriers to electronic commerce such as \n     undue paper and pen requirements, and further, that any such \n     innovation should not unduly burden inter-jurisdictional \n     commerce.\n       (5) To the extent State laws or regulations do not provide \n     a consistent, reasonable national baseline or in fact create \n     an undue burden to interstate commerce in the important \n     burgeoning area of electronic commerce, the national interest \n     is best served by Federal preemption to the extent necessary \n     to provide such consistent, reasonable national baseline \n     eliminate said burden, but that absent such lack of \n     consistent, reasonable national baseline or such undue \n     burdens, the best legal system for electronic commerce will \n     result from continuing experimentation by individual \n     jurisdictions.\n       (6) With due regard to the fundamental need for a \n     consistent national baseline, each jurisdiction that enacts \n     such laws should have the right to determine the need for any \n     exceptions to protect consumers and maintain consistency with \n     existing related bodies of law within a particular \n     jurisdiction.\n       (7) Industry has developed several electronic signature \n     technologies for use in electronic transactions, and the \n     public policies of the United States should serve to promote \n     a dynamic marketplace within which these technologies can \n     compete. Consistent with this Act, States should permit the \n     use and development of any authentication technologies that \n     are appropriate as practicable as between private parties and \n     in use with State agencies.\n\n[[Page S13104]]\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n     electronic commerce through the operation of free market \n     forces rather than proscriptive governmental mandates and \n     regulations;\n       (2) to promote public confidence in the validity, integrity \n     and reliability of electronic commerce and online government \n     under Federal law;\n       (3) to facilitate and promote electronic commerce by \n     clarifying the legal status of electronic records and \n     electronic signatures in the context of writing and signing \n     requirements imposed by law;\n       (4) to facilitate the ability of private parties engaged in \n     interstate transactions to agree among themselves on the \n     terms and conditions on which they use and accept electronic \n     signatures and electronic records; and\n       (5) to promote the development of a consistent national \n     legal infrastructure necessary to support of electronic \n     commerce at the Federal and State levels within existing \n     areas of jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Agreement.--The term `agreement' means the bargain of \n     the parties in fact as found in their language or inferred \n     from other circumstances and from rules, regulations, and \n     procedures given the effect of agreements under laws \n     otherwise applicable to a particular transaction.\n       (2) Electronic.--The term ``electronic'' means relating to \n     technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, \n     optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.\n       (3) Electronic agent.--The term ``electronic agent'' means \n     a computer program or an electronic or other automated means \n     used to initiate an action or respond to electronic records \n     or performances in whole or in part without review by an \n     individual at the time of the action or response.\n       (4) Electronic record.--The term ``electronic record'' \n     means a record created, generated, sent, communicated, \n     received, or stored by electronic means.\n       (5) Electronic signature.--The term ``electronic \n     signature'' means an electronic sound, symbol, or process \n     attached to or logically associated with an electronic record \n     and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign \n     the electronic record.\n       (6) Governmental agency.--The term ``governmental agency'' \n     means an executive, legislative, or judicial agency, \n     department, board, commission, authority, institution, or \n     instrumentality of the Federal Government or of a State or of \n     any country, municipality, or other political subdivision of \n     a State.\n       (7) Record.--The term ``record'' means information that is \n     inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an \n     electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable \n     form.\n       (8) Transaction.--The term ``transaction'' means an action \n     or set of actions relating to the conduct of commerce, \n     including the business of insurance, between 2 or more \n     persons, neither of which is the United States Government, a \n     State, or an agency, department, board, commission, \n     authority, institution, or instrumentality of the United \n     States Government or of a State.\n       (9) Uniform electronic transactions act.--The term \n     ``Uniform Electronic Transactions Act'' means the Uniform \n     Electronic Transactions Act as provided to State legislatures \n     by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \n     Law.\n\n     SEC. 5.

By agreeing to \n     conduct a transaction by electronic means a party does not \n     necessarily agree to conduct other transactions by electronic \n     means.\n       (b) In General.--In any commercial transaction affecting \n     interstate commerce:\n       (1) A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or \n     enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.\n       (2) A contract or agreement may not be denied legal effect \n     or enforceability solely because an electronic record was \n     used in its formation.\n       (3) If a law requires a record to be in writing, an \n     electronic record satisfies the law.\n       (4) If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature \n     satisfies the law.\n       (c) Admissibility of Evidence.--In a legal proceeding, \n     evidence of an electronic record of signature may not be \n     excluded solely because it is in electronic form.\n       (d) Terms and Condition of Agreements.--The parties to a \n     transaction may agree on the terms and conditions on which \n     they will use and accept electronic signatures and electronic \n     records, including the methods therefore, in commercial \n     transactions affecting interstate commerce. Nothing in this \n     subsection requires that any party enter into such a \n     transaction.\n       (e) Retention.--\n       (1) If a law requires that certain records be retained, \n     that requirement is met by retaining an electronic record of \n     the information in the record which--\n       (A) accurately reflects the information set forth in the \n     record after it was first generated in its final form as an \n     electronic record or otherwise; and\n       (B) remains accessible for later reference.\n       (2) A requirement to retain records in accordance with \n     paragraph (1) does not apply to any information whose sole \n     purpose is to enable the record to be sent, communicated, or \n     received.\n       (3) A person satisfies the requirements of paragraph (1) by \n     using the services of any other person if the requirements of \n     paragraph (1) are met.\n       (4) If a law requires a record to be provided or retained \n     in its original form, or provides consequences if the record \n     is not provided or presented or retained in its original \n     form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record provided \n     or retained in accordance with paragraph (1).\n       (5) If a law requires retention of a check, that \n     requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record \n     of the information on the front and back of the check in \n     accordance with paragraph (1).\n       (6) A record retained as an electronic record in accordance \n     with paragraph (1) satisfies a law requiring a person to \n     retain records for evidentiary, audit, or like purposes, \n     unless a law enacted after the effective date of this \n     subsection specifically prohibits the use of an electronic \n     record for a specified purpose.\n       (7) This subsection does not preclude a governmental agency \n     of the United States or any State from specifying additional \n     requirements for the retention of records, written or \n     electronic, subject to the agency's jurisdiction.\n       (f) Transferable Records.--\n       (1) In this section, ``transferable record'' means an \n     electronic record that--\n       (A) would be a note under Article 3 of the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or a document under Article 7 of the Uniform \n     Commercial Code if the electronic record were in writing;\n       (B) the issuer of the electronic record expressly has \n     agreed is a transferable record; and\n       (C) relates to a transaction involving real or personal \n     property.\n       (2) A person has control of a transferable record if a \n     system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in \n     the transferable record reliably establishes that person as \n     the person to which the transferable record was issued or \n     transferred.\n       (3) A system satisfies paragraph (2), and a person is \n     deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the \n     transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such \n     a manner that--\n       (A) a single authoritative copy of the transferable record \n     exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as \n     otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), \n     unalterable;\n       (B) the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting \n     control as--\n       (i) the person to which the transferable record was issued; \n     or\n       (ii) if the authoritative copy indicates that the \n     transferable record has been transferred, the person to which \n     the transferable record was most recently transferred;\n       (iii) the authoritative copy is communicated to and \n     maintained by the person asserting control or its designated \n     custodian;\n       (iv) copies or revisions that add or change an identified \n     assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the \n     consent of the person asserting control;\n       (v) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a \n     copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the \n     authoritative copy; and\n       (vi) any revision of the authoritative copy is readily \n     identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.\n       (4) Except as otherwise agreed, a person having control of \n     a transferable record is the holder, as defined in section 1-\n     201(20) of the Uniform Commercial Code, of the transferable \n     record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an \n     equivalent record or writing under the Uniform Commercial \n     Code, including, if the applicable statutory requirements \n     under section 3-302(a), 7-501, or 9-308 of the Uniform \n     Commercial Code are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a \n     holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document \n     of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, \n     respectively. Delivery, possession, and endorsement are not \n     required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this \n     subsection.\n       (5) Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a \n     transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an \n     equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under \n     the Uniform Commercial Code.\n       (6) If requested by a person against which enforcement is \n     sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record \n     shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control \n     of the transferable record. Proof may include access to the \n     authoritative copy of the transferable record and related \n     business records sufficient to review the terms of the \n     transferable record and to establish the identity of the \n     person having control of the transferable record.\n       (g) Electronic Agents.--A contract relating to a commercial \n     transaction affecting interstate commerce may not be denied \n     legal effect solely because its formation involved--\n       (1) the interaction of electronic agents of the parties; or\n       (2) the interaction of an electronic agent of a party and \n     an individual who acts on that individual's own behalf or for \n     another person.\n       (h) Specific Exclusions.--The provisions of this section \n     shall not apply to a statute, regulation, or other rule of \n     law governing any of the following:\n       (1) The Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in a state, \n     other than sections 1-107 and 1-206, Article 2, and Article \n     2A.\n\n[[Page S13105]]\n\n       (2) The creation or execution of wills, codicils, or \n     testamentary trusts.\n       (3) Premarital agreements, marriage, adoption, divorce or \n     other matters of family law.\n       (4) Court orders or notices, or documents used in court \n     proceedings.\n       (5) Documents of title which are filed of record with a \n     governmental unit until such time that a state or subdivision \n     thereof chooses to accept filings electronically.\n       (6) Residential landlord-tenant relationships.\n       (7) The Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act.\n       (i) Insurance.--It is the specific intent of the Congress \n     that the benefits of this title apply to the business of \n     insurance. This section applies to any Federal and State law \n     and regulation governing the business of insurance that \n     requires manual signatures or communications to be printed or \n     in writing, document delivery, and retention.\n       (j) Application in UETA States.--This section does not \n     preempt the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect \n     in a State, if that Act, as in effect in that State, is not \n     inconsistent, in any significant manner, with the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n     SECTION 6. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE USE OF ELECTRONIC \n                   SIGNATURES IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS.\n\n       To the extent practicable, the Federal Government shall \n     observe the following principles in an international context \n     to enable commercial electronic transaction:\n       (1) Remove paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions \n     by adopting relevant principles from the Model Law on \n     Electronic Commerce adopted in 1996 by the United Nations \n     Commission on International Trade Law.\n       (2) Permit parties to a transaction to determine the \n     appropriate authentication technologies and implementation \n     models for their transactions, with assurance that those \n     technologies and implementation models will be recognized and \n     enforced.\n       (3) Permit parties to a transaction to have the opportunity \n     to prove in court or other proceedings that their \n     authentication approaches and their transactions are valid.\n       (4) Take a non-discriminatory approach to electronic \n     signatures and authentication methods from other \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SECTION 7. STUDY OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO \n                   ELECTRONIC COMMERCE.\n\n       (a) Barriers.--Each Federal agency shall, not later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, provide a \n     report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     and the Secretary of Commerce identifying any provision of \n     law administered by such agency, or any regulations issued by \n     such agency and in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that may impose a barrier to electronic transactions, or \n     otherwise to the conduct of commerce online or be electronic \n     means. Such barriers include, but are not limited to, \n     barriers imposed by a law or regulation directly or \n     indirectly requiring that signatures, or records of \n     transactions, be accomplished or retained in other than \n     electronic form. In its report, each agency that shall \n     identify the barriers among those identified whose removal \n     would require legislative action, and shall indicate agency \n     plans to undertake regulatory action to remove such barriers \n     among those identified as are caused by regulations issued by \n     the agency.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, shall, within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and after the consultation required by \n     subsection (c) of this section, report to the Congress \n     concerning--\n       (1) legislation needed to remove barriers to electronic \n     transactions or otherwise to the conduct of commerce online \n     or by electronic means; and\n       (2) actions being taken by the Executive Branch and \n     individual Federal agencies to remove such barriers as are \n     caused by agency regulations or policies.\n       (c) Consultation.--In preparing the report required by this \n     section, the Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the \n     General Services Administration, the National Archives and \n     Records Administration, and the Attorney General concerning \n     matters involving the authenticity of records, their storage \n     and retention, and their usability for law enforcement \n     purposes.\n       (d) Include Findings If No Recommendations.--If the report \n     required by this section omits recommendations for actions \n     needed to fully remove identified barriers to electronic \n     transactions or to online or electronic commerce, it shall \n     include a finding or findings, including substantial reasons \n     therefor, that such removal is impracticable or would be \n     inconsistent with the implementation or enforcement of \n     applicable laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13105-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe life of Thomas Bureau McDonald who died as a result of a tragic car \naccident on October 9, 1999 in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of \n35. His parents, family, and friends have lost a very special person. \nNew Mexico has lost a young and dedicated public servant whose passion \nwas working with college students, strengthening and expanding higher \neducation, and stressing the importance of attending college.\n  Tom was a rising star among those interested in public service in New \nMexico. He will be missed for his cheerful personality, his keen sense \nof humor, his political savvy, and his devotion to empowering students \nat the university and state level when it came to their education. Tom \nwas never concerned with how much he could accomplish or who he could \ninfluence but, rather how he could live his life so when he was no \nlonger serving in his appointed or elected capacities his ideas, \ndreams, and goals would be a reality. That reality was for children and \ntheir families living throughout New Mexico to have the opportunities \nin place to attend college to better themselves and to better their \ncommunity. In life there are individuals who are concerned about being \nremembered for what they have done or still can do; Tom's only concern \nwas being remembered for who he was--an outspoken leader on higher \neducation and its students, a good son to his parents, a loving \ngrandson to his grandmothers, and a trustworthy and loyal individual to \nhis friends.\n  Tom attended the University of New Mexico and graduated from Western \nNew Mexico University in Silver City, New Mexico where I grew up as a \nchild. During his years at Western, Tom was elected by his peers not \njust once but twice to serve as their student body president (1990-\n1992). It was during this time that he eloquently presented a plan to \nthe Board of Regents to build a new $3.5 million Student Union Building \nutilizing only student fees. Tom was fortunate to go back a few years \nago to the dedication of this new building. While at the dedication \nceremony he realized that what started as a vision, a risk, a \nchallenge, turned into structure of unity where students, \nadministrators, and community members could learn, work and just be \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, from 1990 to 1992 Tom was appointed to two one year \nterms as the student member on the Governor's Commission on Higher \nEducation by former Governor Bruce King. During his tenure, Tom \ntransformed the way members of the Commission viewed student \nparticipation and input on higher education. Through his optimism, \ndetermination, and presence he created an identity for students around \nthe state who were concerned about the quality of their education. That \nidentity which Tom helped form not only exists before the Commission \ntoday, but before the State Legislature and Office of the Governor.\n  From 1992 to 1993 Tom was elected by student representatives from New\n\n[[Page S13106]]\n\nMexico's two-year and four-year institutions as executive director of \nthe Associated Students of New Mexico (ASNM). ASNM is a non-profit \nstudent organization that represents the interests of 100,000 students \nmembers enrolled in two-year and four-year institutions of higher \nlearning before the New Mexico Commission on Higher Education, State \nLegislature and Office of the Governor. This organization has brought \nforth some of New Mexico's current and former state legislators, county \ncommissioners, and public servants. Two of my current Washington DC \nstaffers and one of my state staffers are former executive directors of \nthis association. While serving as executive director, Tom always \nencouraged those he met to reach for their goals, pursue their dreams, \nand turn any rejection into motivation. He believed that what one does \nnow to enhance their life will impact others in the future. He lived \nwhat he preached and what he did to enhance his life has left a lasting \nimpact for students and their education throughout New Mexico.\n  Tom received his Masters of Criminal Justice from New Mexico State \nUniversity in 1996. He was also appointed by Governor Gary Johnson to \nserve a two-year term from 1994-1996 as the first voting student regent \nin the history of New Mexico State University. One year later in 1997, \nhe was appointed by Governor Johnson to serve a full six-year term on \nthe New Mexico Commission on Higher Education where he served until the \ntime of his death.\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend my condolences to his parents \nClyde and Eileen and the entire McDonald family. I ask that my \ncolleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the achievements and \ncontributions in the life of this young and outstanding New \nMexican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13106-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MENTOR A CHILD WEEK\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \nefforts of those working to make a difference in the lives of today's \nyouth. The last week in October is ``Mentor a Child Week'' in my home \nState of Oklahoma. I encourage all of us to participate.\n  Big Brothers, Big Sisters is an organization whose mission is to make \na positive difference in the lives of children and youth. Focusing on \nthe challenges single parents face, this organization provides \nprofessionally supportive one-to-one relationships with a positive and \ncaring adult volunteer, and assists these children in achieving their \ngreatest potential as they grow to become responsible citizens in the \ncommunity.\n  Children with mentors are 46 percent less likely to use illegal \ndrugs, 27 percent less likely to use alcohol, and 52 percent less \nlikely to skip school. Youth with mentors have better relationships \nwith their peers and family members.\n  I encourage all citizens, parents, governmental agencies, public and \nprivate institutions, businesses and schools to support efforts that \nwill promote the mentoring of children and youth throughout our \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13106-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WOMEN'S BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nWomen's Business Development Center in their efforts to help female \nentrepreneurs establish their niche in the corporate world. The WBDC \nhelps train and provide technical assistance to entrepreneurial women. \nThese are the same women who own your neighborhood dry cleaner, run \nyour child care center, and assist with your taxes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call special attention to the women \nwho have dedicated their time expanding child-care availability in \nIllinois. The WBDC sponsors the Child Care Business Initiative (CCBI) \nin cooperation with the Hull House Association that will provide \ninformation, resources, and guidance to women seeking entry into this \nimportant and growing industry. Over 250 women have utilized CCBI to \ngain critical business skills and key industry information about child \ncare.\n  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs estimates \nthat over 1,000 child care centers would need to be created to meet the \nprojected demand for child care in Illinois alone. In light of the fact \nthat only 20% of the 162,000 children who are in working families \nreceive full-day, licensed child care, the role that the CCBI plays in \nhelping women establish day care centers may have a significant impact \non the availability and accessibility of child care in Illinois.\n  Again, I would like to take this time to commend the WBDC for \ncreating and expanding opportunities for ambitious, women \nentrepreneurs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13106-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR LEAHY'S 10,000TH VOTE\n\n   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my \ncolleagues, Senator Pat Leahy, who has cast his 10,000th vote. I \ncongratulate him on his tenure in the Senate.\n  Senator Leahy and I have worked together in the past on many \nagricultural issues and legislation as members of the Senate Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Most notably we worked closely \ntogether on two farm bills, both in 1990 when Senator leahy served as \nchairman of the committee and in 1996 when I served as chairman. \nSenator Leahy joined with me in reviewing the organization of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture and developing legislation to streamline its \noperations. We both share an interest in conservation issues and have \nworked together to provide opportunities for farmers to preserve and \nprotect their natural resources.\n  We have both recognized the importance of a bipartisan approach on \nmajor legislation originating in the committee. I value the partnership \nthat we formed to move important agricultural legislation through the \ncommittee and through the Senate.\n  My colleague, Senator Pat Leahy, deserves commendation for his \nservice and tenure in the Senate.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nTPL, Inc. in Albuquerque, NM who is a 1999 Tibbetts Award recipient and \nwill be honored by the U.S. Small Business Administration at a \ncongressional reception on Tuesday, October 26, 1999 here in Washington \nDC.\n  The Fourth Annual Tibbets Award is presented by the Small Business \nAdministration to firms that have attained high levels of success in \nresearch and development under the Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) program and to organizations and individuals who have supported \ntechnological innovation. Moreover, those groups are judged on the \neconomic impact of their technological innovations and overall business \nachievements.\n  I feel that it is fitting that I recognize the 1999 Tibbetts Award \nrecipient TPL, Inc. and its CEO Mr. H.M. (Hap) Stoller for their hard \nwork that has led them to receive this prestigious national award. TPL, \nInc. is a leading contractor for the Army and Navy in the \ndemilitarization of conventional munitions as well as the development \nof economically viable processes for the commercial reuse of recovered \nenergetic materials. TPL, under sponsorship of the Defense Threat \nReduction Agency in the Military Capacitor Program, has developed the \nstate-of-the-art in high energy density dielectric materials for \ncapacitive devices and has begun their manufacture for advance weapons \nsystem programs. The technologies underlying these accomplishments were \ninitiated under the SBIR Program.\n  TPL was recently awarded a $38.4 million sub-contract from General \nDynamics Ordnance Systems as part of their five-year, $145 million \noperational demilitarization contract from the U.S. Army's Industrial \nOperations Command. TPL will be totally responsible for three out of \nnine families of conventional munitions contained in the largest \ndemilitarization program ever funded by the Army. Concurrently, through \nthe Tri-Services Demilitarization Technology Office, the Navy is \nsupporting three Phase III efforts to transition energetic materials \nresource recovery and reuse processes to pilot plant facilities, such \nprocesses designed to lower the cost of demilitarization activities as \nwell as protect the environment by allowing demilitarization material \nreuse. These contracts reinforce TPL's position as an\n\n[[Page S13107]]\n\ninnovator in demilitarization processes, an activity that is essential \nin the rapidly changing international system. Additionally, the work \nassociated with these contracts will be performed at Fort Wingate, New \nMexico, bringing critically needed jobs to one of the more \ndisadvantaged parts of the State.\n  Mr. President, as you can see TPL, Inc. reflects the very best in \nSBIR achievement and has established itself as a strong national leader \nin technological innovation. In addition, TPL, Inc. was recognized in \n1997 as one of the fastest growing technology companies in the State of \nNew Mexico and in 1995, and again in 1996, was recognized as one of the \nfastest growing, privately held companies in the United States. Again, \nlet me congratulate TPL, Inc. and its staff of their hard work, \ndedication, and commitment. They are a tremendous asset to their \ncommunity and New Mexico, and we are extremely proud of their \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13107-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1999\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I just returned. I was down-State when I \nheard the news of John Chafee's passing. I felt compelled to come to \nthe floor for just a very brief minute and say that, in my judgment, \nJohn Chafee was as decent a human being as any individual I have \nencountered in public service.\n  He was a personal friend during the time he was here in Washington. \nWe happened to attend the same church in northern Virginia. We happened \nto have worn the same uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps in service to \nour country. But most of the time I spent with John Chafee was right \nhere in the Capitol frequently in his hideaway. I spent more time in \nthat particular hideaway than I did in my own office, or any other \nSenator's hideaway in the Capitol, meeting with a bipartisan group of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle trying to make the system work.\n  John Chafee was an extraordinary human being in many ways. But he \nunderstood the need for bipartisanship if this institution were to \naccomplish the goals which the American people expect us to accomplish. \nAnd it was always at the call of John Chafee that we would gather and \ntry to see if we couldn't find some common ground upon which the Senate \ncould at least offer an alternative to the occasional gridlock into \nwhich we have occasionally found ourselves forced by the process or \nother agendas.\n  It was never with any rancor that he disagreed with anyone, whether \nit be someone on his own side of the aisle or someone on this side of \nthe aisle. He was always a voice of reason, always a voice of \nbipartisanship, always someone wanting to make the system work and \ncommitted to the goals for which he was elected to this particular \ninstitution by the people of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I have no prepared remarks. I could not pass up this \nopportunity to express my own profound sense of loss of someone who was \nfar more special, I suspect, to this institution than many of those who \ndo not or have not had the privilege of serving in it may realize, and \nwhose loss we may feel in ways that many of its Members have not fully \ncome to grips with at this particular point.\n  John Chafee was one of those extraordinary individuals with whom I \nwas very proud to serve and call a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/25/senate-section/article/S13107-6", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
