SCOTT BATES, LEGISLATIVE CLERK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, our Senate family grieves today and our \nhearts are heavy as a result of the tragic loss of Scott Bates. \nSenators come and Senators go, but Scott has been a fixture in this \ngreat Chamber for 30 years and the last 8 years as our legislative \nclerk. His familiar voice was a pillar of our continuity and tradition. \nHe was not just a coworker; he was a friend, really a great guy. Even \nas we conduct our business today, we will be grieving, but those who \nknew him well know that that is exactly what he would want us to do, to \ncontinue with the work of the Senate to which he devoted his life. He \nwas an example of public service at its finest, never claiming the \nspotlight, never seeking a headline, but always working for the good of \nthis institution and for the country we are here to serve.\n  We pray for the recovery of his wife, Ricki. We ask that the Lord \nkeep her and their three children always in His care. Before I ask for \na moment of silence by the Senate, I yield to Senator Daschle for his \ncomments.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader. I thank our Chaplain for \nhis gracious prayer.\n  The presence of Scott Bates in that chair and in our lives is \nsomething most of us have counted on each and every day. As the \nmajority leader so eloquently said, he, Scott, served the Senate, our \ncountry, and each of us so admirably for the last 30 years. Who can \nforget that resonant voice? Who can forget the call of the roll? Who \ncan forget the authority with which he articulated each of our names? \nThe answer is--no one.\n  When Scott began his service, Senator Mansfield was the majority \nleader and Senator Hugh Scott the minority leader. Ever since that \ntime, Scott was\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\nan integral part of the history created in this Chamber and certainly \nan integral part of our Senate family. He grew up with small town \nvalues, active in his church and Boy Scouts. He loved politics and \nschool and served as a page in both the House and the Senate in the \nArkansas Legislature. Scott's love of politics came naturally for him. \nHis father actually served as a member of the Arkansas State \nLegislature. In 1970 he came here as a summer intern for Senator John \nMcClellan, in the bill clerk's office, and began his work for us in \n1973.\n  Today, we send our thoughts and our prayers to his wife, Ricki, who \nremains in the hospital, and to their three children, Lisa, Lori, and \nPaul, and his family in Arkansas, who are now dealing with this tragic \nloss.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I now ask that all Senators rise and \nlet's observe a moment of silence for our friend, Scott Bates.\n  (Moment of silence, Senators rising.)\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1289-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1290-S1318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIAL OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, under the order for today there will be \na 6-hour presentation equally divided between the House managers and \nthe White House counsel. It would be our intention to have a break \naround noon so we will have an opportunity for lunch, and also it may \nbe necessary to have one break, a brief break, before that time.\n  Following today's presentation, the Senate will adjourn over until 1 \np.m. on Monday.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of the \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the order of February 1, 1999, the \nmanagers on the part of the House of Representatives and the counsel \nfor the President each have 3 hours to make their presentation. The \nChair recognizes Mr. Manager Rogan to begin the presentation on the \npart of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel for the \nPresident, Members of the United States Senate, this is the first and \nonly chance you will have in this historic impeachment trial to \nconsider the evidence from a few of the actual witnesses. After weeks \nof proceedings, the day has finally arrived when the U.S. Senate will \nlisten, not just to lawyers talk about the evidence, but to witnesses \nwith direct knowledge of the unlawful conduct of the President of the \nUnited States.\n\n  Today in particular, you will have your only opportunity to hear from \nthe one person whose testimony invariably leads to the conclusion that \nthe President of the United States committed perjury and obstructed \njustice in a Federal civil rights action. That person is Monica \nLewinsky, a bright lady whose life has forever been marked by the most \npowerful man on the Earth.\n  If her testimony is truthful, then the President committed the \noffenses alleged in the articles of impeachment. Many different \nopinions have been formed about her over the last year. Nearly all of \nthis has been fueled by spin and by propaganda rather than by truth. \nToday, the analysis and the speculation ends. There is only one \njudgment the Senate must make for history about Monica Lewinsky: Do you \nbelieve her?\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       SENATOR DeWINE. Do you, Monica S. Lewinsky, swear or affirm \n     that the evidence you shall give in the case now pending \n     between the United States and William Jefferson Clinton, \n     President of the United States, shall be the truth, the whole \n     truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n       THE WITNESS. I do.\n       SENATOR DeWINE. The House managers may now begin your \n     questioning.\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Who is this former intern who swore under oath to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Monica \nLewinsky is an intelligent, articulate young woman who, until recently, \nheld untarnished hope for tomorrow, like any other recent college \ngraduate. That hope was drastically altered when she was subpoenaed in \na lawsuit against the President of the United States.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       But for the record, would you state your name once again, \n     your full name?\n       A Yes. Monica Samille Lewinsky.\n       Q And you're a--are you a resident of California?\n       A I'm--I'm not sure exactly where I'm a resident now, but \n     I--that's where I'm living right now.\n       Q Okay. You--did you grow up there in California?\n       A Yes.\n       Q I'm not going to go into all that, but I thought just a \n     little bit of background here.\n       You went to college where?\n       A Lewis and Clark, in Portland, Oregon.\n       Q And you majored in--majored in?\n       A Psychology.\n       Q Tell me about your work history, briefly, from the time \n     you left college until, let's say, you started as an intern \n     at the White House.\n       A Uh, I wasn't working from the time I--\n       Q Okay. Did you--\n       A I graduated college in May of '95.\n       Q Did you work part time there in--in Oregon with a--with a \n     District Attorney--\n       A Uh--\n       Q --in his office somewhere?\n       A During--I had an internship or a practicum when I was in \n     school. I had two practicums, and one was at the public \n     defender's office and the other was at the Southeast Mental \n     Health Network.\n       Q And those were in Portland?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Okay. What--you received a bachelor of science in \n     psychology?\n       A Correct.\n       Q Okay. As a part of your duties at the Southeast Health \n     Network, what did you--what did you do in terms of working? \n     Did you have direct contact with people there, patients?\n       A Yes, I did. Um, they referred to them as clients there \n     and I worked in what was called the Phoenix Club, which was a \n     socialization area for the clients to--really to just hang \n     out and, um, sort of work on their social skills. So I--\n       Q Okay. After your work there, you obviously had occasion \n     to come to work at the White House. How did--how did you come \n     to decide you wanted to come to Washington, and in particular \n     work at the White House?\n       A There were a few different factors. My mom's side of the \n     family had moved to Washington during my senior year of \n     college and I wanted--I wasn't ready to go to graduate school \n     yet. So I wanted to get out of Portland, and a friend of our \n     family's had a grandson who had had an internship at the \n     White House and had thought it might be something I'd enjoy \n     doing.\n       Q Had you ever worked around--in politics and campaigns or \n     been very active?\n       A No.\n       Q You had to go through the normal application process of \n     submitting a written application, references, and so forth \n     to--to the White House?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Did you do that while you were still in Oregon, or were \n     you already in D.C.?\n       A No. The application process was while I was a senior in \n     college in Oregon.\n       Q Had you ever been to Washington before?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Obviously, you were accepted, and you started work when?\n       A July 10th, 1995.\n  That image, the image of a young woman, very much like a family \nmember or a friend that we might know, is an image that the President \ndid not want America to see when his indiscretions with her became \npublic. When that happened, the President painted Monica Lewinsky in a \nvery different and callous light.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON: But I want to say one thing to \n     the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to \n     say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that \n     woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a \n     single time, never. These allegations are false, and I need \n     to go back to work for the American people. Thank you.\n\n  ``That woman'' with that subtle description, the President invited a \nwaiting America to adopt a totally false impression of Monica Lewinsky. \nThat was not fair. Yet, with his close aides, aides that he later \ntestified he knew would be witnesses before the grand jury, he went \nmuch further than a subtle sneer. Hear the words of Sidney Blumenthal, \nassistant to the President, recount how the President painted this \nvulnerable young intern who made the tragic mistake of becoming \ninvolved with him.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did the President then give you his account of what \n     happened between him and Monica Lewinsky?\n       A As I recall, he did.\n       Q What did the President tell you?\n       A He, uh--he spoke, uh, fairly rapidly, as I recall, at \n     that point and said that she had come on to him and made a \n     demand for sex, that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, \n     and that she, uh, threatened him. And, uh, he said that she \n     said to him, uh, that she was\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\n     called ``the stalker'' by her peers and that she hated the \n     term, and that she would claim that they had had an affair \n     whether they had or they hadn't, and that she would tell \n     people.\n       Q Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica \n     Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't \n     be known by her peers as ``the stalker'' anymore?\n       A Yes, that's right.\n       Q Do you remember the President also saying that--and I'm \n     quoting--``I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain \n     for a lot of people. I'm not going to do that again''?\n       A Yes. He told me that.\n       Q And that was in the same conversation that you had with \n     the President?\n       A Right, in--in that sequence.\n       Q Can you describe for us the President's demeanor when he \n     shared this information with you?\n       A Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was, a man in \n     anguish.\n\n  He was a man in anguish. This was more than rakish behavior. When the \nPresident used his aides as a conduit to impart false information to a \nFederal grand jury in a criminal investigation, his behavior graduated \nfrom the unconscionable to the illegal.\n  Members of the Senate, your task is to determine who is telling the \ntruth and who is lying. As you weigh that option, consider Mr. \nBlumenthal's conclusion drawn on the very subject.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q That's where you start talking about the story that the \n     President told you. Knowing what you know now, do you believe \n     the President lied to you about his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       A I do.\n  To justify a vote of not guilty for the President, you certainly have \nthe right to reject Monica Lewinsky's testimony as untruthful. However, \nI trust your sense of fairness will dictate that you will listen to all \nof her testimony before you dismiss it outright. If you believe her, \nyou will see this morning how the President wove the web of perjury and \nobstruction of justice. You will see why he was impeached by the House \nof Representatives, and you will see why a just and proper verdict in \nthis body would be to replace him as President with Vice President Al \nGore.\n  Consider, for example, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony regarding witness \ntampering, one element of the obstruction of justice charge against the \nPresident. The President stands charged with illegally encouraging a \nwitness in a Federal civil rights suit brought against him to give \nperjured testimony in that proceeding. Did he do this? Listen to Monica \nLewinsky.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       We're at that point that we've got a telephone conversation \n     in the morning with you and the President, and he has among \n     other things mentioned to you that your name is on the Jones \n     witness list. He has also mentioned to you that perhaps you \n     could file an affidavit to avoid possible testifying in that \n     case. Is that right?\n       A Correct.\n       Q And he has also, I think, now at the point that we were \n     in our questioning, referenced the cover story that you and \n     he had had, that perhaps you could say that you were coming \n     to my office to deliver papers or to see Betty Currie; is \n     that right?\n       A Correct. It was from the entire relationship, that story.\n       Q Now, when he alluded to that cover story, was that \n     instantly familiar to you?\n       A Yes.\n       Q You knew what he was talking about?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And why was this familiar to you?\n       A Because it was part of the pattern of the relationship.\n  It was part of the pattern of the relationship. During Ms. Lewinsky's \ntestimony earlier this week under oath pursuant to a Senate deposition \norder, she further elaborated on this critical piece of evidence.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of--I \n     would draw your attention to the cover stories. I have \n     alluded to that earlier, but, uh, did you talk about cover \n     story that night?\n       A Yes, sir.\n       Q And what was said?\n       A Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something--you \n     can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing me \n     papers.\n       Q I think you've testified that you're sure he said that \n     that night. You are sure he said that that night?\n       A Yes.\n\n  Consider also Ms. Lewinsky's testimony regarding concealing \nsubpoenaed evidence; namely, the gifts he gave her. This is yet another \nelement in the obstruction of justice allegation against the President. \nThe President stands charged with corruptly engaging in a scheme to \nconceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights \naction brought against him. Did he do this? Remember, on the morning of \nDecember 28, 1997, a few days after Ms. Lewinsky received a subpoena \ndirecting her to turn over any gifts she had received from the \nPresident, the President met with Ms. Lewinsky. She suggested to him \nthat she could give the gifts he gave her to Betty Currie, the \nPresident's personal secretary. The President said that he would think \nabout it. Listen to what Monica Lewinsky said happened next.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Did you later that day receive a call from Betty Currie?\n       A Yes, I did.\n       Q Tell us about that.\n       A I received a call from--Betty, and to the best of my \n     memory, she said something like I understand you have \n     something for me or I know--I know I've testified to saying \n     that--that I remember her saying either I know you have \n     something for me or the President said you have something for \n     me. And to me, it's a--she said--I mean, this is not a direct \n     quote, but the gist of the conversation was that she was \n     going to go visit her mom in the hospital and she'd stop by \n     and get whatever it was.\n       Q Did you question Ms. Currie or ask her, what are you \n     talking about or what do you mean?\n       A No.\n       Q Why didn't you?\n       A Because I assumed that it meant the gifts.\n\n  As you can see, the only way Betty Currie would have known to come \nand get the gifts would have been for the President to tell her to do \nso.\n  Finally, consider Ms. Lewinsky's testimony regarding the President's \nhelp in securing a New York job for her to encourage her silence, which \nis another element of the obstruction of justice charge against him. \nThe President is charged with chasing a job for her in order to prevent \nher truthful testimony. Did he do this? Remember that the President \nlearned on December 6, 1997, that Ms. Lewinsky was on the Paula Jones \nwitness list.\n  Listen to Monica Lewinsky.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Okay. Between your meeting with Mr. Jordan in early \n     November, and December the 11th when you met with Mr. Jordan \n     again, you did not feel that Mr. Jordan was doing much to \n     help you get a job; is that correct?\n       A I hadn't seen any progress.\n       Q Okay. After you met with Mr. Jordan in early December, \n     you began to interview in New York and were much more active \n     in your job search; correct?\n       A Yes.\n       Q In early January, you received a job offer from Revlon \n     with the help of Vernon Jordan; is that correct?\n       A Yes.\n\n  Members of the Senate, these are but a few highlights of a broad \ntapestry of corruption that Mr. Manager Hutchinson and I will develop \nfor you this morning through videotape testimony and through other \nevidence.\n  Before we proceed to that, it is worth briefly recounting the \ncircumstances that elevated the President's initial indiscretions to \nthe level of impeachable offenses. The lesson is not complex. It is \nquite elementary.\n  In all the things we do in life, life is about making choices. \nParents teach children that bad choices bring sorrow and consequences. \nWe do that because the failure to impose meaningful consequences for \nbad choices brings about more bad choices. That simple primer on life \nencapsulates the political and personal legacy of Bill Clinton, his \ncontinuing pattern of indulging all choices and accepting no \nconsequences. This is demonstrated by the actions he took leading to \nhis impeachment and trial before the Senate.\n  In May 1991, an incident allegedly occurred that led the President to \nmake a bad choice. According to Paula Jones, a subordinate government \nemployee, then-Governor Clinton made a crude and unwelcome sexual \nadvance on her. She later filed a legal claim for sexual harassment \nagainst him.\n  In November 1995, the President made another bad choice. He began a \nphysical relationship with a 22-year-old White House intern. He chose \nto begin a physical relationship with her. This was not, as he told the \ngrand jury, a relationship that began as a friendship only to later \nblossom into intimacy. The President impulsively began using her for \nhis gratification the very day he first spoke with her. Later, he made \nthe bad choice of continuing the relationship after Monica became a \npaid Government employee.\n  An important note. As regrettable as his choice was here, any \naccountability\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nfor the private aspect of this should not be determined by the Congress \nof the United States. It should be determined by his family. Had the \nPresident's bad choice simply ended with this indiscretion, we would \nnot be here today. Adultery may be a lot of things, but it is not an \nimpeachable offense.\n  Unfortunately, the President's bad choices only grew worse. In \nDecember 1997, the President made a bad choice. In order to avoid any \npossible legal accountability to Paula Jones, he chose to destroy her \nlawful right to proceed with her case. And this is how he did it: \nDuring the so-called discovery portion of the Paula Jones case, Federal \nJudge Susan Wright ordered the President to answer questions under oath \nabout any intimate relationship he may have had with subordinate female \ngovernment employees while he was Governor or President.\n  Why did Judge Susan Wright order him to answer these questions? She \ndid it because sexual harassers in the workplace usually do not commit \ntheir offenses in the open. Typically they get their victims alone and \nisolated. Predators know if they can do this, one of two things \ngenerally will happen. Out of fear and intimidation the victim will \nsubmit, or out of fear and intimidation the victim will not submit but \nthe victim will not tell anybody about it.\n  There usually is no other way for a sexual harassment victim to learn \nif there is evidence of a pattern of similar conduct by a predator \nwithout being able to ask these kinds of questions in a sexual \nharassment case. Without this information, a harassment victim in the \nworkplace generally would not be able to prove her case. This is why \ncourts routinely order defendants to answer these kinds of questions in \nalmost every sexual harassment case in the country.\n\n  Now, President Clinton vigorously pursued legal arguments and motions \nto avoid answering these questions about his sexual relations with \nsubordinate government employees. Yet, after hearing his arguments, \nJudge Susan Wright ordered the President to answer under oath these \nroutine questions. And by the way, Paula Jones also was required to \nprovide truthful answers under oath as part of the trial of the \ndiscovery process. Had Paula Jones lied in providing such answers, she \nwould have been liable for criminal prosecution.\n  It was while the Paula Jones case was proceeding in the summer of \n1995, that a 22-year-old named Monica Lewinsky went to work as an \nintern at the White House. Shortly thereafter, in November 1995, the \nPresident began his physical relationship with Monica Lewinsky. And \nthis continued from 1995 until the early part of 1997.\n  In order to shield him, Monica Lewinsky promised the President that \nshe would always deny the sexual nature of their relationship. She said \nshe would always protect him. The President spoke words of approval and \nencouragement to this pledge of secrecy. Monica and the President even \nagreed to cover stories to disguise the true nature of their \nrelationship.\n  In April 1996, Monica was transferred, against her will, from the \nWhite House job to a job at the Pentagon. After she left employment at \nthe White House, she frequently returned there to continue her secret \nrelationship with the President under the guise of visiting Betty \nCurrie, the President's personal secretary.\n  After working at the Pentagon for over a year, Monica became \ndisheartened. Despite the President's promises to the contrary, Monica \nwas not returned to work at the White House. In July 1997, she began \nlooking for a job in New York. She wasn't having any luck, despite the \nPresident's promise to help her with this, too. By early November 1997, \nMonica became frustrated with the lack of assistance.\n  Finally, Betty Currie arranged a meeting for Monica with Vernon \nJordan, one of the President's closest friends. They sought to enlist \nhis help in her New York job search. On November 5, 1997, Monica met \nfor 20 minutes with Mr. Jordan in his office. No job referrals \nfollowed, no job interviews were arranged, and there were no contacts \nfrom Mr. Jordan. In short, Mr. Jordan made no effort to find Monica a \njob. Indeed, getting her a job was so unimportant to him that Mr. \nJordan later testified that he didn't even remember meeting her on \nNovember 5.\n  Nothing happened on her job search through the month of November, \nbecause Mr. Jordan was either gone or he simply wasn't returning \nMonica's phone calls. All that changed on December 5, 1997. That was \nthe day Monica Lewinsky's name appeared on the Paula Jones witness \nlist.\n  Members of the Senate, this is how the whole thing started. A lone \nwoman in Arkansas felt that she had been wronged by the President of \nthe United States. The law said that she had a right to have her claim \nheard in a court of law. At each stage the President could have chosen \nto uphold the law. Instead, he chose to obstruct justice and to commit \nperjury.\n  In his presentation, Mr. Manager Hutchinson will show you, through \nvideotape words of the key witnesses, how the President used his \nposition to obstruct justice as set forth in the articles of \nimpeachment. I will then return to make the same showing respecting the \nallegations of perjury in the articles. Throughout all of this, \nthroughout this presentation, it is important to keep in mind that we \nseek no congressional punishment for a man who chose to cheat on his \nwife. However, we have a legal obligation to expect constitutional \naccountability for a President who chooses to cheat the law.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I want to continue the \npresentation that was commenced this morning by Mr. Rogan. Let me \ncontinue with the path of obstruction. The obstruction, for our \npurposes, began on December 5, 1997, when the witness list came out in \nthe civil rights case. It was faxed to the President's lawyers. It was \nlater given to the President.\n  At that point, the administration of justice became a threat to the \nPresident of the United States. He determined that the truth would be \nharmful to the case that he was trying to defend, and the President \nmade a decision to take whatever steps were necessary to suppress the \ntruth rather than to uphold the law. The acts of obstruction included \nattempts to improperly influence the testimony of witnesses in the case \nagainst him, the procurement of a false affidavit in the case, the \nwillful concealment of evidence that was under subpoena, and efforts to \nillegally influence the testimony of witnesses before the Federal grand \njury.\n  You have heard these areas of obstruction presented to you before by \nmanagers on behalf of the House. Today it is important that you hear \nthis case from those who have testified by deposition at your \ndirection. And as you hear their testimony, you will see that the \nPresident may have been the only individual who had the complete \npicture. He had all the facts, and he did not always share those facts \nwith others. He did not share those facts with Mr. Vernon Jordan, nor \ndid he share all the facts with Ms. Monica Lewinsky, until he \ndetermined the time was right to do so.\n  For example, he knows that Ms. Lewinsky is a witness but does not \ntell Ms. Lewinsky that fact until the time is right and whenever the \njob search is proceeding. He asks Mr. Jordan to help Ms. Lewinsky to \nget a job, but he does not tell Mr. Jordan the essential facts, first \nof all, that Ms. Lewinsky is a witness and, secondly, that there is a \ndangerous relationship between them in which, if she testified, her \ntestimony would be harmful.\n  The President was obviously concerned about the truth of the \ntestimony of Ms. Lewinsky. It would have been harmful to his interests \nin the case. As a result, the President personally obstructed and \ndirected the efforts of Mr. Jordan to secure Ms. Lewinsky a job and \nurge the filing of the affidavit. Now, what is the President's defense \nto this charge? Let's listen.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Was your assistance to Ms. Lewinsky which you have \n     described in any way dependent upon her doing anything \n     whatsoever in the Paula Jones case?\n       A. No.\n\n  Now, you have heard that before. As you can see, Mr. Jordan defends \nhis actions and, by implication, defends the actions of the President. \nYou can weigh his intentions, but his intentions are not the issue, \nbecause regardless of your view of Mr. Jordan and his motivations, they \nare irrelevant. His view as to whether there is a connection between \nthe job and the testimony is not\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\nan issue. It is not an issue as to whether Ms. Lewinsky thought there \nwas a connection between the job and the testimony. It is not an issue \nas to whether Revlon thought there was a connection between the job and \nthe testimony.\n  There is only one issue, and that is whether the President viewed \nthat there was a connection between those two. And it is the President \nwho, under the law, had to have the corrupt intent, and that is the \nquestion that you have to answer. And I believe that the evidence will \nshow that regardless of what anyone else believed, he knew the direct \nconnection.\n  Now, after each of you hears the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. \nJordan, some of you will conclude that surely he had to know that there \nwas an inappropriate relationship between the President and Ms. \nLewinsky. And why do I say that? Well, Ms. Lewinsky will testify that \nhe made it clear--that she made it clear to Mr. Jordan that there was \nthat type of relationship. At first, she sort of is careful about it, \nbut then she just ultimately tells him, as you will see from her \ntestimony. But Mr. Jordan also, for those who have listened to his \ntestimony, refers to mother wit, and his oft relied upon mother wit \nwould have told him as well, under the circumstances, that there is \nsomething more going on.\n  If he knew about the relationship, he had to know that all was not as \nit should be in what the President was asking him to do. The President \nrequested a job for Ms. Lewinsky at the same time he was monitoring the \nfiling of a false affidavit and knowing she was a witness in a case \nagainst him: All indicated that the job was not a favor for a young \nfriend but it was a favor for someone in high office that had to be \naccomplished in order to assure the cooperation of a dangerous witness. \nThat evidence will show that it is the President who suggested the \nassistance from Ms. Lewinsky and it is the President who suggested the \nfalse affidavit.\n  Now, let's listen to the testimony, step by step, through the job \nsearch, through the signing of the false affidavit, to the \nencouragement to file the false affidavit on December 17, to the \ndiscussion of the gifts on December 28, through the tampering with the \ntestimony of Betty Currie on two occasions, and then with the \nPresident's aide when they were called before the Federal grand jury, \nor prior to that.\n  First, let's go to the job benefit to Ms. Lewinsky. How involved was \nthe President in this activity? Let's first listen to the President as \nto what he said when he testified under oath in his deposition.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Do you know a man named Vernon Jordan?\n       A I know him well.\n       Q You have known him for a long time?\n       A A long time.\n       Q Has it ever been reported to you that he met with Monica \n     Lewinsky and talked about this case?\n       A I knew that he met with her. I think Betty suggested he \n     met with her and she may have met with her. I thought that he \n     talked with her about something else. I thought he had given \n     her some advice about her move to New York. It seems like \n     that is what Betty said.\n\n  Rather vague. Attributes all of his knowledge about Vernon Jordan, in \nreference to Ms. Lewinsky, to Betty, to Betty.\n  Let's go on and hear more of what the President has to say in this \nconnection.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Have you ever had a conversation with Vernon Jordan in \n     which Monica Lewinsky was mentioned?\n       A I have. He told me that he thought he mentioned in \n     passing to me that he had talked to her and she had come to \n     him for advice about moving to New York.\n       Q She had come to him for advice.\n       A She had come to him for advice about moving to New York. \n     She had called him and asked if she could come see him, and \n     Betty, I think, maybe had said something to him about talking \n     to him and he had given her some advice about moving to New \n     York.\n       That's all I know about that.\n\n  That is all I know about that--diminished knowledge, diminished \nresponsibility.\n  But let's see what his good friend and confidant, Mr. Jordan, says \nabout what the President knew, when he knew it, and to what extent he \ncontrolled this effort.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Now, is it true that your efforts to find a job for Ms. \n     Lewinsky that you referenced in that meeting with Mr. \n     Gittis--were your efforts carried out at the request of the \n     President of the United States?\n       A There is no question but that through Betty Currie, I was \n     acting on behalf of the President to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. \n     I think that's clear from my grand jury testimony.\n       Q Okay. And I just want to make sure that that's firmly \n     established. And in reference to your previous grand jury \n     testimony, you indicated, I believe, on May 28th, 1998, at \n     page 61, that ``She''--referring to Betty Currie--``was the \n     one that called me at the behest of the President.''\n       A That is correct, and I think, Congressman, if in fact the \n     President of the United States' secretary calls and asks for \n     a request that you try to do the best you can to make it \n     happen.\n       Q And you received that request as a request coming from \n     the President?\n       A I--I interpreted it as a request from the President.\n       Q And then, later on in June of '98 in the grand jury \n     testimony at page 45, did you not reference or testify that \n     ``The President asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job''?\n       A There was no--there was no question but that he asked me \n     to help and that he asked others to help. I think that is \n     clear from everybody's grand jury testimony.\n       Q And just one more point in that regard. In the same grand \n     jury testimony, is it correct that you testified that \n     ``He''--referring to the President--``was the source of it \n     coming to my attention in the first place''?\n       A I may--if that is--if you--if it's in the--\n       Q It's at page 58 of the grand jury--\n       A I stand on my grand jury testimony.\n\n  As Mr. Jordan testified, the President was a source of it coming to \nhis attention in the first place. Mr. Jordan, the President's friend, \ntestified that this was not a casual matter for the President. He was \ninterested, he was directing the show and, as will be clear, he was \nconsumed with preventing the truth from coming out in the civil rights \ncase.\n  But let's start back, for a moment, at the beginning. In the packet \nprovided to you, there is a time line, and you can see again that there \nwas the witness list that came out on December 5. That triggered the \naction in this case. But as we know, there was a meeting on November 5 \nbetween Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan in Mr. Jordan's office. Ms. \nLewinsky wanted a job before the witness list came out, but not a whole \nlot was happening in that regard.\n  Let's look at the testimony of Mr. Jordan in regard to this November \n5 meeting that he was first asked about, which he had no recollection \nabout. When the records were reproduced for him, he had a recollection.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Well, regardless of whether you met with her in November \n     or not, the fact is you did not do anything in November to \n     secure a job for Ms. Lewinsky until your activities on \n     December 11 of '97?\n       A I think that's correct.\n       Q And on December 11, I think you made some calls for Ms. \n     Lewinsky on that particular day?\n       A I believe I did.\n  There will be a pattern developing, as you can see. Mr. Jordan had no \nrecollection of the November 5 meeting when he originally testified \nbefore the grand jury. He had no recollection whatsoever of that \nmeeting. Basically, he said it didn't happen.\n  The second time he testified before the grand jury, the record was \nproduced and it was substantiated. He recalls that. The second thing \nyou can see from this was the meeting was of absolutely no consequence \nto him because this was not a priority issue to him. He was not going \nto do anything. It started happening, of course, when the witness list \ncame out. The President met with the attorneys with the witness list, \nand on December 7 the President and Mr. Jordan meet. On December 8, a \nmeeting is set up by Ms. Lewinsky with Mr. Jordan for the 11th, and it \nwas on the 11th when they met that things started moving and calls were \nbeing made. Of course, that was done at the direction of the President.\n  Look at Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of that same November 5 meeting.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q . . . you did not feel that Mr. Jordan was doing much to \n     help you get a job; is that correct?\n       A I hadn't seen any progress.\n       Q Okay. After you met with Mr. Jordan in early December, \n     you began to interview in New York and were much more active \n     in your job search; correct?\n       A Yes.\n       Q In early January, you received a job offer from Revlon \n     with the help of Vernon Jordan; is that correct?\n       A Yes.\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky, at this point, is at their mercy. She doesn't know what \nthe communication is, she doesn't\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\nknow what the President knows. The witness list has come in, and she \nhoped things were moving, but she doesn't know it. Finally, they start \nmoving after the witness list comes in. On December 11, she has the \nmeeting at which things start moving.\n  Was this a typical referral? Each of you in this body have had \noccasions where friends and acquaintances, at different levels, or \nprevious employees come to you and say: I am going to be applying for a \njob with such and such a company. Will you be a reference for me?\n  Sometimes they ask you to make a call to that company that they are \napplying for a job. This is not a typical referral, as you will see \nfrom the testimony. A few days prior to the December 11 meeting, Ms. \nLewinsky sends up a wish list of the companies she wanted to apply. Mr. \nJordan quickly said, ``I'm not concerned about your wish list. I have \nthe people I want to deal with.'' He took control of the job search.\n  Let's listen to the testimony of Mr. Jordan as he emphasizes that \npoint.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Now, you mentioned that she had sent you a--I guess some \n     people refer to it--a wish list, or a list of jobs that she--\n       A Not jobs--companies.\n       Q --companies that she would be interested in seeking \n     employment with.\n       A That's correct.\n       Q And you looked at that, and you determined that you \n     wanted to go with your own list of friends and companies that \n     you had better contacts with.\n       A I'm sure, Congressman, that you too have been in this \n     business, and you do know that you can only call people that \n     you know or feel comfortable in calling.\n       Q Absolutely. No question about it. And let me just comment \n     and ask your response to this, but many times I will be \n     listed as a reference, and they can take that to any company. \n     You might be listed as a reference and the name ``Vernon \n     Jordan'' would be a good reference anywhere, would it not?\n       A I would hope so.\n       Q And so, even though it was a company that you might not \n     have the best contact with, you could have been helpful in \n     that regard?\n       A Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. \n     Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or \n     listed were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need \n     to call.\n       Q And that is exactly the point, that you looked at getting \n     Ms. Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just \n     something that you were going to be a reference for.\n       A I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment. \n     Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't \n     view it as an assignment. I just view it as something that is \n     part of what I do.\n       Q You're acting in behalf of the President when you are \n     trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of \n     the job search?\n       A Yes.\n\n  The testimony is very clear as to Mr. Jordan running the job search--\nin essence, a job placement on behalf of the President.\n  Let's go again to that meeting of December 11 at which Ms. Lewinsky \ngoes, for the first time Mr. Jordan remembers, for that meeting about \nthe jobs. Ms. Lewinsky's view of this meeting--again, Jordan's list--he \nwas the one controlling the job search. Also, you will see that Mr. \nJordan acquires some knowledge from Ms. Lewinsky as to the \nrelationship.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Let's go forward another week or so to December the 11th \n     and a lunch that you had with Vernon Jordan, I believe, in \n     his office.\n       A Yes.\n       Q How did--how was that meeting set up.\n       A Through his secretary.\n       Q Did you instigate that, or did he call through his \n     secretary?\n       A I don't remember.\n       Q What was the purpose of that meeting?\n       A Uh, it was to discuss my job situation.\n       Q And what, what--how was that discussed?\n       A Uh, Mr. Jordan gave me a list of three names and \n     suggested that I contact these people in a letter that I \n     should cc him on, and that's what I did.\n       Q Did he ask you to copy him on the letters that you sent \n     out?\n       A Yes.\n       Q During this meeting, did he make any comments about your \n     status as a friend of the President?\n       A Yes.\n       Q What--what did he say?\n       A In one of his remarks, he said something about me being a \n     friend of the President.\n       Q And did you respond?\n       A Yes.\n       Q How?\n       A I said that I didn't, uh--I think I--my grand jury \n     testimony, I know I talked about this, so it's probably more \n     accurate. My memory right now is I said something about, uh, \n     seeing him more as, uh, a man than as a President, and I \n     treated him accordingly.\n       Q Did you express your frustration to Mr. Jordan with, uh, \n     with the President?\n       A I expressed that sometimes I had frustrations with him, \n     yes.\n       Q And what was his response to you about, uh--after you \n     talked about the President?\n       A Uh, he sort of jokingly said to me, You know what your \n     problem is, and don't deny it--you're in love with him. But \n     it was a sort of light-hearted nature.\n       Q Did you--did you have a response to that?\n       A I probably blushed or giggled or something.\n\n  That was on December 11. And I am sure Mr. Jordan and others were \nstarting to kick in, at this point, understanding that there was \nsomething a little bit more involved in the relationship between Ms. \nLewinsky and the President.\n  But let's go to another aspect of the relationship on the job search. \nLet's look how information is controlled. Mr. Jordan learns ultimately \non December 19 clearly that Ms. Lewinsky is on the witness list because \nshe presents a subpoena to him. But whenever he pursues the jobs later \non and maybe the call to Mr. Perelman, he does not pass that \ninformation along to the company. Does that make a difference to \nRevlon? You will hear some reference to Mr. Halperin, who is one of the \nexecutives at MacAndrews & Forbes, the parent company of Revlon, and \nMr. Perelman, who is the CEO of MacAndrews and Forbes as well.\n  Let's listen to the testimony of Mr. Jordan on how information is \ncontrolled.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Now, the second piece of information was the fact that \n     you knew and the President knew that Ms. Lewinsky was under \n     subpoena in the Jones case, and that information was not \n     provided to either Mr. Halperin or to Mr. Perelman; is that \n     correct?\n       A That's correct.\n       Q Now, I wanted to read you a question and answer of Mr. \n     Howard Gittis in his grand jury testimony of April 23, 1998.\n       The question was: ``Now, you had mentioned before that one \n     of the responsibilities of director is to have a fiduciary \n     duty to the company. If it was the case that Ms. Lewinsky had \n     been noticed as a witness in the Paula Jones case, and Vernon \n     Jordan had known that, is that something that you believe as \n     a person who works for MacAndrews & Forbes, is that something \n     that you believe that Mr. Jordan should have told you, or \n     someone in the company, not necessarily you, but someone in \n     the company, when you referred her for employment?''\n       His answer was ``Yes.''\n       Do you disagree with Mr. Gittis' conclusion that that was \n     important information for MacAndrews & Forbes?\n       A I obviously didn't think it was important at the time, \n     and I didn't do it.\n\n  Why would Revlon want to know that Ms. Lewinsky was on a witness list \nand under subpoena in a case that was adverse to the President and the \nfact the President was really the one that was wanting the job \nplacement for Ms. Lewinsky? I think everyone understands the \nextraordinary conflict, extraordinary impropriety of that circumstance. \nAs Mr. Jordan himself testified previously, that whenever the subpoena \nwas issued, it changed the circumstances, and, yet, that information \nwas not provided to Revlon, and Mr. Gittis certainly would have thought \nthat it should have been.\n  So Revlon wanted to know for the same reason, really, that Mr. Jordan \nwould have liked to have had that information. But when the President \nlearned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list, he did not share \nthat information with Mr. Jordan himself.\n  So it is explosive information that the President did not make \navailable to him until the right time.\n  Let's listen to Mr. Jordan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q All right. And so there's two conversations after the \n     witness list came out--one that you had with the President on \n     December 7th, and then a subsequent conversation with him \n     after you met with Ms. Lewinsky on the 11th.\n       Now, in your subsequent conversation after the 11th, did \n     you discuss with the President of the United States Monica \n     Lewinsky, and if so, can you tell us what that discussion \n     was?\n       A If there was a discussion subsequent to Monica Lewinsky's \n     visit to me on December the 11th with the President of the \n     United States, it was about the job search.\n       Q All right. And during that, did he indicate that he knew \n     about the fact that she had lost her job in the White House, \n     and she wanted to get a job in New York?\n       A He was aware that--he was obviously aware that she had \n     lost her job in the White House, because she was working at \n     the Pentagon. He was also aware that she wanted to work in \n     New York, in the private sector, and understood that that is \n     why she was having\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n     conversations with me. There is no doubt about that.\n       Q And he thanked you for helping her?\n       A There's no question about that, either.\n       Q And on either of these conversations that I've referenced \n     that you had with the President after the witness list came \n     out, your conversation on December 7th, and your conversation \n     sometime after the 11th, did the President tell you that Ms. \n     Monica Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case?\n       A He did not.\n\n  The President knew it was not disclosed to Mr. Jordan, according to \nhis testimony. Mr. Jordan has to be reminded as to how important this \ninformation was because, he previously testified, that he expected to \nbe told. It was significant enough information that if Ms. Betty Currie \nknew that Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena that Betty Currie should tell \nhim. He expected the President to tell him. That was his expectation, \nfor natural reasons--that this is an extraordinary conflict whenever \nthe President knows there is a relationship. She is an adverse witness. \nShe is under subpoena, and provided a job benefit. But he kept some of \nthose details to himself without disclosing.\n  Let's listen again to Mr. Jordan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Precisely. She disclosed to you, of course, when she \n     received the subpoena, and that's information that you \n     expected to know and to be disclosed to you?\n       A Fine.\n       Q Is--\n       A Yes. Fine.\n       Q And in fact, if Ms. Currie--I'm talking about Betty \n     Currie--if she had known that Ms. Lewinsky was under \n     subpoena, you would have expected her to tell you that \n     information as well since you were seeking employment for Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       A Well, it would have been fine had she told me. I do make \n     a distinction between being a witness on the one hand and \n     being a defendant in some sort of criminal action on the \n     other. She was a witness in the civil case, and I don't \n     believe witnesses in civil cases don't have a right for--to \n     employment.\n       Q Okay. I refer you to page 95 of your grand jury \n     testimony, in which you said: ``I believe that had Ms. Currie \n     known, that she would have told me.''\n       And the next question: ``Let me ask the question again, \n     though. Would you have expected her to tell you if she knew?\"\n       And do you recall your answer?\n       A I don't.\n       Q ``Yes, sure.''\n       A I stand by that answer.\n       Q And so it's your testimony that if Ms. Currie had known \n     that Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena, you would have expected \n     her to tell you that information?\n       A It would have been helpful.\n       Q And likewise, would you have expected the President to \n     tell you if he had any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky \n     would be called as a witness in the Paula Jones case?\n       A That would have been helpful, too.\n       Q And that was your expectation, that he would have done \n     that in your conversations?\n       A It--it would certainly have been helpful, but it would \n     not have changed my mind.\n       Q Well, being helpful and that being your expectation is a \n     little bit different, and so I want to go back again to your \n     testimony on March 3, page 95, when the question is asked to \n     you--question: ``If the President had any reason to believe \n     that Ms. Lewinsky could be called a witness in the Paula \n     Jones case, would you have expected him to tell you that when \n     you spoke with him between the 11th and the 19th about her?''\n       And your answer: ``And I think he would have.''\n       A My answer was yes in the grand jury testimony, and my \n     answer is yes today.\n       Q All right. So it would have been helpful, and it was \n     something you would have expected?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And yet, according to your testimony, the President did \n     not so advise you of that fact in the conversations that he \n     had with you on December 7th and December 11th after he \n     learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list?\n       A As I testified--\n       MR. KENDALL: Objection. Misstates the record with regard to \n     December 11th.\n       MR. HUTCHINSON: I--I will restate the question. I believe \n     it accurately reflects the record, and I'll ask the question.\n       BY MR. HUTCHINSON:\n       Q And yet, according to your testimony, the President did \n     not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the \n     witness list despite the fact that he had conversations with \n     you on two occasions, on December 7th and December 11th?\n       A I have no recollection of the President telling me about \n     the witness list.\n\n  Now, I am providing some long snippets because I want you to see the \ntestimony of the witnesses. I think it is very important as you piece \nit together. You might say, well, there is nothing explosive here. \nWhenever you are talking about obstruction of justice, it ties \ntogether, it fits together. Information is controlled and that is what \nwe see in this particular case.\n  Clearly, Mr. Jordan expected information because he knew that \nsomething that the President should have shared, it was not shared, \naccording to Mr. Jordan's testimony. And for natural reasons.\n  If you look at the exhibit that I passed out, on the time line we \nhave talked about when the witness list came out, on the 7th, and on \nthe 11th, or sometime thereafter, the President and Mr. Jordan meet, \nand that information is not disclosed, despite the fact that the \nPresident knows she is on the witness list.\n  And now, let's go to the 17th, because now the President is ready to \nshare some additional information with Ms. Lewinsky. Now that he has \ngot the job search moving, perhaps she is in a more receptive mood so \nthat she can handle the news that she is on the witness list. So let's \nlisten to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony as to this December 17, 2 a.m., \ntelephone conversation from the President of the United States.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Sometime back in December of 1997, in the morning of \n     December the 17th, did you receive a call from the President?\n       A Yes.\n       Q What was the purpose of that call? What did you talk \n     about?\n       A It was threefold--first, to tell me that Ms. Currie's \n     brother had been killed in a car accident; second, to tell me \n     that my name was on a witness list for the Paula Jones case; \n     and thirdly, he mentioned the Christmas present he had for \n     me.\n       Q This telephone call was somewhere in the early morning \n     hours of 2 o'clock to 2:30.\n       A Correct.\n       Q Did it surprise you that he called you so late?\n       A No.\n       Q Was this your first notice of your name being on the \n     Paula Jones witness list?\n       A Yes.\n       Q I will try to ask sharper questions to avoid these \n     objections. At that point we got a telephone conversation in \n     the morning with you and the President. And he has, among \n     other things, mentioned to you that your name is on the Jones \n     witness list. He has also mentioned to you that perhaps you \n     could file an affidavit to avoid possible testifying in that \n     case. Is that right.\n       A Correct.\n       Q And he's also, I think, now at the point that we were in \n     our questioning in reference to the cover story that you and \n     he had, that perhaps you could say that you were coming to my \n     office to deliver papers or to see Betty Currie. Is that \n     right.\n       A Correct. It was from the entire relationship. That's \n     correct.\n       Q Now, when he alluded to that cover story, was that \n     instantly familiar to you.\n       A Yes.\n       Q You knew what he was talking about.\n       A Yes.\n       Q And why was this familiar to you.\n       A Because it was part of the pattern of the relationship.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories \n     were reiterated to you by the President that night on the \n     telephone--\n       A Correct.\n       Q --and after he told you you would be a witness--or your \n     name was on the witness list, I should say?\n       A Correct.\n       Q And did you understand that since your name was on the \n     witness list that there would be a possibility that you could \n     be subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case?\n       A I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and \n     there was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I \n     necessarily thought it was a subpoena to testify, but--\n       Q Were you in fact subpoenaed to testify?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And that was what--\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q Okay. Let me ask it. Did you understand in the context of \n     the telephone conversation with the President that early \n     morning of December the 17th--did you understand that you \n     would deny your relationship with the President to the Jones \n     lawyers through use of these cover stories?\n       A From what I learned in that--oh, through those cover \n     stories, I don't know, but from what I learned in that \n     conversation, I thought to myself I knew I would deny the \n     relationship.\n       Q And you would deny the relationship to the Jones lawyers?\n       A Yes, correct.\n       Q Good.\n  Do you believe Monica Lewinsky? I believe her testimony is credible. \nShe is not trying to hammer the President. She is trying to tell the \ntruth as to her recollection of this 2 a.m. call to her by the \nPresident of the United States on December 17.\n  The news is broken to her that she is on the witness list. It puts it \nin a legal context. This is a 24-year-old ex-intern. She might not have \nthe legal sophistication of the President, but the President certainly \nknows the legal\n\n[[Page S1296]]\n\nconsequences as to his actions. What he is telling a witness in a case \nthat is adverse to him is that: You do not have to tell the truth. You \ncan use the cover stories that we used before. And that might have been \nin a nonlegal context, but now we are in a different arena and he says: \nContinue the same lies, even though you are in a court of law. Continue \nthe same pattern.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, in my book that is illegal, and I \nhate to say it, but that is obstruction of justice by the President of \nthe United States. And, if you believe Ms. Lewinsky, then you have to \naccept that fact. Otherwise, we are saying that it is all right for \nsomeone to take a witness who is against them and say: Don't tell the \ntruth, don't worry about that, use the cover stories. You can file an \naffidavit. You can avoid telling the truth.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is significant. It is important. Do not \ndiminish this, the impact of what happened on December 17, with the \nobstruction of justice on that occasion.\n  And, now, let's move on. That is December 17. We can move on to \nDecember 19, and this is when the subpoena is actually delivered to Ms. \nLewinsky. She calls Vernon Jordan. She is in tears. She is upset. \nVernon Jordan says, ``Come over to my office,'' and they have the \ndiscussion. And you are going to hear Mr. Jordan's version of what \nhappens on December 19. You are going to hear Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nas to what happens in that office on December 19 as well.\n  Let's hear from Mr. Jordan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q And during this meeting, did she in fact show you the \n     subpoena that she had received in the Jones litigation?\n       A I'm sure she showed me the subpoena.\n       Q And the subpoena that was presented to you asked her to \n     give a deposition, is that correct?\n       A As I recollect.\n       Q But did it also ask Ms. Lewinsky or direct her to produce \n     certain documents and tangible objects?\n       A I think, if I'm correct in my recollection, it asked that \n     she produce gifts.\n       Q Gifts, and some of those gifts were specifically \n     enumerated.\n       A I don't remember that. I do remember gifts.\n       Q And did you discuss any of the items requested under the \n     subpoena?\n       A I did not. What I said to her was that she needed \n     counsel.\n       Q Now, just to help you in reference to your previous grand \n     jury testimony of March 3, '98--and if you would like to \n     refer to that, page 121, but I believe it was your testimony \n     that you asked her if there had been any gifts after you \n     looked at the subpoena.\n       A I may have done that, and if I--if that's in my \n     testimony, I stand by it.\n       Q And did she--from your conversation with her, did you \n     determine that in your opinion, there was a fascination on \n     her part with the President?\n       A No question about that.\n       Q And I think you previously described it that she had a \n     ``thing'' for the President?\n       A ``Thing,'' yes.\n       Q And did you make any specific inquiry as to the nature of \n     the relationship that she had with the President?\n       A Yes. At some point during that conversation, I asked her \n     directly if she had had sexual relationships with the \n     President.\n       Q And is this not an extraordinary question to ask a 24-\n     year-old intern, whether she had sexual relations with the \n     President of the United States?\n       A Not if you see--not if you had witnessed her emotional \n     state and this ``thing,'' as I say. It was not.\n       Q And her emotional state and what she expressed to you \n     about her feelings for the President is what prompted you to \n     ask that question?\n       A That, plus the question of whether or not the President \n     at the end of his term would leave the First Lady; and that \n     was alarming and stunning to me.\n       Q And she related that question to you in that meeting on \n     December 19th?\n       A That's correct.\n       Q Now, going back to the question in which you asked her if \n     she had had a sexual relationship with the President, what \n     was her response?\n       A No.\n       Q And I'm sure that that was not an idle question on your \n     part, and I presume that you needed to know the answer for \n     some purpose.\n       A I wanted to know the answer based on what I had seen in \n     her expression; obviously, based on the fact that this was a \n     subpoena about her relationship with the President.\n       Q And so you felt like you needed to know the answer to \n     that question to determine how you were going to handle the \n     situation?\n       A No. I thought it was a factual data that I needed to \n     know, and I asked the question.\n       Q And why did you need to know the answer to that question?\n       A I am referring this lady, Ms. Lewinsky, to various \n     companies for jobs, and it seemed to me that it was important \n     for me to know in that process whether or not there had been \n     something going on with the President based on what I saw and \n     based on what I heard.\n\n  Why was it important? Why was it important for Mr. Jordan to know \nwhether she was under subpoena? Why was it important for Mr. Jordan to \nknow whether there was a sexual relationship? Why was it important? \nBecause those would be incredible, explosive ingredients in a \ncircumstance that is fraught with danger and impropriety, and he knows \nthat and he asked the right questions. But he doesn't listen to the \nright answer, nor does he take the right steps, because he is acting at \nthe direction of the President.\n  As you will see, during his meeting on December 19, he was keeping \nthe President very closely informed. You will see in your packet of \nmaterials that the call--as soon as he was notified, Mr. Jordan was \nnotified Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena, he tried to get ahold of the \nPresident, exhibit H-25, a 3:51 call to the President. He didn't make \ncontact at that point. Ms. Lewinsky came into his office about 4:47. It \nwas at 5:01 that he received a call from the President. So the \nPresident actually called him at the same time Ms. Lewinsky was in the \noffice.\n  Let's look at Ms. Lewinsky's testimony as to her recollection of that \nDecember 19 meeting with Mr. Jordan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q You went to see Mr. Jordan, and you were inside his \n     office after 5 o'clock, and you did--is that correct?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Were--were you interrupted, in the office?\n       A Yes. He received a phone call.\n       Q And you testified that you didn't know who that was that \n     called?\n       A Correct.\n       Q Did you excuse yourself?\n       A Yes.\n       Q What--after you came back in, what--what occurred? Did he \n     tell you who he had been talking to?\n       A No.\n       Q Okay. What happened next?\n       A I know I've testified about this--\n       Q Yes.\n       A --so I stand by that testimony, and my recollection right \n     now is when I came back in the room, I think shortly after he \n     had placed a phone call to--to Mr. Carter's office, and told \n     me to come to his office at 10:30 Monday morning.\n       Q Did you know who Mr. Carter was?\n       A No.\n       Q Did Mr. Jordan tell you who he was?\n       A No--I don't remember.\n       Q Did you understand he was going to be your attorney?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Did you express any concerns about the--the subpoena?\n       A I think that happened before the phone call came.\n       Q Okay, but did you express concerns about the subpoena?\n       A Yes, yes.\n       Q And what were those concerns?\n       A In general, I think I was just concerned about being \n     dragged into this, and I was concerned because the subpoena \n     had called for a hatpin, that I turn over a hatpin, and that \n     was an alarm to me.\n       Q How--in what sense was it--in what sense was it an alarm \n     to you?\n       A The hatpin being on the subpoena was evidence to me that \n     someone had given that information to the Paula Jones people.\n       Q What did Mr. Jordan say about the subpoena?\n       A That it was standard.\n       Q Did he have any--did he have any comment about the \n     specificity of the hatpin?\n       A No.\n       Q And did you--\n       A He just kept telling me to calm down.\n       Q Did you raise that concern with Mr. Jordan?\n       A I don't remember if--if I've testified to it, then yes. \n     If--I don't remember right now.\n       Q Did--would you have remembered then if he made any \n     comment or answer about the hatpin?\n       A I mean, I think I would.\n       Q And you don't remember?\n       A I--I remember him saying something that it was--you know, \n     calm down, it's a standard subpoena or vanilla subpoena, \n     something like that.\n\n  What we see here is another example of compartmentalization of \ninformation. During this meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan receives \na call from the President, presumably in response to a call he had \nplaced to the President, to tell him Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. \nWhen the President calls, Mr. Jordan takes that call in private. It is \nabout Ms. Lewinsky, it is about the subpoena, and that information is \nnot shared with Ms. Lewinsky. It is of interest to her.\n  Let's go on and hear some more about Ms. Lewinsky's version of that \nconversation on December 19.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\n\n       Q. Did Mr. Jordan during that meeting make an inquiry about \n     the nature of the relationship between you and the President?\n       A. Yes, he did.\n       Q. What was that inquiry?\n       A. I don't remember the exact wording of the questions, but \n     there were two questions, and I think they were something \n     like did you have sex with the President or did he--and if--\n     or did he ask for it or some--something like that.\n\n  At this point, Ms. Lewinsky denies the relationship. She thinks this \nis some type of a test. She is not sure the reason for the question. \nShe thinks he knows there is a little confusion on that. Clearly, Mr. \nJordan is not satisfied with the answer. Mother wit is still around, as \nhe indicated. But he feels so concerned about it that that night he \ngoes to see the President, that we will later see, and asks that same \nquestion of the President.\n  Now, let's talk to President Clinton and see what he testifies about \nwhen this information was reported to him on the subpoena. Let's listen \nto the testimony of President Clinton.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that \n     Monica Lewinsky had been served with subpoena in this case?\n       A I don't think so.\n       Q Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the \n     possibility that she might be asked to testify in this case?\n       A Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she \n     was, I think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I \n     want to be as accurate as I can.\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from NebraskA\n  Mr. KERREY. Can I ask the manager to identify which deposition this \nis?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. This is the January deposition.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. Chief Justice, will the manager answer the question \nand then show that again? This is the second time he has shown a tape \nof the President without indicating which deposition it was.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes, I think it would be a good idea for the \nmanager if he will indicate what deposition it was, if you are showing \na deposition video of the President.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I thank the \nSenator for the question. It is a very fair question, and I will try to \nbe more clear in the identification of that. This is the testimony of \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton before the deposition in the Jones case in \nJanuary, January 17. I believe--can we replay that? We are not going to \nreplay that. Let me go on.\n  The testimony that he gave at that time was, ``Did anyone other than \nyour attorneys ever tell you that Monica Lewinsky had been served with \na subpoena in that case,'' and the answer was, ``I don't think so.'' \nClearly, Mr. Jordan was keeping close contact with the President, \ntelling him every step of the way, when the subpoena, the call, he is \nplacing a call back--the information is there, but, of course, the \nPresident tries to diminish that.\n  Let's go on with some more testimony of Ms. Lewinsky.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Did you ask Mr. Jordan to call the President and advise \n     him of the subpoena?\n       A. I think so, yes. I asked him to inform the President. I \n     don't know if it was through telephone or not.\n       Q. And you did that because the President had asked you to \n     make sure you let Betty know that?\n       A. Well, sure. With Betty not being in the office, I \n     couldn't--there wasn't anyone else that I could call to get \n     through to him.\n       Q. Did Mr. Jordan say to you when he might see the \n     President next?\n       A. I believe he said he would see him that evening at a \n     holiday reception.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, could I inquire, was the manager \nthinking in terms of concluding this portion in 15 minutes, or do you \nwant to take a break now?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. This would be a good time for a break.\n\n\n                                 recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we take a \n15-minute break at this time.\n  There being no objection, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate recessed until \n11:53 a.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I was going to \ntake the opportunity to replay the videotape--in fact, I will now--that \nI did not properly explain before. This is the videotape of President \nClinton and his testimony before the civil deposition in the Jones case \nin January of 1997.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. When you say ``before,'' you actually mean \n``during,'' don't you? It is not before the deposition; his testimony \nwas during the deposition.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, you are absolutely \ncorrect. Excuse me. Thank you.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that \n     Monica Lewinsky had been served with subpoena in this case?\n       A I don't think so.\n       Q Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the \n     possibility that she might be asked to testify in this case?\n       A Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she \n     was, I think maybe that's the first person told me she was. i \n     want to be as accurate as I can.\n\n  And now let's go to what Mr. Jordan has to say in reference to his \ncontacts with the President when he learned of the subpoena on December \n19. Let's play that tape.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Now, Mr. Jordan, you indicated you had this conversation \n     with the President at about 5:01 p.m. out of the presence of \n     Ms. Lewinsky. Now, during this conversation with the \n     President, what did you tell the President in that \n     conversation?\n       A That Lewinsky--I'm sure I told him that Ms. Lewinsky was \n     in my office, in the reception area, that she had a subpoena \n     and that I was going to visit with her.\n       Q And did you advise the President as well that you were \n     going to recommend Frank Carter as an attorney?\n       A I may have.\n       Q And why was it necessary to tell the President these \n     facts?\n       A I don't know why it was not unnecessary to tell him these \n     facts. I was keeping him informed about what was going on, \n     and so I told him.\n       Q Why did you make the judgment that you should call the \n     President and advise him of these facts?\n       A I just thought he ought to know. He was interested it--he \n     was obviously interested in it--and I felt some \n     responsibility to tell him, and I did.\n       Q All right. And what was the President's response?\n       A He said thank you.\n       Q Subsequent to your conversation with the President about \n     Monica Lewinsky, did you advise Ms. Lewinsky of this \n     conversation with the President?\n       A I doubt it.\n\n  Once again, Mr. Jordan testifies that the President was obviously \ninterested in it. This was not a matter of casual interest to him. It \nwas a matter of deep concern that jeopardized what he saw as his \nposition in that lawsuit.\n  Now, let's go back again to the testimony of President Clinton, this \ntime before the grand jury in August of 1998.\n  (Playing of videotape.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. We cannot hear that monitor.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I will read the answer again:\n\n       . . . and Mr. Jordan informed you of that, is that right?\n       Answer: No, sir.\n\n  Now, in fairness to the President, he gives a longer answer than \nthat. I welcome anybody to read it, but it appears rather convoluted. I \nthink that you can see the contrast. There is no question in Mr. \nJordan's mind as to the details that he is providing to the President \non a regular basis. We are on December 19. The subpoena is issued. He \nnotifies the President. He notifies the President how the job search is \ngoing. He notifies the President that they got representation through \nMr. Carter. So the details are provided to the President and to \ncontrast that with the President's recollection as to did he have any \ncontact with Mr. Jordan, once again diminishing that.\n  Let's go back to December 19, back to the chart--to December 19 when \nthe subpoena is issued. Mr. Jordan meets with Monica Lewinsky. He \nconfronts her about the relationship. Now, he goes that evening to see \nthe President at the White House to confront him personally about it to \ndiscuss this with him. Let's hear from Mr. Jordan, and this is at the \nWhite House.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Now, would you describe your conversation with the \n     President?\n       A. We were upstairs, uh, in the White House. Mrs. Jordan--\n     we came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the Diplomatic \n     Entrance--we left the car there. I took the elevator up to \n     the residence, and Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. \n     And the President was already upstairs--I had ascertained \n     that from the usher--and I went up, and I raised with him the \n     whole question of Monica Lewinsky and asked him directly if \n     he had had sexual relations with Monica\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n     Lewinsky, and the President said, ``No, never.''\n\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       A Well, we had established that.\n       Q All right. And did you tell him that you were concerned \n     about her fascination?\n       A I did.\n       Q And did you describe her as being emotional in your \n     meeting that day?\n       A I did.\n       Q And did you relate to the President that Ms. Lewinsky \n     asked about whether he was going to leave the First Lady at \n     the end of the term?\n       A I did.\n       Q And as--and then, you concluded that with the question as \n     to whether he had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A And he said he had not, and I was satisfied--end of \n     conversation.\n       Q Now, once again, just as I asked the question in \n     reference to Ms. Lewinsky, it appears to me that this is an \n     extraordinary question to ask the President of the United \n     States. What led you to ask this question to the President?\n       A Well, first of all, I'm asking the question of my friend \n     who happens to be the President of the United States.\n       Q And did you expect your friend, the President of the \n     United States, to give you a truthful answer?\n       A I did.\n       Q Did you rely upon the President's answer in your decision \n     to continue your efforts to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job?\n       A I believed him, and I continued to do what I had been \n     asked to do.\n       Q Well, my question was more did you rely upon the \n     President's answer in your decision to continue your efforts \n     to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job.\n       A I did not rely on his answer. I was going to pursue the \n     job in any event. But I got the answer to the question that I \n     had asked Ms. Lewinsky earlier from her, and I got the answer \n     from him that night as to the sexual relationships, and he \n     said no.\n\n  You will have to judge for yourselves as to why Mr. Jordan felt \ncompelled to ask the question. He is asking the right questions. It was \nimportant information. If the President had said, ``Yes; there is,'' \nthen it would certainly have been inappropriate to continue providing a \njob benefit for a witness that you are seeking an affidavit from \ndenying a relationship when you know the relationship exists, when that \nwitness would be adverse to the President's interest who is seeking the \njob.\n  To some that might be convoluted, and perhaps I didn't explain it as \nbest it can be. But it looks to me like that is why Mr. Jordan is \nasking the question because he knows it would be inappropriate if that, \nin fact, did exist. He got an answer ``no.'' I don't know what he \nthought in his mind. But clearly you see the conversations develop when \nMs. Lewinsky made it totally clear to him without any question that \nthere was that relationship. But still the job benefit was provided.\n  We are not going to have time to go through it all. But sequentially, \nthe next thing that happens is December 2 when Ms. Lewinsky goes to Mr. \nJordan's office where Mr. Jordan drives her in the chauffeur-driven \ngovernment vehicle to Mr. Frank Carter's office where the attorney is \nthat is provided for Ms. Lewinsky. And that is the only time that it \nhappened in the referral that Mr. Jordan took it upon himself to \npersonally deliver a client to Mr. Carter. During that conversation, \nMs. Lewinsky tells Mr. Jordan more of the details of their \nrelationship.\n  But let's go to another element of obstruction--on December 28, a few \ndays after Christmas. You are very familiar with this episode in which \nMs. Lewinsky and the President meet. They exchange gifts. The testimony \nin the Jones case is discussed. There is concern expressed about the \ngifts. She asks the President in essence, Should I get them out of my \nhouse? And you will hear her answer. Her testimony is very clear on \nthis. That is what I would like you to listen to. There is no \nambiguity. There are no ``what-ifs.'' It is very clear. And let's move \nnow to the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky.\n  (Inaudible.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I can't hear.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can we turn this up?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I don't think the question is audible.\n  Well, that is a different--it's not as sophisticated a sound \ncollection system as the U.S. Senate used in the depositions here, so I \napologize for the fact that that was inaudible but the question was \nasked of the President:\n\n       Q. After you gave her the gifts on December 28, did you \n     speak with your secretary, Ms. Currie, and ask her to pick up \n     a box of gifts that was some compilation of gifts that Ms. \n     Lewinsky would have?\n\n  His answer:\n\n       No, sir, I did not do that.\n\n  His denial and then the facts presented by Ms. Lewinsky and the \ncircumstantial evidence, the question was asked of Ms. Lewinsky:\n\n       Q. Did the President ever tell you to turn over the gifts?\n       A. Not that I remember.\n\n  But when I say that she that testified unequivocally, whenever Ms. \nLewinsky was asked ``Did you later that day receive a call from Ms. \nCurrie,'' the answer was, ``Yes, I did,'' and she goes ahead and \nexplains it. There is no hesitation. There is no question. But their \nmemory is clear that the call came from Betty Currie.\n  Now, how could Betty Currie know to go pick up the gifts? I think you \nunderstand there is only one way that could have come about, and that \nwould be through a communication from the President to her.\n  Now, let's go on down the path. After we see the meeting on December \n28, there was a meeting at the Hyatt on December 31. We could play this \nvideo--I would like to--with Vernon Jordan and with Ms. Lewinsky. This \nis a meeting at the Hyatt that Mr. Jordan totally denied ever happened \nin his first few testimonies before the grand jury. But in his most \nrecent testimony before the Senate, in the deposition, he was \nconfronted with receipts from the Hyatt, and the testimony of Ms. \nLewinsky which was clear, and the corroborating facts. And he said yes, \nin fact, it did happen. And not only did he recall the meeting, but \nthen he recalled what was discussed, that yes, in fact, notes were \ndiscussed there.\n  And Ms. Lewinsky testifies that she raised the issue of other \nevidence that would be possibly in her apartment, notes to the \nPresident. According to her testimony, she was told that: You need to \nget rid of those.\n  Now, Mr. Jordan totally denies that. But the point is, there is more \nevidence at risk for the President. Mr. Jordan, who is doing the work \nfor the President, has this conversation with Ms. Lewinsky that he \nearlier denied ever happened.\n  So, I think you look at credibility there. You believe Ms. Lewinsky? \nIf you accept the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, then you have more \nevidence that is at issue, and that is being urged to be destroyed and \nnot available for the truth-seeking endeavor in the civil rights case. \nI think that is significant.\n  Now, you say that is not the President, that is Mr. Jordan. You have \nto put this in context. It is Ms. Lewinsky who says that she is talking \nto the President when she is talking to Mr. Jordan--and I am \nparaphrasing that, but that is what she was seeing--seeing Mr. Jordan \nas a conduit to the President.\n  Then we go on after the meeting in the Hyatt, we go into January, \nwhere the job search continues. But it is tied directly to the signing \nof the affidavit, which is false by its nature.\n  If we look at the testimony of Mr. Jordan, in the January 5 timeframe \nwhere the affidavit is prepared and discussed with Mr. Jordan:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Do you know why you would have been calling Mr. Carter on \n     3 occasions the day before the affidavit was signed?\n       A Yeah, my recollection is, is that I was exchanging or \n     sharing with Mr. Carter what had gone on, what she asked me \n     to do, what I refused to do, reaffirming to him that he was \n     the lawyer and I was not the lawyer. I mean, it would be so \n     presumptuous of me to try to advise Frank Carter as to how to \n     practice law.\n       Q Would you have been relating to Mr. Carter your \n     conversation with Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A I may have.\n       Q And if Ms. Lewinsky expressed to you any concerns about \n     the affidavit would you have relayed those to Mr. Carter?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And if Mr. Carter was a good attorney that was concerned \n     about the economics of law practice he would have likely \n     billed Ms. Lewinsky for some of those telephone calls?\n       A You have to talk to Mr. Carter about his billing.\n\n  So you have Mr. Jordan discussing the affidavit with both Ms. \nLewinsky and her attorney, Mr. Carter. And if you look at the testimony \nof Mr. Carter, he talks about the fact that he did bill some time for \nhis conversations with Mr. Jordan. Certainly they are matters of \nsubstance in relation to the affidavit that was being discussed between \nthe three: Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Carter.\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\n  Now, let's hear what Ms. Lewinsky has to say on the changes that were \nmade in the affidavit:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q OK, have you had an opportunity to review the draft of \n     your affidavit?\n       A I--yes.\n       Q Do you have any comment or response?\n       A I received it. I made the suggested changes. And I \n     believe I spoke with Mr. Jordan about the changes I wanted to \n     make.\n\n  Now, because of time, I am not going to be able to go completely \nthrough all of their testimony but let me tell you time sequentially \nwhat is happening here. This is the second page of the time chart that \nyou have.\n  January 5 and 6, the affidavit is prepared and discussed with Mr. \nJordan and with the President.\n  On the 7th, the affidavit is signed. You recall Mr. Jordan lets the \nPresident know that the affidavit was signed. And he says he was \ninterested, he was obviously interested in this.\n  On January 8 the job came through, the day after the affidavit was \nsigned. And of course it had to come through, the personal call of Mr. \nJordan to Mr. Perelman to ``make it happen--if it can happen.'' Once \nthat job is secured, the President is informed: Mission accomplished.\n  January 15, there are some inquiries from the news media about the \ngifts that had been delivered to the White House. This makes Betty \nCurrie nervous enough that she has to go see Mr. Jordan about it.\n  You go to the 17th; the President gives his deposition in which that \nfalse affidavit is presented on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky and the \nPresident's attorney.\n  And then the next day, after that deposition is given, you go to \nJanuary 18, where he is very concerned because he mentions Betty \nCurrie's name so many times.\n\n  We were not able--we did not ask for the deposition of Betty Currie. \nWe wish that we had had that opportunity. We would like to call her \nhere. But that is one of the most critical and important elements of \nthe structure in which the truth is so critically clear, because it \nhappened not just on one day, because it happened on a couple of days.\n  We see on the 17th, the President is deposed. This is the third chart \nthat you have. The 18th, the President coaches Betty Currie, going \nthrough the series of questions. On the 19th, there is this dramatic \nsearch for Ms. Lewinsky. On the 20th, the Washington Post story becomes \nknown, because the President's counselors get calls and the OIC \ninvestigation becomes known.\n  On the 21st, at 12:30 a.m., the Post story appears on the Internet. \nAt 12:41, the President calls Bruce Lindsey. At 1:16 a.m, the Post \nstory appears. The President calls Betty Currie for 20 minutes, \ndiscusses the Post story. And then, according to Betty Currie, on the \n20th or the 21st, it was the second incident of coaching that took \nplace, where the President calls her in and goes through that series of \nquestions: I did nothing wrong; she came on to me; we were never alone. \nAnd so that was the second time that it happened. And that, ladies and \ngentlemen of the Senate, is another example of witness tampering: A \nknown witness clearly going to be testifying, a subordinate employee \nwho is called in and coached.\n  Now, the President says, ``I was trying to gain facts.'' You \ndetermine that. You are the ones who have to defend that question as to \nwhether, under common sense, the President was gaining information on \ntwo separate occasions or whether he was actually trying to tamper with \nthe testimony of a witness.\n  The 21st, she is subpoenaed by the OIC. The 23rd, she is added to the \nJones witness list.\n  Now I want to play the last video clip that I am going to move to on \nMs. Lewinsky, some things that she said that are different with regard \nto the President:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q The President did not in that conversation on December 17 \n     of 1997, or any other conversation for that matter, instruct \n     you to tell the truth; is that correct?\n       A That's correct.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q But the--the pattern that you had with the President to \n     conceal this relationship, it was never questioned that, for \n     instance, that given day that he gave you gifts you were not \n     going to surrender those to the Jones attorneys because that \n     would--\n       A In my mind there is no reflection; no.\n\n  We have one more here we would like you to listen to.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       A Sure, gosh, I think to me that if the President had not \n     said to Betty in letters us--cover--let us just say if we \n     refer to that which I am talking about in paragraph 4 of page \n     4, I would have known to use that. So, to me, encouraging or \n     asking me to lie would have, you know if the President had \n     said now listen you better not say anything about this \n     relationship, you better not tell them the truth, you better \n     not--for me the best way to explain how I feel what happened \n     was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no \n     one discouraged me either.\n  It is very important to understand that we want you to know very \nclearly that Ms. Lewinsky says that the President never told her to \nlie. There is no question about that. There is no dispute about that, \neither. I think you have to look at all the context of this. What the \nPresident did suggest to her was to use an affidavit to avoid truthful \ntestimony, to stick with the cover stories under legal context.\n  Is the issue here whether Ms. Lewinsky believed the President was \nencouraging her to lie, that's what the President was trying to do \nhere? Or is the issue what the President was trying to do? It is your \ndetermination. You have to make the decision whether the President, in \ntalking to a 24-year-old ex-employee, whether he is encouraging her to \ncome forward and to tell the truth or, in a legal context, to use the \nold cover stories, to lie, to use false affidavits, to avoid the truth \nfrom coming out.\n  It is not Ms. Lewinsky's viewpoint that is important. It is what the \nPresident intended. What did the President intend by this conversation \nwhen he told her on December 17, ``Guess what, bad news; you're a \nwitness''. Then he proceeded to suggest to her ways to avoid truthful \ntestimony.\n  I really don't care what is in Ms. Lewinsky's mind at that point. The \ncritical issue is what is in the President's mind at that point as to \nwhat he was intending. Was it an innocent conversation, or was it a \nconversation with corrupt intent?\n  I believe that if you put all of this in context--from the affidavit \nto the job search, to the coaching of Ms. Betty Currie, to all of the \nother conversations with the aides--that it was the President's intent \nto avoid the workings of the administration of justice, to impede the \nflow of the truth in the administration of justice for his own benefit, \nand that is what obstruction of justice is about. That is what people \ngo to jail about, and that is what we are presenting to you as a \nfactual basis for this case.\n  I now yield to my fellow manager, Mr. Rogan.\n\n\n                                 recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would be appropriate if we \ntake a break at this time for lunch and return at 1:15, and I so ask \nunanimous consent.\n  There being no objection, at 12:22 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n1:24 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  I believe we are ready to resume the presentation by the House \nmanagers, and Mr. Manager Rogan is prepared to speak.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Rogan.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, before \nthe break, you had the opportunity to hear the very able presentation \nfrom Mr. Manager Hutchinson relating to the article of impeachment \nalleging obstruction of justice against the President of the United \nStates. I would like to use my portion to discuss very briefly article \nI of the impeachment resolution that alleges on August 17, 1998, the \nPresident committed perjury before a Federal grand jury conducting a \ncriminal investigation. He did this in a number of ways, embarking on a \ncalculated effort to cover up illegal obstruction of justice.\n  First, the President lied about statements he made to his top aides \nregarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. This is significant \nbecause the President admitted, under oath, that he knew these aides \nwere potential witnesses before a criminal grand jury.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\n\n       A. And so I said to them things that were true about this \n     relationship. That I used--in the language I used, I said \n     there was nothing going on between us. That was true. I said \n     I have not had sex with her as I define it. That was true. \n     And did I hope that I never had to be here on this day giving \n     this testimony, of course. But I also didn't want to do \n     anything to complicate this matter further.\n       So I said things that were true that may have been \n     misleading, and if they were, I have to take responsibility \n     for it, and I am sorry.\n       Q. It may have been misleading, but you knew, though, after \n     January 21 when the Post article broke and said that Judge \n     Starr was looking into this, you knew they might be \n     witnesses, you knew they might be called into the grand jury?\n       A. That's right.\n       Q. And you do you recall denying any sexual relationship \n     with Monica Lewinsky to the following people: Harry \n     Thomasson, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes, Mr. Podesta, Mr. \n     Blumenthal, Mr. Jordan, Miss Betty Currie. Do you recall \n     denying any sexual relation--\n\n  The question to the President: ``You knew they might be called into a \ngrand jury, didn't you?'' Answer by the President: ``That's right.''\n  The President's testimony that he said things that were misleading \nbut true to his aides was perjury.\n  Just as the President predicted, several of his top aides later were \ncalled to testify before the grand jury as to what the President told \nthem. When they testified before the grand jury, they passed along the \nPresident's false account, just as the President intended. The \nPresident's former chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, and his current \nchief of staff, John Podesta, went before the grand jury and testified \nthat the President told them he did not have sexual relations with \nMonica and he did not ask anybody to lie.\n  Mr. Podesta had an additional meeting with the President 2 days after \nthe story broke. Mr. Podesta testified that at that meeting with the \nPresident the President was extremely explicit in saying he never had \nsex with her in any way whatever and that he was not alone with her in \nthe Oval Office.\n  The most glaring example of the President using an aide as a \nmessenger of lies to the grand jury was his manipulation of his \nPresidential assistant, Mr. Blumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal has been \nassistant to the President since August of 1997. Mr. Blumenthal \ntestified that dealing with the media was one of his responsibilities \non January 21, 1998, the day the Monica Lewinsky story broke. Mr. \nBlumenthal testified under oath that once the story became public, he \nattended twice-a-day White House strategy sessions called to deal with \nthe political, legal, and media impact of the Clinton scandals on the \nWhite House.\n  In his deposition testimony taken just this week by authority of the \nU.S. Senate, Mr. Blumenthal shared in chilling detail the story of how \nthe President responded to the public discovery of his longstanding \nrelationship with a young woman who had shared tearful and emotional \ndescriptions of her love for him. Mr. Clinton responded not in love, \nnot in friendship, not even with a grain of concern for her well-being \nor emotional stability. Instead, the President took the deep and \napparently unrequited emotional attachment Monica Lewinsky had formed \nfor him, and prepared to summarily take her life and throw it on the \nash heap.\n  The date is January 21, 1998. The Lewinsky scandal had just broken in \nthe newspapers that morning. Mr. Blumenthal met initially with the \nFirst Lady, Mrs. Clinton, to get her take on the growing political fire \nstorm. Later that day, Mr. Blumenthal is summoned to the Oval Office. \nListen as Sidney Blumenthal describes, step by step, the destructive \nmechanism of the man who twice was elected President under the banner \nof feeling other people's pain.\n\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Mr. Blumenthal, specifically inviting your attention to \n     January 21, 1998, you testified before the grand jury that on \n     that date you personally spoke to the President regarding the \n     Monica Lewinsky matter, correct?\n       A. Yes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. You are familiar with the Washington Post story that \n     broke that day?\n       A. I am.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. The story stated that the Office of Independent Counsel \n     was investigating whether the President made false statements \n     about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones case?\n       A. Right.\n       Q. And also that the Office of Independent Counsel was \n     investigating whether the President obstructed justice in the \n     Jones case, is that your best recollection of what that story \n     was about?\n       A. Yes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. And you now remember that the President asked to speak \n     with you?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Did you go to the Oval Office?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. During that conversation were you alone with the \n     President?\n       A. I was.\n       Q. Do you remember if the door was closed?\n       A. It was.\n       Q. When you met with the President, did you relate to him a \n     conversation you had with the First Lady earlier that day?\n       A. I did.\n       Q. What did you tell the President the First Lady told you \n     earlier that day?\n       A. I believe that I told him that the First Lady had called \n     me earlier in the day, and in the light of the story in the \n     Post had told me that the President had helped troubled \n     people in the past and that he had done it many times and \n     that he was a compassionate person and that he helped people \n     also out of his religious conviction and that part it was \n     part of--his nature.\n       Q. And did she also tell you that one of the other reasons \n     he helped people was out of his personal temperament?\n       A. Yes. That is what I mean by that.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. Do you remember telling the President that the First \n     Lady said to you that she felt that with--in reference to the \n     story that he was being attacked for political motives?\n       A. I remember her saying that to me, yes.\n       Q. And you relayed that to the President?\n       A. I'm not sure I relayed that to the President. I may have \n     just relayed the gist of the conversation to him. I don't --\n     I'm not sure whether I relayed the entire conversation.\n\n  Mr. ROGAN: Inviting the Senators and counsel's attention to the June \n4th, 1998 testimony of Mr. Blumenthal, page 47, beginning at line 5.\n\n       By Mr. ROGAN:\n       Q. Mr. Blumenthal, let me just read a passage to you and \n     tell me if this helps to refresh your memory?\n       A. Mm-hmm.\n       Q. Reading at line 5, ``I was in my office, and the \n     President asked me to come to the Oval Office. I was seeing \n     him frequently in this period about the State of the Union \n     and Blair's visit''--that was Prime Minister Tony Blair, as \n     an aside --correct?\n       A. That's right.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. Reading at line 7, ``So I went up to the Oval Office and \n     I began a discussion, and I said that I HAD received--that I \n     had spoken to the First Lady that day in the afternoon about \n     the story that had broke in the morning, and I related to the \n     President my conversation with the First Lady and the \n     conversation went as follows. The First Lady said that she \n     was distressed that the President was being attacked, in her \n     view, for political motives for his ministry of a troubled \n     person. She said that the President ministers to troubled \n     people all the time,'' and then it goes on to--\n       Does that help refresh your recollection with respect to \n     what you told the President the First Lady had said earlier?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. And do you now remember that the First Lady had \n     indicated to you that she felt the President was being \n     attacked for political motives?\n       A. Well, I remember she said that to me.\n       Q. And just getting us back on track, a few moments ago, I \n     think you--you shared with us that the First Lady said \n     that the President helped troubled people and he had done \n     it many times in the past.\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Do you remember testifying before the grand jury on that \n     subject, saying that the First Lady said that he has done \n     this dozens, if not hundreds, of times with people--\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. --with troubled people?\n       A. I recall that.\n       Q. After you related the conversation that you had with the \n     First Lady to the President, what do you remember saying to \n     the President next about the subject of Monica Lewinsky?\n       A. Well, I recall telling him that I understood he felt \n     that way, and that he did help people, but that he should \n     stop trying to help troubled people personally, that troubled \n     people are troubled and that they can get you in a lot of \n     messes and that you had to cut yourself off from it and you \n     just had to do it. That's what I recall saying to him.\n       Q. Do you also remember in that conversation saying to him, \n     ``You really need to not do that at this point, that you \n     can't get near anybody who is even remotely crazy. You're \n     President''?\n       A. Yes. I think that was a little later in the \n     conversation, but I do recall saying that.\n       Q. When you told the President that he should avoid contact \n     with troubled people, what did the President say to you in \n     response?\n       A. I'm trying to remember the sequence of it. He--he said \n     that was very difficult for him. He said he--he felt a need \n     to help troubled people, and it was hard for him to--to cut \n     himself off from doing that.\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\n       Q. Do you remember him saying specifically, ``It's very \n     difficult for me to do that given how I am. I want to help \n     people''?\n       A. I recall--I recall that.\n       Q. And when the President referred to helping people, did \n     you understand him in that conversation to be referring to \n     Monica Lewinsky?\n       A. I think it included Monica Lewinsky, but also many \n     others.\n       Q. Right, but it was your understanding that he was all--he \n     was specifically referring to Monica Lewinsky in that list of \n     people that he tried to help?\n       A. I believe that--that was implied.\n       Q. Do you remember being asked that question before the \n     grand jury and giving the answer, ``I understood that''?\n       A. If you could point it out to me, I'd be happy to see it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       By Mr. ROGAN: Inviting Senators' and counsels' attention to \n     June 25th, 1998 grand jury, page 5, I believe it's at lines 6 \n     through 8.\n       The WITNESS: Yes, I see that. Thank you.\n       By Mr. ROGAN:\n       Q. You recall that now?\n       A. Yes.\n\n  Following this conversation where Mr. Blumenthal told the President \nabout his conversation with the First Lady that day, the President told \nMr. Blumenthal about the President's own conversation he had earlier \nthat day with his pollster, Dick Morris.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Mr. Blumenthal, did the President then relate a \n     conversation he had with Dick Morris to you?\n       A. He did.\n       Q. What was the substance of that conversation, as the \n     President related it to you?\n       A. He said that he had spoken to Dick Morris earlier that \n     day, and that Dick Morris had told him that if Nixon, Richard \n     Nixon, had given a nationally televised speech at the \n     beginning of the Watergate affair, acknowledging everything \n     he had done wrong, he may well have survived it, and that was \n     the conversation that Dick Morris--that's what Dick Morris \n     said to the President.\n       Q. Did it sound to you like the President was suggesting \n     perhaps he would go on television and give a national speech?\n       A. Well, I don't know. I didn't know.\n       Q. When the President related the substance of his \n     conversation with Dick Morris to you, how did you respond to \n     that?\n       A I said to the President, ``Well, what have you done \n     wrong?''\n       Q Did he reply?\n       A He did.\n       Q What did he say?\n       A He said, ``I haven't done anything wrong.''\n       Q And what did you say to that response?\n       A Well, I said, as I recall, ``That's one of the stupidest \n     ideas I ever heard. If you haven't done anything wrong, why \n     would you do that?''\n\n  After denying to Mr. Blumenthal any wrongdoing with Monica Lewinsky, \nthe President then struck the harshest of blows against her. He \nlaunched a preemptive strike against her name and her character to an \naide who he expected would be, and very shortly became, a witness \nbefore a Federal grand jury investigation.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did the President then give you his account of what \n     happened between him and Monica Lewinsky?\n       A As I recall, he did.\n       Q What did the President tell you?\n       A He, uh--he spoke, uh, fairly rapidly, as I recall, at \n     that point and said that she had come on to him and made a \n     demand for sex, that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, \n     and that she, uh, threatened him. And, uh, he said that she \n     said to him, uh, that she was called ``the stalker'' by her \n     peers and that she hated the term, and that she would claim \n     that they had had an affair whether they had or they hadn't, \n     and that she would tell people.\n       Q Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica \n     Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't \n     be known by her peers as ``the stalker'' anymore?\n       A Yes, that's right.\n       Q Do you remember the President also saying that--and I'm \n     quoting--``I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain \n     for a lot of people. I'm not going to do that again''?\n       A Yes. He told me that.\n       Q And that was in the same conversation that you had with \n     the President?\n       A Right, in--in that sequence.\n       Q Can you describe for us the President's demeanor when he \n     shared this information with you?\n       A Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was, a man in \n     anguish.\n       Q And at that point, did you repeat your earlier admonition \n     to him as far as not trying to help troubled people?\n       A I did. I--I think that's when I told him that you can't \n     get near crazy people, uh, or troubled people. Uh, you're \n     President; you just have to separate yourself from this.\n       Q And I'm not sure, based on your testimony, if you gave \n     that admonition to him once or twice. Let me--let me clarify \n     for you why my questioning suggested it was twice. In your \n     grand jury testimony on June the 4th, at page 49, beginning \n     at line 25, you began the sentence by saying, and I quote, \n     ``And I repeated to the President''--\n       A Right.\n       Q --``that he really needed never to be near people who \n     were''--\n       A Right.\n       Q --``troubled like this,'' and so forth. Do you remember \n     now if you--if that was correct? Did you find yourself in \n     that conversation having to repeat the admonition to him that \n     you'd given earlier?\n       A I'm sure I did. Uh, I felt--I felt that pretty strongly. \n     He shouldn't be involved with troubled people.\n       Q Do you remember the President also saying something about \n     being like a character in a novel?\n       A I do.\n       Q What did he say?\n       A Uh, he said to me, uh, that, uh, he felt like a character \n     in a novel. Uh, he felt like somebody, uh, surrounded by, uh, \n     an oppressive environment that was creating a lie about him. \n     He said he felt like, uh, the character in the novel Darkness \n     at Noon.\n       Q Did he also say he felt like he can't get the truth out?\n       A Yes, I--I believe he said that.\n       Q Politicians are always loathe to confess their ignorance, \n     particularly on videotape. I will do so. I'm unfamiliar with \n     the novel Darkness at Noon. Did you--do you have any \n     familiarity with that, or did you understand what the \n     President meant by that?\n       A I--I understood what he meant. I--I was familiar with the \n     book.\n       Q What--what did he mean by that, per your understanding?\n       A Uh, the book is by Arthur Koestler, who was somebody who \n     had been a communist and had become disillusioned with \n     communism. And it's an anti-communist novel. It's about, uh, \n     uh, the Stalinist purge trials and somebody who was a loyal \n     communist who then is put in one of Stalin's prisons and held \n     on trial and executed, uh, and it's about his trial.\n       Q Did you understand what the President was trying to \n     communicate when he related his situation to the character in \n     that novel?\n       A I think he felt that the world was against him.\n       Q I thought only Members of Congress felt that way.\n\n  The President continued to pass along false information to Mr. \nBlumenthal with regard to the substance of his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Blumenthal, did you ever ask the President if he was \n     ever alone with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A I did.\n       Q What was his response?\n       A I asked him a number of questions that appeared in the \n     press that day. I asked him, uh, if he were alone, and he \n     said that, uh, he was within eyesight or earshot of someone \n     when he was with her.\n       Q What other questions do you remember asking him?\n       A Uh, there was a story in the paper that, uh, there were \n     recorded messages, uh, left by him on her voice-mail and I \n     asked him if that were true.\n       Q What did he say?\n       A He said, uh, that it was, that, uh, he had called her.\n       Q You had asked him about a press account that said there \n     were potentially a number of telephone messages left by the \n     President for Monica Lewinsky. And he relayed to you that he \n     called her. Did he tell you how many times he called her?\n       A He--he did. He said he called once. He said he called \n     when, uh, Betty Currie's brother had died, to tell her that.\n       Q And other than that one time that he shared that \n     information with you, he shared no other information \n     respecting additional calls?\n       A No.\n       Q He never indicated to you that there were over 50 \n     telephone conversations between himself and Monica Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q Based on your conversation with the President at that \n     time, would it have surprised you to know that there were \n     over 50--there were records of over 50 telephone \n     conversations with Monica Lewinsky and the President?\n       A Would I have been surprised at that time?\n       Q Yes.\n       A Uh, I--to see those records and if he--I don't fully \n     grasp the question here. Could you--would I have been \n     surprised?\n       Q Based on the President's response to your question at \n     that time, would it have surprised you to have been told or \n     to have later learned that there were over 50 recorded--50 \n     conversations between the President and Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A I did later learn that, uh, as the whole country did, uh, \n     and I was surprised.\n       Q When the President told you that Monica Lewinsky \n     threatened him, did you ever feel compelled to report that \n     information to the Secret Service?\n       A No.\n       Q The FBI or any other law enforcement organization?\n       A No.\n       Q I'm assuming that a threat to the President from somebody \n     in the White House\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\n     would normally send off alarm bells among staff.\n       A It wouldn't--\n       MR. McDANIEL: Well, I'd like to object to the question, \n     Senator. There's no testimony that Mr. Blumenthal learned of \n     a threat contemporaneously with it being made by someone in \n     the White House. This is a threat that was relayed to him \n     sometime afterwards by someone who was no longer employed in \n     the White House. So I think the question doesn't relate to \n     the testimony of this witness.\n       MR. ROGAN: Respectfully, I'm not sure what the legal basis \n     of the objection is. The evidence before us is that the \n     President told the witness that Monica Lewinsky threatened \n     him.\n       [Senators Specter and Edwards conferring.]\n       SENATOR SPECTER: We've conferred and overrule the objection \n     on the ground that it calls for an answer; that, however the \n     witness chooses to answer it, was not a contemporaneous \n     threat, or he thought it was stale, or whatever he thinks. \n     But the objection is overruled.\n       MR. ROGAN: Thank you.\n       BY MR. ROGAN:\n       Q Let me--let me restate the question, if I may. Mr. \n     Blumenthal, would a threat--\n       SENATOR SPECTER: We withdraw the ruling.\n       [Laughter.]\n       MR. McDANIEL: I withdraw my objection, then.\n       [Laughter.]\n       MR. ROGAN: Senator Specter, the ruling is just fine by my \n     light. I'm just going to try to simplify the question for the \n     witness' benefit.\n       SENATOR SPECTER: We'll hold in abeyance a decision on \n     whether to reinstate the ruling.\n       MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Maybe I should just quit while I'm \n     ahead and have the question read back.\n       BY MR. ROGAN:\n       Q Basically, Mr. Blumenthal, what I'm asking is, I mean, \n     normally, would a threat from somebody against the President \n     in the White House typically require some sort of report \n     being made to a law enforcement agency?\n       A Uh, in the abstract, yes.\n       Q This conversation that you had with the President on \n     January the 21st, 1998, how did that conversation conclude?\n       A Uh, I believe we, uh--well, I believe after that, I said \n     to the President that, uh--who was--seemed to me to be upset, \n     that you needed to find some sure footing and to be \n     confident. And, uh, we went on, I believe, to discuss the \n     State of the Union.\n       Q You went on to other business?\n       A Yes, we went on to talk about public policy.\n       Q When this conversation with the President concluded as it \n     related to Monica Lewinsky, what were your feelings toward \n     the President's statement?\n       A Uh, well, they were complex. Uh, I believed him, uh, but \n     I was also, uh--I thought he was very upset. That troubled \n     me. And I also was troubled by his association with troubled \n     people and thought this was not a good story and thought he \n     shouldn't be doing this.\n       Q Do you remember also testifying before the grand jury \n     that you felt that the President's story was a very heartfelt \n     story and that ``he was pouring out his heart, and I believed \n     him''?\n       A Yes, that's what I told the grand jury, I believe; right.\n       Q That was--that was how you interpreted the President's \n     story?\n       A Yes, I did. He was, uh--he seemed--he seemed emotional.\n       Q When the President told you he was helping Monica \n     Lewinsky, did he ever describe to you how he might be helping \n     or ministering to her?\n       A No.\n       Q Did he ever describe how many times he may have tried to \n     help or minister to her?\n       A No.\n       Q Did he tell you how many times he visited with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q Did he tell you how many times Monica Lewinsky visited \n     him in the Oval Office complex?\n       A No.\n       Q. Did he tell you how many times he was alone with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q He never described to you any intimate physical activity \n     he may have had with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A Oh, no.\n       Q Did the President ever tell you that he gave any gifts to \n     Monica Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q Did he tell you that Monica Lewinsky gave him any gifts?\n       A No.\n       Q Based on the President's story as he related on January \n     21st, would it have surprised you to know at that time that \n     there was a repeated gift exchange between Monica Lewinsky \n     and the President?\n       A Well, I learned later about that, and I was surprised.\n       Q The President never told you that he engaged in \n     occasional sexual banter with her on the telephone?\n       A No.\n       Q He never told you about any cover stories that he and \n     Monica Lewinsky may have developed to disguise a \n     relationship?\n       A No.\n       Q He never suggested to you that there might be some \n     physical evidence pointing to a physical relationship between \n     he--between himself and Monica Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q Did the President ever discuss his grand jury--or strike \n     that.\n       Did the President ever discuss his deposition testimony \n     with you in the Paula Jones case on that date?\n       A Oh, no.\n       Q Did he ever tell you that he denied under oath in his \n     Paula Jones deposition that he had an affair with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q Did the President ever tell you that he ministered to \n     anyone else who then made a sexual advance toward him?\n       A No.\n\n  One of the things that the President's counsel has continuously urged \nupon this body, as they did over in the House of Representatives, is to \nlook at the President's state of mind in determining whether, in fact, \nhe committed the crime of perjury. We hope that you will do that. \nBecause nowhere is the President's state of mind more evident than it \nis in the manner in which he dealt with Sidney Blumenthal at this \npoint.\n  Remember, the date of this conversation that Sidney Blumenthal just \nrelated to you was January 21, the day the Monica Lewinsky story broke. \nAbout a month later, Sidney Blumenthal was called to testify as a \nwitness before the grand jury. That was the first time.\n  Five months later or 4 months later Sidney Blumenthal was called back \nto testify to the grand jury--not once, but two more times. From \nJanuary 21 until the end of June 1998, the President had almost 6 \nmonths in which to tell Sidney Blumenthal, after he was subpoenaed, but \nbefore he testified, not to tell the grand jury information that was \nfalse. The President had the opportunity to not use his aide as a \nconduit of false information. Listen to what Sidney Blumenthal said the \nPresident failed to tell him.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q After you were subpoenaed to testify but before you \n     testified before the Federal grand jury, did the President \n     ever recant his earlier statements to you about Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A No.\n       Q After you were subpoenaed but before you testified before \n     the federal grand jury, did the President ever say that he \n     did not want you to mislead the grand jury with a false \n     statement?\n       A No. We didn't have any subsequent conversation about this \n     matter.\n       Q So it would be fair also to say that after you were \n     subpoenaed but before you testified before the Federal grand \n     jury, the President never told you that he was not being \n     truthful with you in that January 21st conversation about \n     Monica Lewinsky?\n       A Uh, he never spoke to me about that at all.\n       Q The President never instructed you before your testimony \n     before the grand jury not to relay his false account of his \n     relationship with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A We--we didn't speak about anything.\n\n  The President of the United States used a special assistant, one of \nhis aides, as a conduit to go before a Federal grand jury and present \nfalse and misleading information and precluded the grand jury from \nbeing able to make an honest determination in their investigation. He \nobstructed justice when he did it, and when he denied that testimony he \ncommitted the offense of perjury.\n  In response to a question from Mr. Manager Graham, Mr. Blumenthal \ncandidly addressed the President's claim under oath that he was \ntruthful with his aides that he knew would be future grand jury \nwitnesses:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q . . . Knowing what you know now, do you believe the \n     President lied to you about his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       A I do.\n       Q I appreciate your honesty . . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q . . . Is it a fair statement, given your previous \n     testimony concerning your 30-minute conversation, that the \n     President was trying to portray himself as a victim of a \n     relationship with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A I think that's the import of his whole story.\n\n  In an earlier presentation, the President's attorney, Mr. Ruff, said \nthat the very same denial the President made to his family and his \nfriends was the same one he made to the American people.\n  Mr. Ruff said:\n\n       Having made the announcement to the whole country, it is \n     simply absurd, I suggest to you, to believe that he was \n     somehow attempting corruptly to influence his senior staff \n     when he told them virtually the same thing at the same time.\n\n  Members of the Senate, Mr. Ruff's conclusion is wrong because his \npremise is wrong. The President didn't tell the American public and his \naides the same thing, nor did he make the\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\nvery same denial. On the contrary, the President went out of his way \nwith his aides to make explicit denials, coupled with character \nassassination against Monica Lewinsky. Why the distinction? Because the \nAmerican public was not destined to be subpoenaed as a witness before \nthe grand jury and the President's aides were.\n  Members of the Senate, our time draws short. The record is replete \nwith other examples which I have addressed and Mr. Manager Hutchinson \nhas addressed dealing with the President's perjuries in other areas, \nfor instance, in the Paula Jones deposition where he emphatically \ndenied having a relationship with Monica Lewinsky that we now know to \nbe true, a relationship that a Federal judge ordered him to discuss \nwith Paula Jones' attorneys because it was relevant information in the \nsexual civil harassment lawsuit.\n  The President's perjury is with respect to Betty Currie and using \nBetty Currie as somebody to be brought into the Oval Office so that he \ncould coach her as a witness and doing everything he could in his own \ntestimony to ensure that the Jones attorney would subpoena her as a \nwitness, to once again use a White House aide as a conduit of false \ninformation before the grand jury.\n\n  I don't feel the need to have to go over this ground with you any \nfurther. In my final couple of minutes, before I reserve time, I do \nwant to raise one last point, because I think it is a valid one and it, \nperhaps, in the long run, is the most important point that this body \nshould consider in coming to their verdict.\n  We have heard an awful lot throughout this entire episode about the \nidea of proportionality of punishment. We have also heard that lying \nabout sex somehow minimizes the perjury because everybody does it. Many \npeople in everyday life under the stress of ordinary relations may well \nlie about personal matters when confronted with embarrassing \nsituations. But, no, everybody doesn't commit perjury under oath in a \ncourt proceeding, having been ordered by a Federal judge to answer \nquestions. And if they did so, they generally don't expect to keep \ntheir job or their liberty if they get caught.\n  The dispensation this President wants for himself is not the same \ndispensation he grants as head of the executive branch to ordinary \nAmericans when they lie about sex under oath. Bill Clinton wants it \nboth ways. The question before this body is whether you are going to \ngive it to him.\n  During our committee hearings, we learned the Clinton administration \nhad no shyness in prosecuting other people for lying under oath about \nconsensual sex in civil cases, even when the underlying civil case was \ndismissed. For instance, Dr. Barbara Battalino was an attorney and a VA \ndoctor when she began a relationship with one of her counseling \npatients at a VA hospital. On a single occasion, she performed an \ninappropriate sexual act with him in her office. The patient later sued \nthe Veterans Administration for, among other things, sexual harassment.\n  During a deposition in this civil lawsuit, Dr. Battalino was asked if \nanything of a sexual nature took place in her office with the patient. \nFearing embarrassment, disgrace and the loss of her job, Dr. Battalino \nanswered, ``No.'' Later, she learned the patient had tape recorded \nconversations which proved she lied about sex under oath.\n  Even though the patient's harassment case was eventually dismissed, \nthe Clinton Justice Department prosecuted Dr. Battalino. She lost her \nmedical license. She lost her right to practice law. She was fired from \nher job. She later agreed to a plea bargain. She was fined $3,500 and \nsentenced to 6 months of imprisonment under electronic monitoring.\n  Listen to the words of Dr. Battalino as she testified before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, and then explain to her the theory of \nproportionality, if you can.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Dr. Battalino, your case intrigues me.\n       I want to make sure I understand the factual circumstances. \n     You lied about a one-time act of consensual sex with someone \n     on Federal property; is that correct?\n       Ms. Battalino. Yes, absolutely, correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. This act of perjury was in a civil lawsuit, not \n     in a criminal case?\n       Ms. Battalino. That's also correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. And, in fact, the civil case eventually was \n     dismissed?\n       Ms. Battalino. Correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. Yet despite the dismissal, you were prosecuted \n     by the Clinton Justice Department for this act of perjury; is \n     that correct?\n       Ms. Battalino. That is correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. I want to know, Dr. Battalino: During your \n     ordeal, during your prosecution, did anybody from the White \n     House, from the Clinton Justice Department, any Members of \n     Congress, or academics from respected universities every show \n     up at your trial and suggest that you should be treated with \n     leniency because ``everybody lies about sex''?\n       Ms. Battalino. No, sir.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did anybody ever come forward from the White \n     House or from the Clinton Justice Department and urge \n     leniency for you because your jerjury was only in a civil \n     case?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did they argue for leniency because the civil \n     case in which you committed perjury was ultimately dismissed?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did anybody from the White House ever say that \n     leniency should be granted to you because you otherwise did \n     your job very well?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did anybody ever come forward from Congress to \n     suggest that you were the victim of an overzealous or sex-\n     obsessed prosecutor?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Mr. Rogan. Now, according to the New York Times, they \n     report that you lied when your lawyer asked you at a \n     deposition whether ``anything of a sexual nature'' occurred; \n     is that correct?\n       Ms. Battalino. Yes, that is correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did anybody from Congress or from the White \n     House come forward to defend you, saying that that phrase was \n     ambiguous or it all depended on what the word ``anything'' \n     meant?\n       Ms. Battalino. No, sir. May I just--I am not sure it was my \n     lawyer that asked the question, but that is the exact \n     question that I was asked.\n       Mr. Rogan. The question that was asked that caused your \n     prosecution for perjury.\n       Ms. Battalino. That's correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. No one ever argued that that phrase itself was \n     ambiguous, did they?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Ms. Waters. Will the gentleman yield?\n       Mr. Rogan. Regrettably, my time is limited and I will not \n     yield for that reason.\n       Now, Doctor, you lost two licenses. You lost a law license.\n       Ms. Battalino. Well, I have a law degree. I was not a \n     member of any bar.\n       Mr. Rogan. Your conviction precludes you from practicing \n     law?\n       Ms. Battalino. That is correct, sir.\n       Mr. Rogan. You also had a medical degree and license.\n       Ms. Battalino. That is correct.\n       Mr. Rogan. You lost your medical license?\n       Ms. Battalino. Yes. I am no longer permitted to practice \n     medicine either.\n       Mr. Rogan. Did anybody from either the White House or from \n     Congress come forward during your prosecution, or during your \n     sentencing, and suggest that rather than you suffer the \n     severe punishment of no longer being able to practice your \n     profession, perhaps you should simply just receive some sort \n     of rebuke or censure?\n       Ms. Battalino. No one came to my aid or defense, no.\n       Mr. Rogan. Nobody from the Clinton Justice Department \n     suggested that during your sentencing hearing?\n       Ms. Battalino. No.\n       Mr. Rogan. Has anybody come forward from the White House to \n     suggest to you that in light of circumstances, as we now see \n     them unfolding, you should be pardoned for your offense?\n       Ms. Battalino. Nobody has come no. . . .\n\n  That is how the Clinton administration defines proportionality in \npunishment.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. The Chair recognizes the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe now we are prepared to hear \nfrom White House counsel for up to 3 hours. How much time is remaining \nfor the House managers?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thirty-one minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Chief Justice suggest we take a brief break here?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. No, let's keep going.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right, sir.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. I guess that settles that.\n  (Laughter.)\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Counsel Seligman.\n  Ms. Counsel SELIGMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, the House managers have suggested to you that the deposition of \nMs. Lewinsky helped their case. The opposite is true. Ms. Lewinsky \nundermined critical aspects of the House managers' obstruction case.\n  As those of you who watched the entire video are well aware, the \nmanagers have cleverly snipped here and there in\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\nan effort to present their story even if, as a result, the story they \nare telling you is not Ms. Lewinsky's story. They have distorted, they \nhave omitted, and they have created a profoundly erroneous impression.\n  So let's look at the facts.\n  In her deposition this week, Ms. Lewinsky reaffirmed her previous \ntestimony and provided extremely useful supplements to that testimony. \nWe asked her no questions. Why? Because there was no need. Her \ntestimony exonerated the President. In four areas in particular, what \nshe said demonstrates that the allegations in the articles cannot \nstand.\n  First, she refuted the allegations in article II, subpart (1), with \nrespect to alleged efforts to obstruct and influence Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit.\n  Second, she contradicted the allegations in article II, subpart (2), \nwith respect to alleged efforts to influence Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nas distinct from her affidavit.\n  Third, she undermined the allegations in article II, subpart (3), \nwith respect to alleged efforts to conceal gifts.\n  And fourth, she rebutted the allegations in article II, subpart (4), \nwith respect to Ms. Lewinsky's job search.\n  I will discuss each briefly.\n  Let's begin with the December 17 phone call between the President and \nMs. Lewinsky, which is at the heart of article II's first two subparts. \nThe managers have consistently exaggerated the facts, the impact, and \nthe import of this conversation. They have relentlessly argued that you \nshould draw inferences and conclusions that are not supported by the \nevidence. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony this week should put an end to these \ninflated claims about that call.\n  Article II charges, in subpart (1), that the President: ``On or about \nDecember 17, 1997,'' ``corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal \ncivil rights action brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in \nthat proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.''\n  ``On or about December 17.'' In other words, the allegation is firmly \ngrounded in the December 17 phone call. That is where the House of \nRepresentatives charged the deed was done. That is the single event on \nwhich the managers base the first obstruction of justice charge.\n  Indeed, Mr. Manager McCollum made this point emphatically before the \nSenate. He claimed:\n\n       In this context, the evidence is compelling that the \n     President committed both the crimes of obstruction of justice \n     and witness tampering right then and there on December 17th.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       Now, Monica Lewinsky's testimony is so clear about this \n     that the President's lawyers probably won't spend a lot of \n     time with you on this; they didn't in the Judiciary \n     Committee. I could be wrong, and they probably will just to \n     show me I am wrong.\n\n  Well, Mr. McCollum was wrong in one respect. We do plan to spend time \non that call. But he was absolutely right in another respect. He was \ncorrect that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is so clear on this issue. It is \nso clear it exonerates the President.\n  The managers asked this body to permit the deposition and later the \nlive testimony of Ms. Lewinsky to complete their proof. As Mr. Manager \nBryant stated:\n\n       An appropriate examination--and an appropriate cross-\n     examination, I might add; let's don't limit the White House \n     attorneys here--of Ms. Lewinsky on the factual disputes of \n     the affidavit and their cover story, wouldn't that be nice to \n     hear?\n\n  Well, the managers got their examination of Ms. Lewinsky about the \nDecember 17 phone call, and it defeated the charge. It showed that she \nand the President did not discuss the content of an affidavit--never \never. Again, the managers ask you to convict the President and remove \nhim from office for what turns out to be his silence. No discussion of \ncontent.\n  Let's listen to the testimony of Monica Lewinsky about that December \n17 phone call. It is critically important. And we are showing it to you \nunvarnished, not in snippets, because the snippets you have seen are \nterribly misleading. The tape you will hear establishes beyond doubt \nthat she and the President did not discuss the content of the affidavit \nin that call, or ever. It establishes beyond doubt that what happened \nis not obstruction of justice.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Sometime back in December of 1997, in the morning of \n     December the 17th, did you receive a call from the President?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. What was the purpose of that call? What did you talk \n     about?\n       A. It was threefold--first, to tell me that Ms. Currie's \n     brother had been killed in a car accident; second, to tell me \n     that my name was on a witness list for the Paula Jones case; \n     and thirdly, he mentioned the Christmas present he had for \n     me.\n       Q. This telephone call was somewhere in the early morning \n     hours of 2 o'clock to 2:30.\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. Did it surprise you that he called you so late?\n       A. No.\n       Q. Was this your first notice of your name being on the \n     Paula Jones witness list?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. I realize he, he commented about some other things, but \n     I do want to focus on the witness list.\n       A. Okay.\n       Q. Did he say anything to you about how he felt concerning \n     this witness list?\n       A. He said it broke his heart that, well, that my name was \n     on the witness list.\n       Can I take a break, please? I'm sorry.\n       SENATOR DeWINE: Sure, sure.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       BY MR. BRYANT:\n       Q. Did--did we get your response? We were talking about the \n     discussion you were having with the President over the \n     telephone, early morning of the December 17th phone call, and \n     he had, uh, mentioned that it broke his heart that you were \n     on that list.\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. And I think you were about to comment on that further, \n     and then you need a break.\n       A. No.\n       Q. No.\n       A. I just wanted to be able to focus--I know this is an \n     important date, so I felt I need a few moments to be able to \n     focus on it.\n       Q. And you're comfortable now with that, with your--you are \n     ready to talk about that?\n       A. Comfortable, I don't know, but I'm ready to talk about.\n       Q. Well, I mean comfortable that you can focus on it.\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. Good. Now, with this discussion of the fact that your \n     name appeared as a witness, had you--had you been asleep that \n     night when the phone rang?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. So were you wide awake by this point? It's the President \n     calling you, so I guess you're--you wake up.\n       A. I wouldn't say wide awake.\n       Q. He expressed to you that your name--you know, again, you \n     talked about some other things--but he told you your name was \n     on the list.\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. What was your reaction to that?\n       A. I was scared.\n       Q. What other discussion did you have in regard to the fact \n     that your name was on the list? You were scared; he was \n     disappointed, or it broke his heart. What other discussion \n     did you have?\n       A. Uh, I believe he said that, uh--and these are not \n     necessarily direct quotes, but to the best of my memory, that \n     he said something about that, uh, just because my name was on \n     the list didn't necessarily mean I'd be subpoenaed; and at \n     some point, I asked him what I should do if I received a \n     subpoena. He said I should, uh, I should let Ms. Currie know. \n     Uh--\n       Q. Did he say anything about an affidavit?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. What did he say?\n       A. He said that, uh, that I could possibly file an \n     affidavit if I--if I were subpoenaed, that I could possibly \n     file an affidavit maybe to avoid being deposed.\n       Q. How did he tell you you would avoid being deposed by \n     filing an affidavit?\n       A. I don't think he did.\n       Q. You just accepted that statement?\n       A. [Nodding head.]\n       Q. Yes?\n       A. Yes, yes. Sorry.\n       Q. Are you, uh--strike that. Did he make any representation \n     to you about what you could say in that affidavit or--\n       A. No.\n       Q. What did you understand you would be saying in that \n     affidavit to avoid testifying?\n       A. Uh, I believe I've testified to this in the grand jury. \n     To the best of my recollection, it was, uh--to my mind came--\n     it was a range of things. I mean, it could either be, uh, \n     something innocuous or could go as far as having to deny the \n     relationship. Not being a lawyer nor having gone to law \n     school, I thought it could be anything.\n       Q. Did he at that point suggest one version or the other \n     version?\n       A. No. I didn't even mention that, so there, there wasn't a \n     further discussion--there was no discussion of what would be \n     in an affidavit.\n       Q. When you say, uh, it would be--it could have been \n     something where the relationship was denied, what was your \n     thinking at that point?\n       A. I--I--I think I don't understand what you're asking me. \n     I'm sorry.\n       Q. Well, based on prior relations with the President, the \n     concocted stories and those things like that, did this come \n     to mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come \n     to your mind about these stories--the cover stories?\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n       A. Not in connection with the--not in connection with the \n     affidavit.\n       Q. How would--was there any discussion of how you would \n     accomplish preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?\n       A. No.\n       Q. Why--why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you--\n     why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?\n       A. First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second \n     of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula Jones \n     or her case. And--I guess those two reasons.\n       Q. You--you have already mentioned that you were not a \n     lawyer and you had not been to law school, those kinds of \n     things. Did, uh, did you understand when you--the potential \n     legal problems that you could have caused yourself by \n     allowing a false affidavit to be filed with the court, in a \n     court proceeding?\n       A. During what time--I mean--I--can you be--I'm sorry--\n       Q. At this point, I may ask it again at later points, but \n     the night of the telephone--\n       A. Are you--are you still referring to December 17th?\n       Q. The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could \n     file an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of \n     filing a false affidavit with the court?\n       A. I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it \n     would have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't--I \n     don't remember having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I \n     would remember something like that, and I don't, but--\n       Q. Did you know what an affidavit was?\n       A. Sort of.\n       Q. Of course, you're talking at that time by telephone to \n     the President, and he's--and he is a lawyer, and he taught \n     law school--I don't know--did you know that? Did you know he \n     was a lawyer?\n       A. I--I think I knew it, but it wasn't something that was \n     present in my, in my thoughts, as in he's a lawyer, he's \n     telling me, you know, something.\n       Q. Did the, did the President ever tell you, caution you, \n     that you had to tell the truth in an affidavit?\n       A. Not that I recall.\n       Q. It would have been against his interest in that lawsuit \n     for you to have told the truth, would it not?\n       A. I'm not really comfortable--I mean, I can tell you what \n     would have been in my best interest, but I--\n       Q. But you didn't file the affidavit for your best \n     interest, did you?\n       A. Uh, actually, I did.\n       Q. To avoid testifying.\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. But had you testified truthfully, you would have had \n     no--certainly, no legal implications--it may have been \n     embarrassing, but you would have not had any legal problems, \n     would you?\n       A. That's true.\n       Q. Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of--I \n     would draw your attention to the cover stories. I have \n     alluded to that earlier, but, uh, did you talk about cover \n     story that night?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. And what was said?\n       A. Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something--\n     you can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing \n     me papers.\n       Q. I think you've testified that you're sure he said that \n     that night. You are sure he said that that night?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?\n       A. I don't believe so, no.\n       Q. Why would he have told you you could always say that?\n       A. I don't know.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We're at that point that we've got a telephone conversation \n     in the morning with you and the President, and he has among \n     other things mentioned to you that your name is on the Jones \n     witness list. He has also mentioned to you that perhaps you \n     could file an affidavit to avoid possible testifying in that \n     case. Is that right?\n       A Correct.\n       Q And he has also, I think, now at the point that we were \n     in our questioning, referenced the cover story that you and \n     he had had, that perhaps you could say that you were coming \n     to my office to deliver papers or to see Betty Currie; is \n     that right?\n       A Correct. It was from the entire relationship, that story.\n       Q Now, when he alluded to that cover story, was that \n     instantly familiar to you?\n       A Yes.\n       Q You knew what he was talking about?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And why was this familiar to you?\n       A Because it was part of the pattern of the relationship.\n       Q Had you actually had to use elements of this cover story \n     in the past?\n       A I think so, yes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q Okay. Now let me go back again to the December 11th \n     date--I'm sorry--the 17th. This is the conversation in the \n     morning. What else--was there anything else you talked about \n     in terms of--other than your name being on the list and the \n     affidavit and the cover story?\n       A Yes. I had--I had had my own thoughts on why and how he \n     should settle the case, and I expressed those thoughts to \n     him. And at some point, he mentioned that he still had this \n     Christmas present for me and that maybe he would ask Mrs. \n     Currie to come in that weekend, and I said not to because she \n     was obviously going to be in mourning because of her brother.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories \n     were reiterated to you by the President that night on the \n     telephone--\n       A Correct.\n       Q --and after he told you you would be a witness--or your \n     name was on the witness list, I should say?\n       A Correct.\n       Q And did you understand that since your name was on the \n     witness list that there would be a possibility that you could \n     be subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case?\n       A I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and \n     there was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I \n     necessarily thought it was a subpoena to testify, but--\n       Q Were you in fact subpoenaed to testify?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And that was what--\n       A December 19th, 1997.\n       Q December 19th.\n       Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I think your \n     closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie, but \n     yet in that very conversation of December the 17th, 1997 when \n     the President told you that you were on the witness list, he \n     also suggested that you could sign an affidavit and use \n     misleading cover stories. Isn't that correct?\n       A Uh--well, I--I guess in my mind, I separate necessarily \n     signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories. So, \n     does--\n       Q Well, those two--\n       A Those three events occurred, but they don't--they weren't \n     linked for me.\n       Q But they were in the same conversation, were they not?\n       A Yes, they were.\n       Q Did you understand in the context of the conversation \n     that you would deny the--the President and your relationship \n     to the Jones lawyers?\n       A Do you mean from what was said to me or--\n       Q In the context of that--in the context of that \n     conversation, December the 17th--\n       A I--I don't--I didn't--\n       Q Okay. Let me ask it. Did you understand in the context of \n     the telephone conversation with the President that early \n     morning of December the 17th--did you understand that you \n     would deny your relationship with the President to the Jones \n     lawyers through use of these cover stories?\n       A From what I learned in that--oh, through those cover \n     stories, I don't know, but from what I learned in that \n     conversation, I thought to myself I knew I would deny the \n     relationship.\n       Q And you would deny the relationship to the Jones lawyers?\n       A Yes, correct.\n       Q Good.\n       A If--if that's what it came to.\n       Q And in fact you did deny the relationship to the Jones \n     lawyers in the affidavit that you signed under penalty of \n     perjury; is that right?\n       A I denied a sexual relationship.\n       Q The President did not in that conversation on December \n     the 17th of 1997 or any other conversation, for that matter, \n     instruct you to tell the truth; is that correct?\n       A That's correct.\n       Q And prior to being on the witness list, you--you both \n     spoke--\n       A Well, I guess any conversation in relation to the Paula \n     Jones case. I can't say that any conversation from the--the \n     entire relationship that he didn't ever say, you know, ``Are \n     you mad? Tell me the truth.'' So--\n       Q And prior to being on the witness list, you both spoke \n     about denying this relationship if asked?\n       A Yes. That was discussed.\n       Q He would say something to the effect that--or you would \n     say that--you--you would deny anything if it ever came up, \n     and he would nod or say that's good, something to that \n     effect; is that right?\n       A Yes, I believe I testified to that.\n       Q In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has \n     indicated that he thought he had--might have had a way that \n     he could have you--get you to file a--basically a true \n     affidavit, but yet still skirt these issues enough that you \n     wouldn't be called as a witness.\n       Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?\n       A He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at \n     all, ever.\n\n  Now, there is a lot there, but that's the testimony. I would like to \ngo quickly through some parts of it. First, let's be very clear, as you \nsaw, Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told Mr. Manager Bryant that she and the \nPresident did not discuss the content of the affidavit in that phone \ncall.\n  Let's listen quickly again:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Are you, uh--strike that. Did he make any representation \n     to you about what you could say in that affidavit or--\n       A No.\n       Q What did you understand you would be saying in that \n     affidavit to avoid testifying?\n       A Uh, I believe I've testified to this in the grand jury. \n     To the best of my recollection, it was, uh--to my mind came--\n     it was a range of things. I mean, it could either be, uh, \n     something innocuous or could go as far as having to deny the \n     relationship. Not being a lawyer nor having gone to law \n     school, I thought it could be anything.\n       Q Did he at that point suggest one version or the other \n     version?\n       A No. I didn't even mention that, so there, there wasn't a \n     further discussion--there was\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\n     no discussion of what would be in an affidavit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has \n     indicated that he thought he had--might have had a way that \n     he could have you--get you to file a--basically a true \n     affidavit, but yet still skirt these issues enough that you \n     wouldn't be called as a witness.\n       Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?\n       A He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at \n     all, ever.\n\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the managers skipped these excerpts. They \nhid from you this key fact about the call. To borrow a phrase, they \n``want to win too badly.''\n  In that excerpt, Ms. Lewinsky also made clear that the President only \nsuggested she might be able to file an affidavit that might enable her \nto avoid testifying.\n  Let's listen:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Did he say anything about an affidavit?\n       A Yes.\n       Q What did he say?\n       A He said that, uh, that I could possibly file an affidavit \n     if I--if I were subpoenaed, that I could possibly file an \n     affidavit maybe to avoid being deposed.\n       Q How did he tell you you would avoid being deposed by \n     filing an affidavit?\n       A I don't think he did.\n       Q You just accepted that statement?\n       A [Nodding head.]\n       Q Yes?\n       A Yes, yes. Sorry.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Q And in that same telephone conversation, he encouraged you to file \nan affidavit in the Jones case?\n  A He suggested I could file an affidavit.\n  She also made clear that the President was not certain she even would \nbe subpoenaed and have to confront the issue.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q What other discussion did you have in regard to the fact \n     that your name was on the list? You were scared; he was \n     disappointed, or it broke his heart. What other discussion \n     did you have?\n       A Uh, I believe he said that, uh--and these are not \n     necessarily direct quotes, but to the best of my memory, that \n     he said something about that, uh, just because my name was on \n     the list didn't necessarily mean I'd be subpoenaed; and at \n     some point, I asked him what I should do if I received a \n     subpoena. He said I should, uh, I should let Ms. Currie know. \n     Uh----\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q How would--was there any discussion of how you would \n     accomplish preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?\n       A No.\n\n  Now, where does this leave us? Ms. Lewinsky described a brief \nconversation in which the President mentioned the possibility that an \naffidavit might enable her to avoid testifying if the need for it \narose, and they left the subject. No discussion of content. No \ndiscussion of logistics. No discussion of timing. Virtually no \ndiscussion at all. And that very brief exchange is the heart of the \ncase.\n  Now, the managers contend that because Ms. Lewinsky also recalls a \nreference to cover stories in that call, it is clear beyond doubt that \nthe President instructed her to file a false affidavit.\n  But for at least two reasons, this claim fails also. First, Ms. \nLewinsky repeatedly told Mr. Manager Bryant that the mention of cover \nstories in that call was not connected to the mention of a possible \naffidavit--a position, I must note, that she had taken with the \nindependent counsel for a very long time.\n  Second, Ms. Lewinsky has insisted for more than a year that the cover \nstories were not, in any event, false--a position she reasserted this \nweek in explaining why an affidavit didn't necessarily have to be \nfalse.\n  Let's look quickly at Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, first, with respect \nto the alleged connection between cover stories and the affidavit.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Well, based on prior relations with the President, the \n     concocted stories and those things like that, did this come \n     to mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come \n     to your mind about these stories--the cover stories?\n       A Not in connection with the--not in connection with the \n     affidavit.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of--I \n     would draw your attention to the cover stories. I have \n     alluded to that earlier, but, uh, did you talk about cover \n     story that night?\n       A Yes, sir.\n       Q And what was said?\n       A Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something--you \n     can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing me \n     papers.\n       Q I think you've testified that you're sure he said that \n     that night. You are sure he said that that night?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?\n       A I don't believe so, no.\n       Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I think your \n     closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie, but \n     yet in that very conversation of December the 17th, 1997 when \n     the President told you that you were on the witness list, he \n     also suggested that you could sign an affidavit and use \n     misleading cover stories. Isn't that correct?\n       A Uh--well, I--I guess in my mind, I separate necessarily \n     signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories. So, \n     does--\n       Q Well, those two--\n       A Those three events occurred, but they don't--they weren't \n     linked for me.\n  Again, the managers did not play these excerpts for you either. They \ndon't want you to know Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, which is that the \ncover stories and the affidavit were not connected in that telephone \ncall. And that is the call that is at the heart of that first \nobstruction charge.\n  The managers have suggested to you that Ms. Lewinsky for the first \ntime this week offered responses, responses concerning the literal \ntruth, for example, of the cover story designed to help the President. \nThat was a suggestion a few days ago. Concerned then that the testimony \nmight now undermine their case, they suddenly did an about-face and \nattacked her on Thursday.\n  Through these proceedings, the managers have consistently told you \nhow credible a witness Ms. Lewinsky is and they have invoked her \nimmunity agreement as the reason that she must be honest, and today \nthey again credit her testimony, but carefully, only in snippets, only \nwhen it suits their purposes. The responses Ms. Lewinsky provided about \nthe cover story that were mentioned on Thursday by Mr. Manager Bryant \nare not new; they are the same responses Ms. Lewinsky gave to the \nindependent counsel. For example, when asked about the so-called cover \nstory, Ms. Lewinsky testified as follows this week.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Would you agree that these cover stories that you've just \n     testified to, if they were told to the attorneys for Paula \n     Jones, that they would be misleading to them and not be the \n     whole story, the whole truth?\n       A They would--yes, I guess misleading. They were literally \n     true, but they would be misleading, so incomplete.\n\n  The managers suggest that this testimony may be new, different, \ntinted, and tainted, I think they said on Thursday, but they don't tell \nyou that Ms. Lewinsky said the very same things to the independent \ncounsel. She did so repeatedly, and she did so--and this is key--before \nthe President testified. She didn't know what he would say. He didn't \nknow what she had said.\n  For example, Ms. Lewinsky referred to the two cover stories in her \nFebruary 1998 proffer, more than a year ago. Remember, one such cover \nstory concerned the reasons for visiting the President before she left \nthe White House. That was to bring papers to him. And the other \nconcerned her reasons for visiting the President after she left the \nWhite House, and that was to visit Betty Currie. Ms. Lewinsky was asked \nand said that neither of these statements was untrue and also that \nthere was truth to both of these statements in her proffer a year ago.\n  She repeated this testimony in July to the independent counsel, \ntelling an FBI agent that ``these statements were not untrue but were \nmisleading'' and that ``some facts were omitted from this statement.'' \nThat is what she said this week.\n  The cover story testimony is consistent and is consistently \nexculpatory. Of course, it was easy for Mr. Manager Bryant to stand \nbefore you on Thursday reminiscing about the open and forthcoming Ms. \nLewinsky he had met during the informal interview. It was easy for Mr. \nManager Bryant to complain that the Ms. Lewinsky of the deposition was, \nI believe he said, not open to discussion or fully responsive to their \ninquiry. Let the questions and answers let you be the judge of that. It \nwas easy for him to say that, because the House managers had refused \nSenator Daschle's request that they be allowed to make a transcript of \nthe interview. That absence of a transcript\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nallowed them this unverifiable fallback if their examination was \ndisappointing: Oh, she changed on us. The truth is that she didn't tell \nthe story that the managers wanted to hear. Remember those stubborn \nfacts.\n\n  So we know that the managers are disappointed and want to blame their \ndisappointment on Ms. Lewinsky. But when you get to the substance of \ntoday's presentation by the House managers, it shows that they have not \nin fact identified any significant area where Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \non Monday differs from her earlier testimony in the grand jury. Her \nview of the cover story has been consistent from day 1.\n  Mr. Manager McCollum has also insisted that in the December 17 call \nit was clear both to the President and Ms. Lewinsky that the affidavit \nhad to be false. As he put it--and I quote-- ``Can there be any doubt \nthat the President was suggesting that they file an affidavit that \ncontained lies and falsehoods that might keep her from ever having to \ntestify in the Jones case, and give the President the kind of \nprotection he needed when he testified?'' Yes, there surely is doubt.\n  Ms. Lewinsky herself explains this week that she did not discuss the \ncontent of the affidavit with the President--we played those portions \nalready and I will not again--but also that in her mind an affidavit \npresented a whole range of possibilities that were not necessarily \nfalse.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could \n     file an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of \n     filing a false affidavit with the court?\n       A I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it \n     would have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't--I \n     don't remember having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I \n     would remember something like that, and I don't, but--\n\n  Thus, as we have seen and heard, Ms. Lewinsky testified that there \nwas no discussion of what would be in the affidavit and also that, to \nher thinking, the affidavit would not necessarily have been false.\n  Now that the December 17 call has fallen short, the managers have \ntried to transform the articles, as drafted, by asserting that the \nalleged obstruction occurred also on another date, January 5, in a call \nthat took place then, even though the articles pin everything on \nDecember 17.\n  With respect to a January 5 call, Mr. Manager Hutchinson made the \nfollowing claim to you. He asserted, and I quote:\n\n       Well, the record demonstrates that Monica Lewinsky's \n     testimony is that she had a conversation with the President \n     on the telephone in which she asked questions about the \n     affidavit. She was concerned about signing that affidavit and \n     according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said, ``Well, you \n     could always say the people in legislative affairs got it for \n     you or helped you get it.''\n\n  This is still a quote:\n\n       And that is in reference to a paragraph in a particular \n     affidavit.\n\n  Those were Mr. Manager Hutchinson's words. But the record \nunequivocally demonstrates that Ms. Lewinsky and the President did not \never discuss the content of that affidavit in this January 5 call or \notherwise. And I challenge you to find any paragraph in Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit, either her draft or the final, reflecting this \nconversation. There isn't one. The call wasn't about the affidavit. He \ndidn't tell her what to say in the affidavit. It is just not there.\n\n  In fact, Mr. Manager Hutchinson repeatedly represented to you that \nMs. Lewinsky reviewed the content of her affidavit with the President. \nHe had to say that because he is asking you to remove the President \nfrom office for getting her to file a false affidavit. That is a tough \nsell if they never talked about the content of the affidavit. That is \nwhy he told you, and I quote, ``On January 6th''--5th or 6th--``she \ndiscussed that with the President, signing that affidavit, and the \ncontent of the affidavit.''\n  That is why Mr. Manager Hutchinson also told you, ``She went over the \ncontents of that, even though she might not have had it in hand, with \nthe President.''\n  That is just not true. It is not true. To borrow a phrase, again: It \nis wanting to win too much. What is clear from Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nis that she never went over the contents of the affidavit with the \nPresident, on January 5 or at any other time. Let's watch a brief \nexcerpt about this matter.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Did--did the subject of the affidavit come up with the \n     President?\n       A. Yes, towards the end of the conversation.\n       Q. And how did--tell us how that occurred.\n       A. I believe I asked him if he wanted to see a copy of it, \n     and he said no.\n       Q. Well, I mean, how did you introduce that into the \n     subject--into the conversation?\n       A. I don't really remember.\n       Q. Did he ask you, well, how's the affidavit coming or--\n       A. No, I don't think so.\n       Q. But you told him that you had one being prepared, or \n     something?\n       A. I think I said--I think I said, you know, I'm going to \n     sign an affidavit, or something like that.\n       Q. Did he ask you what are you going to say?\n       A. No.\n       Q. And this is the time when he said something about 15 \n     other affidavits?\n       A. Correct.\n       Q. And tell us as best as you can recall what--how that--\n     how that part of the conversation went.\n       A. I think that was the--sort of the other half of his \n     sentence as, No, you know, I don't want to see it. I don't \n     need to--or, I've seen 15 others.\n       It was a little flippant.\n       Q. In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has \n     indicated that he thought he had--might have had a way that \n     he could have you--get you to file a--basically a true \n     affidavit, but yet still skirt these issues enough that you \n     wouldn't be called as a witness.\n       Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?\n       A. He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me at \n     all, ever.\n\n  In fact, Ms. Lewinsky made clear she did not have any indication \nwhatsoever that the President learned of the content of the affidavit \nfrom Mr. Jordan, either.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. The fact that you assume that Mr. Jordan was in contact \n     with the President--and I believe the evidence would support \n     that through his own testimony that he had talked to the \n     President about the signed affidavit and that he had kept the \n     President updated on the subpoena issue and the job search--\n       A. Sir, I'm not sure that I knew he was having contact with \n     the President about this. I--I think what I said was that I \n     felt that it was getting his approval. It didn't necessarily \n     mean that I felt he was going to get a direct approval from \n     the President.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. Did you have any indication from Mr. Jordan that he--\n     when he discussed the signed affidavit with the President, \n     they were discussing some of the contents of the affidavit? \n     Did you have--\n       A. Before I signed it or--\n       Q. No; during the drafting stage.\n       A. No, absolutely not--either/or. I didn't. No, I did not.\n\n  Finally, lacking any direct evidence of any kind that there was a \ndiscussion about the content of the affidavit, the managers have argued \nagain and again that the President must have told Ms. Lewinsky to file \na false affidavit because it was in his interest, not hers, to avoid \nher testifying in the Jones case. Mr. Manager Bryant argued to you at \nthe start of these proceedings, ``When everything is said and done, Ms. \nLewinsky had no motivation, no reason whatsoever, to want to commit a \ncrime by willfully submitting a false affidavit with a court of law. \nShe really did not need to do this at that point in her life.''\n  Mr. Manager Bryant also argued that only the President would benefit \nfrom a false affidavit, so he must have instructed her to do it. As he \nput it, ``Ms. Lewinsky files a false affidavit in the Jones case. What \nis the result of filing that false affidavit and who benefited from \nthat?''\n  But he was wrong. He was wrong, as Ms. Lewinsky made very clear when \nMr. Manager Bryant asked her about this very subject this week. Let's \nlisten to what she said:\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. But you didn't file the affidavit for your best \n     interest, did you?\n       A. Uh, actually, I did.\n       Q. To avoid testifying.\n       A. Yes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q. Why--why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you--\n     why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?\n       A. First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second \n     of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula Jones \n     or her case. And--I guess those two reasons.\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky concedes that she had a reason to act on her own.\n  Now, we have been discussing subpart (1) of article II, the affidavit \nallegation. But this testimony also undermined subpart (2) of article \nII, which\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\nalleges that the President obstructed justice in that very same phone \ncall by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to lie in any testimony that she might \ngive. Ms. Lewinsky previously denied that she and the President ever \ndiscussed the content of any deposition testimony in that conversation. \nThat happened before this week. Indeed, she had told the FBI that she \nand the President never discussed what to say about her visits to the \nWhite House in the context of the Paula Jones case. And the managers \nthemselves said, in a press release on January 19 of this year, that \nthe President and Ms. Lewinsky ``did not discuss the deposition that \nevening because Monica had not yet been subpoenaed.''\n  So it is not entirely surprising that the managers did not ask Ms. \nLewinsky to confirm that she and the President talked about the \ntestimony in this call, even though that is where the obstruction \nallegedly occurred. They didn't ask her about that this week because \nthey knew the answer. They knew the answer was ``No.'' They knew there \nwas no discussion about the content of her testimony during that call. \nAnd the testimony you have seen today confirms that answer \nresoundingly. There is no evidence to support the charge in subpart (2) \neither. The managers did not even try to elicit it.\n  The President did not obstruct justice. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nexplodes these two claims arising out of the December 17 telephone \ncall.\n  Now let's turn to the allegation in article (2) concerning gifts. \nSubpart (3) charges that:\n\n       On or about December 28, 1997, [the President] corruptly \n     engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal \n     evidence that had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights \n     action brought against him.\n\n  Now, the managers have indicated to you that Ms. Lewinsky provided \ntestimony useful to their case with respect to the President's \ninvolvement in the transfer of gifts to Ms. Currie. We must have \nattended a different deposition. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nprovides powerful support for the position that Ms. Lewinsky decided on \nher own to keep from the Jones lawyers the gifts she had received from \nthe President. It provides powerful support for the position that she \nhad her own reasons and concerns for keeping the gifts from them. And \nit provides powerful support for the position that she never discussed \neither the topic of gifts or her own reasons for concern with the \nPresident before making her own independent decision on how to handle \nthe gifts.\n  Perhaps most notably, her testimony also provides corroboration for \nthe President's testimony that he told her she had to turn over to the \nJones lawyers what gifts she had. That is new evidence. But it \nundermines the managers' case, it doesn't help it.\n  In one of the most extraordinary points in the deposition--and we \nwill get to this in a moment--we learned that the Office of Independent \nCounsel failed to disclose to the House, to the Senate, to the \nPresident, Ms. Lewinsky's exculpatory statement on this point.\n  Since the OIC evidently had chosen not to share the information with \nus, with the House or with this body, we owe the managers a small debt \nof gratitude for allowing us to learn of it here.\n  Now let's look at the record with respect to the phone calls giving \nrise to the gift pickup. The managers repeatedly asserted at the outset \nthat they could prove Ms. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky and not the other \nway around. They claimed they had found a cell phone record documenting \nthat initial call to arrange to pick up the gifts. As Mr. Manager \nHutchinson said tantalizingly at the start of these proceedings:\n\n       Well, it was not known at the time of the questioning of \n     Monica Lewinsky, but since then, the cell phone record was \n     retrieved. And you don't have it in front of you, but it will \n     be available. The cell phone record was retrieved that showed \n     on Betty Currie's cell phone calls that a call was made at \n     3:32 p.m. from Betty Currie to Monica Lewinsky and--\n\n  Still under quotes--\n\n     this confirms the testimony of Monica Lewinsky that the \n     followup to get the gifts came from Betty Currie.\n\n  That is what Mr. Manager Hutchinson promised the record would show. \nBut that is not, in the end, what the record now shows. There is no \nevidence that the cell phone call initiated the process, as the \nmanagers claimed, and since there is no evidence that that call from \nMs. Currie was the call initiating the process, there is no documentary \nevidence that Ms. Currie initiated the process. It is that simple. The \nproof has failed.\n  What the record does show is that there was a cell phone call that \nday, a proposition that no one has ever disputed. Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified to the managers that she recalls a cell phone call that day. \nLet's look at the testimony. This passage that you are about to see \naddresses the calls between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie on December 28. \nMs. Lewinsky has just described Ms. Currie's call to her about picking \nsomething up, and this is what follows.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Did--did you have other telephone calls with her that \n     day?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Okay. What was the purpose of those conversations?\n       A. I believe I spoke with her a little later to find out \n     when she was coming, and I think that I might have spoken \n     with her again when she was either leaving her house or \n     outside or right there, to let me know to come out.\n       Q. Do--at that time, did you have the caller \n     identification--\n       A. Yes, I did.\n       Q. --on your telephone?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. And did you at least on one occasion see her cell phone \n     number on your caller-ID that day?\n       A. Yes, I did.\n  Nowhere does Ms. Lewinsky say which call was the cell phone call. In \nfact, if anything, it is logical to assume that it is the call from Ms. \nCurrie announcing her imminent arrival which, of course, says nothing \nabout how the visit was initially planned, and no one ever has disputed \nthat Ms. Currie picked up the box. The fact that she might have called \nto say, ``I'm downstairs now,'' is of no additional evidentiary value \nwhatsoever.\n  Left without a documentary record, the managers assert that there is \nnew testimonial evidence of other calls on December 28 that somehow \ncorroborate their theory of the case. But the new testimony doesn't \neven establish who made the other calls that day, and the record \nalready had evidence of other calls on that day. Ms. Lewinsky mentioned \nsuch calls to the grand jury. Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie spoke often, \nespecially in that time period. There were phone calls.\n  There is nothing new here. Ms. Currie has one recollection; Ms. \nLewinsky has a different recollection. Indeed, when asked by Mr. \nManager Bryant whether there was any doubt in her mind that it was \nBetty Currie who called her, Ms. Lewinsky stated simply, ``That's how I \nremember this event.''\n  Straining for something beyond this absolutely unresolvable conflict, \nthe managers promised evidence to tip the balance, and they produced \nnone. The much-touted cell phone call utterly fails to establish who \ninitiated the gift pickup by Ms. Currie.\n  It is, therefore, clear that the deposition testimony does not \nadvance the managers' case with respect to the gifts, but it sure \nadvances the defense case. Remember, Ms. Lewinsky received a subpoena \non December 19 requesting gifts she had received from the President. \nShe met with her lawyer, Frank Carter, on December 22, and she did not \nspeak to the President in the interim.\n  In her deposition this week, Ms. Lewinsky testified at some length \nabout how she decided what to bring her attorney, Frank Carter, in \nresponse to that request for gifts. As we will see, she decided on her \nown that she would bring only innocuous things to produce, things that \nany intern might have in his or her possession.\n  Again, this was on December 22, well before the December 28 meeting \nwith the President at which the managers and the articles say the plan \nto hide the gifts was hatched. Ms. Lewinsky explained to the managers \nwhat she did and why she did it. Let's listen.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Did, uh, did you bring with you to the meeting with Mr. \n     Jordan, and for the purpose of carrying it, I guess, to Mr. \n     Carter, items in response to this request for production?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Did you discuss those items with Mr. Jordan?\n       A. I think I showed them to him, but I'm not 100 percent \n     sure. If I've testified that I did, then I'd stand by that.\n       Q. Okay. How did you select those items?\n       A. Uh, actually, kind of in an obnoxious way, I guess. I--I \n     felt that it was important\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\n     to take the stand with Mr. Carter and then, I guess, to the \n     Jones people that this was ridiculous, that they were--they \n     were looking at the wrong person to be involved in this. And, \n     in fact, that was true. I know and knew nothing of sexual \n     harassment. So I think I brought the, uh, Christmas cards, \n     that I'm sure everyone in this room has probably gotten from \n     the President and First Lady, and considered that \n     correspondence, and some innocuous pictures and--they were \n     innocuous.\n       Q. Were they the kind of items that typically, an intern \n     would receive or, like you said, any one of us might receive?\n       A. I think so.\n       Q. In other words, it wouldn't give away any kind of \n     special relationship?\n       A. Exactly.\n       Q. And was that your intent?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Did you discuss how you selected those items with \n     anybody?\n       A. I don't believe so.\n       Q. Did Mr. Jordan make any comment about those items?\n       A. No.\n       Q. Were any of these items eventually turned over to Mr. \n     Carter?\n       A. Yes.\n\n  As an aside, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Manager Rogan, it is \nalso clear from that excerpt that Ms. Lewinsky knew nothing of sexual \nharassment. That is what she said.\n  So it is clear from this tape that well before December 28 Ms. \nLewinsky had made her own decision for her own reasons not to produce \nthe gifts. She remained firm in this decision for her own reasons on \nDecember 28 when the President gave her more gifts. Let's watch again.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Okay. Did--he gave you some gifts that day, and my \n     question to you is what went through your mind when he did \n     that, when you knew all along that you had just received a \n     subpoena to produce gifts. Did that not concern you?\n       A. No, it didn't. I was happy to get them.\n       Q. All right. Why did it--beyond your happiness in \n     receiving them, why did the subpoena aspect of it not concern \n     you?\n       A. I think at that moment--I mean, you asked me when he \n     gave me those gifts. So, at that moment, when I was there, I \n     was happy to be with him. I was happy to get these Christmas \n     presents. So I was nervous about the case, but I had made a \n     decision that I wasn't going to get into it too much--\n       Q. Well--\n       A. --with a discussion.\n       Q. --have you in regards to that--you've testified in the \n     past that from everything that the President had told you \n     about things like this, there was never any question that you \n     were going to keep everything quiet, and turning over all the \n     gifts would prompt the Jones attorneys to question you. So \n     you had no doubt in your mind, did you not, that you weren't \n     going to turn these gifts over that he had just given you?\n       A. Uh, I--I think the latter half of your statement is \n     correct. I don't know if you're reading from my direct \n     testimony, but--because you said--your first statement was \n     from everything the President had told you. So I don't know \n     if that was--if those were my words or not, but I--no, I \n     was--I--it--I was concerned about the gifts. I was worried \n     someone might break into my house or concerned that they \n     actually existed, but I wasn't concerned about turning them \n     over because I knew I wasn't going to, for the reason that \n     you stated.\n\n  Now, when Ms. Lewinsky raised the issue of gifts with the President \non December 28, she did not state he even answered. Her recollection of \nwhether he said anything has been murky, as we have heard discussed \nhere. And in her recent deposition she declined to resolve the \ninconsistencies in favor of the version the managers have advanced.\n  And then what happened after she left on December 28? As Ms. Lewinsky \nrecounted the subsequent events, Ms. Currie later called and arranged \nto pick up something. But what? According to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie \nnever said ``gifts'' when she called. Ms. Lewinsky assumed that was \nwhat she was calling about--that is her testimony--no doubt because \nthey had been on her mind for the reasons we have just heard explained.\n  Now, the managers attempt to respond to all this by saying over and \nover, yes, but the President never told Ms. Lewinsky she had to produce \nthe gifts he had given her. They attempt to convert his silence into a \nfailure to perform a legal duty and then to convert that failure to \nperform a legal duty into a high crime.\n  But are we really sure that he didn't tell her to produce the gifts? \nRemember, the President volunteered on his own in the grand jury that \nMs. Lewinsky had raised the subject of gifts with him. That was long \nbefore he knew she had said it. And remember, he said what his response \nwas: ``You have to give them whatever you have.''\n  Now, the managers would have you believe Ms. Lewinsky rejected that \nrecollection wholesale, that she said he never said any such thing. \nThey need that to be the case. But it is not so, we now learn, no \nthanks to Mr. Starr's agents.\n  Let's watch.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Okay. Now, were you ever under the impression from \n     anything that the President said that you should turn over \n     all the gifts to the Jones lawyers?\n       A. No, but where this is a little tricky--and I think I \n     might have even mentioned this last weekend--was that I had \n     an occasion in an interview with one of the--with the OIC--\n     where I was asked a series of statements, if the President \n     had made those, and there was one statement that Agent Phalen \n     said to me--I--there were--other people, they asked me these \n     statements--this is after the President testified and they \n     asked me some statements, did you say this, did you say this, \n     and I said, no, no, no. And Agent Phalen said something, and \n     I think it was, ``Well, you have to turn over whatever you \n     have.'' And I said to you, ``You know, that sounds a little \n     bit familiar to me.''\n       So that's what I can tell you on that.\n       Q. That's in the 302 exam?\n       A. I don't know if it's in the 302 or not, but that's what \n     happened.\n       Q. Uh-huh.\n\n  This is extraordinary testimony. Why? Because Ms. Lewinsky apparently \ncorroborated the President. She recognized those words when she heard \nthem. She didn't refute the President. And the OIC never told us that \nthat was what she said. Never told the House. Never told this body. We \nhad no idea about Ms. Lewinsky's recollection until we heard her \ntestimony. We can only wonder--in troubled disbelief--how much more we \nstill don't know. The President did not obstruct justice. Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony seriously undermines the gift claim that is before \nyou.\n  We have reviewed the first three subparts of article II. Now, let's \nlook quickly at the fourth.\n  Ms. Lewinsky's testimony also confirms what has been clear throughout \nthese proceedings: That her New York job search efforts began in \nOctober 1997, well before Ms. Lewinsky was ever named a potential \nwitness in the Jones case; and that Mr. Jordan first became involved in \nthe job search effort in November, early November, also before she \nbecame a witness; that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job offer in New \nYork from the United Nations in November also, and also well before \nthere was any indication she would be a witness; and that Mr. Jordan \nand Ms. Lewinsky had several contacts related to her job search in \nNovember, despite the fact that both of them were traveling \nextensively, including out of the country in that period.\n  In fact, Ms. Lewinsky makes it clear in this testimony that she and \nMr. Jordan began arranging the meeting that took place on December 11 \nbefore Thanksgiving, before anyone knew Ms. Lewinsky's name would be on \na witness list--all of this, of course, before anyone knew Ms. \nLewinsky's name would be on a witness list. If the fact that the \nassistance to Ms. Lewinsky preceded her appearance on the witness list \nneeded confirmation, it has been confirmed again.\n  But there is more. What has also been confirmed is Ms. Lewinsky's \ngrand jury testimony that, ``No one ever asked me to lie. And I was \nnever promised a job for my silence.'' We have repeatedly reminded this \nbody of these plain and simple words with their plain, simple and \nexculpatory meaning.\n  The House managers repeatedly have tried to suggest that these words \nmust mean something else. But at no time in their hours of questioning \nMs. Lewinsky did they question her about this pivotal assertion \nregarding the job search allegation. They did not ask her to explain \nit, to amend it, to qualify it. They did not challenge it. They did not \nconfront it. They didn't dare. They knew the answer. They knew there \nwas no quid pro quo. And their failure to elicit a response speaks \nvolumes.\n  The President did not obstruct justice. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nundermines this job search claim, as well. Plain and simple, the \nevidence is to the contrary.\n  Now, Mr. Manager Bryant remarked on Thursday that after deposing Ms. \nLewinsky he felt like the actor Charles Laughton in the film ``Witness \nfor the Prosecution.'' As counsel for the President, I would \nrespectfully submit that another famous role of Charles\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nLaughton might be the more fitting reference. It is that of the dogged, \ntireless, obsessed Inspector Javert once played by Mr. Laughton in the \n1935 movie version of ``Les Miserables.''\n  The most recent testimony of Ms. Lewinsky has seriously damaged the \nmanagers' case and has confirmed that it is time for this tireless \npursuit of the President to come to an end.\n  I turn now to my partner, Mr. Kendall, who will discuss Mr. Jordan's \nrecent testimony.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I think I see in the Chief Justice's eyes the desire for--\n--\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. --a 15-minute break. Let's return as shortly after 3:30 as \nis possible.\n  Thereupon, at 3:18 p.m., the Senate recessed until 3:42 p.m.; \nwhereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Chief \nJustice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I believe the White House \ncounsel has an additional presenter at this time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes White House Counsel Kendall.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, distinguished House Managers, I am going to deal with Vernon \nJordan's videotape deposition. That deposition was taken on February 2, \nthis last Tuesday, and it produced nothing at all which was significant \nand new. Time and again, Mr. Manager Hutchinson cited Mr. Jordan's \nprevious grand jury testimony, and time and again Mr. Jordan confirmed \nand recited his previous grand jury testimony.\n  The managers had a full and fair opportunity to take Mr. Jordan's \ntestimony, and they, indeed, had time to spare. They used just about 3 \nhours of their allotted 4-hour time. And they discovered nothing that \nwas not contained in the previous 900 pages of Mr. Jordan's grand jury \ntestimony which has been taken in his March 3, March 5, May 5, May 28, \nand June 9 appearances before the OIC grand jury. Assertions by counsel \nis not the same thing as proof. And I think that it is clear when you \nwatch the actual video as we have done today of the three witnesses \nwhose testimony the managers took earlier this week.\n  For example, with respect to Mr. Jordan, Mr. Manager Hutchinson, who \ndid a first-rate job of interrogation as you can see from the video, \ntold you last Thursday that he needed to have in evidence the \nvideotape, and you admitted it into evidence, because--and I quote--\n``Mr. Jordan's testimony goes to the connection between the job search, \nthe benefit provided to a witness, and the solicited false testimony \nfrom that witness.''\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson also asserted more than once last Thursday \nthat Mr. Jordan's testimony will prove that the President was \ncontrolling the job search. There is only one problem with these \nassertions. When you actually look at the videotape and listen to what \nMr. Jordan testified to, there is no support for these propositions. \nThere is no direct evidence and there is no circumstantial evidence. It \nis plain that to help somebody find a job is an acceptable activity. It \nis only when this is tied, as the second article of impeachment alleges \nit is tied, to some obstruction in the Paula Jones case that it becomes \nillegal. And, when fairly considered, Mr. Jordan's testimony provides \nno evidence whatsoever of that.\n  Mr. Jordan was a long-time and close personal friend of the \nPresident.\n\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Q. It's probably not bad from Washington standards.\n       Would you describe the nature of your relationship with \n     President Clinton?\n       A. President Clinton has been a friend of mine since \n     approximately 1973, when I came to your State, Arkansas, to \n     make a speech as president of the National Urban League about \n     race and equal opportunity in our Nation, and we met then and \n     there, and our friendship has grown and developed and matured \n     and he is my friend and will continue to be my friend.\n       Q. And just to further elaborate on that friendship, it's \n     my understanding that he and his--and the First Lady has had \n     Christmas Eve dinner with you and your family for a number of \n     years?\n       A. Every year since his Presidency, the Jordan family has \n     been privileged to entertain the Clinton family on Christmas \n     Eve.\n       Q. And has there been any exceptions in recent years to \n     that?\n       A. Every year that he has been President, he has had, he \n     and his family, Christmas Eve with my family.\n       Q. And have you vacationed together with the Clinton \n     family?\n       A. Yes. I think you have seen reels of playing golf and \n     having fun at Martha's Vineyard.\n       Q. And so you vacation together, you play golf together on \n     a semi-regular basis?\n       A. Whenever we can.\n\n  It has been, since the start of this investigation, well known that \nMr. Jordan was active in helping Ms. Lewinsky secure employment in New \nYork, and also that he construed this request which came to him through \nBetty Currie as having come from the President himself. In his May 28 \ngrand jury testimony, for example, Mr. Jordan testified that Betty \nCurrie is the President's secretary. ``She was the person who called me \nat the behest of the President, I believe, to ask me to look into \ngetting Monica Lewinsky the job.''\n  And, again, on June 9, Mr. Jordan testified to the grand jury that, \n``The President asked me to help get Monica Lewinsky a job.''\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson played an excerpt, which I will not play \nagain, which once more repeats that testimony.\n  Mr. Jordan, however, made clear that while he recommended Ms. \nLewinsky for a job at three New York firms which he had some connection \nwith, the decision to hire her was the company's, and he put no \npressure of any kind on these companies to hire Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, \nshe received an offer at one company, Revlon, and failed to obtain one \nfrom American Express or Burson-Marsteller.\n  (Text of video presentation:)\n\n       Q. Okay. Do you believe that you are acting in the \n     company's interest or the President's interest when you were \n     trying to secure a job for Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A. Well, what I knew was that the company would take care \n     of its own interest. This is not the first time that I \n     referred somebody, and what I know is, is that if a person \n     being referred does not meet the standards required for that \n     company, I have no question but that that person will not be \n     hired. And so the referral is an easy thing to do; the \n     judgment about employment is not a judgment as a person \n     referring that I make. But I do have confidence in all of the \n     companies on whose boards I sit that, regardless of my \n     reference, that as to their needs and as to their \n     expectations for their employees that they will make the \n     right decisions, as happened in the American Express \n     situation.\n       American Express called and said: We will not hire Ms. \n     Lewinsky. I did not question it, I did not challenge it, \n     because they understood their needs and their needs in \n     comparison to her qualifications. They made a judgment. \n     Revlon, on the other hand, made another judgment.\n       I am not the employer. I am the referrer, and there is a \n     major difference.\n       Q. Now, going back to what you knew as far as information \n     and what you conveyed to Revlon, you indicated that you did \n     not tell Mr. Halperin that you were making this request or \n     referral at the request of the President of the United \n     States.\n       A. Yes, and I didn't see any need to do that.\n       Q. And then, when you talked to Mr.--\n       A. Nor do I believe not saying that, Counselor, was a \n     breach of some fiduciary relationship.\n       Q. And when you had your conversation with Mr. Perelman--\n       A. Right.\n       Q. --at a later time--\n       A. Right.\n       Q. --you do not remember whether you told him--you do not \n     believe you told him you were calling for the President--\n       A. I believe that I did not tell him.\n       Q. --but you assumed that he knew?\n       A. No. I did not make any assumptions, let me say. I said: \n     Ronald, here is a young lady who has been interviewed. She \n     thinks the interview has not gone well. See what you can do \n     to make sure that she is properly interviewed and evaluated--\n     in essence.\n       Q. And did you reference her as a former White House \n     intern?\n       A. Probably. I do not have a recollection of whether I \n     described her as a White House intern, whether I described \n     her as a person who had worked for the Pentagon. I said this \n     is a person that I have referred.\n       I think, Mr. Hutchinson, that I have sufficient, uh, \n     influence, shall we say, sufficient character, shall we say, \n     that people have been throughout my career able to take my \n     word at face value.\n       Q. And so you didn't need to reference the President. The \n     fact that you were calling Mr. Perelman--\n       A. That was sufficient.\n       Q. --and asking for a second interview for Ms. Lewinsky, \n     that that should be sufficient?\n       A. I thought it was sufficient, and obviously, Mr. Perelman \n     thought it was sufficient.\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n       Q. And so there is no reason, based on what you told him, \n     for him to think that you were calling at the request of the \n     President of the United States?\n       A. I think that's about right.\n       Q. And so, at least with the conversation with Mr. Halperin \n     and Mr. Perelman, you did not reference that you were acting \n     in behalf of the President of the United States. Was there \n     anyone else that you talked to at Revlon in which they might \n     have acquired that information?\n       A. The only persons that I talked to in this process, as I \n     explained to you, was Mr. Halperin and Mr. Perelman about \n     this process. And it was Mr. Halperin who put the--who got \n     the process started.\n       Q. So those are the only two you talked about, and you made \n     no reference that you were acting in behalf of the President?\n       A. Right.\n       Q. Now, the second piece of information was the fact that \n     you knew and the President knew that Ms. Lewinsky was under \n     subpoena in the Jones case, and that information was not \n     provided to either Mr. Halperin or to Mr. Perelman; is that \n     correct?\n       A. That's correct.\n\n  The most critical thing about this deposition is it contained no \nevidence of any kind which supports the central allegation of article \nII, the obstruction of justice article, that Mr. Jordan's job search \nassistance was tied to Ms. Lewinsky testifying in a certain way or that \nthe President intended Mr. Jordan's assistance to corruptly influence \nher testimony. Mr. Jordan was unequivocal about the fact that he had \nfrequently helped other people and that here there was no quid pro quo, \nno tie-in of any kind. Indeed, he provided direct evidence of this \nfact.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Mr. Jordan, you were asked questions about job \n     assistance. Would you describe the job assistance you have \n     over your career given to people who have come to you \n     requesting help finding a job or finding employment?\n       A. Well, I've known about job assistance and have for a \n     very long time. I learned about it dramatically when I \n     finished at Howard University Law School, 1960, to return \n     home to Atlanta, Georgia to look for work. In the process of \n     my--during my senior year, it was very clear to me that no \n     law firm in Atlanta would hire me. It was very clear to me \n     that, uh, I could not get a job as a black lawyer in the city \n     government, the county government, the State government or \n     the Federal Government.\n       And thanks to my high school bandmaster, Mr. Kenneth Days, \n     who called his fraternity brother, Donald L. Hollowell, a \n     civil rights lawyer, and said, ``That Jordan boy is a fine \n     boy, and you ought to consider him for a job at your law \n     firm,'' that's when I learned about job referral, and that \n     job referral by Kenneth Days, now going to Don Hollowell, got \n     me a job as a civil rights lawyer working for Don Hollowell \n     for $35 a week.\n       I have never forgotten Kenneth Days' generosity. And given \n     the fact that all of the other doors for employment as a \n     black lawyer graduating from Howard University were open to \n     me, that's always--that's always been etched in my heart and \n     my mind, and as a result, because I stand on Mr. Days' \n     shoulders and Don Hollowell's shoulders, I felt some \n     responsibility to the extent that I could be helpful or got \n     in a position to be helpful, that I would do that.\n       And there is I think ample evidence, both in the media and \n     by individuals across this country, that at such times that I \n     have been presented with that opportunity that I have taken \n     advantage of that opportunity, and I think that I have been \n     successful at it.\n       Q. Was your assistance to Ms. Lewinsky which you have \n     described in any way dependent upon her doing anything \n     whatsoever in the Paula Jones case?\n       A. No.\n\n  That is direct evidence. That is not circumstantial evidence. That is \nunimpugned direct evidence.\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson emphasized that Mr. Jordan now admits that he \nmet with Ms. Lewinsky for breakfast on December 31. But Mr. Jordan also \nconceded in his deposition that, while he has no direct recollection of \nit, he also met with Ms. Lewinsky on November 5, a date well before any \nof the many managerial-selected dates for the beginning of the corrupt \nconspiracy here.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. . . . Now, when was the first time that you recall that \n     you met with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A. If you've read my grand jury testimony--\n       Q. I have.\n       A. --and I'm sure that you have--there is testimony in the \n     grand jury that she came to see me on or about the 5th of \n     November. I have no recollection of that. It was not on my \n     calendar, and I just have no recollection of her visit. There \n     is a letter here that you have in evidence, and I have to \n     assume that in fact that happened. But as I said in my grand \n     jury testimony, I'm not aware of it, I don't remember it--but \n     I do not deny that it happened.\n       Q. And Ms. Lewinsky has made reference to a meeting that \n     occurred in your office on November 5, and that's the meeting \n     that you have no recollection of?\n       A. That is correct. We have no record of it in my office, \n     and I just have no recollection of it.\n       Q. And in your first grand jury appearance, you were firm, \n     shall I say, that the first time you met with Ms. Lewinsky, \n     that it was on December 11th?\n       A. Yes. It was firm based on what my calendar told me, and \n     subsequently to that, there has been a refreshing of my \n     recollection, and I do not deny that it happened. By the same \n     token, I will tell you, as I said in my grand jury testimony, \n     that I did not remember that I had met with her.\n       Q. And in fact today, the fact that you do not dispute that \n     that meeting occurred is not based upon your recollection but \n     is simply based upon you've seen the records, and it appears \n     that that meeting occurred?\n       A. That is correct.\n\n  The managers' theory is that it wasn't the original job assistance \nwhich constitutes obstruction of justice, it was, rather, the \nintensification of it which began at a certain point--and that point \nhas varied.\n  When you boil it all down, when you look at Mr. Jordan's deposition \nor read his grand jury testimony, you see that he acted for Ms. \nLewinsky on two different occasions. On December 11 he made three phone \ncalls for her to New York firms, and then on January 8, when she \nthought an interview had gone badly, he made another phone call, this \ntime to Mr. Perelman. That is all he did.\n  Now, you also will recall, I think, that the managers' original \ntheory was that what catalyzed this job search intensification, what \nreally kick-started it, was the entry of an order in the Paula Jones \ncase by Judge Wright on December 11.\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you on January 14 that what triggered--\n\n       Let's look at the chain of events. The judge--the witness \n     list came in, the judge's order came in, that triggered the \n     President into action and the President triggered Vernon \n     Jordan into action. That chain reaction here is what moved \n     the job search along. . . . Remember what else happened on \n     that day, December 11. Again, that was the same day that \n     Judge Wright ruled that the questions about other \n     relationships could be asked by the Jones attorneys.\n\n  That was the theory then. This is now. We demonstrated, in our own \npresentation, of course, that that order was entered late in the day at \na time when Mr. Jordan was high over the Atlantic in an airplane on his \nway to Amsterdam.\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson's very able examination did not try to \nresuscitate that theory. He didn't even make the attempt. He didn't ask \nMr. Jordan about the December 11 order.\n  So today we have a different time line. We have a new chart and a new \ntime line. Let's look at this.\n  This is Mr. Manager Hutchinson's chart this morning. What is critical \nhere? Well, we learned today that it is the December 5 date that is \ncritical. That is when the witness list was faxed to the President's \ncounsel, and that is what triggered the succeeding chain of events. Mr. \nManager Hutchinson remarked, if I heard him correctly, that whenever \nyou are talking about obstruction of justice, it ties together, it all \nfits together.\n  Let's look at his chart. We see that December 11 is on here, but \nJudge Wright's order has dropped off entirely, unless it is there where \nI don't see it. Judge Wright's order is now not part of the chain of \ncausation.\n  We look at December 7. We ask ourselves what happened then; this is 2 \ndays after the witness list came in. It must have been something \nnefarious, because the President and Jordan meet. But Mr. Manager \nHutchinson did not represent to you that they even talked about the \nJones litigation or Ms. Lewinsky because they didn't. The managers told \nyou that in their trial brief, and it has been Mr. Jordan's consistent \ntestimony.\n  On December 11, Mr. Jordan did have a meeting with Ms. Lewinsky. That \nwas originally set up not on December 8, you will recall, but back in \nNovember when Ms. Lewinsky had agreed to call Mr. Jordan when he \nreturned from his travel.\n  So the chronology here produces no even circumstantial evidence of \nsome linkage between the Paula Jones case and Mr. Jordan's job search.\n  It is also significant, I think, while the witness list came in on \nDecember 5, the President met with his lawyers on December 6, the \nPresident doesn't call Ms. Lewinsky until December 17 and\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nMr. Jordan doesn't learn about the fact that Ms. Lewinsky is on the \nwitness list until December 19. There does not seem to be a lot of \nurgency here.\n  Let's review the nefarious conspiracy that we have heard about today \nto get Ms. Lewinsky a job. We are told today that Vernon Jordan had no \ncorrupt intent, that Ms. Lewinsky had no corrupt intent, and that \nRevlon had no corrupt intent. Rather, it was the President who somehow \nspun out this conspiracy. But I ask you, where, in all of the \nvoluminous record, is there any evidence, either direct or \ncircumstantial, that the President somehow tied these things together \nthrough Mr. Jordan? It is a shell game, but the game doesn't have any \nshell in it, and I think this is the loneliest conspiracy in human \nhistory, if it was a conspiracy. But it wasn't.\n  On the subject of quid pro quo, I want to play two excerpts, and part \nof these I ask your indulgence. They were played in part by Mr. Manager \nHutchinson, but I think they deserve to be seen in their full context. \nIn one of them you are going to hear Mr. Jordan say that he was running \nthe job search, he was in control of the job search. I think that is \ntrue about the Vernon Jordan job search. Ms. Lewinsky's job search had \nalso been proceeding with Mr. Richardson--Mr. Jordan was not involved \nin any way with that--and through her superior at the Pentagon, Mr. Ken \nBacon. Let's listen to the full context and listen for any evidence of \na quid pro quo.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       BY MR. HUTCHINSON:\n       Q. Mr. Jordan, let me go back to that meeting on December \n     11th. I believe we were discussing that. My question would \n     be: How did the meeting on December 11 of 1997 with Ms. \n     Lewinsky come about?\n       A. Ms. Lewinsky called my office and asked if she could \n     come to see me.\n       Q. And was that preceded by a call from Betty Currie?\n       A. At some point in time, Betty Currie had called me, and \n     Ms. Lewinsky followed up on that call, and she came to my \n     office, and we had a visit.\n       Q. Ms. Lewinsky called, set up a meeting, and at some point \n     sent you a resume, I believe.\n       A. I believe so.\n       Q. And did you receive that prior to the meeting on \n     December 11th?\n       A. I--I have to assume that I did, but I--I do not know \n     whether she brought it with her or whether--it was at some \n     point that she brought with her or sent to me--somehow it \n     came into my possession--a list of various companies in New \n     York with which she had--which were her preferences, by the \n     way--most of which I did not know well enough to make any \n     calls for.\n       Q. All right. And I want to come back to that, but I \n     believe--would you dispute if the record shows that you \n     received the resume of Ms. Lewinsky on December 8th?\n       A. I would not.\n       Q. And presumably, the meeting on December 11th was set up \n     somewhere around December 8th by the call from Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A. I--I would not dispute that, sir.\n       Q. All right. Now, you mentioned that she had sent you a--I \n     guess some people refer to it--a wish list, or a list of jobs \n     that she--\n       A. Not jobs--companies.\n       Q. --companies that she would be interested in seeking \n     employment with.\n       A. That's correct.\n       Q. And you looked at that, and you determined that you \n     wanted to go with your own list of friends and companies that \n     you had better contacts with.\n       A. I'm sure, Congressman, that you too have been in this \n     business, and you do know that you can only call people that \n     you know or feel comfortable in calling.\n       Q. Absolutely. No question about it. And let me just \n     comment and ask your response to this, but many times I will \n     be listed as a reference, and they can take that to any \n     company. You might be listed as a reference and the name \n     ``Vernon Jordan'' would be a good reference anywhere, would \n     it not?\n       A. I would hope so.\n       Q. And so, even though it was a company that you might not \n     have the best contact with, you could have been helpful in \n     that regard?\n       A. Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. \n     Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or \n     listed were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need \n     to call.\n       Q. And that is exactly the point, that you looked at \n     getting Ms. Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just \n     something that you were going to be a reference for.\n       A. I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment. \n     Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't \n     view it as an assignment. I just view it as something that is \n     part of what I do.\n       Q. You're acting in behalf of the President when you are \n     trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of \n     the job search?\n       A. Yes.\n       Q. Now, going back--going to your meeting that we're \n     talking about on December 11th, prior to the meeting did you \n     make any calls to prospective employers in behalf of Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       A. I don't think so. I think not. I think I wanted to see \n     her before I made any calls.\n       Q. And so if they were not before, after you met with her, \n     you made some calls on December 11th?\n       A. I--I believe that's correct.\n       Q. And you called Mr. Richard Halperin of McAndrews & \n     Forbes?\n       A. That's right.\n       Q. You called Mr. Peter--\n       A. Georgescu.\n       Q. --Georgescu. And he is with what company?\n       A. He is chairman and chief executive officer of Young & \n     Rubicam, a leading advertising agency on Madison Avenue.\n       Q. And did you make one other call?\n       A. Yes. I called Ursie Fairbairn, who runs Human Resources \n     at American Express, at the American Express Company, where I \n     am the senior director.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q And what did you basically communicate to each of these \n     officials in behalf of Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A I essentially said that you're going to hear from Ms. \n     Lewinsky, and I hope that you will afford her an opportunity \n     to come in and be interviewed and look favorably upon her if \n     she meets your qualifications and your needs for work.\n       Q Okay. And at what level did you try to communicate this \n     information?\n  A By--what do you mean by ``what level''?\n       Q In the company that you were calling, did you call the \n     chairman of human resources, did you call the CEO--who did \n     you call, or what level were you seeking to talk to?\n       A Richard Halperin is sort of the utility man; he does \n     everything at McAndrews & Forbes. He is very close to the \n     chairman, he is very close to Mr. Gittis. And so at McAndrews \n     & Forbes, I called Halperin.\n       As I said to you, and as my grand jury testimony shows, I \n     called Young & Rubicam, Peter Georgescu as its chairman and \n     CEO. I have had a long-term relationship with Young & Rubicam \n     going back to three of its CEOs, the first being Edward Ney, \n     who was chairman of Young & Rubicam when I was head of the \n     United Negro College Fund, and it was during that time that \n     we developed the great theme, ``A mind is a terrible thing to \n     waste.'' So I have had a long-term relationship with Young & \n     Rubicam and with Peter Georgescu, so I called the chairman in \n     that instance.\n       At American Express, I called Ms. Ursie Fairbairn who is, \n     as I said before, in charge of Human Resources.\n       So that is the level--in one instance, the chairman; in one \n     instance a utilitarian person; and in another instance, the \n     head of the Human Resources Department.\n       Q And the utilitarian connection, Mr. Richard Halperin, was \n     sort of an assistant to Mr. Ron Perelman?\n       A That's correct. He's a lawyer.\n       Q Now, going to your meeting on December 11th with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, about how long of a meeting was that?\n       A I don't--I don't remember. You have a record of it, \n     Congressman.\n       Q And actually, I think you've testified it was about 15 to \n     20 minutes, but don't hold me to that, either.\n       During the course of the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, what \n     did you learn about her?\n       A Uh, enthusiastic, quite taken with herself and her \n     experience, uh, bubbly, effervescent, bouncy, confident, uh--\n     actually, I sort of had the same impression that you House \n     Managers had of her when you met with her. You came out and \n     said she was impressive, and so we come out about the same \n     place.\n       Q And did she relate to you the fact that she liked being \n     an intern because it put her close to the President?\n       A I have never seen a White House intern who did not like \n     being a White House intern, and so her enthusiasm for being a \n     White House intern was about like the enthusiasm of White \n     House interns--they liked it.\n       She was not happy about not being there anymore--she did \n     not like being at the Defense Department--and I think she \n     actually had some desire to go back. But when she actually \n     talked to me, she wanted to go to New York for a job in the \n     private sector, and she thought that I could be helpful in \n     that process.\n       Q Did she make reference to someone in the White House \n     being uncomfortable when she was an intern, and she thought \n     that people did not want her there?\n       A She felt unwanted--there is no question about that. As to \n     who did not want her there and why they did not want her \n     there, that was not my business.\n       Q And she related that--\n       A She talked about it.\n       Q --experience or feeling to you?\n       A Yes.\n       Q Now, your meeting with Ms. Lewinsky was on December 11th, \n     and I believe that Ms. Lewinsky has testified that she met \n     with the President on December 5--excuse me, on December 6--\n     at the White House and complained that her job search was not \n     going anywhere, and the President then talked to Mr. Jordan.\n       Do you recall the President talking to you about that after \n     that meeting?\n       A I do not have a specific recollection of the President \n     saying to me anything about\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\n     having met with Ms. Lewinsky. The President has never told me \n     that he met with Ms. Lewinsky, as best as I can recollect. \n     I--I am aware that she was in a state of anxiety about going \n     to work. She was in a state of anxiety in addition because \n     her lease at Watergate, at the Watergate, was to expire \n     December 31st. And there was a part of Ms. Lewinsky, I think, \n     that thought that because she was coming to me, that she \n     could come today and that she would have a job tomorrow. That \n     is not an unusual misapprehension, and it's not limited to \n     White House interns.\n       Q I mentioned her meeting with the President on the same \n     day, December 6th. I believe the record shows the President \n     met with his lawyers and learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the \n     Jones witness list. Now, did you subsequently meet with the \n     President on the next day, December 7th?\n       A I may have met with the President. I'd have to--I mean, \n     I'd have to look. I'd have to look. I don't know whether I \n     did or not.\n       Q If you would like to confer--I believe the record shows \n     that, but I'd like to establish that through your testimony.\n       MS. WALDEN: Yes.\n       THE WITNESS: Yes.\n       BY MR. HUTCHINSON:\n       Q All right. So you met with the President on December 7th. \n     And was it the next day after that, December 8th, that Ms. \n     Lewinsky called to set up the job meeting with you on \n     December 11th?\n       A I believe that is correct.\n       Q And sometime after your meeting on December 11th with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, did you have another conversation with the \n     President?\n       A Uh, you do understand that conversations between me and \n     the President, uh, was not an unusual circumstance.\n       Q And I understand that--\n       A All right.\n       Q --and so let me be more specific. I believe your previous \n     testimony has been that sometime after the 11th, you spoke \n     with the President about Ms. Lewinsky.\n       A I stand on that testimony.\n       Q All right. And so there's two conversations after the \n     witness list came out--one that you had with the President on \n     December 7th, and then a subsequent conversation with him \n     after you met with Ms. Lewinsky on the 11th.\n       Now, in your subsequent conversation after the 11th, did \n     you discuss with the President of the United States Monica \n     Lewinsky, and if so, can you tell us what that discussion \n     was?\n       A If there was a discussion subsequent to Monica Lewinsky's \n     visit to me on December the 11th with the President of the \n     United States, it was about the job search.\n       Q All right. And during that, did he indicate that he knew \n     about the fact that she had lost her job in the White House, \n     and she wanted to get a job in New York?\n       A He was aware that--he was obviously aware that she had \n     lost her job in the White House, because she was working at \n     the Pentagon. He was also aware that she wanted to work in \n     New York, in the private sector, and understood that that is \n     why she was having conversations with me. There is no doubt \n     about that.\n       Q And he thanked you for helping her?\n       A There's no question about that, either.\n       Q And on either of these conversations that I've referenced \n     that you had with the President after the witness list came \n     out, your conversation on December 7th, and your conversation \n     sometime after the 11th, did the President tell you that Ms. \n     Monica Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case?\n       A He did not.\n       Q And did you consider this information to be important in \n     your efforts to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A I never thought about it.\n\n  Mr. Jordan found out about Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena on December 19 \nwhen a weeping Ms. Lewinsky telephoned him and came to his office. Mr. \nManager Hutchinson played that excerpt from the testimony this morning. \nI won't replay it. Mr. Jordan then did what I think is best called due \ndiligence. He talked to Ms. Lewinsky, got her a lawyer, asked her \nwhether there was any sexual relationship with the President, and was \nassured that there was not. That same evening, he went to the White \nHouse and made a similar inquiry of the President and he received a \nsimilar response.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q And still on December 19th, after your meeting with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, did you subsequently see the President of the \n     United States later that evening?\n       A I did.\n       Q And is this when you went to the White House and saw the \n     President?\n       A Yes.\n       Q At the time that Ms. Lewinsky came to see you on December \n     19th, did you have any plans to attend any social function at \n     the White House that evening?\n       A I did not.\n       Q And in fact there was a social invitation that you had at \n     the White House that you declined?\n       A I had--I had declined it; that's right.\n       Q And subsequent to Ms. Lewinsky visiting you, did you \n     change your mind and go see the President that evening?\n       A After the--a social engagement that Mrs. Jordan and I \n     had, we went to the White House for two reasons. We went to \n     the White House to see some friends who were there, two of \n     whom were staying in the White House; and secondly, I wanted \n     to have a conversation with the President.\n       Q And this conversation that you wanted to have with the \n     President was one that you wanted to have with him alone?\n       A That is correct.\n       Q And did you let him know in advance that you were coming \n     and wanted to talk to him?\n       A I told him I would see him sometime that night after \n     dinner.\n       Q Did you tell him why you wanted to see him?\n       A No.\n       Q Now, was this--once you told him that you wanted to see \n     him, did it occur the same time that you talked to him while \n     Ms. Lewinsky was waiting outside?\n       A It could be. I made it clear that I would come by after \n     dinner, and he said fine.\n       Q Now, let me backtrack for just a moment, because whenever \n     you talked to the President, Ms. Lewinsky was not inside the \n     room--\n       A That's correct.\n       Q --and therefore, you did not know the details about her \n     questions on the President might leave the First Lady and \n     those questions that set off all of these alarm bells.\n       A [Nodding head up and down.]\n       Q And so you were having--is the answer yes?\n       A That's correct.\n       Q And so you were having this discussion with the President \n     not knowing the extent of Ms. Lewinsky's fixation?\n       A Uh--\n       Q Is that correct?\n       A Correct.\n       Q And, regardless, you wanted to see the President that \n     night, and so you went to see him. And was he expecting you?\n       A I believe he was.\n       Q And did you have a conversation with him alone?\n       A I did.\n       Q No one else around?\n       A No one else around.\n       Q And I know that's a redundant question.\n       A It's okay.\n       Q Now, would you describe your conversation with the \n     President?\n       A We were upstairs, uh, in the White House. Mrs. Jordan--we \n     came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the Diplomatic \n     Entrance--we left the car there. I took the elevator up to \n     the residence, and Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. \n     And the President was already upstairs--I had ascertained \n     that from the usher--and I went up, and I raised with him the \n     whole question of Monica Lewinsky and asked him directly if \n     he had had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and the \n     President said, ``No, never.''\n       Q All right. Now, during that conversation, did you tell \n     the President again that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed?\n       A Well, we had established that.\n       Q All right. And did you tell him that you were concerned \n     about her fascination?\n       A I did.\n       Q And did you describe her as being emotional in your \n     meeting that day?\n       A I did.\n       Q And did you relate to the President that Ms. Lewinsky \n     asked about whether he was going to leave the First Lady at \n     the end of the term?\n       A I did.\n       Q And as--and then, you concluded that with the question as \n     to whether he had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A And he said he had not, and I was satisfied--end of \n     conversation.\n       Q Now, once again, just as I asked the question in \n     reference to Ms. Lewinsky, it appears to me that this is an \n     extraordinary question to ask the President of the United \n     States. What led you to ask this question to the President?\n       A Well, first of all, I'm asking the question of my friend \n     who happens to be the President of the United States.\n       Q And did you expect your friend, the President of the \n     United States, to give you a truthful answer?\n       A I did.\n       Q Did you rely upon the President's answer in your decision \n     to continue your efforts to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job?\n       A I believed him, and I continued to do what I had been \n     asked to do.\n  This morning, a very short portion of the President's grand jury \ntestimony was played. The sound was not very good. It was a very short \nsnippet, but it relates to what happened between Mr. Jordan and the \nPresident in that December 19, late-night meeting at the White House. \nThe snippet that was played for you was:\n\n       Q And Mr. Jordan informed you of that, is that correct?\n\n  ``That'' being the subpoena.\n\n       A No, sir.\n\n  That leaves the misleading impression in his grand jury testimony the \nPresident did not acknowledge this visit with Mr. Jordan. The question \nright above the one that was quoted, however, was the following:\n\n       Q You were familiar, weren't you, Mr. President, that she \n     had received the subpoena? You have already acknowledged \n     that.\n\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\n\n  The answer was, ``Yes, sir, I was.''\n  And then two pages later, the President was asked by the OIC:\n\n       Q Did you, in fact, have a conversation with Mr. Jordan on \n     the evening of December 19, 1997, in which he talked to you \n     about Monica being in Mr. Jordan's office, having a copy of \n     the subpoena and being upset about being subpoenaed?\n\n  And the President's answer was:\n\n       I remember that Mr. Jordan was in the White House on \n     December 19 for an event of some kind, that he came up to the \n     residence floor and told me that he had--that Monica had \n     gotten subpoenaed or Monica was going to have to testify and \n     I think he told me he recommended a lawyer for her. I believe \n     that's what happened, but it was a very brief conversation.\n\n  So I think it is absolutely clear that there is no conflict between \nthe President's testimony and Mr. Jordan's testimony about this. Mr. \nJordan had recommended Ms. Lewinsky and took her to the lawyer's \noffice, to a lawyer, a Mr. Frank Carter, a respected Washington, DC, \nlawyer, to whom Mr. Jordan had recommended other clients. (Text of \nvideotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Now, you have referred other clients to Mr. Carter during \n     your course of practice here in Washington, D.C.?\n       A Yes, I have.\n       Q About how many have you referred to him?\n       A Oh, I don't know. Maggie Williams is one client that I--I \n     remember very definitely.\n       I like Frank Carter a lot. He's a very able young lawyer. \n     He's a first-class person, a first-class lawyer, and he's one \n     of my new acquaintances amongst lawyers in town, and I like \n     being around him. We have lunch, and he's a friend.\n\n       Q And is it true, though, that when you've referred other \n     clients to Mr. Carter that you never personally delivered and \n     presented that client to him in his office?\n       A But I delivered Maggie Williams to him in my office. I \n     had Maggie Williams to come to my office, and it was in my \n     office that I introduced, uh, Maggie Williams to Mr. Carter, \n     and she chose other counsel. I would have happily taken \n     Maggie Williams to his office.\n  Gary, I will skip the next two videotapes 21 and 22. I hear a sigh of \nrelief.\n  I want to use the next videotape--and I am almost through --to \ncorrect the record as to one point that was made by the managers on \nThursday. And again, this representation was important because it \nasserted an interconnection between the job search assistance and \ntestimony in the Jones case.\n  We were shown a chart on Thursday and it was a chart that was \nentitled ``Interconnection Between Job Help and Testimony.''\n  Managers' version:\n\n       Q [so you] Talk to her both about the job and her concerns \n     about parts of the affidavit.\n\n  Answer, according to the managers' version, ``That is correct.''\n  When we actually looked at the testimony which we will see in just a \nsecond, the question is:\n\n       Q Did you, in fact, talk to her about the job and her \n     concerns about parts of the affidavit?\n       A I have never in any conversation with Ms. Lewinsky talked \n     to her about the job, on the one hand, or job being \n     interrelated with the conversation about the affidavit. The \n     affidavit was over here. The job was over here.\n\n  I don't suggest any intentional misrepresentation, but I think the \nrecord deserves to be corrected.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q Do you know why you would have been calling Mr. Carter on \n     three occasions, the day before the affidavit was signed?\n       A Yeah. I--my recollection is--is that I was exchanging or \n     sharing with Mr. Carter what had gone on, what she had asked \n     me to do, what I refused to do, reaffirming to him that he \n     was the lawyer and I was not the lawyer. I mean, it would be \n     so presumptuous of me to try to advise Frank Carter as to how \n     to practice law.\n       Q Would you have been relating to Mr. Carter your \n     conversations with Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A I may have.\n       Q And if Ms. Lewinsky expressed to you any concerns about \n     the affidavit, would you have relayed those to Mr. Carter?\n       A Yes.\n       Q And if Mr. Carter was a good attorney that was concerned \n     about the economics of law practice, he would have likely \n     billed Ms. Lewinsky for some of those telephone calls?\n       A You have to talk to Mr. Carter about his billing.\n       Q It wouldn't surprise you if his billing did reflect a--a \n     charge for a telephone conversation with Mr. Jordan?\n       A Keep in mind that Mr. Carter spent most of his time in \n     being a legal services lawyer. I think his concentration is \n     primarily on service, rather than billing.\n       Q But, again, based upon the conversations you had with \n     him, which sounds like conversations of substance in \n     reference to the affidavit, that it would be consistent with \n     the practice of law if he charged for those conversations?\n       A That's a question you'd have to ask Mr. Carter.\n       Q They were conversations of substance with Mr. Carter \n     concerning the affidavit?\n       A And they were likely conversations about more than Ms. \n     Lewinsky.\n       Q But the answer was yes, that they were conversations of \n     substance in reference to the affidavit?\n       A Or at least a portion of them.\n       Q In other words, other things might have been discussed?\n       A Yes.\n       Q In your conversation with Ms. Lewinsky prior to the \n     affidavit being signed, did you in fact talk to her about \n     both the job and her concerns about parts of the affidavit?\n       A I have never in any conversation with Ms. Lewinsky talked \n     to her about the job, on one hand, or job being interrelated \n     with the conversation about the affidavit. The affidavit was \n     over here. The job was over here.\n       Q But the--in the same conversations, both her interest in \n     a job and her discussions about the affidavit were contained \n     in the same conversation?\n       A As I said to you before, Counselor, she was always \n     interested in the job.\n       Q Okay. And she was always interested in the job, and so, \n     if she brought up the affidavit, very likely it was in the \n     same conversation?\n       A No doubt.\n       Q And that would be consistent with your previous grand \n     jury testimony when you expressed that you talked to her both \n     about the job and her concerns about parts of the affidavit?\n       A That is correct.\n       Q Now, on January 7th, the affidavit was signed. Subsequent \n     to this, did you notify anyone in the White House that the \n     affidavit in the Jones case had been signed by Ms. Lewinsky?\n       A Yeah. I'm certain I told Betty Currie, and I'm fairly \n     certain that I told the President.\n       Q And why did you tell Betty Currie?\n       A I'm--I kept them informed about everybody else that was--\n     everything else. There was no reason not to tell them about \n     that she had signed the affidavit.\n       Q And why did you tell the President?\n       A The President was obviously interested in her job search. \n     We had talked about the affidavit. He knew that she had a \n     lawyer. It was in the due course of a conversation. I would \n     say, ``Mr. President, she signed the affidavit. She signed \n     the affidavit.''\n       Q And what was his response when you informed him that she \n     had signed the affidavit?\n       A ``Thank you very much.''\n       Q All right. And would you also have been giving him a \n     report on the status of the job search at the same time?\n       A He may have asked about that, and--and part of her \n     problem was that, you know, she was--there was a great deal \n     of anxiety about the job. She wanted the job. She was \n     unemployed, and she wanted to work.\n       Q Now, I think you indicated that he was obviously \n     concerned about--was it her representation and the affidavit?\n       A I told him that I had found counsel for her, and I told \n     him that she had signed the affidavit.\n       Q Okay. You indicated that he was concerned, obviously, \n     about something. What was he obviously concerned about in \n     your conversations with him?\n       A Throughout, he had been concerned about her getting \n     employment in New York, period.\n       Q And he was also concerned about the affidavit?\n       A I don't know that that was concern. I did tell him that \n     the affidavit was signed. He knew that she had counsel, and \n     he knew that I had arranged the counsel.\n\n  In his presentation, Mr. Manager Hutchinson discussed the breakfast \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, which Mr. Jordan now concedes he had, on December \n31. He showed you the restaurant bill. I am not going to dwell long on \nthat because it really is not relevant to article II.\n  First of all, it is nowhere alleged as a ground of obstruction of \njustice. Mr. Manager Hutchinson referred to the 7 pillars of \nobstruction in article II. Those are 7 different factual grounds. This \nalleged obstruction is nowhere in the grounds.\n  There is plainly a conflict in the testimony between Ms. Lewinsky and \nMr. Jordan; although Mr. Jordan, as you will recall, vehemently denies \never giving that instruction, saying in the videotape played this \nmorning: ``I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm not a fool. \nThat's ridiculous. I never did that.''\n  The second reason why I think this is irrelevant is, it was not \npresented as a separate ground for impeachment by the independent \ncounsel. It was identified--the fact of the conflicted testimony was \nidentified, but it was not urged as a separate ground, despite the \nvery, very energetic investigation of Mr. Starr. We have heard a lot in \nthis case about ``dogs that won't hunt.'' In my mind, this is like a \nSherlock\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\nHolmes story about the dog that didn't bark. If the independent counsel \ndidn't raise it, that is significant. Finally, it has nothing \nwhatsoever to do with the President, by anybody's contention.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to raise a question now, which arose \nin the final stage of the Vernon Jordan deposition. Mr. Manager \nHutchinson had taken the deposition. I had asked a couple of questions \nin response. After I had concluded, Mr. Jordan made a statement \ndefending his own integrity to which Mr. Manager Hutchinson objected. I \npropose--since the issue has arisen of his integrity and since Mr. \nJordan is an honorable man and has had a distinguished career--that I \nbe allowed to play the approximately 2-minute segment of his own \nstatement about his integrity.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Do the managers object?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, it is my understanding \nthat that is not a part of the Senate record, and therefore it would \nnot be appropriate to be played under the rules of the Senate.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. But is it a part of the deposition of him that was \ntaken?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. It is not a part of the deposition that was \nentered into the Senate record under the Senate rules.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the Parliamentarian advises me that Division \nI of the motion on Thursday, which was approved, would prevent the \nplaying of that. So the Chair will rule that that is not acceptable.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was one of the Senators at that deposition. I think it \nwould be extremely interesting to hear it. It was taken at the \ndeposition. I ask unanimous consent that it----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Vermont may appeal the decision \nof the Chair, which is that it not be played, ask consent for----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I'm asking unanimous consent, under the circumstances and \nbecause it is so short, that the deposition--and it would clarify that \npart of the deposition Mr. Jordan took, which has been videotaped--be \nallowed to be shown here on the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Objection.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Counsel may proceed.\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. I would like to recognize my colleague. Well, I \nthink that concludes our presentation.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. We yield back the remainder of our time, Mr. Chief \nJustice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. The managers have 31 minutes remaining.\n  The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We will conclude \nour roughly half hour by responding to as many of the contentions and \nstatements raised by counsel for the White House as we can. I first \nwant to talk, I suppose, about the statement that we heard back a \ncouple of weeks ago, which was repeated today by one of the White House \ncounsels, that ``the managers want to win too much.''\n  This is not a game. This is not a game to anyone here. There are \nextraordinary consequences to what we are doing and what we have been \ndoing and what your decision will be. The stakes are very high. We \ndon't need to take a poll to do what we did. I am reminded of the \ntestimony of the President and Dick Morris taking the poll to determine \nwhether to tell the truth or not, and then after deciding the public \nwould not forgive his perjury, he said, ``We will just have to win.'' \nBut that's not the attitude the House managers have in bringing this \ncase here. The managers fully appreciate the seriousness and the \nconsequences of this. We want to do the right thing. We are not here \njust to win. We want to help the Senate in this constitutional process \ndo the constitutional thing--not only for the precedent of this Senate \nbut for the precedent of future generations in terms of how the courts \nnow and later will view obstruction of justice and perjury. We believe \nthis is a constitutional effort and not a game.\n  The question about snippets, that we just put some snippets on the \nair today--we wanted to call live witnesses. We wanted Ms. Lewinsky to \nbe here and let everybody examine her fully and completely. But we are \nworking with a timeframe, and we brought up those points in her \ntestimony and in Mr. Jordan's testimony and Mr. Blumenthal's testimony \nthat we felt proved our case.\n  With regard to the issue that Ms. Seligman raised about filing a \nfalse affidavit, she ran that testimony many times. I thought we ran \nthe President's earlier in these hearings several times, but I think \nshe beat our record with that testimony. I appreciate that.\n  But what that is important for is not what Ms. Lewinsky felt was \ngoing on that night; but I think it perfectly illustrates what I told \nyou the other day about her testimony. While she was truthful and while \nshe gave us the testimony she had to give us to keep her immunity \nagreement, where there were some blanks to fill in, or where there was \nsomething that could be bent, she did so.\n  As they pointed out on the question of the linkage between filing an \naffidavit and this cover story, it was so obvious that they were \nconnected that the OIC did not ask that question, ``Did you think about \nthis when you''--and that. It was obvious. But he did not ask that \nquestion. She was right; the question was not asked. So when she, Ms. \nLewinsky, had an opportunity in these hearings when I asked her, she \nsaid, ``Well, you know, I really didn't link the two together.'' Let's \nnot throw away all of our common sense here.\n  She gets a phone call in the middle of the night with a message that \nyou are on the witness list, and she says three things occurred: You \nare on the witness list, you can file an affidavit, and you can use a \ncover story. Why else would the President raise the issue of a cover \nstory at 2:30 in the morning if he didn't intend for her to use that?\n  But keep in mind, too, it really doesn't matter how she appreciated \nthis. It really matters what the President intended. And he intended to \nlet her know that she was on the list, she could be subpoenaed, she \ncould file an affidavit, and she could use the cover story.\n  And in fact she did use that cover story. She went to her lawyer, Mr. \nCarter, and told him that. And it was incorporated into the draft \naffidavit that she went to take papers to the President to sign, and in \nthose cases she may have been alone. But they didn't like the specter \nof her being alone. So they struck that provision out of the final \naffidavit. But they did attempt to use it.\n  But keep in mind also that it is the President's intent. And his \nintent was to interfere with justice in the Paula Jones case and to \nhave her give a false affidavit. And that is why he so suggested that.\n  On the gifts to people, is it really an issue? Is there really an \nissue here? There is some fabulous lawyering over here. But there is no \nissue here. Ms. Lewinsky testified that there was no doubt in her mind \nthat Ms. Currie initiated the call. That is all there is to this issue. \nThe fact that there were other calls in the day, the fact that one of \nthe other calls may have been at 3:30, really are moot points. The \nissue is, if Betty Currie initiated that phone call, the only impetus \nfor her to initiate that call had to come from the President. She was \nnot in that conversation that morning. The President had to tell her, \nand apparently did so, because she made the call.\n\n  At the end of the examination of her testimony, or toward the end--it \nwas shown several times--we asked her, ``Did the President ever tell \nyou anything about the gifts?'' And she said, ``Not that I remember.'' \nAnd then later on in the segment, you also saw she was asked the \nquestion again by me: ``OK. Were you ever under any impression or the \nimpression from the President that you should turn over all the gifts \nto the Jones lawyers?'' And she said, ``No.'' Then she goes on to say, \n``This gets a little tricky here, and it could be I heard the \nstatements from agents, or somewhere along the line, or perhaps that it \ndid sound familiar.''\n  I would suggest to you what happened there is that Mr. Carter--it is \nclearly in the testimony and before all of us in the record--her own \nlawyer told her she had to turn over all the records. That is where she \nheard that.\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\n  But logic demands that you reject that view, because why would the \nPresident, whose intent was to conceal this whole affair, ever think of \ntelling her that, ``You have to turn over all those gifts''? If he did \ntell her that she had to turn over all of those gifts, why would she \nimmediately go out that afternoon and reject that instruction, and just \ncompletely say, ``Well, I am going to forget what he told me to do, I \nam going to call his secretary and have her come pick up these gifts \nand store them for me''?\n  That is just not logical. Common sense tells us that didn't happen \nthat way, and Ms. Lewinsky was absolutely positive that there was no \ndoubt that Betty Currie initiated the call, and that is that.\n  Job search: Very quickly, this is not a bribery case. This is not \ngiving her a job, bribing her with a job to get her false testimony. It \nis not a bribery case. If it was, we wouldn't be arguing about the \nimpeachability of obstruction of justice. It would be clear that \nbribery is mentioned in the Constitution. It is about attempting to \ncorruptly persuade or influence the behavior of a witness. That is \nexactly what that is about.\n  I would also close very quickly by telling you in the beginning that \nI urged you to look at particularly obstruction of justice charges, the \nresult-benefit analysis. And I do not ever hear anybody talking about \nthat but me. So maybe I am off base here. But I ask you to consider \neach of these seven pillars of obstruction that Mr. Hutchinson raised, \nand look at the end results of those acts, and look at who benefited \nfrom those results. And what I believe you would have found and can \nstill find is that each case resulted in impeding justice in the Paula \nJones case in some way that favored the President. And the benefit \nnaturally inured to the President.\n  I guess if you reject that result-benefit test, and if you accept \neach and every argument of these extremely fine defense counsel that \nthe President wasn't behind any of this, then I guess you just have to \nreach the conclusion that the President was the luckiest man in the \nworld, that people would commit crimes by filing false affidavits, by \nhiding evidence, by going out and possibly trashing the witnesses and \ngiving false testimony in grand jury proceedings, and that--if that is \nthe way you feel about it, so be it; we will abide by your judgment. \nBut I suggest to you that the facts of this case are really not in \ncontest. They have been argued very well by defense counsel for the \nWhite House.\n  I am about to exhaust my time. So I yield at this point to Mr. \nManager Hutchinson to make some remarks.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. This will be \nvery brief, and then I will yield to Mr. Graham.\n  Let's recall Ms. Monica Lewinsky to the stand for a brief moment. \nLet's go to the Park Hyatt Hotel, December 31, 1997, breakfast between \nMs. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       A. Well, the--sort of the--I don't know what to call it, \n     but the story that I gave to Mr. Jordan was that I was trying \n     to sort of alert to him that, gee, maybe Linda Tripp might be \n     saying these things about me having a relationship with the \n     President, and right now, I'm explaining this to you. These \n     aren't the words that I used or how I said it to him, and \n     that, you know, maybe she had seen drafts of notes, trying to \n     obviously give an excuse as to how Linda Tripp could possibly \n     know about my relationship with the President without me \n     having been the one to have told her. So that's what I said \n     to him.\n       Q. And what was his response?\n       A. I think it was something like go home and make sure--oh, \n     something about a--I think he asked me if they were notes \n     from the President to me, and I said no. I know I've \n     testified to this. I stand by that testimony, and I'm just \n     recalling it, that I said no, they were draft notes or notes \n     that I sent to the President, and then I believe he said \n     something like, well, go home and make sure they're not \n     there.\n       Q. And what did you do when you went home?\n       A. I went home and I searched through some of my papers, \n     and--and the drafts of notes I found, I sort of--I got rid of \n     some of the notes that day.\n       Q. So you threw them away?\n       A. Mm-hmm.\n       THE REPORTER: Is that a ``yes''?\n       THE WITNESS: Yes. Sorry.\n\n  Thank you. This goes to the overall pattern of obstruction. It goes \nto credibility. I believe it is relevant in this case, and I yield to \nMr. Graham.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Graham.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. How much time do I \nhave?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. You have 18 minutes and some seconds.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. I may yield back some of the seconds, I hope.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Point of agreement, rebuttal is to refocus, and the law allows that \nfor the person or the party with the burden, and we do have the burden.\n  Point of agreement, White House counsel says there is much more that \nwe need to know. There is much more we need know.\n  White House counsel said strongly, when these proceedings opened up, \nthe President is not guilty of obstruction of justice, the President is \nnot guilty of perjury. Refocus: No fair-minded person, in my opinion, \ncould come to any other rational conclusion than that our President \nobstructed justice, that our President committed perjury in front of a \ngrand jury.\n  You vote your conscience. I have told you to do so. And if we \ndisagree at the end of the day, that is America at its best. I have \nnever suggested there was any reasonable doubt that this President \ncommitted crimes. I will ask you at the conclusion of this case to \nremove him with a clear conscience. You vote your conscience, and I \nknow it will be clear.\n  Refocus: The gifts--simply put, if you believe the President of the \nUnited States in his grand jury testimony said: I told her, I said, \nlook, the way these things work is when a person gets a subpoena, you \nhave to give them whatever you have. That's the way--that's what the \nrule--that's what the law is.\n\n  If you believe that, we need to congratulate our President because he \ndid, in fact, state the law correctly. He fulfilled his obligation as \nChief Executive Officer of the land. He fulfilled his obligation as an \nhonorable person by telling someone, who happened to be Ms. Lewinsky, \nYou are doing a bad thing here even by suggesting we do something with \nthese gifts. You need to turn them over because that is what the law \nsays.\n  If you believe that, that is the only time he really embraced the law \nin this case, as I can see. Everything about him, in the way he \nbehaved, was 180 degrees out from that statement. That is the most \nself-serving statement that flies in the face of every action he took \nfor months. The truth is that a reasonable person should conclude that \nwhen Ms. Lewinsky approached him about what to do with the gifts, he \nsaid, ``I'll have to think about that.'' And you know what, ladies and \ngentlemen, he thought about it. And do you know what he did after he \nthought about it? ``Betty, go get those gifts.'' And they wound up \nunder the bed of the President's secretary. And the people are \nwondering what the heck happened here? What the heck happened here is \nyou have a man trying to hide his crimes.\n  Affidavit--where I come from, you call somebody at 2:30 in the \nmorning, you are up to no good.\n  (Laughter.)\n  That will be borne out, if you listen to the testimony and use your \ncommon sense. He was up to no good. He told her, ``My heart is breaking \nbecause you are on this witness list and maybe here's a way to get out \nof it.'' That is the God's truth. That is what he did and that is wrong \nand that is a crime.\n  The rule of law, what does it mean? It means that process and \nprocedure wins out over politics and personality. That means that \nsubpoenas have to be honored by the great and the small. That means \nwhen subpoenas come, you can't, as the President, try to defeat them \nbecause you are nobody special in the eyes of the law--except that you \nare the guardian of the law. If you are special, you are special in a \nmore ominous way, not a lesser way.\n  When you file an affidavit in a court of law, nobody, because of \ntheir position in society, has the right to cheat and to get somebody \nto lie for them, even as the President. That means we are not a nation \nof men or kings, we are a nation of laws. And that is what this case \nhas always been about to me.\n  This affidavit was false for a reason--because the President and Ms.\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\nLewinsky wanted it to be false. The job search? ``Mission \naccomplished,'' says it all. ``Mission accomplished.''\n  It went from being no big deal to the biggest deal in the world with \na telephone bill--I don't know what the telephone bill was to get this \njob, but it was huge. ``Mission accomplished.''\n  All these are crimes. All these are things that average Americans \nshould not be allowed to do. But I am going to tell you something. At \nthis point in time what is going on is that he is trying to conceal a \nrelationship about the workplace that would be embarrassing and that \nwould be illegal and that would help Ms. Jones and would hurt him. And \nit is not just about his private life. But you can say this about the \nPresident, he was trying to get her a job and he was trying to just get \nher to file a false affidavit so this would go away. And he was trying \nto hide the gifts. And that is bad but that is not nearly as bad as \nwhat was to come.\n\n  Let me tell you what was to come, ladies and gentlemen. After the \ndeposition, when it was clear that Ms. Lewinsky may have been talking, \nor somebody knew something they weren't supposed to know, the alarm \nbells went off and concealing the relationship changed to redefining \nthe relationship. That is why he should not be our President. The \nredefining of the relationship began very quickly after that \ndeposition. It started with the President's secretary, and it goes like \nthis: The President, on two occasions, under the guise of refreshing \nhis memory, makes the following statements to his secretary, ``You are \nalways there when she was there, right? We were never really alone? You \ncould see and hear everything? Monica came on to me and I never touched \nher, right? She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.''\n  If you believe that is about refreshing your memory, you are not \nbeing reasonable. That is about coaching a witness. But here is where \nit gets to be nasty. Here is where it gets to be mean: ``Monica came on \nto me and I never touched her, right? She wanted to have sex with me \nand I couldn't do that.'' He didn't say it once, he said it twice, just \nto make sure Ms. Currie would get the point.\n  Now that Ms. Lewinsky may be a problem, let me tell you how the \ndiscussion goes. It is not from concealing; now it is redefining.\n  Conversation with Mr. Morris, after they did the poll about what to \ndo here, and ``We just have to win.'' The President had a followup \nconversation with Mr. Morris during the evening of January 22, 1998, \nthe day after the story broke, when Mr. Morris was considering holding \na press conference to blast Ms. Lewinsky out of the water, the \nPresident told Mr. Morris to be careful, to be careful. According to \nMr. Morris, the President warned him not to be too hard on Ms. Lewinsky \nbecause ``there is some slight chance that she may not be cooperating \nwith Mr. Starr and we don't want to alienate her by anything we are \ngoing to put out.'' In other words, don't blast her now, she may not be \na problem to us.\n  During this period of time, it went from concealing to redefining. \nWhen he knew he had to win, what did he do? He went to his secretary \nand he made her a sexual predator and him an innocent victim, and he \ndid it twice. But did he do it to anybody else? Did he redefine his \nrelationship to anybody else?\n  I now would like to have a clip from Mr. Blumenthal, please.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. You have a conversation with the President on the same \n     day the article comes out, and the conversation includes a \n     discussion about the relationship between him and Ms. \n     Lewinsky, is that correct?\n       A. Yes.\n\n  Next tape:\n\n       Q. Now, you stated, I think very honestly, and I appreciate \n     that, you were lied to by the President. Is it a fair \n     statement, given your previous testimony concerning your 30-\n     minute conversation, that the President was trying to portray \n     himself as a victim of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A. I think that's the import of his whole story.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen, that is the import of his whole story. That \nstory was told on the day this broke in the press, and it goes on. That \nstory is very detailed. It makes him the victim of a sexual predator \ncalled Ms. Lewinsky. He had to rebuff her. He threatened her--she \nthreatened him, excuse me. And it goes on and on and on. And I have \nalways wondered, how did that story make it to the grand jury and how \ndid it make it into the press? We know how it made it to the grand \njury, because Mr. Blumenthal told it and the President told him and \nthey claimed executive privilege and the President never straightened \nit out. Your President redefined this relationship, and your President \nlet that lie be passed to a grand jury. Your President obstructed \njustice in a mean way.\n  Next statement.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       MR. McDANIEL: Page 49?\n       MR. GRAHAM: Yes, sir.\n       MR. McDANIEL: Thank you.\n       BY MR. GRAHAM:\n\n       Q That's where you start talking about the story that the \n     President told you. Knowing what you know now, do you believe \n     the President lied to you about his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n       A I do.\n\n  Next statement.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Okay. Do you have any idea how White House sources are \n     associated with statements such as ``She's known as \n     `Elvira','' ``She's obsessed with the President,'' ``She's \n     known as a flirt,'' ``She's the product of a troubled home, \n     divorced parents,'' ``She's known as `The Stalker'''? Do you \n     have any idea how that got in the press?\n       MR. BREUER: I'm going to object. The document speaks for \n     itself, but it's not clear that the terms that Mr. Lindsey \n     has used are necessarily--any or all of them--are from a \n     White House source. I object to the form and the \n     characterization of the question.\n       MR. GRAHAM: The ones that I have indicated are associated \n     with the White House as being the source of those statements \n     and--\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Senator Edwards and I think that question \n     is appropriate and the objection is overruled.\n       THE WITNESS: I have no idea how anything came to be \n     attributed to a White House source.\n\n  Everybody wants this over so bad you can taste it, including me, but \ndon't let's leave a taste behind that history cannot stand. It was \nshouted in this Chamber, ``For God's sakes, vote.''\n  Let me quietly, if I can, for God's sakes, get to the truth. For \nGod's sakes, figure out what kind of person we have here in the White \nHouse. For God's sakes, spend some time to fulfill your constitutional \nduty so that we can get it right, not just for our political moment but \nfor the future of this Nation.\n  When the President redefined this relationship, he did so by telling \na lie. He told a lie to a key White House aide, who repeated that lie \nto a Federal grand jury, and in our system, ladies and gentlemen, that \nis a crime. That lie made it into the public domain. That lie was mean. \nThat lie would have the effect of running this young lady over. You \nthink what you want to think, too, about Ms. Tripp, and I agree she is \nnot going to be in the hall of fame of friends, but let me tell you, \nthe best advice she gave that young lady was to keep that blue dress.\n  The final thing is that our President, in my opinion, and for you to \njudge, in August of last year, after being begged not to by many \nMembers of this body and prominent Americans, appeared before a Federal \ngrand jury to answer for the conduct in this case, his conduct. We have \nalleged that with forewarning and knowledge on his part, that instead \nof clearing it up and making America a better place, instead of \nfulfilling his role as the chief law enforcement officer of the land to \ndo honor to the law, instead of taking this burden off all Americans' \nbacks, he told a story that defies common sense, that he played a \nbutchery game with the English language that ``is'' maybe is not is, \nand ``alone'' is not alone, and he told John Podesta, ``My relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky was not sexual, including oral sex.''\n  He went on and told an elaborate farce to a Federal grand jury that \nthey just didn't ask the right question and really the sexual \nrelationship did include one thing but not another. And he says he \nnever lied to his aide and he says he never lied to the grand jury. \nWell, God knows he lied to somebody, and he lied to that grand jury, \nand this whole story is a fraud and a farce. The last people in the \nUnited States to straighten it out is the U.S. Senate. God bless you in \nyour endeavors.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

This is the first semiannual \nreport that evaluates progress in BiH against the ten benchmarks \n(``aims'') outlined in my certification to the Congress of March 3, \n1998. NATO adopted these benchmarks on May 28, 1998, as part of its \napproval of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) military operations plan \n(OPLAN 10407). The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council \n(PIC) subsequently adopted corresponding benchmarks in its Luxembourg \nDeclaration of June 9, 1998.\n  NATO, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and my \nAdministration have coordinated closely in evaluating progress on \nDayton implementation based on these benchmarks. There is general \nagreement that there has been considerable progress in the past year. \nThe basic institutions of the state, both political and economic, have \nbeen established. Key laws regarding foreign investment, privatization, \nand property are now in place. Freedom of movement across the country \nhas substantially improved. Fundamental reform of the media is \nunderway. Elections have demonstrated a continuing trend towards \ngrowing pluralism. Nevertheless, there is still much to be done, in \nparticular on interethnic tolerance and reconciliation, the development \nof effective common institutions with powers clearly delineated from \nthose of the Entities, and an open and pluralistic political life. The \ngrowth of organized crime also represents a serious threat.\n  With specific reference to SFOR, the Secretaries of State and \nDefense, in meetings in December 1998 with their NATO counterparts, \nagreed that SFOR continues to play an essential role in the maintenance \nof peace and stability and the provision of a secure environment in \nBiH, thus contributing significantly to progress in rebuilding BiH as a \nsingle, democratic, and multiethnic state. At the same time, NATO \nagreed that we do not intend to maintain SFOR's presence at current \nlevels indefinitely, and in fact agreed on initial reductions, which I \nwill describe later in this report. Below is a benchmark-by-benchmark \nevaluation of the state-of-play in BiH based on analysis of input from \nmultiple sources.\n  1. Military Stability. Aim: Maintain Dayton cease-fire. Considerable \nprogress has been made toward military stabilization in BiH. Entity \nArmed Forces (EAFs) are in compliance with Dayton, and there have been \nno incidents affecting the cease-fire. EAFs remain substantially \ndivided along ethnic lines. Integration of the Federation Army does not \nreach down to corps-level units and below. However, progress has been \nmade through the Train and Equip Program to integrate the Ministry of \nDefense and to provide the Federation with a credible deterrent \ncapability. Although it is unlikely to meet its target of full \nintegration by August 1999, the Federation Ministry of Defense has \nbegun staff planning for integration. The Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) \ncontinues its relationship with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(FRY) Army. Similarly, the Bosnian Croat element of the Federation Army \nmaintains ties with Croatia. In both cases, however, limited resources \nimpinge on what either Croatia or the FRY can provide financially or \nmaterially; the overall trend in support is downward. In some areas, \nthe VRS continues to have certain qualitative and quantitative \nadvantages over the Federation Army, but the Train and Equip Program \nhas helped narrow the gap in some key areas. The arms control regimes \nestablished under Articles II (confidence and security-building \nmeasures) and IV (arms reduction and limitations) of Annex 1-B of the \nDayton Peace Accords are functioning. In October 1997, BiH and the \nother parties were recognized as being in compliance with the \nlimitations on five major types of armaments (battle tanks, armored \ncombat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft, and attack helicopters) \nset forth in the Article IV agreement, which were derived from the \nAnnex 1B 5:2:2 ratios for the FRY, Republic of Croatia, and BiH \nrespectively. The parties have since maintained armament levels \nconsistent with the limitations and are expected to do so in the \nfuture. A draft mandate for an Article V agreement (regional stability) \nhas been approved; negotiations are due to begin in early 1999. \nMilitary stability remains dependent on SFOR as a deterrent force.\n  2. Public Security and Law Enforcement. Aim: A restructured and \ndemocratic police force in both entities. There has been considerable \nprogress to date on police reform due to sustained joint efforts of the \nInternational Police Task Force (IPTF), Office of the High \nRepresentative (OHR), and SFOR, which have overcome a number of \nsignificant political obstacles. So far, approximately 85 percent of \nthe police in the Federation have received IPTF-approved training, as \nhave approximately 35 percent of the police in the Republika Srbska \n(RS). All sides continue to lag in the hiring of minority\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nofficers and, as the IPTF implements its plans to address this problem, \ntensions will increase in the short-term. SFOR often must support the \nIPTF in the face of crime, public disorder, and rogue police. \nMonoethnic police forces have often failed to facilitate minority \nreturns. In these types of scenarios, SFOR's use of the Multinational \nSpecialized Unit (MSU) has been a force miltiplier, requiring fewer, \nbut specially trained troops. At this point, SFOR's essential \ncontribution to maintaining a secure environment, to include backing up \nIPTF in support of nascent civilian police forces, remains critical to \ncontinued progress.\n  3. Judicial Reform. Aim: An effective judicial reform program. \nSeveral key steps forward were taken in 1998, such as the signing of an \nMOU on Inter-Entity Legal Assistance on May 20, 1998, and establishment \nof an Inter-Entity Legal Commission on June 4, 1998. The Federation \nParliament in July adopted a new criminal code. Nevertheless, the \njudicial system still requires significant reform. Judges are still \ninfluenced by politics, and the system is financially strapped and \nremains ethnically biased. Execution of judgments, in particular \neviction of persons who illegally occupy dwellings, is especially \nproblematic. The progress made in the area of commercial law is \nencouraging for economic development prospects.\n\n  4. Illegal Institutions, Organized Crime, and Corruption. Aim: The \ndissolution of illegal pre-Dayton institutions. Corruption remains a \nmajor challenge to building democratic institutions of government. \nStructures for independent monitoring of government financial \ntransactions are still not in place. Shadow institutions still need to \nbe eliminated. The burden of creating institutions to combat fraud and \norganized crime falls mostly to the international community and in \nparticular to the IPTF. SFOR contributes to the secure environment \nnecessary for the success of other international efforts to counter \nthese illegal activities.\n  5. Media Reform. Aim: Regulated, democratic, and independent media. \nApproximately 80 percent television coverage has been achieved in BiH \nthrough the international community's support for the Open Broadcasting \nNetwork (OBN), which is the first (and so far only) neutral source of \nnews in BiH. Several television and radio networks have been \nrestructured and are led by new management boards. Most are in \ncompliance with Dayton except for some regional broadcasts. The \nIndependent Media Commission assumed responsibility for media \nmonitoring from the OSCE on October 31, 1998. Progress has been \nsignificant, but BiH still has far to go to approach international \nstandards. SFOR's past actions in this area are a key deterrent against \nillegal use of media assets to undermine Dayton implementation.\n  6. Elections and Democratic Governance. Aim: National democratic \ninstitutions and practices. With the exception of the election of a \nnationalist to the RS presidency, the September 1998 national elections \ncontinued the long-term trend away from reliance on ethnically based \nparties. The two major Serb nationalist parties lost further ground \nand, once again, will be unable to lead the RS government. Croat and \nBosniak nationalist parties retained control, but saw margins eroded \nsignificantly. In this regard, SFOR's continued presence will \nfacilitate conduct of the municipal elections scheduled for late 1999 \nbut, as has been the case with every election since Dayton, the trend \nof increasingly turning over responsibility for elections to the \nBosnians themselves will continue.\n  7. Economic Development. Aim: Free-market reforms. While the process \nof economic recovery and transformation will take many years, some \nessential groundwork has been laid. Privatization legislation and \nenterprise laws have been passed, and banking legislation has been \npartially passed. Fiscal revenues from taxes and customs have increased \nsignificantly. Nevertheless, the fiscal and revenue system is in its \ninfancy. Implementation of privatization legislation is slow and the \nbanking sector is under-funded, but there are signs of development in \nGDP. There has been a marked increase in freedom of movement, further \nenhanced by the uniform license plate law. SFOR's continued \ncontribution to a secure environment and facilitating freedom of \nmovement is vital as economic reforms begin to take hold.\n  8. Displaced Person and Refugee (DPRE) Returns. Aim: A functioning \nphased and orderly minority return process. While there have been some \nsignificant breakthroughs on DPRE returns to minority areas, such as \nJajce, Stolac, Kotor Varos, Prijedor, Mostar, and Travnik, the overall \nnumbers have been low. In some areas where minority DPREs have \nreturned, interethnic tensions rose quickly. Some nationalist political \nparties continue to obstruct the return of minority DPREs to the areas \nthey control. Poor living conditions in some areas present little \nincentive for DPREs to return. The Entities are using DPREs to resettle \nregions (opstinas) that are of strategic interest to each ethnic \nfaction. SFOR's contribution to a secure environment remains vital to \nOHR efforts to facilitate minority returns.\n  9. Brcko. Aim: A multiethnic administration, DPRE returns, and secure \nenvironment. Freedom of movement in Brcko has improved dramatically. \nCitizens of BiH are increasingly confident in using their right to \ntravel freely throughout the municipality and the region. Police and \njudicial elements have been installed, but the goal of multiethnicity \nin these elements still has not been realized. About 1,000 Federation \nfamilies have returned to the parts of Brcko on the RS side of the \nInter-Entity Boundary Line, but few Serb displaced persons have left \nBrcko to return to their pre-war homes. SFOR support will be a critical \ndeterrent to the outbreak of violence during the period surrounding the \nArbitrator's decision on Brcko's status anticipated for early in 1999.\n  10. Persons Indicted for War Crimes (PIFWCs). Aim: Cooperation with \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \nleading to the transfer of PIFWCs to The Hague for trial. Thanks to \naction by the Congress, the Secretary of State now has the ability to \noffer rewards of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest \nor conviction of PIFWCs. Of the 81 people indicted publicly by the \nTribunal, only 29--36 percent--are still at large. The two highest-\nprofile indictees, Karadzic and Mladic, are among them. Bosniaks are \ncooperating with the ICTY, but the failure of the RS to support the \nICTY is a major obstacle to progress. Bosnian Croats have cooperated \nwith respect to the surrender of all but two public indictees, but have \nnot cooperated fully with respect to the Tribunal's orders that they \nturn over documents needed for the fair trial of a number of indictees. \nSFOR continues to provide crucial support in the apprehension of PIFWCs \nand for ICTY exhumations.\n\n  In my report to the Congress dated July 28, 1998, I emphasized the \nimportant role that realistic target dates, combined with concerted use \nof incentives, leverage, and pressure on all parties, should play in \nmaintaining the sense of urgency necessary to move steadily toward an \nenduring peace.\n  The December 1998 Peace Implementation Council Declaration and its \nannex (attached) offer target dates for accomplishment of specific \ntasks by authorities in BiH. The PIC decisions formed the background \nagainst which NATO Defense Ministers reviewed the future of SFOR in \ntheir December 17 meeting. Failure by Bosnian authorities to act within \nthe prescribed timeframes would be the point of departure for more \nforceful action by the OHR and other elements of the international \ncommunity. Priorities for 1999 will include: accelerating the \ntransition to a sustainable market economy; increasing the momentum on \nthe return of refugees and displaced persons, particularly to minority \nareas; providing a secure environment through the rule of law, \nincluding significant progress on judicial reform and further \nestablishment of multiethnic police; developing and reinforcing the \ncentral institutions, including adoption of a permanent election law, \nand the development of greater confidence and cooperation among the \nEntity defense establishments with the goal of their eventual \nunification; and pressing ahead with media reform and education issues.\n  In accordance with the NATO Defense Ministers' guidance in June 1998, \nNATO is conducting a series of comprehensive reviews at no more than 6-\nmonth intervals. The first of these reviews was completed on November \n16, 1998, and recently endorsed by the North Atlantic Council (NAC) \nForeign and Defense Ministers. In reviewing the size and shape of SFOR \nagainst the\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\nbenchmarks described above, the United States and its Allies concluded \nthat at present, there be no changes in SFOR's mission. NATO \nrecommended, however, that steps begin immediately to streamline SFOR. \nThe NAC Foreign and Defense Ministers endorsed this recommendation on \nDecember 8, 1998, and December 17, 1998, respectively. The Defense \nMinisters also endorsed a report from the NATO Military Authorities \n(NMAs) authorizing further adjustments in SFOR force levels--in \nresponse to the evolving security situation and support requirements--\nto be completed by the end of March 1999. While the specifics of these \nadjustments are still being worked, they could amount to reductions of \nas much as 10 percent from the 6,900 U.S. troops currently in SFOR. The \n6,900 troop level already represents a 20 percent reduction from the \n8,500 U.S. troops deployed in June 1998 and is 66 percent less than \npeak U.S. deployment of 20,000 troops in 1996.\n  The NATO Defense Ministers on December 17, 1998, further instructed \nNMAs to examine options for possible longer-term and more substantial \nadjustments to the future size and structure of SFOR. Their report is \ndue in early 1999 and will give the United States and its Allies the \nnecessary information on which to base decisions on SFOR's future. We \nwill address this issue in the NAC again at that time. Decisions on \nfuture reductions will be taken in the light of progress on \nimplementation of the Peace Agreement. Any and all reductions of U.S. \nforces in the short or long term will be made in accordance with my \nAdministration's policy that such reductions will not jeopardize the \nsafety of U.S. armed forces serving in BiH.\n  My Administration values the Congress' substantial support for Dayton \nimplementation. I look forward to continuing to work with the Congress \nin pursuit of U.S. foreign policy goals in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to establish a national policy of basic consumer fair \ntreatment for airline passengers; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     AIRLINE PASSENGER FAIRNESS ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senators \nBryan and Snowe in introducing today the Airline Passenger Fairness Act \nof 1999. The purpose of our legislation is to assure that consumer \nprotections don't end when a passenger pulls into the airport parking \nlot. Travelers ought to enjoy the same kinds of rights in the air as \nthey do on the ground. But as airline profits have soared in recent \nyears, passenger rights have been left at the gate.\n  We are well aware that legislation cannot resolve every problem air \ntravelers may encounter. Our bill does not impose a federal mandate for \nfluffier pillows or a Constitutional right to a bigger bag of peanuts, \njust the right to basic information and the ability for consumers to \nmake decisions for themselves.\n  The Department of Transportation's (DoT) Air Travel Consumer Reports \njust issued its final tally of consumer complaints for 1998. Consumer \ncomplaints about air travel jumped from a total of 7,667 in 1997 to \n9,606 last year, an increase of more than 25%. In just three months \nlast year, one airline alone denied boarding to 55,767 passengers. The \n10 largest U.S. carriers combined denied boarding to more than 250,300 \npassengers from July-September 1998. One industry expert estimates that \nsometimes as many as 130-150% of the seats on a flight are sold. \nClearly, all is not well.\n  The price of an airline ticket is one of the great mysteries of \nmodern life. A ticket costs one price when purchased over the phone and \nanother if purchased online, one if purchased in the morning and \nanother three hours later. It practically defies the law of physics.\n  With this bill, we are putting the airlines on notice that business \nas usual is no longer acceptable for American air travelers. No longer \ncan a passenger be bumped, canceled or overbooked with impunity.\n  Under this bill, consumers will be able to get full information about \nall the fares on all the flights. Airlines will no longer be able to \nwithhold basic information on air fares, creating confusion and \npreventing consumers from comparison shopping. It will also make sure \nthat when a consumer pays for a ticket, they can use all or part of it \nfor whatever reason they choose. Airlines will have to inform a \nticketed passenger when a flight is overbooked, as well as when the \nproblem is when a flight is canceled, delayed, or diverted.\n  The legislation will work by building on current rules and \nregulations. Today, the Department of Transportation can investigate \n``anti-competitive, unfair or deceptive practices'' by an airline. If \nthe Department finds that an airline has engaged in such practices, DoT \ncan issue civil penalties or take other actions to assure compliance. \nOur legislation will empower consumers to seek DoT action against \ncarriers that fail to respect the common sense consumer protections \nspelled out in the bill.\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n  To date, DoT has tended to look at this authority primarily on an \nindustry-wide basis, or whether one airline has engaged in an unfair \npractice against another. Our bill brings this attention down to the \nconsumers' level. It gives the Department the authority to investigate \nand punish violations of passenger rights. Under our proposal, airlines \nwill no longer be able to deny consumers basic information without \npaying a price.\n  This bill will also put market forces to work to bring prices down. \nToday, a traveler cannot get much basic information. Poor information \nmakes for poor decisions; poor decisions prevent the market from \noperating smoothly and set the stage for higher prices. Just last year, \naccording to one national media report, there were more than a dozen \nfare hikes, and in late January, the media reported the major U.S. \ncarriers raised leisure fares four percent and business fares two \npercent. Informed consumers engaging in real comparison shopping will \nput pressure on the airlines to make fares as low as possible.\n  There's been a lot of talk lately about ``air rage.'' In my view \nthere is no excuse for violent or abusive behavior by anyone. But when \npeople are treated like so many pieces of cargo, it's not surprising \nthat some of them will lash out. One pilot at a major U.S. air carrier \nsaid recently: ``What's happening is the industry's own fault. We've \ngot to treat passengers with respect. We've made air travel a very \nunpleasant experience.''\n  It's time to make sure air travel works better for everyone. It can \nif air travelers have the same basic protections as other consumers. \nThe corner grocer cannot sell a customer a product at one price and \nthen sell the next customer in line the same product at a higher price. \nThe neighborhood movie house cannot cancel a show just because only a \nfew people show up. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act will bring \nsimilar consumer protections to air travel and ensure that air \ntravelers have the information they need to make informed decisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Passenger Fairness \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of airline passengers on United States \n     carriers is expected to grow from about 600 million per year \n     today to about 1 billion by the year 2008.\n       (2) Since 1978 the number of certified large air carriers \n     has decreased from 30 to 10. In 1998, 6 of the United States' \n     largest air carriers sought to enter into arrangements that \n     would result in 3 large networks comprising approximately 70 \n     percent of the domestic market.\n       (3) Only \\2/3\\ of all communities in the United States that \n     had scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today, and \n     \\1/2\\ of those remaining are served by smaller airlines \n     feeding hub airports.\n       (4) The Department of Transportation's Domestic Airline \n     Fares Consumer Report for the 3rd Quarter of 1997 listed 75 \n     major city pairs where fares increased by 30 percent or more \n     year-over-year, while total traffic in these city pairs \n     decreased by 863,500 passengers, or more than 20 percent.\n       (5) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that \n     large United States air carriers charge twice as much at \n     their large hub airports where there is no low fare \n     competition as they charge at a hub airport where a low fare \n     competitor is present. The General Accounting Office found \n     that fares range from 12 percent to 71 percent higher at hubs \n     dominated by one carrier or a consortium.\n       (6) Complaints filed with the Department of Transportation \n     about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent \n     over the previous year, and complaints against large United \n     States air carriers have increased from 6,394 in 1997 to \n     7,994 in 1998.\n       (7) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission \n     reported that recent data indicate the problem of delay in \n     flights is getting worse, and that the number of daily \n     aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer was nearly 20 percent \n     higher in 1996 than in 1995.\n       (8) The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission \n     forecast that United States domestic and international \n     passenger enplanements are expected to increase 52 percent \n     between 1996 and 2006, and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration forecasts annual growth in revenue passenger \n     miles will average 4.2 percent.\n       (9) A 1998 Department of Transportation study found that \n     the large United States air carriers charge about 60 percent \n     more to passengers traveling to or from small communities \n     than they charge to passengers traveling between large \n     communities.\n       (10) The Congress has directed the Secretary of \n     Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in \n     the airline industry.\n\n     SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS.\n\n       Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``On the initiative'' and inserting ``(a) \n     Duty of the Secretary.--On the initiative''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(b) Specific Practices.--For purposes of subsection (a), \n     the terms `unfair or deceptive practice' and `unfair method \n     of competition' include, in the case of a certificated air \n     carrier, an air carrier's failure--\n       ``(1) to inform a ticketed passenger, upon request, whether \n     the flight on which the passenger is ticketed is oversold;\n       ``(2) to permit a passenger holding a confirmed reserved \n     space on a flight to use portions of that passenger's ticket \n     for travel, rather than the entire ticket, regardless of the \n     reason any other portion of the ticket is not used;\n       ``(3) to deliver a passenger's checked baggage within 24 \n     hours after arrival of the flight on which the passenger \n     travelled and on which the passenger checked the baggage, \n     except for reasonable delays in delivery of such baggage;\n       ``(4) to provide a consumer full access to all fares for \n     that air carrier, regardless of the technology the consumer \n     uses to access the fares if such information is requested by \n     that consumer;\n       ``(5) to provide notice to each passenger holding a \n     confirmed reserved space on a flight with reasonable prior \n     notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed for any reason \n     (other than reasons of national security);\n       ``(6) to inform passengers accurately and truthfully of the \n     reason for the delay, cancellation, or diversion of a flight;\n       ``(7) to refund the full purchase price of an unused ticket \n     if the passenger requests a refund within 48 hours after the \n     ticket is purchased;\n       ``(8) to disclose to consumers information that would \n     enable them to make informed decisions about the comparative \n     value of frequent flyer programs among airlines, including--\n       ``(A) the number of seats redeemable on each flight; and\n       ``(B) the percentage of successful and failed redemptions \n     on each airline and on each flight.\n       ``(c) Report.--The Secretary shall include information \n     about violations of subsection (a) by certificated air \n     carriers in the Department of Transportation's monthly Air \n     Travel Consumer Report.\n       ``(d) Confirmed reserved space.--The term `confirmed \n     reserved space' shall mean a space on a specific date and on \n     a specific flight and class of service of a carrier which has \n     been requested by a passenger and which the carrier or its \n     agent has verified, by appropriate notation on the ticket or \n     in any other manner provided by the carrier, as being \n     reserved for the accommodation of the passenger.''.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Snowe, and Senator Bryan, to \nintroduce the Airline Passenger Fairness Act.\n  People who travel by air are the airlines' customers. As such, they \nexpect and deserve the same fair treatment that consumers in other \nareas have come to rely on. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act would \nensure that passengers have the information that they need to make \ninformed choices in their travel plans. It also seeks to encourage \nairlines to provide better customer service by outlining some minimum \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on \nsome of the specific provisions in the bill. The Airline Passenger \nFairness Act will enable an airline passenger to:\n  find out whether the flight on which that passenger is booked has \nbeen oversold;\n  use whatever portions of a ticket he or she chooses to use to get to \nhis or her destination;\n  receive his or her checked baggage within 24 hours of a flight's \narrival, unless additional delays are reasonable;\n  find out from an airline all of the fares that the airline offers, \nregardless of the method used to access fares;\n  receive prior notice when a scheduled flight will be delayed, if \nreasonable;\n  receive accurate information about the reasons why a passenger's \nflight has been delayed, canceled, or diverted to another airport;\n  obtain a full refund of the purchase price of a ticket if the \npassenger requests it within 48 hours of purchase; and\n  receive accurate information about an airline's frequent flyer \nprogram, including the number of seats that can be\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nredeemed on each flight, and the percentage of successful and failed \nfrequent flyer redemptions on each flight.\n  The Department of Transportation already holds the authority to \ninvestigate airlines that have been charged with exercising ``unfair \nand deceptive practices,'' and ``unfair methods of competition.'' Our \nbill simply specifies that if passengers are denied any of the items of \nfair treatment that I just listed, that denial constitutes an unfair or \ndeceptive practice on the part of the airline, or an unfair method of \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, this legislation is about helping \nconsumers make informed choices among their air travel options. A key \ncomponent of this bill is a publication requirement. Consumers will be \nable to review the Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel \nConsumer Report to find out what airlines are denying passengers the \nfair treatment outlined in the bill, and on how many occasions.\n  Air travel is on the rise. As airport congestion, delays, and fares \nincrease, so have the complaints among airline passengers. The Air \nPassenger Fairness Act seeks to respond to these complaints in a \nconstructive manner by giving passengers better information on which to \njudge the service levels offered by the airlines. We expect to hold \nhearings soon on this bill in the Commerce Committee, and we welcome \nany input on the initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 384. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive certain \ndomestic source or content requirements in the procurement of items.\n\n\n                  BUY AMERICA RESTRICTIONS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would authorize the Secretary of Defense to waive \n``Buy America'' restrictions on all items procured for the Department \nof Defense.\n  I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential \nimpact of our ``Buy America'' policy on bilateral trade relations with \nour allies. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose this type of \nprotectionist trade policy, not only because I believe free trade is an \nimportant means of improving relations among all nations and a key to \nmajor U.S. economic growth, but also because I believe we must reform \nthese practices in order to make our limited defense dollars go further \nso as to reverse the downward trend in our military readiness.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward bill that \npromotes U.S. products, not by imposing restrictive barriers on open \ncompetition and free trade, but by reinforcing sound and beneficial \neconomic principles.\n  This bill gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to waive \nrestrictions on the procurement of all items with respect to a foreign \ncountry if the Secretary of Defense determines they would impede \ncooperative programs entered into between a foreign country and the \nDepartment of Defense. Additionally, it would waive protectionist \npractices if it is determined that such practices would impede the \nreciprocal procurement of items in that foreign country, and that \nforeign country does not discriminate against items produced in the \nU.S. to a greater degree than the U.S. discriminates against items \nproduced in that country.\n  For example, the Secretary of Defense may waive ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions for contracts and subcontracts for items because of \nunreasonable delays or costs to the U.S. government in equipping \nservicemembers with U.S. products; insufficient quantity or \nunsatisfactory quality of U.S. products; and absence of competition in \nthe U.S., resulting in a monopoly or a sole source contract, and thus, \na higher price for the Department of Defense and ultimately the \ntaxpayer.\n  Let me be clear, I am not against U.S. procurement of American \nproducts. The United States, without a doubt, produces the very best \nproducts in the world. In fact, a recent Department of State study \nreported that U.S. defense companies sold more weapons and defense \nproducts and claimed a larger share of the world market than was \npreviously realized. This new study shows U.S. exports of defense \nproducts increased to nearly $25 billion in 1996, comprising nearly 60 \npercent of global exports. This number continues to rise steadily.\n  From a practical standpoint, adherence to ``Buy America'' \nrestrictions seriously impairs our ability to compete freely in \ninternational markets for the best price on needed military equipment \nand could also result in a loss of existing business from longstanding \ninternational trading partners. While I fully understand the arguments \nmade by some that the ``Buy America'' restrictions help maintain \ncertain critical industrial base capabilities, I find no reason to \nsupport domestic source restrictions for products that are widely \navailable from many U.S. companies (e.g., pumps produced by at least 25 \nU.S. companies). I believe that competition and open markets among our \nallies on a reciprocal basis would provide the best equipment at the \nbest prices for taxpayers and U.S. and allied militaries alike.\n  In recent meetings, the Ambassadors and other senior representatives \nof the United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia and Israel have \napprised me of similar situations in their countries. In every meeting, \nthey tell me how difficult it is becoming to persuade their governments \nto buy American defense products, because of our protectionist policies \nand the growing ``Buy European'' sentiment.\n  Mr. President, we have heard over the last four months of the dire \nsituation of our military forces. We have heard testimony of decreasing \nreadiness, modernization programs that are decades behind schedule, and \nquality of life deficiencies that are so great we cannot retain, much \nless recruit, the personnel we need. As a result, there has been a \nrecent groundswell of support in Congress for the Armed Forces, \nincluding a number of pay and retirement initiatives and the promise of \na significant increase in defense spending.\n  All of these proposals are excellent starting points to help re-forge \nour military, but we must not forget that much of them will be in vain \nif the Department of Defense is obligated to maintain wasteful, \nprotectionist trade policies. When we actually look for the dollars to \npay for these initiatives, it would be unconscionable not to examine \nthe potential for savings from modifying the ``Buy America'' program. \nSecretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have stated repeatedly \nthat they want more flexibility to reform the military's archaic \nacquisition practices. We cannot sit idly by and throw money at the \nproblem, without considering this partial solution regarding ``Buy \nAmerica.''\n  Mr. President, the Congress can continue to protect U.S. industry \nfrom foreign competition for selfish, special interest reasons, or we \ncan loosen these restrictions to provide the necessary funds to ensure \nour military can fight and win future wars. Every dollar we spend on \narchaic procurement policies, like ``Buy America,'' is a dollar we \ncannot spend on training our troops, keeping personnel quality of life \nat an appropriate level, maintaining force structure, replacing old \nweapons systems, and advancing our military technology.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this legislation will end \nonce and for all the anti-competitive, anti-free trade practices that \nencumber our government, the military, and U.S. industry. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this critical bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to further improve the safety and health of working environments, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n              SAFETY ADVANCEMENT FOR EMPLOYEES (SAFE) ACT\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safety \nAdvancement for Employees (SAFE) Act of 1999.\n  Today, as Americans head off to work, 17 of them will die and 18,600 \nof them will be injured on the job. The fact is that these accidents \nare occurring not because employers are heartless when it comes to \nworker safety. On the contrary, even the Department of Labor estimates \nthat 95 percent of employers are striving to create safe workplaces. \nNevertheless, America's employers are routinely left to their own \ndevices to comply with thousands of pages of regulations without agency \nassistance and face steep fines for noncompliance despite their good-\nfaith efforts.\n  The Clinton Administration has responded to this problem by pledging \na ``reinvented government'' that partners with employers in the effort \nto improve occupational safety and health. I agree with the strong \nstatements made by Vice President Gore that ``OSHA doesn't work well \nenough,'' and that OSHA should ``hire third parties, such as private \ninspection companies'' to perform inspections. In fact, Vice President \nGore's conclusions are at the heart of the OSHA modernization effort \nthat I worked on last Congress. The SAFE Act that I am introducing \ntoday embodies a true partnership approach by encouraging employers to \nvoluntarily hire third party consultants to audit their workplaces for \ncompliance with OSHA and safety in general. Those consultants must be \nqualified by OSHA as legitimate safety consultants. They will work with \nemployers on an ongoing basis to ensure that the employer is in \ncompliance with OSHA regulations. Once the employer is in compliance, \nthe consultant will issue him a certificate of compliance.\n  Under the SAFE Act, OSHA retains full power to inspect employers who \nhave received such a certificate, full power to find violations of \nOSHA's regulations and full power to order such employers to abate the \nviolations. The bill also provides that good-faith employers who go to \nthe time and expense of hiring a safety consultant and getting in \ncompliance with OSHA are exempt from civil fines for one year. In other \nwords, the SAFE Act strikes a new and healthier balance for America's \nworkers.\n  The SAFE Act's third party consultation provision codifies the Vice \nPresident's approach. It will result in tens of thousands of employers, \nperhaps more, getting expert safety consultations. It will allow OSHA \nto target its enforcement resources where they are most needed, and \nunlike other OSHA reform bills, it preserves OSHA's power to inspect \nany workplace and order abatement as it sees fit.\n  During the 105th Congress, the SAFE Act garnered more support than \nany OSHA modernization measure in years and successfully passed the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee within a few months of \nintroduction. I hope to build on that success by strengthening the \nconsultation aspect of the bill in the 106th Congress. One of the most \nimportant changes to the SAFE Act in this regard is that the voluntary, \nthird party consultation provision now requires employers to work with \ntrained safety and health consultants to develop work site-specific \nsafety and health programs before they receive a Certificate of \nCompliance. I have borrowed both the idea for this provision and the \nlanguage directly from one of OSHA's successful consultation programs, \nthe Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program, or SHARP. SHARP \nis a consultation-based program available to businesses who want to \nwork with an OSHA consultant and develop a safety and health program in \nreturn for one year free from inspections. The key to this program's \nsuccess is that it is voluntary, it helps employers achieve compliance \nby working with a trained safety consultant, and it contains incentives \nto encourage employers to seek solutions to safety and health hazards.\n  The outstanding results of the SHARP program will be amplified by its \ninclusion in the SAFE Act. Due to the limited resources that OSHA \ndedicates to consultation, very few employers are able to take \nadvantage of the SHARP program. However, under the SAFE Act, the safety \nbenefits of the program will be available to every employer on a \nvoluntary basis.\n  An important and additional benefit of including OSHA's voluntary, \nconsultation-based SHARP program in the SAFE Act is that it strikes a \ncompromise. For the last several months, OSHA has been moving forward \nin promulgating a mandatory safety and health program rule applicable \nto all employers regardless of size or type. The rule is not only \nmandatory but it is also a ``performance-based'' rule, the elements of \nwhich are almost completely subjective in nature. For example, the rule \nrequires a program ``appropriate'' to conditions in the workplace, an \nemployer to evaluate the effectiveness of the program ``as often as \nnecessary'' to ensure program effectiveness, and ``where appropriate,'' \nto initiate corrective action.\n  Employers are justifiably concerned because the rule offers no \ndefinition of these terms to help them in their compliance efforts. \nThey are also concerned because there is no objectivity to the rule. \nOSHA is answering these concerns by promising that their inspectors \nwill be fair in their application of the rule and flexible in their \ninterpretations. That does not satisfy employers who have safety and \nhealth programs in place or are working to develop such programs in a \nway that meets with OSHA's approval without the threat of fines.\n  The SAFE Act combines the need to promote a safety and health program \nstandard that is sanctioned by OSHA with the need of the employer to \nknow specifically how to achieve regulatory compliance. By keeping the \nSAFE Act consultation-based, employers will have full access to \npersonalized compliance assistance. Neither will there be a threat of \nsubjective enforcement under the SAFE Act because good-faith employers \ncannot be penalized for good-faith compliance efforts. The SAFE Act is \nthe workable alternative to encourage and implement safety and health \nprograms that work to improve conditions for America's workers.\n  Another important change to the SAFE Act is that the bill has been \nstreamlined to strengthen the consultation theme by removing provisions \nthat do not relate to consultation. The importance of such streamlining \nis two-fold. First, by highlighting consultation, the SAFE Act is able \nto maintain a one-theme message that consultations work and that their \navailability should be expanded to more employers. Second, by removing \nother, non-consultation-based programs from the bill will allow for \nconcentrated development of several specific, freestanding OSHA \nmodernization bills in the future.\n  As I introduce the new SAFE Act today, I am hopeful that we can again \nbegin meaningful discussions about what is involved in achieving safer\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nworkplaces. I am hopeful that we can take even greater steps away from \nthe adversarial approach to worker safety that virtually everyone \nagrees is without benefit or substantive result. And I am hopeful that \nwe can actually pass the SAFE Act to achieve greater worker safety and \nhealth. The SAFE Act's proactive approach to achieving safer workplaces \nis revolutionary because it empowers both OSHA and the employer. By \npassing the SAFE Act, OSHA's own consultation programs will be extended \nto all employers who truly seek safety and health solutions. The result \nwill mean vastly improved safety for America's work sites.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1325-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 14\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the name of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Mack] was added as a cosponsor of S. 14, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the use of education individual \nretirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 271\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 271, a bill to \nprovide for education flexibility partnerships.\n\n\n                                 S. 280\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 280, a bill to \nprovide for education flexibility partnerships.\n\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hagel, the name of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nSmith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 327, a bill to exempt \nagricultural products, medicines, and medical products from U.S. \neconomic sanctions.\n\n\n                                 S. 377\n\n  At the request of Mr. Enzi, the name of the Senator from South Dakota \n[Mr. Johnson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 377, a bill to eliminate \nthe special reserve funds created for the Savings Association Insurance \nFund and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1329-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 6--AUTHORIZING FLAGS LOCATED IN THE \nCAPITOL COMPLEX TO BE FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF IN MEMORY OF R.

Mr. President, I believe it would be helpful for \nall of us to consider the example of bipartisan cooperation and \ncollegiality set by many of our predecessors. Jack Valenti, a former \nadvisor to President Lyndon Johnson and a man many of us know \npersonally, nicely captured that spirit in a recent editorial, \npublished in the Los Angeles Times, urging a return to ``political \ncivility.''\n  There was a time, Mr. President, when leaders of both parties, men \nlike President Johnson and Everett Dirksen, knew the importance of \nmaintaining cordial relations and cooperating to further the national \ninterest. As Jack Valenti puts it, ``they knew that compromise was not \nan ignoble word.''\n  In today's atmosphere, I fear that cooperating on anything for the \ngood of the country will prove extremely difficult. In this trying \ntime, we all should consider Jack Valenti's words, as well as the \nspirit of the bygone era he invokes.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Valenti's editorial be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 29, 1999]\n\n                 Two Old Pols Knew the Art of a Bargain\n\n                           (By Jack Valenti)\n\n       Controversy rages in Washington. But there is one fact in \n     which agreement is universal: Between a majority of the \n     people's representatives and the people's president, there is \n     a continuing antagonism that makes civil communication almost \n     impossible.\n       But ``what if''? What if, frequently, President Clinton put \n     his feet up on the coffee table on the second floor of the \n     mansion with either the speaker of the House (or the majority \n     leader of the Senate) lounging before him, chatting about \n     where the nation ought to be heading. Not that either would \n     change course or declare defeat. But the easy give and take \n     of an informal conversation, some pieces of worthy programs \n     might find daylight.\n       Looking back is usually not very fruitful, but I remember \n     when it was different than it is now. When I was special \n     assistant to President Johnson, he charged me with \n     ``handling'' key members of the Senate and the House, which \n     meant they could call me direct with grievances, needs, \n     requests. I was authorized to use my best judgment in \n     responding.\n       I bore personal witness to long-ago discourses wherein \n     President Johnson and the minority leader of the Senate, \n     Everett Dirksen of Illinois, would sip a drink, field some \n     little joke that poked fun at each other and do the nation's \n     business. Dirksen, the Republican leader, would call me \n     around noon in that voice dipped in cream and ladled out in \n     large velvet spoons, deep, sonorous tones to soothe even the \n     most obsessively discontented. ``Jack, would you tell the \n     boss I would like to see him today. Possible?'' Without \n     hesitation, ``Absolutely, senator. You want to come by around \n     6 o'clock for a drink with him?''\n       At 3 o'clock that afternoon, Dirksen would rise on the \n     Senate floor and flail LBJ with a rhetorical whip, comparing \n     him unfavorably to Caligula. Three hours later, the two would \n     gather in the West Hall in the living quarters of the \n     president, with me as observer.\n       ``Dammit, Everett, the way you treated me today made me \n     feel like a cut dog. You ought to be ashamed of \n     yourself,'' the president would say with a mocking grin. \n     ``Well, Mr. President,'' came The Voice, trying in vain to \n     suppress a chuckle. ``I have vowed to speak the truth so I \n     had no choice in the matter.'' Much laughter. They both \n     knew who they were and why they were leaders. They were \n     two warriors who had fought a hundred battles against each \n     other. They knew the game, how it was played, no quarter \n     given, no quarter asked in the public arena. But when the \n     day was done, they sat around the campfire, as it were, to \n     recount the details of the fight over a flagon of fine \n     refreshment. They both knew that each needed the other, \n     and the country needed them both. If they fumed and \n     fussed, determined to wound and kill the other, no \n     ultimate good would come of it. The land they served would \n     be agitated and stunted by stalemate. They both understood \n     the meaning of ``duty'' to the nation, and they knew that \n     compromise was not an ignoble word.\n       The president would say, ``Now, Everett, I need three \n     Republican votes on my civil rights bill, and, dammit, you \n     can get them.'' Dirksen would ponder that somberly, and then \n     pull a sheaf of papers out of his inside pocket. ``I have \n     here, Mr. President, some potential nominees to the FCC, the \n     ITC, the SEC'' and so on through the catalog of acronyms \n     wherein the nation's regulatory labors get done.\n       LBJ would sigh, and say, ``Jack, take down the names and \n     see if Mr. Hoover (J. Edgar) will certify them.'' Dirksen \n     would smile broadly, sip his drink. LBJ would do the same. \n     After more intimate joshing between them, Dirksen would \n     depart. There was no mention of a deal. There was no formal \n     commitment. But each knew the pact was struck. Each would \n     redeem the unspoken pledges given. And there was no leakage \n     to the press. Moreover, the warriors' code was intact. \n     Neither gloated in a supposed triumph over the other.\n       By whatever mutations the gods of politics brew, there has \n     to be a return to political civility, whose end result is to \n     the nation's benefit. Neither LBJ nor Sen. Dirksen lost their \n     honor or abandoned their crusades when they talked. Nor did \n     they lose their bearings. For they knew such damage would \n     diminish them both, and most of all the country, whose people \n     they had by solemn oath sworn to serve, would be the loser. \n     They did their duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1329-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1329-S1330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE STUDENTS OF MILFORD HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize students from Milford High School in Milford, New Hampshire \nfor their outstanding performance in the ``We the People * * * The \nCitizen and the Constitution'' program.\n  On May 1-3, 1999, more than 1200 students from across the United \nStates will be in Washington, D.C., to compete in the national finals \nof the ``We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution'' \nprogram. I am proud to announce that the class from Milford High School \nwill represent the state of New Hampshire in this national event. These \nyoung scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and \nthrough their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding \nof\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nthe fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  The ``We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentation by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a ``congressional \ncommittee,'' that is, the panel of judges representing various regions \nof the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The \nstudent testimony is followed by a period of questioning during which \nthe judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability \nto apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People * \n* * The Citizen and the Constitution'' program has provided curricular \nmaterials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more \nthan 26.5 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their \nstaff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues \nwith students and teachers and by participating in other educational \nactivities.\n  The student team from Milford High School is currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for the upcoming national competition in \nWashington, D.C. As a former history teacher, I recognize the \nimportance and value of this unique educational experience. I wish the \nstudents and their teacher, Mr. David Alcox, the best of luck at the \n``We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution'' national \nfinals. I look forward to greeting them when they visit Capitol Hill, \nand I am honored to represent them in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1329-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ST.

Mr. President, last week the Senate, sitting as a \ncourt of impeachment, voted on Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss the \narticles of impeachment brought by the Managers from the House of \nRepresentatives. I voted in support of this motion, and would like to \nbriefly state my position on this important question.\n  While the motion failed, it received the support of forty-four \nsenators--eleven more votes than needed to acquit the President of the \ncharges made by the Articles. Therefore, this vote demonstrates to a \nnear certainty that there are insufficient votes to support the \nManagers' position that the President should be convicted.\n  This result comes as a surprise to no one--including most if not all \nof those who support the President's removal. These Articles should \nnever have been presented to the Senate. The President's actions were \nundoubtedly reprehensible. They deserve condemnation and may warrant \nprosecution after he leaves office. But they do not warrant removal--a \nsanction unprecedented in our nation's history, and one that the \nFramers of our Constitution envisioned would be used in only the rarest \nof circumstances to protect the country.\n  The case presented by the Managers is fatally deficient in three \nrespects:\n  First, the facts presented, even if viewed in the light most \nfavorable to the Managers' case, do not allege conduct that meets the \nhigh standard laid out by the framers for the impeachment, conviction, \nand removal from office of a president.\n  Second, the articles as drafted are vague and contain multiple \nallegations--denying the President the fairness and due process that is \nthe right of every American citizen, and depriving senators of the \nclarity that is essential to discharging their responsibility as triers \nof fact.\n  Third, the Managers have failed to present facts that meet their \nheavy burden of proving the allegations contained in the Articles.\n  Let me address these points in turn.\n  The conduct alleged by the Managers to be worthy of conviction arises \nout of a private, civil lawsuit and a private, consensual, yet improper \nrelationship between the President and Ms. Monica Lewinsky. It is the \nPresident's conduct in that lawsuit and in that relationship that are \nthe basis of the charges at issue here. No charges arise from his \nofficial conduct as President.\n  (It is worth noting that, with regard to the Jones matter, the \nSupreme Court itself considered the conduct alleged therein to be \nprivate. The Court ruled that, while the President may delay or avoid \nuntil leaving office lawsuits based on his official conduct, he may \nclaim no such immunity in an action based on private conduct unrelated \nto official duties.)\n  The Managers claim that what is at issue is not the President's \nprivate actions but his actions in connection with efforts to prevent \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from becoming known to his family \nand others. These actions, the Managers argue--including his testimony \nin the grand jury and his statements to staff and others--are official \nin nature. However, these actions clearly arise out of the President's \nefforts to keep secret a personal relationship which he admitted to be \nwrong. Under no reasonable analysis can they be understood to relate to \nthe President's official duties.\n  It follows, then, that the President's actions certainly do not rise \nto the level of ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' set forth by the Framers as the standard for removing a \npresident from office. As Alexander Hamilton explained, impeachment is \nto be reserved as ``a remedy for great injuries done to the society \nitself''. The impeachment process is intended to protect the nation \nfrom official wrongdoing, not punish a president for personal \nmisconduct.\n  It is not in my view reasonable to conclude that the President's \nactions--while by his own admission wrong and offensive--pose a danger \nto the institutions of our society. The President's past behavior did \nnot--and his continuation in office does not--pose a threat to the \nstability of those institutions.\n  Indeed, I submit that convicting and removing the President based on \nthese actions, not the actions themselves, would have a destabilizing \neffect on our institutions of government. Were this scenario to come to \npass, then henceforth any president would have to worry that he or \nshe could be removed on a partisan basis for essentially personal \nconduct. That standard would weaken the presidency. In the words of \nMadison, it would in effect make the president's term equivalent to ``a \ntenure during pleasure of the Senate'', and upset the careful system of \nchecks and balances established by the Framers to govern relations \nbetween the legislative and executive branches.\n\n  The Articles also deserve to be dismissed because of the fatally \nflawed manner in which they are drafted. Those flaws are of two \nseparate kinds.\n  First, the Articles fail to allege wrongdoing with the kind of \nspecificity required to allow the President--or indeed, any person--to \ndefend himself, and to allow the Senate to fully understand and judge \nthe charges made against him. White House counsel described the \narticles as an ``empty vessel'', a ``moving target'' where neither the \nPresident nor the Senate knows with precision what has been alleged. \nSenators were presented with videotaped testimony of former federal \nprosecutors who stated that standard prosecutorial practice requires \nthat allegations of perjury and obstruction\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\nmust be stated with particularity and specificity. The allegations here \nhave not been so stated. That lack of specificity is manifestly unfair \nto the President. And it is detrimental to the Senate's ability to \ndischarge its responsibility as the trier of fact in this case.\n  The second fatal structural flaw in the Articles is that the Managers \nhave aggregated multiple allegations of wrongdoing into single \nArticles. Article I allows the President to be impeached for ``one or \nmore'' of four enumerated, unspecified categories of alleged \nmisconduct. Similarly, in Article II he is alleged to have obstructed \njustice in ``one or more'' of seven ways. This smorgasbord approach to \nthe allegations creates the deeply troubling prospect that the \nPresident could be convicted and removed without two-thirds of the \nSenate agreeing on what precisely he did wrong. For this reason, too, \ndismissal is appropriate.\n  Dismissal is, finally, appropriate because the facts undergirding the \nmanagers' case do not prove the criminal wrongdoing the managers \nallege. Manager McCollum told the Senate that it must first find \ncriminal wrongdoing and then determine whether to remove the President \nfrom office. While it is left to each Senator to determine the standard \nof proof he or she will use to judge the evidence, manager McCollum's \nown analysis suggests that that standard should be beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. After all, that is the standard used in all other criminal \ncases; why should the President be subjected to any lower standard than \nthat to which all citizens are entitled? Indeed, he should not--not \nonly because he deserves no less fairness than other citizens, but also \nbecause this high standard of proof is appropriate to the gravity of \nthe sanction the Senate is being asked to impose.\n  In my view, the Managers have failed to prove criminal culpability on \nthe part of the President beyond a reasonable doubt. The record is \nreplete with exculpatory, contradictory, and ambiguous facts.\n  Consider, for example, these:\n  (1) Ms. Lewinsky--who was questioned some 22 times by investigators, \nprosecutors, and grand jurors (not to mention twice by the Managers \nthemselves)--said under oath that neither the President nor anyone else \never asked her to lie.\n  (2) She also said--again, under oath--that no one ever promised her a \njob for her silence.\n  (3) Further, she stated without contradiction that the President did \nnot suggest that she return the gifts given her by the President to him \nor anyone else on his behalf.\n  (4) Betty Currie, the President's secretary--who was questioned some \nnine times--likewise testified that the President did not suggest that \nthe gifts to Ms. Lewinsky be returned.\n  (5) She also said that she never felt pressure to agree with the \nPresident when he spoke with her following the Jones deposition, and, \nindeed, felt free to disagree with his recollection.\n  (6) Lastly, the Managers argued that a December 11, 1997 ruling by \nthe judge in the Jones case, permitting the calling of witnesses \nregarding the President's conduct, triggered intensive efforts that \nvery day by the President and Vernon Jordan to help Ms. Lewinsky find a \njob. We now know that the facts contradict that account of the \nManagers. A meeting on that date between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky \nwas scheduled three days earlier. It was held several hours before the \njudge's ruling. And at the time of that ruling, Mr. Jordan was on an \nairplane bound for Holland.\n  In addition, factual discrepancies between the President and Ms. \nLewinsky--about when their relationship began, about the nature of the \ninappropriate contacts between them, about the number of those \ncontacts, and about the number of inappropriate telephone calls between \nthem--amount to differences in recollection that in no way can be \nconsidered criminal on the part of the President. More fundamentally, \nthey cannot be considered material to this proceeding. Not even the \nOffice of Independent Counsel considered these discrepancies relevant \nor material to the matter at hand. It cannot reasonably be argued, in \nany event, that the President should be removed from his office because \nof them.\n  For all of these reasons--the failure of the Managers to prove beyond \na reasonable doubt that the President committed criminal wrongdoing, \nthe structural flaws in the Articles themselves, and the failure of the \nallegations, even if proven, to warrant the unprecedented action of \nconviction and removal--these Articles should be dismissed. We have \nreviewed enough evidence, heard enough arguments, and asked enough \nquestions to know with reasonable certainty that the flaws in the \nManagers' case cannot be remedied. We know enough to decide this matter \nnow. The national interest is best served not by extending this \nproceeding needlessly, but by ending it.\n  I regret that the Senate has failed to do that. But I continue to \nbelieve that we must dispose of this matter as soon as possible so we \ncan return to the other important business of the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1330-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1331-S1332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     OPPOSITION TO MANAGERS' MOTION FOR THE APPEARANCE OF WITNESSES\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week the Senate, sitting as a \ncourt of impeachment, voted on a motion by the Managers for the \nappearance of witnesses and to admit evidence not in the trial record. \nI opposed this motion, and would like to briefly state my reasons for \ndoing so.\n  While the motion carried, the fact that it was opposed by forty-four \nSenators demonstrates that a large number of our colleagues believe \nthat the record of this case is sufficient to allow Senators to decide \non the articles of impeachment. Indeed, it is not merely sufficient, it \nis voluminous. As I will discuss more fully below, neither the Managers \nnor counsel for the President would in any way be harmed by a \nrequirement that they rely on the record as presently constituted.\n  Let me concede at the outset that this motion is not an easy one to \ndecide. There is an argument to be made for calling witnesses. Our \ncolleagues who believe there ought to be witnesses are motivated by \nearnest reasons.\n  However, the issue for us is not whether there is a case for \nwitnesses. It is this: do we need to hear from witnesses in order to \nfulfil our responsibility as triers of fact? The answer to that \nquestion, in my opinion, is no. We know enough to decide this case, and \ndecide it now.\n  There may be legitimate reasons for calling witnesses. But the \nreasons for not calling them are compelling.\n  There are five reasons, in particular, that strongly argue against \nthe motion.\n  First, the record is more than sufficient to allow the Senate to \ndecide this case. We are all painfully familiar with the essential \ndetails of this matter. Like most Americans, we have been subjected to \nthe blizzard of media attention paid to it from its very start just \nover a year ago.\n  This is not 1868, when only a handful of people could witness the \nlast presidential impeachment. One hundred and thirty years later, we \ncan receive an Independent Counsel's voluminous and graphic report over \nthe Internet literally at the moment it is made available to the \npublic. We can witness the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee \nlive on television. We can observe the televised impeachment \nproceedings in the House chamber as if we are there.\n  This trial is now in its fourth week. We have been provided with \nmassive portions of a record that exceeds 67,000 pages in length. We \nhave heard days of arguments. Ninety of us have asked some 105 \nquestions to the House Republican Managers and to counsel for the \nPresident.\n  So I daresay that the facts of this case have been drilled into our \nconsciousness--relentlessly, overwhelmingly, and, it seems endlessly.\n  I should add one more adverb: repeatedly. And that leads to the \nsecond reason for not calling witnesses: they have testified repeatedly \nand without contradiction on the key facts.\n  Again and again, the record shows the same questions asked of the \nsame witnesses. Ms. Lewinsky has been questioned a total of twenty-\nthree times, Ms. Currie nine times, Mr. Jordan six times, and Mr. \nBlumenthal five times. They were asked hundreds upon hundreds of \nquestions--by some of the toughest, shrewdest legal minds in the \ncountry. Their testimony fills in excess of two thousand five hundred \npages of the trial record.\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\n  What is the likelihood that prolonging this trial to hear from these \nand possibly other witnesses will bring new details to light that could \nchange the outcome of this trial? Regarding at least one witness--Ms. \nLewinsky--we know from her interview by the Managers two weekends ago: \nvirtually nil.\n  A third reason to oppose this motion is that witness testimony will \ninvite the introduction of salacious details onto the Floor of the \nUnited States Senate--details with which we are already painfully \nfamiliar, and details about which any differences between the President \nand Ms. Lewinsky are immaterial and irrelevant to the charges contained \nin the Articles presented by the House Republican Managers.\n  The Managers tell us that they have no interest in raising any such \ndetails. But sexual misconduct is at the core of this case. Manager \nBryant admitted as much when he said on the Floor that the issue in \nArticle I is ``perjury about sex''. The same could be said about \nArticle II--the issue is obstruction about sex.\n  Every question about perjury or obstruction, then, necessarily \ninvites testimony about the sexual details of this scandal. Given the \nmassive size of the record, I do not think we need to risk allowing the \nSenate to become a forum for that kind of speech. It will not bring \ndignity to this proceeding or credit to this institution.\n  If we somehow think that we can summon witnesses to appear in this \ntrial and at the same time guarantee that the Senate will not become a \nkind of burlesque stage for the airing of this case's tawdry factual \nessence, let me remind my colleagues of the frenzied circus that formed \nimmediately upon the news that Ms. Lewinsky had arrived in Washington, \nD.C. for questioning by the Managers. Once the door to witnesses is \nopened, the Senate will be hard-pressed to keep that atmosphere from \nspilling into this trial and this body.\n  The fourth reason why we should not call witnesses is that they will \nprolong this process needlessly and extensively. Senator Warner made \nthe point well several days ago: it is questionable whether the list of \nwitnesses, and the time required to hear from them, could be strictly \nlimited because to do so might deny the President his right to defend \nhimself.\n  The point was echoed by one of the attorneys for the President. He \nstated that he and his associates would be committing ``malpractice'' \nif they failed to seek the most aggressive possible discovery process \nshould that course be opened to them.\n  That discovery process may reasonably be expected to include \nsubpoenas for documents, interviews with corroborating witnesses, \ndepositions, examinations and cross-examinations. As any person \nfamiliar with litigation knows, such a process is not easily restricted \nin time and scope. It could take weeks, or longer, to conclude. During \nthat time, Senators would not necessarily be free from the burdens of \nserving as triers of fact in the court of impeachment. They could well \nbe called upon to make any number of evidentiary rulings. They could be \ncalled upon to comment publicly on matters raised during depositions--\nincluding on salacious matters that deserve no comment. In short, this \nprocess could drag on and on.\n\n  Fifth, and finally, let me say that I remain unconvinced by the \nargument of the Managers that witnesses are so critical here. They have \nfailed convincingly to explain why witnesses are so indispensable in \nthis trial if they were so dispensable during the impeachment \nproceedings in the other body.\n  During those proceedings, Mr. Manager Hyde said that ``the most \nrelevant witnesses have already testified at length about the matters \nin issue. And in the interest of finishing our expeditious inquiry, we \nwill not require most of them to come before us to repeat their \ntestimony.'' Regarding Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, he added that \nthey ``have already testified under oath. We have their testimony. We \ndon't need to reinvent the wheel.''\n  Likewise, Mr. Manager Gekas stated during the House hearings that \n``bringing in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely \nin the record would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all.''\n  The fervor with which the Managers call for witnesses now is not only \ninconsistent with their refusal to call them earlier. It is also \ninconsistent with their underlying assertion that the facts in evidence \nalready prove the President's criminal culpability. If the Managers \nhave any doubt about whether their evidence was sufficient to prove \nguilt and justify removal, then they had a responsibility to resolve \nthose doubts in the House of Representatives--before they came to this \nbody and had us take an oath to do impartial justice. They should never \nhave put us through this trial.\n  In conclusion, and at the risk of stating the obvious, we should \nremember that we, the members of the Senate, are the triers of fact \nhere. We are the ones who control how this trial is to be conducted. \nEach side deserves to be treated fairly. But neither side deserves an \nunlimited and open-ended right to put forth their arguments.\n  I have never known a lawyer arguing a losing case to say he or she \ncouldn't benefit from one more day in court. The proper response to a \nlengthy trial and a weak case is not more length and more case--it's an \nend to the case.\n  Does anyone seriously believe that the outcome of this proceeding \nwill be changed by allowing a parade of witnesses?\n  Does anyone seriously believe that they will shed new and meaningful \nlight on the key areas of this dispute?\n  After our historic, bipartisan agreement to begin this trial, after \nweeks of the trial itself, after the opportunity to read a massive \nfactual record, after the opportunity to ask over 100 questions--after \nall this, I do not believe that witnesses are now needed to demonstrate \nthe Senate's commitment to conduct this trial in a fair and thorough \nmanner. The dignity of this proceeding and the decorum of this \ninstitution are not likely to be enhanced--and could well be damaged--\nby taking such a step.\n  In my view, the Managers' motion to call witnesses is the expression \nof an increasingly desperate desire to breathe life into a case that--\nas the vote on the motion to dismiss demonstrated--has failed to \nconvince anywhere close to two-thirds of the Senate as to its merit. \nThey are eager for something, anything, to rescue the sinking ship that \ntheir impeachment has become.\n  Their motion, furthermore, is an expression of the partisan process \nthat they began in the House and now seek to perpetuate in the Senate. \nHaving lost five seats in the November elections, Republican leaders in \nthe other body, including the Managers, knew that their best chance to \nimpeach the President was during the lame duck session of the 105th \nCongress. So they eschewed a bipartisan inquiry, decided not to call \nwitnesses, and forbade members from considering a censure resolution in \nthat chamber--all so they could force a vote on articles of impeachment \nbefore the start of the 106th Congress. Two of the articles considered \nfailed. Two others passed, but only by exceedingly slim margins: the \nArticle alleging obstruction of justice would have failed if just five \nRepresentatives had voted differently; the Article alleging perjury \nwould have failed if just eleven Representatives had cast their vote \nagainst impeachment.\n  Having rushed to judgment in the House, the Managers now rush to \ndelay judgment in the Senate. Why? I think the reason is obvious: \nbecause they know that their case is weak. From the moment the Articles \nwere drafted in the House, they have attempted to obscure that \ninescapable fact.\n  Each side of this dispute has now had ample opportunity to present \nits case. The time has come to bring this matter to a close, and return \nto the other compelling issues that we were elected to address. While I \nregret that the majority party in the Senate has decided to move \nforward with the calling of witnesses and gathering of additional \ninformation, I remain hopeful that we can conclude this trial at the \nearliest possible opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/06/senate-section/article/S1331-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1332-S1334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ADOPTION OF RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, \n                           AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. GRAMM.

At that\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nmeeting, the full committee adopted rules of procedure for the \ncommittee for the 106th Congress.\n  In accordance with Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I \nam submitting those rules, as adopted, for printing in the \nCongressional Record. I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The rules follow:\n\n  RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n            (Adopted in executive session, January 28, 1997)\n\n              Rule 1.--Regular Meeting Date for Committee\n\n       The regular meeting day for the Committee to transact its \n     business shall be the last Tuesday in each month that the \n     Senate is in Session; except that if the Committee has met at \n     any time during the month prior to the last Tuesday of the \n     month, the regular meeting of the Committee may be canceled \n     at the discretion of the Chairman.\n\n                           Rule 2.--Committee\n\n       (a) Investigations.--No investigation shall be initiated by \n     the Committee unless the Senate, or the full Committee, or \n     the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member have specifically \n     authorized such investigation.\n       (b) Hearings.--No hearing of the Committee shall be \n     scheduled outside the District of Columbia except by \n     agreement between the Chairman of the Committee and the \n     Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or by a majority \n     vote of the Committee.\n       (c) Confidential testimony.--No confidential testimony \n     taken or confidential material presented at an executive \n     session of the Committee or any report of the proceedings of \n     such executive session shall be made public either in whole \n     or in part or by way of summary, unless specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking \n     Minority Member of the Committee or by a majority vote of the \n     Committee.\n       (d) Interrogation of witnesses.--Committee interrogation of \n     a witness shall be conducted only by members of the Committee \n     or such professional staff as is authorized by the Chairman \n     or the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee.\n       (e) Prior notice of markup sessions.--No session of the \n     Committee or a Subcommittee for marking up any measure shall \n     be held unless (1) each member of the Committee or the \n     Subcommittee, as the case may be, has been notified in \n     writing of the date, time, and place of such session and has \n     been furnished a copy of the measure to be considered at \n     least 3 business days prior to the commencement of such \n     session, or (2) the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     determines that exigent circumstances exist requiring that \n     the session be held sooner.\n       (f) Prior notice of first degree amendments.--It shall not \n     be in order for the Committee or a Subcommittee to consider \n     any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure \n     under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee unless \n     fifty written copies of such amendment have been delivered to \n     the office of the Committee at least 2 business days prior to \n     the meeting. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for \n     a Senator to offer a motion to strike a single section of any \n     measure under consideration. Such a motion to strike a \n     section of the measure under consideration by the Committee \n     or Subcommittee shall not be amendable. This section may be \n     waived by a majority of the members of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee voting, or by agreement of the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member.

Immediately upon the filing of the request, \n     the Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee of the filing of the request.

Any absent member of a \n     Subcommittee may affirmatively request that his or her vote \n     to recommend a measure or matter to the Committee or his vote \n     on any such other matters on which a record vote is taken, be \n     cast by proxy. The proxy shall be in writing and shall be \n     sufficiently clear to identify the subject matter and to \n     inform the Subcommittee as to how the member wishes his or \n     her vote to be recorded thereon. By written notice to the \n     Chairman of the Subcommittee any time before the record vote \n     on the measure or matter concerned is taken, the member may \n     withdraw a proxy previously given. All proxies shall be kept \n     in the files of the Committee.\n\n                           Rule 4.--Witnesses\n\n       (a) Filing of statements.--Any witness appearing before the \n     Committee or Subcommittee (including any witness representing \n     a Government agency) must file with the Committee or \n     Subcommittee (24 hours preceding his or her appearance) 75 \n     copies of his or her statement to the Committee or \n     Subcommittee, and the statement must include a brief summary \n     of the testimony. In the event that the witness fails to file \n     a written statement and brief summary in accordance with this \n     rule, the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee has the \n     discretion to deny the witness the privilege of testifying \n     before the Committee or Subcommittee until the witness has \n     properly complied with the rule.\n       (b) Length of statements.--Written statements properly \n     filed with the Committee or Subcommittee may be as lengthy as \n     the witness desires and may contain such documents or other \n     addenda as the witness feels is necessary to present properly \n     his or her views to the Committee or Subcommittee. The brief \n     summary included in the statement must be no more than 3 \n     pages long. It shall be left to the discretion of the \n     Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee as to what portion \n     of the documents presented to the Committee or Subcommittee \n     shall be published in the printed transcript of the hearings.\n       (c) Ten-minute duration.--Oral statements of witnesses \n     shall be based upon their filed statements but shall be \n     limited to 10 minutes duration. This period may be limited or \n     extended at the discretion of the Chairman presiding at the \n     hearings.\n       (d) Subpoena of witnesses.--Witnesses may be subpoenaed by \n     the Chairman of the Committee or a Subcommittee with the \n     agreement of the Ranking Minority Member of\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n     the Committee or Subcommittee or by a majority vote of the \n     Committee or Subcommittee.\n       (e) Counsel permitted.--Any witness subpoenaed by the \n     Committee or Subcommittee to a public or executive hearing \n     may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing who \n     shall be permitted, while the witness is testifying, to \n     advise him or her of his or her legal rights.\n       (f) Expenses of witnesses.--No witness shall be reimbursed \n     for his or her appearance at a public or executive hearing \n     before the Committee or Subcommittee unless such \n     reimbursement is agreed to by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member of the Committee.\n       (g) Limits of questions.--Questioning of a witness by \n     members shall be limited to 5 minutes duration when 5 or more \n     members are present and 10 minutes duration when less than 5 \n     members are present, except that if a member is unable to \n     finish his or her questioning in this period, he or she may \n     be permitted further questions of the witness after all \n     members have been given an opportunity to question the \n     witness.\n       Additional opportunity to question a witness shall be \n     limited to a duration of 5 minutes until all members have \n     been given the opportunity of questioning the witness for a \n     second time. This 5-minute period per member will be \n     continued until all members have exhausted their questions of \n     the witness.\n\n                            Rule 5.--Voting\n\n       (a) Vote to report a measure or matter.--No measure or \n     matter shall be reported from the Committee unless a majority \n     of the Committee is actually present. The vote of the \n     Committee to report a measure or matter shall require the \n     concurrence of a majority of the members of the Committee who \n     are present.\n       Any absent member may affirmatively request that his or her \n     vote to report a matter be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be \n     sufficiently clear to identify the subject matter, and to \n     inform the Committee as to how the member wishes his vote to \n     be recorded thereon. By written notice to the Chairman any \n     time before the record vote on the measure or matter \n     concerned is taken, any member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies shall be kept in the files of \n     the Committee, along with the record of the rollcall vote of \n     the members present and voting, as an official record of the \n     vote on the measure or matter.\n       (b) Vote on matters other than to report a measure or \n     matter.--On Committee matters other than a vote to report a \n     measure or matter, no record vote shall be taken unless a \n     majority of the Committee are actually present. On any such \n     other matter, a member of the Committee may request that his \n     or her vote may be cast by proxy. The proxy shall be in \n     writing and shall be sufficiently clear to identify the \n     subject matter, and to inform the Committee as to how the \n     member wishes his or her vote to be recorded thereon. By \n     written notice to the Chairman any time before the vote on \n     such other matter is taken, the member may withdraw a proxy \n     previously given. All proxies relating to such other matters \n     shall be kept in the files of the Committee.\n\n                            Rule 6.--Quorum\n\n       No executive session of the Committee or a Subcommittee \n     shall be called to order unless a majority of the Committee \n     or Subcommittee, as the case may be, are actually present. \n     Unless the Committee otherwise provides or is required by the \n     Rules of the Senate, one member shall constitute a quorum for \n     the receipt of evidence, the swearing in of witnesses, and \n     the taking of testimony.\n\n                     Rule 7.--Staff Present on Dais\n\n       Only members and the Clerk of the Committee shall be \n     permitted on the dais during public or executive hearings, \n     except that a member may have one staff person accompany him \n     or her during such public or executive hearing on the dais. \n     If a member desires a second staff person to accompany him or \n     her on the dais he or she must make a request to the Chairman \n     for that purpose.\n\n                      Rule 8.--Coinage Legislation\n\n       At least 67 Senators must cosponsor any gold medal or \n     commemorative coin bill or resolution before consideration by \n     the Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             EXTRACTS FROM THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n                     Rule XXV, Standing Committees\n\n       1.
