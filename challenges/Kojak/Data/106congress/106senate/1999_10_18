You are \nfaithful, consistent, totally reliable, and absolutely true to Your \npromises.\n  God, we long to be people who are known for our integrity; that \nwonderful consistency between what we believe and what we do; that \ncongruity of what we say and how we follow through. We also desire to \nbe people who communicate respect and take responsibility for the \nnatural world, for our Nation, and for the sacredness of the people \naround us. Each of us views Your particularized affirmation of our \nuniqueness. Help us to communicate that same respect for others. May \nthis Senate be a shining example to America as men and women who are \nunreservedly trustworthy, respectful, and responsible in their \nleadership. Through them and all of us, strengthen the moral fiber of \nour Nation. In Your trustworthy name.

Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this morning \nand talk a little bit about where we are in the Senate, at least in my \nview, and where we are going. We are, of course, nearing the end of \nthis session. Nobody knows precisely or exactly when we will be out of \nhere, but it won't be long. We have to take a strong look, in my view, \nat what we have to do, and the things that are necessary to do. There \nare, of course, certain things that are required.\n  At this time of year, Congress maybe hasn't finished its annual \nritual, but the fact is we have done a great deal. I am pleased with \nthat. But we must, of course, finish the appropriations. The continuing \nresolution expires this week, but hopefully we will have the \nappropriations to the President. We will see what happens from there.\n  In addition to that, of course, I am very hopeful that at least one \nother issue will be undertaken, and that is to do something about the \nbalanced budget amendment and the Medicare restrictions that are in \nplace.\n  You might recall that Congress asked for some reduction in the cost \nof Medicare over a period of time to ensure a firming up in the fact \nthat these dollars are being used as they should be. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has reduced that spending almost twice what was \nanticipated and, therefore, I\n\n[[Page S12732]]\n\nthink it will be necessary for us to go back and do some things for all \nof Medicare and particularly, I might say, for rural areas and small \nhospitals in areas such as in Wyoming.\n\n  I think we have allowed ourselves to become a little bit off track. \nWe have gotten involved in lengthy discussions of issues that are \nprobably not particularly timely nor, indeed, perhaps even particularly \nappropriate, issues that did not need to be or were not ready to be \ndiscussed and debated this year and could well have been put off until \nanother year. But, nevertheless, they have been discussed, and we are, \nin fact, still involved in some of those--the nuclear test ban treaty \nof course, being one of them. Now we are on campaign finance.\n  There have been extended debates brought about by the insistence of \nMembers on the floor. We have also had a number of filibusters and \nthreatened filibusters from the other side of the aisle in order to \ncontrol what was occurring on the floor.\n  I haven't been here as long as have many Members of the Senate, but I \ncan tell you I don't think that in the time I have been here I have \nseen such a contentious and combative situation. It is the most \ncontroversial session I believe--perhaps the most uncooperative--in \nterms of coming to terms with the things we need to do.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, of course, \nhave brought issues to the floor, and we have had a number of \nfilibusters and threatened filibusters. I guess the most interesting \nwas the latest nuclear test ban treaty debate in which there was an \ninsistence that we come on the floor with it, and then there was a cry \nof foul when it came up. That was a somewhat interesting and difficult \nissue.\n  We have had Members forcing issues to the floor that have had little \nor no support, but yet under the rules of the Senate they are entitled \nto be discussed and discussed for a length of time. In fact, we have \nhad the feeling we are becoming too oriented toward accomplishing \nthings. But, again, that is one point of view.\n  It seems to me we find the President now in the most political \nposture that I recall a President being in, criticizing the Senate for \ndoing the things that we have a constitutional responsibility to do--\ntreaties. We have the advise and consent responsibility on all \ntreaties. That is in the Constitution. The same is true regarding \nnominees. That is our responsibility. I believe we have the right to do \nthe things that we believe are right without being criticized.\n  At every opportunity, the President is calling everything a political \nvote. I find that paradoxical. There were allegations of racial voting \non nominees for the Judiciary. I for one--and I know many others--did \nnot even know the race of the person being voted upon.\n  The White House, trying to use many of these votes to breathe some \nlife into a lame-duck President, makes it very difficult. We still have \na responsibility. We have things to do. We have things to complete. We \nfind ourselves in a confrontation, with the President threatening to \ndisapprove appropriations. He has that right, as well. However, we \nought to come together. We ought to talk about it. We ought to decide \nwhat we are going to do. We know we will fund the Government. We know \nwe will go forward. I don't think anyone genuinely wants to shut down \nthe Government. However, we are faced with that possibility. It worked \nout so well politically for the President a couple of years ago; he \nshut down the Government and we got the blame. I hope we don't use that \ntechnique again.\n  It is a fairly simple thing. It is very difficult, but we have a \ncommitment to have a certain amount of spending--about $592 billion \nworth of spending--outside the mandatory appropriations. We have to \nmake agreements to stay within that commitment. We are dedicated to the \nidea of not spending more than that because we have to go into Social \nSecurity. As difficult as it may be, that is the goal. That is the \nbottom line. We simply have to make the adjustments that are necessary \nto do that. I think that is reasonable and certainly not impossible.\n  Aside from that, it seems to me we have had a good year. We started \nthis year as the majority party saying we were committed to ensuring a \nsound Social Security retirement system. We said we were here to help \nimprove educational opportunities for our children, to expand economic \nopportunities for all Americans, to provide a strengthening of our \nnational security to protect our freedoms. Those were the four things \nwe set about to do. I believe the leadership and the Members have \ncalled for that.\n  Despite all the talk and concern about education in the \nappropriations, the Republican proposal has $537 million more than the \nPresident requested. We have passed a bill that increases flexibility \nand opportunity for the States, the local school boards, and the \nparents to make the necessary decisions in their school districts. The \nschool districts in Basin, WY, have different needs than in \nPhiladelphia, PA. To the extent the Federal Government has a role--\nwhich represents, by the way, about 7 percent of total educational \nspending; not a huge amount --that money should be able to be spent the \nway the people wish to spend it. They, after all, are responsible for \nthe education of their children.\n  In our tax bill, which the President vetoed, there were several \neducational propositions, educational savings accounts, and student \nloan programs available, as well. Of course, the President vetoed those \nbills. We have done a great deal in education. I think it is something \nof which we should be proud.\n\n  Everyone talks about Social Security. It is one of our most important \nissues. Everyone who has worked for a wage or worked in their own \nbusiness has paid into Social Security. Our commitment is to have \nSocial Security available not only for those who are now beneficiaries \nbut, indeed, for those young people who have just begun to work. There \nhas been a great deal of discussion. The President talked about saving \nSocial Security, but, frankly, has put nothing forward.\n  We have done a couple of things. One is to have a Social Security \nlockbox to ensure we will not spend the Social Security money, and that \nwill be a test of this budget. The other is to propose that we have the \nkind of Social Security program so at least a portion of those funds \ncan be put into an individual account that belongs to the person who \nhas been putting in the money. It can be invested directly in equities \nin the private sector to increase the return. I am pleased with that.\n  We have increased military spending by about $17 billion. It has gone \ndown over the last several years despite the fact that the world is not \nsafe.\n  Tax relief: We spent a great deal of time working on opportunities \nfor all Americans to save some of the money they pay to taxes through \nmarriage penalties, through estate tax reduction, capital gains \nreduction, and general reductions in rates. The President vetoed that \nbecause he wants to spend more money.\n  In health care, we have a Patients' Bill of Rights that I think is \nexcellent. We also have committed ourselves to do something on the \nbalanced budget.\n  These are the things on which we have made a great deal of progress. \nIn addition, we recently had the test ban on nuclear testing. In a \npress conference last week, the President tried to deflect criticism \nabout the lack of leadership he provided and the fact that not even a \nmajority of this Senate supported it on a final vote by blaming it all \non partisan politics, accusing the Republicans of making the world a \nmore dangerous place.\n  Acting against the national interest? Nonsense. Let me give some \ncanards. Neither the United States nor the Senate have changed their \nviews on nuclear testing. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and \nJapan. We are not going to start testing; we have not changed our \nposition. We have no plan to test. Our policies in that regard are \nexactly the same as they were before the vote. All we were saying in \nthe vote was, this is not the treaty at this time, with these \nshortcomings.\n  The President tried to blame the Republicans for being in a partisan \nmode. The President should look at his own party. Democrats demanded we \nhave a vote on this treaty or they would filibuster all action on the \nSenate floor. On September 18, the Senator from North Dakota said:\n\n       I intend to plant myself on the floor like a potted plant \n     and object. I intend to object to other routine business of \n     the Senate until the majority leader brings this treaty to \n     the floor for debate and vote. I don't run this\n\n[[Page S12733]]\n\n     place, but those who do should know this is going to be a \n     rough place to run if you do not decide to bring this issue \n     to a vote.\n\n  We brought it to a vote and apparently they got exactly what they \ndemanded--a debate and vote. Before the President blames the \nRepublicans, he ought to take a look at the Congressional Record. The \nvote was not a vote against national security. In an attempt to \nfrighten people, the President accused those who opposed it of \nthreatening the national security, that no thinking person could \npossibly oppose it.\n  Let me list for the Senate some of the people whom the President \ndismissed: Henry Kissinger, six former Secretaries of Defense, four \nformer CIA Chiefs, former Federal weapons lab Directors, two former \nChiefs of Staff, the President's own head of Strategic Command at the \ntime the treaty was negotiated, three former National Security \nAdvisers. It goes on and on.\n  This idea of isolationism is ridiculous. The idea of maintaining the \nU.S. military strength is not. That, in the view of many, gives the \nbest opportunity for security.\n  Now we are involved, of course, in this question of campaign finance. \nIt is a legitimate issue, a good issue. We have been into it before. We \npassed bills in the 1970s. We passed bills in the 1980s. It has not \nchanged an awful lot. Some people suggest it has been blown completely \nout of hand. I suggest it is probably not true. The expenditures in the \naverage congressional district have gone up about 3.6 percent a year \nsince 1986. That is hardly runaway. It amounts to about $1 per voter in \nmost congressional districts.\n  But I believe--and, for myself, I think there is some consensus in \nthe Senate--it is an important issue. I have said, and I continue to \nsay, I support some changes. I would like to see more disclosure. It \nseems to me that is the most important thing. If there is going to be \nmoney--and, indeed, there has to be money--if people are to understand \nthe issues and have a chance to speak out, to have the freedom of \nspeech, to have the opportunity to participate, it has to be open. But \nI think there should be disclosure. There should be disclosure right up \nuntil the end of the election, and we can do that. We should enforce \nthe laws already on the books, as is the case with many other matters \nof enforcement. I think we have to protect the constitutional rights of \nindividuals to participate.\n  I would support some limit on soft money. I do not know how, \nconstitutionally, that would be accepted by the Supreme Court. \nNevertheless, I would set some limit and support that. But I would not \nsupport doing away with it. I would not support eliminating it. I would \nnot support the bill as it is proposed now.\n  We can contribute to the integrity of the process and help return \nmore confidence to it. I have thought about this a lot. People who \nsupport Members, or people who are running, do so because of what they \nbelieve. They do not change their beliefs because they received some \nsupport. As you look around for whom you are going to support in the \nelection, you support the person whose beliefs are similar to yours. I \nsupport things in my State--I suppose some people call them special \ninterests--because they are important to my State. Those are the \nindustries at which most people in my State work. Those are the kinds \nof industries that we need to have a vibrant economy. Of course I \nsupport those, not because of some contribution.\n  In summary, I wish we were in a little different situation in our \nrelationship on both sides of this aisle and in our relationship with \nthe White House, so we could really look at some issues, come out with \nwhat seems best to us as a group, and move forward.\n  On the other hand, I am very pleased with many of the things we have \ndone. I can tell you, most people in my State, when we talk about doing \nall these things, have a limit in their minds as to what the Congress \nought to be doing, what is the role of the Federal Government. It is \nnot up to the Congress to solve every problem. On the contrary, we are \nbetter off to push more and more of that government closer to the \npeople, where they can make the decisions, not the one-size-fits-all \nkind of thing some people here would like to have.\n  We are ready to move on and finish up. I look forward to it. I hope \nwe can conclude our work and do the best things for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I greet my colleagues with the often bad \nnews of drug use by young people, and particularly with reference to \nthe very important role of parents in preventing youth drug use. As I \ndo occasionally, in my capacity as chairman of the International \nNarcotics Control Caucus of the Senate, I come to the floor to report \non national surveys that go on in this area, surveys that have been \ngoing on for a couple of decades, so we are able to compare the \nincidence of increasing drug experimentation by young people as well as \nfollowing trends we had in the last decade in declines in drug use by \nyoung people.\n  I seek the floor today to visit with my colleagues on this very same \nsubject, as I have many times in the past since I have been chairman of \nthis group of our colleagues who spend a great deal of time on drug \nproblems generally and, of course, a lot of time on the issue of drug \nuse by young people.\n  So, again, as happens at the beginning of every school year, there \nare these national surveys that are made public. Within the last month \nor so, several of these have been made public. That is what I want to \ndiscuss with my colleagues. There have been three national surveys \nreleased that tell the story of drug use in the United States, \nparticularly among teenagers.\n  On September 8 of this year, the National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse--that is called CASA, for short. Let me say it again: \nIt is a National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. That \norganization released its annual back-to-school survey on the attitudes \nof teens and parents regarding substance abuse. The survey stressed how \nessential it is for parents to get involved in their children's lives. \nThe survey indicates that kids actually do listen to their parents. In \nfact, 42 percent of the teenagers who have never used marijuana credit \ntheir parents with that decision. Unfortunately, too many parents--45 \npercent--believe that teenagers' use of drugs is inevitable. In \naddition, 25 percent of the parents said they have little influence \nover their teen's substance abuse.\n  I suggest to that 25 percent that they ought to consider that 42 \npercent of the young people in America have already responded to this \nsurvey, saying they do not use marijuana because their parents have \ninfluenced them not to. And for the 25 percent of the parents who do \nnot think they can have any influence over their teen's substance \nabuse, they would probably have considerable and beneficial influence.\n  CASA stresses how important parental involvement is. A child with a \npositive relationship with both parents is less likely to get involved \nwith drugs. The survey also suggests that family-oriented activities \nsuch as eating dinners together and attending religious services \ntogether can reduce the risk of substance abuse.\n  The second week in September also marked the release of the annual \nParents Resource Institute for Drug Education survey. That acronym is \nPRIDE, P-R-I-D-E. PRIDE's survey on teenage drug use. The survey also \nindicated the importance of parents' influence in shaping the attitude \nof teens regarding the harmful effects of drugs, just like the CASA \nsurvey.\n  Unfortunately, this past year the overall attitude among youth \ntowards the harmful effects of drugs remains mostly unchanged. In fact, \nsome attitudes worsened. Sadly, about 27 percent used an illegal drug \nat least once in the last year, and about 16 percent used drugs monthly \nor more often.\n\n[[Page S12734]]\n\n Moreover, the number of students who regarded cocaine and heroin as \nharmful has decreased from the previous year. We know that, as \nperception of risk of use goes down, actual use of cocaine and heroin \ngoes up. The monthly use of cocaine by high school students rose from \n3.1 percent to 3.2 percent, hallucinogens went up from 3.9 percent to \n4.2 percent, and liquor--and we don't often think enough of a legal \nproduct, liquor, being used illegally by young people as being a \nproblem--but it went up from 26.9 percent to 28.1 percent. Worse yet, \nbeer tends to be a gateway for uses of these other drugs that \neventually leads, by some young people, to worse drugs. Unfortunately, \nin this PRIDE survey, the number of students who said drugs cause no \nharm increased over the previous year.\n\n  So that message out there that is strong and hard and definitive and \nconstant that drug use is bad, does work but not if it isn't \nconsistently heard and reinforced.\n  The PRIDE survey reiterates that parents have the power to change \nthese attitudes. Those young people who say their parents talk with \nthem a lot about drugs show a 37 percent lower drug use than those \nstudents who say their parents never talk to them about drugs. Despite \nthis statistic, less than 31 percent of the students say their parents \ntalk with them often or a lot about the problems of drugs.\n  So we have one-third of the parents shirking their responsibility; \nand in shirking their responsibility, they are losing an opportunity to \nmake a difference in whether or not their young people will experiment \nwith drugs. Because we have that other survey that shows 42 percent of \nthe young people in America do not use drugs because they have been \ninfluenced by their parents not to use drugs.\n  The last survey I want to refer to is a National Household Survey on \ndrug abuse. It was released 2 months ago. It gives a very clear picture \nthat we still have much work ahead of us when it comes to educating our \nkids about drugs.\n  The survey stated that almost 10 percent of our young people, ages 12 \nto 17, reported current use of illicit drugs. An estimated 8 percent of \nyouths in the same age category reported current use of marijuana \nfairly regularly.\n  Unfortunately, this was not a significant change from last year. \nAccording to the survey, young people reported great risk of using \ncigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol; and that percentage was \nunchanged from the previous year.\n  The disturbing fact is 56 percent of the kids, ages 12 to 17, \nreported that marijuana was very easy to get. And 14 percent of these \nyoung people reported being approached by someone selling drugs within \n30 days of their interview for the survey.\n  Although these statistics seem daunting, we have made some progress \nin keeping drugs out of children's hands. The National Household \nSurvey--the last one I referred to--stated that the number of youths \nusing inhalants has decreased significantly from 2 percent in 1997 to 1 \npercent last year.\n  The PRIDE survey reported that monthly use of any illegal and illicit \ndrugs fell from 17 percent last year to 16 percent this year. Even more \nimportant is the fact that 60 percent of the students say they do not \nexpect to use drugs in the future. And this is a 9-percent increase \nfrom the 51 percent last year.\n  There may be some hope shown in those statistics, then, that finally \na message about ``just don't do it,'' ``drugs are bad,'' may be making \nsome progress.\n  But we all know the war on drugs is tough and it is not one that will \nbe won easily, but it is not one from which we in public life or within \nour families can walk away. Although these numbers and statistics \nremain exceedingly high, our efforts can make a difference and are not \nfutile. I believe creating a drug-free environment for our youth is an \naccessible goal that we must work to reach.\n  Surveys such as these play an important role in measuring our \nprogress and determining the work that lies ahead of us. It is clear \nthat the public is aware of the problem and expects Congress and the \nadministration to do their part in finding ways to make counterdrug \nprograms work.\n  In a national poll on national drug policy, produced last month by \nthe Mellman Group, the public supports effective drug control programs. \nAs you can see from chart No. 1--if you would look at chart No. 1--the \npublic particularly supports strong interdiction programs and \nconsistent interdiction efforts. The survey shows 92 percent of the \npeople questioned view illegal drugs as a serious problem in this \ncountry.\n\n  I will now refer to chart No. 2. The majority of individuals think \ndrug use in this country is increasing. Few see it declining, in other \nwords. So it seems obvious to me--and I hope to all of you--that the \nAmerican people are aware of the problem and are eager for a more \nassertive national drug policy from Congress and from the \nadministration.\n  When Americans are more concerned about the availability of drugs \nthan they are about crime, we clearly need to take action. We cannot \nafford to let drugs devastate our country any further; we cannot afford \nto let drugs devastate any more young people. We have to be proactive \nin our efforts if we want to change these disturbing numbers that have \ncome out in the CASA survey, the National Household Survey, and the \nPRIDE survey.\n  We do not need a miracle for our young people. We need a strong \nfamily life and positive role models to guide our youth in the right \ndirection.\n  Education of the dangers of drugs starts at home. But it needs to be \ncarried over into all of society. Parents need help in sustaining a \nclear and consistent ``no use'' message.\n  In closing, I refer to an effort I am making in my State called Face \nIt Together, an organization that tries to bring together all elements \nof our society.\n  There are two elements of our society--at least in my State--that I \ndo not think have done enough to be supportive of families because the \nfront line in the war against drugs is the home. We cannot, in the \nhome, push it off on the school, off onto law enforcement, off onto \nsubstance abuse professions. That front line is the home.\n  But two institutions of society, in my State, I think, can do a \nbetter job. Maybe it is true of the other 49 States as well. Although \nit is more encompassing than just involving industry and business on \nthe one hand, and the churches on the other hand in supporting \nfamilies, that is where I want to concentrate my effort. Because most \nbusinesses and industries in my State have substance abuse programs, as \na matter of necessity, for the health and well-being of their workers \nand to maintain the productivity of their workforce, we want those \nbusinesses that have a drug education and drug awareness program in the \nworkplace to get their workers--men and women alike--to carry that \nmessage home and use it in the families, in the home, to support the \neffort which ought to be in that family already, of telling their \nchildren of the dangers of drugs.\n  The other place where I do not think we have used enough of our \nresources is in the churches of our State, for messages from the \npulpit, and to use the institution of the church to disseminate \neducational information to, again, be supportive of the family--mom and \ndad--to keep that message strong back home. This is something we all \nneed to work on.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12734-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before making my comments on the campaign \nfinance reform measure before us, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis splendid work on this issue. This has been an issue on which he has \nspent a good deal of time. An issue this complicated is very demanding. \nAs so frequently is the custom of the Senator from Kentucky, he has put \nhis heart and soul into this issue. Many of us appreciate his dedicated \neffort in trying to deal with this issue in a very responsive manner. \nIt is characteristic of the Senator from Kentucky to do this kind of \nwork for the Senate. We all appreciate and respect him for it.\n  The Denver Rocky Mountain News ran an editorial on September 21st in \nresponse to the passage of the Shays/Meehan bill, expressing the \npaper's belief that soft money campaign contributions are a form of \npolitical expression and, as such, are protected by the First \nAmendment.\n  I don't bring this up now as a part of the Senate debate on campaign \nfinance reform just because The News is a local paper. I am bringing \nthis editorial up now because it is from a local paper with an \nexceedingly sound view.\n  In the editorial they use an example of an average citizen who might \ndecide to distribute leaflets against a city pot hole problem. If this \nhypothetical citizen is stopped from doing so by a city council, it \nwould be a clear-cut violation of freedom of speech.\n  The editorial then goes on, correctly, to explain that the difference \nbetween this simple form of election activity control and the kinds \ncontained in the two main campaign finance measures considered on the \nHill this year--Shays/Meehan and McCain/Feingold--is merely a \ndifference of degrees, not type.\n  Donors who want to give to the Republican National Committee or the \nDemocrat National Committee are expressing their political views.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Rocky Mountain News editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From the Denver Rocky Mountain News, Tues., Sept. 21, 1999]\n\n                        Free Speech vs. `Reform'\n\n       Suppose that you were upset about potholes in a \n     neighborhood street. Imagine that you started cranking out \n     leaflets to win the support of fellow residents and maybe \n     even to get them to consider the issue in the next city \n     council election. And now suppose that the city government \n     told you to cut it out on the ground that the amount of money \n     you were spending on those leaflets was corrupting \n     politicians. You just might suspect someone was messing with \n     your freedom of speech, right?\n       Your assessment would be correct. And it would be equally \n     correct to believe that a campaign finance bill passed \n     recently in the House of Representatives would abridge the \n     First Amendment guarantees of untethered political \n     expression. The bill is aimed principally at money that's \n     given to political parties for reasons other than directly \n     influencing a candidate's election or defeat at the polls. \n     The legislation would ban those kinds of unregulated \n     contributions, and the cheers have been deafening.\n       But why is it that applauding throngs are so eager to quell \n     free speech? Can't they see that it's as much an abuse of \n     power to stop a rich donor from piling money at the door of \n     the Republicans or the Democrats as it would be to limit the \n     distribution of leaflets by a neighborhood activist? The \n     Senate sponsors of a similar bill reportedly plan to drop one \n     particularly obnoxious provision of the House legislation--\n     regulating the content of issue advertisements that comment \n     on candidates--but the proposed law remains an anti-\n     democratic restriction of political discussion.\n       This so-called reform may be stopped this year by \n     filibuster. It ought to be stopped because members of \n     Congress recognize that the best cure the current system's \n     many ills is more complete disclosure of contributors and \n     even more freedom for direct campaign contributions, not less \n     liberty for all of us.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. As the Supreme Court has ruled, political spending equals \npolitical expression. Attempting to stop this political expression, \nhowever distasteful some might find soft money, is an attempt to stifle \nactivities protected by the Constitution. And so it is our duty as \nlegislators to find a better--a constitutional--way.\n  ``Don't let perfect be the enemy of good'' is an expression we hear \noften on this matter. It's a slogan urging baby steps: small moves \ntoward a distant goal.\n  The thought is that a soft money ban is one part of a move towards an \nideal campaign finance system, and is part of an incremental process of \nimprovement.\n  But alone, it is not good. It's not even merely average. Banning soft \nmoney will only give us different and arguably worse evils.\n  Let's take a look at just a few of them:\n  First, in some of my colleagues' minds it is a step towards taxpayer \nfinanced elections. This would be an absolute monstrosity with the \nbureaucracy calling the shots on campaigns. Our democratic process is \nvoluntary and fiercely competitive.\n  Mandating completely taxpayer financed campaigns would force citizens \nto support candidates they disagree with, it would place bureaucrats in \nthe position of legitimizing political candidates, and it unjustly \nallows candidates influence beyond their natural appeal to voters.\n  Let me explain also that I feel that a soft money ban is biased.\n  It might just be coincidental that the Republican caucus is leading \nthe opposition to this bill instead of the Democrat caucus, but it \nmight also have something to do with the fact that a ban on party soft \nmoney will ultimately benefit Democrat candidates over Republican ones.\n  If political parties are curbed, the Democrats already have a \ncohesive constituency ready and able to step up and assume party \nfunctions. Organized labor is just that--coordinated people ready to \nwork. They are also ready to spend.\n  Senators Snowe and Jeffords were kind enough to provide us all with a \ncopy of the October 12th Washington Post article covering the \nannouncement by the AFL-CIO that they were going to spend $46 million \non the upcoming elections.\n  I don't begrudge the Democrat National Committee this labor and \nfunding base, but it is unbalanced and blatantly partisan to attempt to \nshield this type of spending while attacking its counterbalancing \nforce, the areas where the RNC instead has the advantage.\n  The natural constituencies of each party tend to balance each other \nout, but they do so in different ways.\n  If you will excuse this minor diatribe, I want to digress here for a \nmoment and lament what seems so obvious to everyone and that is \norganized labor is not a Republican constituency.\n  I support the American worker. My party supports the American worker. \nWe are the party of the individual worker, not a worker controlled by \ngovernment.\n  In a more perfect world--of course, meaning a world that runs more \naccording to my beliefs--the Republican agenda would be passed and \nwould aid American workers tremendously.\n  The tax refund bill pushed by the Republican majority would have \npassed and returned money to taxpayers, also known as American workers.\n  The legislation I offered last year to pay down the debt would have \nbenefitted all American workers in myriad ways.\n  The Social Security lock box would have passed and guaranteed this \nbenefit for American workers.\n  I am therefore a little perturbed that the leaders of organized labor \nare so adamant against goals which I feel will greatly benefit the \nworkers of America.\n  The nature or our political differences has resulted in the current \nsituation where there is no other single entity willing to be so \ndedicated to a single party.\n  The Republican Party counters this absence by seeking contributions \nfrom diverse sources. Once these individuals give to the candidates \nthey support, because they have not been coerced into giving and are \nwithout the option of labor unions to further spread their general \nmessage, they give to the Republican National Committee. To try and \n``un-level'' the whole playing field by denying one side an outlet for \npolitical expression and clout, even if the objection is based an \nabhorrence of fund raising, is flagrant factionalism.\n  It is also, as I have said, unconstitutional.\n\n[[Page S12736]]\n\n  The Supreme Court, in the case we are hearing about a lot this week, \nBuckley v. Valeo, said just that.\n  The Supreme Court struck down spending levels, because, and I quote, \n``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express \nterm advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate, \nthey are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate \nand his views.''\n\n  They allowed campaign donation limits, not because they did not \ninterfere with First Amendment rights, but because the interference \nthey impose can be grudgingly tolerated in light of the overriding \ninterest in ensuring clean and fair elections.\n  To further limit soft money donations, or to attempt a different way \nto cut campaign spending, both of which a ban on party soft money would \ndo, there must first be shown the corresponding overwhelming corruption \nit brings.\n  I feel compelled to respond to earlier discussion on this floor by \npointing out that the mere lack of authorization for appropriations, \nwhile certainly unfortunate and unsound practice, is not by itself \nproof positive of corruption. We have not authorized the State \nDepartment in years. It is hardly pork barrel spending to fund the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, another unauthorized agency.\n  Just because large amounts of money flow around elections does not \nmean that the elections automatically become corrupt.\n  The Supreme Court has said that large gifts directly to a candidate \ncould be corrupting. That is why the hard money limits are in place. I \nagree with these.\n  If a candidate were to receive a huge--say, in the millions--donation \nfrom one donor and could run an entire campaign from it, it would be \nawfully hard to tell it apart from what is commonly called ``being \nbought.''\n  But one donor making even a huge donation to a political party is not \nbuying the party philosophy, they are supporting it. And we cannot tell \npeople how and what to support politically.\n  Many of the proponents of other campaign finance bills try to reduce \nthe influence of ``special interests'' by suppressing their donations \nand thus their speech.\n  First, I am not even sure suppressing special interests is an \nadmirable goal, since ``special interests'' are citizens expressing a \nparticular viewpoint, such as the Sierra Club, Chambers of Commerce, \nCommon Cause and countless others.\n  That's the point of politics: advocating your goal during the march \ntowards a collective good. There needs to be more interests in \npolitics, not less!\n  I believe the absolute best way to ensure there are no undue special \ninterest influence is to suppress and reduce the size of government.\n  If the government rids itself of special interest funding and \ncorporate subsidies, then there would be less of a perception of any \nattempts to buy influence through donations.\n  A simplified tax code, state regulation flexibility, local education \ncontrol--these are less government approaches to problems that would \nalso lower the desperate need for access.\n  Meddlesome outside influences--another horror of campaigning--are a \nfunction of the hard money limits, not soft money availability.\n  Candidates lose control of their message when they lose the right to \naccept money people want to spend and will end up spending on their \nbehalf.\n  The simple fact that large sums of money are spent on elections does \nnot mean those elections are corrupt.\n  In my campaign for Senate, I was outspent by three-quarters of a \nmillion dollars. That money obviously did not buy the election. That \nmoney did not corrupt the election.\n  Supporters say that the election system is drowning in soft money.\n  They say that soft money has consumed the entire political process.\n  Let me say this. Or, rather, allow me to share what the Supreme Court \nhas to say:\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--\n     individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as \n     associations and political committees--who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.\n\n  The Supreme Court has been very clear in its rulings concerning \ncampaign finance and the First Amendment.\n  Since the post-Watergate changes to the campaign finance system \nbegan, twenty-four Congressional actions have been declared \nunconstitutional, with nine rejections based on the First Amendment.\n  Out of those nine, four dealt directly with campaign finance reform \nlaws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political \nspending--even if obviously excessive--is equal to political speech.\n  Even today, the Supreme Court is addressing a case regarding Missouri \ncontribution limits, showing their continued dedication to protecting \nthe freedom of speech expressed through political support.\n  Besides the constitutional question, there is the simple matter of \nplain reality. People with money and political views will not give up \ntheir desires to express themselves.\n  Like water flowing downhill, politically active Americans who find \nthemselves blocked will just find different outlets to reach their \ngoal.\n  Hard money was regulated, so soft money was invented. If soft money \nis banned, something else will take its place.\n  The problem is that the regulations and laws that go further and \nfurther towards cutting money also go further and further towards \nunconstitutionality.\n  Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire \nfor healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict, \nand that we can't have both.\n  The only effective dam, they say, would be to change the First \nAmendment so as to allow the abridging of political speech.\n  I don't support that belief. Fortunately for those of us who believe \nin the First Amendment rights of all American citizens, the founding \nfathers and the Supreme Court do not either.\n  They believe, and I believe, that we can have free political speech \nand fair campaigns.\n  Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills believe \nthat if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force give-aways of \npublic and private resources then we will be improving the campaign \nfinance system.\n  The Supreme Court again disagrees and is again very clear in its \nintent on campaign spending. The Buckley decision says,\n\n       . . . the mere growth in the cost of federal election \n     campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for governmental \n     restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending. . . .\n\n  Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how \ngreat or small the means.\n  The ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' to the most ``expensive \nmodes of communication'' are both indispensable instruments of \neffective political speech. We should not force one sector to freely \ndistribute our political ideas just because it is more expensive than \nall the other sectors.\n  So no matter how objectionable the cost of campaigns, the Supreme \nCourt has stated that this is not reason enough to restrict the speech \nof candidates or any other groups involved in political speech.\n  Despite my objections to this current legislation, I think I can \nagree with this bill's cosponsors that improvements can be made to \ntoday's system. I have some ideas on that. To that end I have \nintroduced S. 1671, the Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 1999.\n  My bill would: Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of \ntheir contributions from individuals in the state or district in which \nthey are running; equalize contributions from individuals and political \naction committees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1,000 to \n$2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500; index \nindividual and PAC contribution limits for inflation; reduce the \ninfluence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party \ncommittees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a \ncandidate above $5,000; require corporations and labor organizations to \nseek separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, \ninitiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for political \nactivity, and requires annual full disclosure of those activities\n\n[[Page S12737]]\n\nto members and shareholders; prohibit depositing an individual \ncontribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and \nemployer are reported; encourage the Federal Election Commission to \nallow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies \nand to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet \nless than 24 hours of receipt; ban the use of taxpayer financed mass \nmailings; enhance cuts on the use of federal property for fund raising, \nrestrict use of White House and Air Force One for fund raising, and \nrequire non-office holders who use government vehicles for campaigns to \nreimburse for that usage.\n  This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate \nback into his district or state to raise money from individual \ncontributions.\n  It has some of the most open, full and timely disclosure requirements \nof any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant.\n  The right of political parties, groups and individuals to say what \nthey want in a political campaign is preserved but the right of the \npublic to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is \nalso recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own \ndecisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely \ninformation.\n  Objecting to the popular quest of the moment is very difficult for \nany politician, but turning your back on the First Amendment is more \ndifficult for me.\n  I want campaign finance reform but not at the expense of the First \nAmendment. My legislation does this.\n  As we deal with this issue, I will continue to listen and continue to \nfine-tune my belief on this matter. But I will not stray from a firm \nbelief in the first amendment, a firm belief in fair campaign laws, and \na firm belief that whatever we do here in this body must justly serve \nthe democratic process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I shall take just a moment before the \nSenator from Colorado leaves the floor to thank him. This is his third \nyear in the Senate. As he knows and as has been discussed, we seem to \nhave this debate every year. He has participated every single year in \nthe debate in an extraordinarily insightful way. His speech made a \nwhole lot of sense. I listened to every word.\n  I thank him for the important contribution he has made to this \ndebate, not only this year but in the other years since he has been in \nthe Senate. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I note that the Senator from Idaho is \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nengage in what has become an annual debate on campaign finance reform. \nBut I am also here to honor Senator Mitch McConnell, who has chosen to \nbe a leader on this issue for all the right reasons and, most \nimportantly, the right principled reasons. To defend our Constitution \nand to defend free speech in this country is an admirable cause. I \nthank him for engaging in it.\n  Along with that kind of leadership comes the risk of errors. I see \nthat this weekend the New York Times, in its rather typical fashion, \nhas decided to engage in this debate by simply calling names, \nsuggesting that the Senate is a ``bordello'' and that Mitch McConnell \nis its ``madam.'' Shame on you, New York Times. I thought you were \nbetter than that. But then again, why should we think you are better \nthan that on this issue, because you have chosen to take what you call \nhigh ground, which is in fact exclusive ground, that only you as \njournalists would have to speak out for America when no one else would \nhave that opportunity.\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is why I come to the floor, \nnot only to support Mitch McConnell but to support these important \nprinciples that somehow the New York Times just flat stumbles over on \nits way to its version of the truth.\n  There is another analogy I might use. It is similar to suggesting \nthat this form of regulation is like a new architectural design for the \nNavy that gave us the Titanic. I suspect it is not new at all. In fact, \nit is not reform at all. And we have been up this creek one too many \ntimes.\n  We are here today and we are engaged in a most serious way to debate \nwhat I think is an important issue. The Senate has held more than 100 \nvotes on campaign finance reform during the past dozen years. Although \nthe definition of ``reform'' has fluctuated widely over that period of \ntime, the essence of this legislation remains the same--to restrict and \nstifle political speech.\n\n  The bill now before us would also federalize or nationalize vast \nparts of America's politics. For the average citizen listening in \ntoday, let me repeat that phrase. Do you want your Government to \nfederalize or nationalize political free speech in this country, to \nshape it and control it, and to tell candidates and their supporters \nhow to speak? Someday they might even suggest what to speak. That is \nreally the importance of why we come to this floor today to debate this \nmost important topic.\n  Under the new plan offered by Senators McCain and Feingold, there \nwould be once again an across-the-board ban on soft money for any \nFederal election activity.\n  You have already heard the sponsors and the supporters of this bill \ntalk on and on about how soft money is bad, about how President Clinton \nrented out the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for huge soft money \ndonations, or how foreign nationals paid tens of thousand of dollars \nduring the President's 1996 election campaign. They say all soft money \nis bad. Or should we say that Bill Clinton misused it and so, \ntherefore, it is bad? I believe that is the kind of connection they are \nusing.\n  Sorry, Senator McCain; sorry, Senator Feingold. Don't put me in the \nsame category with Bill Clinton. Put me in another category. Put me in \na category that recognizes the importance of free speech and that \nrecognizes there are appropriate ways of handling it.\n  As I have said in the past, and I say again, a total ban on soft \nmoney will have a significant negative effect on the lives of thousands \nof citizens who believe it is their American right to become engaged in \nthe political process. In the end, you will hear no disagreement on \nthis point from the sponsors or the supporters of the legislation.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain how this proposal of a ban on \nsoft money will affect thousands of citizens involved in America's \npolitics.\n  Here in Washington, the national party organizations receive money \nfrom donors. The donations can be from individuals, lobbying groups \nthat represent their members, businesses, or unions. The political \norganizations receiving these donations include the Republican National \nCommittee, the Democratic National Committee, the Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, the Democrat Senatorial Committee, the Republican National \nCongressional Committee, and the Democratic National Congressional \nCommittee.\n  All of these political organizations receive donations from \ncontributors. What happens next is--and it is very important that we \nfollow this because this is supposed to be the negative side of \npolitics; this is supposed to be the side that corrupts. And yet, so \nfar, it is clearly outside the Halls of the Senate. The money flows to \nthese national political organizations.\n  What happens next? These political organizations distribute some of \nthat money to their respective political parties in counties and \nlocalities all over the country. As you can imagine, there are \nthousands of State, county, and local political offices that receive \nthis financial aid.\n  Then, under certain conditions already defined by State and Federal \nlaw, the local parties use this money for activities such as purchasing \ncampaign buttons, bumper stickers, posters, and yard signs to express \nan opinion, to express an idea. The money is also used by voter \nregistration activities on behalf of the partys' Presidential and Vice \nPresidential nominees. The money is also used for multicandidate \nbrochures and even sample ballots.\n  Can you imagine corruption yet emerging out of this that somehow\n\n[[Page S12738]]\n\nwould affect the vote or influence the vote of an individual Senator on \nthis floor? I know Halloween is close. I know Senators McCain and \nFeingold are searching for ghosts. And maybe in this scenario there is \na ghost. But, fellow Senators, it is only a ghost because here is what \nhappens next.\n  Let me give you an example. Say it is an election day. You go down to \nyour local polling site, whether it is at a school, a local church, a \nNational Guard armory, or your American Legion hall. Sometimes there is \na person there who will hand you what is called a sample ballot listing \nall of the candidates in your party running for office. It is a way of \nidentifying people running for your office or running for office in \nyour party. As most voters, you are more than likely to choose \ncandidates of your party. However, under the McCain-Feingold proposal, \nit would be against the law to use soft money to pay for a sample \nballot with the name of any candidate who is running for Congress on \nthe same sample ballot with State and local candidates combined. \nCorruption? As I said earlier, it is close to Halloween.\n\n  Under the McCain-Feingold legislation, it would be against the law to \nuse soft money to pay for campaign buttons, posters, yard signs, or \nbrochures that include the name or picture of a candidate for Federal \noffice on the same item that has the name or picture of a State or \nlocal candidate. That is called Federal control. That causes the \ncreation of a bureaucracy to examine every election process right down \nto the local county central committee. Imagine the size of the new \nbuilding here in Washington. Imagine the Federal agents out on the \nground. Imagine it; that is what ultimately we reduce ourselves to when \nwe begin to micromanage, as is proposed in this legislation, the kind \nof political process that most Americans believe and have reason to \nbelieve is a fair and honest process.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use soft money \nto conduct a local voter registration drive 120 days before the \nelection. These get-out-the-vote drives have proven to be effective \ntools for increasing interest among people in the political process. \nFrankly, that is what we are all about, getting people interested in \nparticipating in their government. Not enough do now. With McCain-\nFeingold, in the end we would probably even cause that to be \nrestricted.\n  In fact, in 1979 Congress supported revisions in the law pertaining \nto get-out-the-vote drives because they were concerned about important \nparty-building activities and they promoted citizen participation in \nthe election process. As we have heard on the Senate floor, the \nsponsors and supporters of this bill think this, and what I have just \ndiscussed, is corruption.\n  Let's look at the reality of what this legislation creates. I will \ntalk about a man I know by the name of Jack Hardy, the chairman of the \nRepublican Party in Custer County, ID. Custer County is about as big as \nDelaware, New Hampshire, and New Jersey together with only about 4,000 \ncitizens living in that huge geographic area. Jack Hardy, chairman of \nthe Republican Party in that county, works at a full time job as a \ncarpenter. He also enjoys spending time with his family. Jack relies on \nfinancial aid from the State and national party organizations to run \nhis Custer County Republican Party.\n  There are thousands of Jack Hardys all over the country. Most are \nvolunteers. They put in long hours supporting their party and their \ncandidates hoping to make a difference because they believe as \nAmericans they ought to be involved in the party process to get people \nelected who believe in and represent the ideals that the Jack Hardys of \nAmerica hold. Jack Hardy is a hard-working man who wants to make a \ndifference.\n  McCain-Feingold is saying we will make it tougher, Jack. Here is how \nwe will make it tougher. We are not going to allow you to use the kind \nof resources that come from the State and the Federal parties. You have \nto get out and hustle: forget your job. You have to get hard money from \ndonations, local business money, and individuals to fund any \nactivities.\n  Jack already does some of this. He already solicits among individuals \nand businesses in his community. But never is there enough on an \nelection day or before an election day to do the right kind of work. \nJack Hardy relies on his State and Federal party to help him.\n\n  People such as Jack Hardy will be forced to take more of their time \noff from what is a nonpaid voluntary job to help participate in \nAmerican political activities. In other words, fundraising hard money \nwill become a bigger concern for the State and local officials than \never before, and whoever raises the most money can fund more political \nactivities. It is that simple.\n  Essentially, what we have done is make money the most compelling \nfactor in campaigns instead of part of what is necessary to run a good \ncampaign organization.\n  Frankly, this is silly stuff. Exactly what kind of campaign finance \nreform is this? What are we trying to accomplish? We just added more \nlaws to a system that is already heavily burdened with rules and \nregulations, many of which can't even get enforced because the Federal \nElection Commission doesn't function too well. Again, it is a federal \nbureaucracy that has probably outserved its usefulness.\n  We have just added more laws to a system that is already not working. \nWe forced thousands of State and local party officials to raise more \nmoney from their constituents, to confuse the process that we think \nworks pretty well now.\n  If the point of McCain-Feingold is to reform the campaign finance \nsystem, then I think the last thing we want to do is ban soft money.\n  I support the amendment offered by Senator McCain to require State \nand local officials to file immediate electronic disclosure of \ncontributions. That is key to anything we do. Let the voters know \nfirsthand about the money source coming into their politics. Voters are \nnot dumb. They are talented, bright Americans who make their own \njudgments. And they should be based on the knowledge handed them, \nwithout having to create a monstrously large Federal bureaucracy.\n  I am bothered by what has been left out of McCain-Feingold. For \nexample, there is no protection in this bill against union workers. \nThis issue has already been debated thoroughly on the floor. I noticed \njust this past week the AFL-CIO has endorsed Al Gore in his candidacy \nfor the Presidency. Of course, this will bring in millions of dollars \nof reported and millions of dollars of unreported money. Why? In large \npart, we have exempted labor unions from certain levels of campaign \nrequirements and we do not exempt other citizens of our country. Most \nimportantly, we have said labor bosses can take the dues of their \nmembers and use them for political purposes that maybe even those union \nmembers don't want.\n  The American political process ought to be a free process. We want it \nto be open. We want and must always have full disclosure. If union dues \ngo to fund Al Gore's campaign, there will be a lot of union people in \nIdaho who will be very angry because they openly tell me they cannot \nsupport this candidate. Why? Because he put them out of work. His \npolicy on public lands and public land resources and this \nadministration's reaction has cost thousands of union men and women to \nbe out of work in my State. If their dues go without their ability to \nsay no, they have a right to be angry. Yet the provision I am talking \nabout is not in McCain-Feingold. I am talking about a term we call \n``paycheck protection.'' This is a very important part of any kind of \ncampaign finance reform any Member wants to see.\n  During the 1996 elections, union leaders tacked on an extra surcharge \non dues to their members in order to raise $49.2 million to defeat \nRepublican candidates around the country. There is no reason not to say \nit; that was their intent. They were open about it. The union bosses \nhave announced they plan to spend much more in the 2000 election. Yet \nnothing in this law says they can't do that. We shouldn't say, ``You \ncan't do it.'' We should say there are rules about how to collect the \nmoney. The right of the citizen is to say yes or no to how his or her \nmoney is used for political purposes.\n\n  There are others waiting to speak. This will be an issue we will \ndebate into the week. It is an important issue, but it is one I think \nthe American citizens understand quite well.\n\n[[Page S12739]]\n\n  When mom and dad come home at night and they sit at the dinner table \nand one spouse says to another, ``How was your day?'' my guess is they \ndo not say, ``And, oh, what about those campaign finance laws that \nSenator Feingold is debating in the U.S. Senate? Those are really \nimportant to us.'' I doubt they say that. In fact, I doubt even few \nmoms and dads have ever said that. I think what they will talk about, \nthough, is the shooting that happened down the street too close to \ntheir school; or the economy that cost a brother or a sister their job; \nor the taxes they paid that denied them the ability to spend more on \ntheir children or put away more for their children's education. Yes, \nand they probably even, in a rather disgusted way, talk about some of \nthe examples of moral decline in this country. My guess is that is what \ngoes on around the dinner tables of America, not, ``Oh, and by the way, \nSenator Feingold has a great campaign finance bill.''\n  What are important issues, as we debate the issues in the closing \ndays of this Senate, are issues about public education and safety and \ncrime and all of that. We will engage in that with our President in the \ncoming days as we finalize some of these key appropriations bills.\n  Again, I think what is important to the American people are issues \nlike crime, the economy, taxes, health care, education, social \nsecurity, and the moral decline of the country.\n  What people really care about is whether their children will get \nsafely back and forth from school--and whether they'll get a good \neducation in the public schools.\n  They care about keeping their jobs and trying to make ends meet while \nthey watch more and more of their hard earned money slip away to \nWashington to satisfy this President's lust for spending.\n  They care about their future--whether they can save enough money to \nretire some day. And if they retire, will there be any money left in \nthe Social Security system, or will it all be spent on more government \nprograms.\n  These are the real concerns of Americans today, and I hope the Senate \nwill soon be able to turn its attention to these important issues.\n  Let me conclude by saying we are not wasting our time debating \ncampaign finance reform. Defending the right of free speech and the \nright of citizens to participate in this most critical of American \ninstitutions is our job. To defend and protect that right is the \nreasonable goal. So I appreciate joining with my colleagues on the \nfloor to oppose McCain-Feingold and hope Senators will join with us in \nprotecting that freedom of expression of America's citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Before the Senator from Idaho yields the floor, will he \nyield to a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was very interested in a comment about the money being \nraised by the AFL-CIO. I would like to get the exact figure. Did the \nSenator say $49 million?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That was in the last cycle.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In the last cycle.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Specific to those elections.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Let me ask a question, which I will be asking my friends \non the other side as well. But since my colleague has raised it, I \nthink he could be an expert on this issue.\n  Since we are being told repeatedly throughout this debate that the \nhuge amounts of soft money are corrupting and controlling the votes, \nlet me ask the Senator from Idaho, who is a member of the Republican \nleadership: If the AFL-CIO were to simply give that $49 million to the \nRepublicans and thus corrupt and influence our votes, would that not be \na better investment on their part than to have it wasted on people who \nare already with them?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is a unique thought. I guess I had not thought of it \nthat way. I do not necessarily suggest the $49.2 million is a \ncorrupting factor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do not believe it is corrupting either, but we are \nbeing told repeatedly that it is.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What is corrupting about that is when a labor boss says he \nis going to take the dues of his member without asking him or her \nwhether he can use those dues for a political purpose.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thomas Jefferson had something to say about that. He said \nit was wrong, and an individual's money never should be used for those \npurposes. That is the corrupting factor, when money you thought you \ncontrolled for the purpose of expressing your political opinion would \nget misused. I think in this instance it does.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with the Senator from Idaho completely about \nthat. But I want to go back to the argument that has been made again \nand again by my friend from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona, \nthat the tremendous amount of money that is being put into the system \ninfluences how people vote. If I were sitting on a $49 million pot of \nmoney, advising the AFL-CIO, saying what you want is to get more of \nyour legislation through the Congress, I would say to them: If in fact \nthe $49 million does change the way people vote, why not give the $49 \nmillion to the people who are not voting for us? Why not give the $49 \nmillion to the Republicans and turn them all into rabid supporters of \nthe AFL-CIO?\n  Mr. CRAIG. In other words, following the logic that money talks and \nmoney influences.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If we accept that logic, it is perfectly clear it ought \nto come on this side of the aisle rather than the other.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Idaho, if he was to suddenly receive in \nhis campaign--through, let us say, the State party of Idaho, because it \ncannot be given to him directly, there is no way the soft money can \ncorrupt you because you cannot receive it--but, if the AFL-CIO were \nsuddenly to give to the Republican Party of Idaho $1 million in cash, \nwould you change your position on any of the labor issues you have \ndiscussed, paycheck protection, for example?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. How can you change your position on things that are \nfundamentally right in America, such as the right of an individual to \ncontrol his money or her money for political purposes? Absolutely not.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I accept the integrity of the Senator from Idaho. Let me \nask him, as a member of leadership----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Remember the New York Times says I am a member of a \nbordello.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is why I am raising the question, because in a \nbordello you can change what happens by where the money goes, without \nany question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I wouldn't know.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have never been in one, but I am at least told that is \nthe way it works.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Idaho, as a member of the leadership, you \nknow other Members of the Republican Party. Do you know of any Member, \non this side of the aisle, who would change his or her position on \nlabor issues if the AFL-CIO were to suddenly put $1 million worth of \nsoft money into his or her State party?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I not only do not know of anyone, I know if you accused \nanyone of changing their opinion because of that, you would have a \nfight on your hands. I do not mean just a verbal fight. I say to anyone \nwho would suggest to any of us that money influences, from the \nstandpoint it is going to change our philosophy, change our attitude or \ncorrupt us, as some Senators have suggested on this floor that it \ndoes--out West we call them fighting words. Because you are questioning \na person's integrity. You are basically saying they are for sale.\n  Shame on those Senators who come to the floor to make that kind of \nsuggestion. Maybe they know something we do not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Idaho yield for a similar \nquestion?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Most of the Republican Members of the Senate have been \nvigorous supporters of tort reform, changes in the legal system of this \ncountry. I ask my friend from Idaho, if the American Trial Lawyers \nAssociation gave $1 million to the Republican National Committee, would \nthat turn the Republicans in the Senate into vigorous opponents of \nlegal reform?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It not only would not, you are speaking of a fantasy idea \nthat I doubt will ever come to pass. But I thank you for asking that \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S12740]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My final question of the Senator from Idaho: Let's \nassume the National Right to Life Committee contributed $100,000 to the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Does the Senator from Idaho--\nof course we are not in the best position to answer this, I don't \nguess, since it is not our party, but it is still interesting to \nspeculate. Let's assume the National Right to Life Committee gave a \n$100,000 soft money contribution to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee. I ask my friend from Idaho, does he anticipate at that point \nthe Democrats in the Senate would become pro-life?\n  Mr. CRAIG. No. I do not believe that a majority of them would. I \nthink their basis for what they call a pro-choice position is one \nfirmly grounded on their philosophy. I don't criticize--I don't agree, \nbut I don't criticize--their right to hold that. But what National \nRight to Life is saying is that they want to have the right to give the \nDemocrat Party money if they choose to. What they are saying is, we \nwant to have a right to organize individual citizens to come together \nto pool their money for the purpose of giving it. What McCain-Feingold \nsays is: No, you can't do that.\n\n  National Right to Life is saying, in this instance: Give us choice, \nthe right to choose where we want to play in the political process. \nDon't deny us what is our right as American citizens or an American \ngroup to participate in the political process.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Idaho, not only for responding \nto our questions but also for another outstanding contribution to this \nmost important debate.\n  We appreciate his insightful comments. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry my friend from Utah last left the \nfloor. The fact is, the political balance of power is already heavily \ntilted toward corporations, by any study that you find. The fact is, in \nthe last election cycle corporate interests spent about $700 million in \npolitical contributions. That is 11 times more than what unions spent. \nAnd they did not get the permission of their stockholders. While unions \ncontributed less than 4 percent of the $1.6 billion raised by \ncandidates and parties in 1996, corporations contributed over 40 \npercent.\n\n  So the disparity between corporate and union spending is not static; \nit is growing. In the next election cycle, instead of 11 to 1, it will \nprobably be 14 to 1. What is so disconcerting about this is for this \nso-called soft money, it is even wider.\n  While both corporations and unions have increased their unrestricted \nso-called soft money contributions, since 1992 corporate spending has \ngrown twice as fast. In 1996, as an example, corporations spent more \nthan $176 million--19 times more than what the unions spent.\n  There is all this talk about the unions that represent the working \nmen and women of this country spending 4 percent of what is spent in \npolitical campaigns. I think it is too bad that working men and women \nin this country do not have more of a representation. It is getting \nworse. That is why this legislation is before this body.\n  I think it is important at this time to recognize the work done by \nSenator Feingold in making this an issue before the people of America. \nI applaud and congratulate Senator Feingold for his position based upon \nwhat he believes is principle.\n  He not only talks the game; he lives the game, as indicated in his \nmost recent election. While all over America people were spending huge \namounts of soft money, and it was being spent in Wisconsin against \nSenator Feingold, he refused to take any money even though it was \navailable to him.\n  So I take this opportunity to say, first of all, let's bring in to \nproper perspective the disparity between corporate spending and union \nspending and also to congratulate my friend from the State of \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator mentioned $179 million of corporate \nexpenditures. Are those for State and local races also?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. The fact is, that is a lesser figure. What I did say \nin the beginning is that in the 1996 election cycle--the one that we \nhave numbers on--corporate interests spent more; in fact, it is almost \n$700 million in political contributions, which is 11 times more than \nwhat unions spent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not know about that. But I know Mr. Sweeney has \nindicated he had $170-some-odd million, that they would spend $46 \nmillion, I believe, on just the 34 Federal congressional races, all of \nwhich is very unregulated and underreported, inaccurately reported, of \ncourse. But I want to get those numbers straight, whether you are \ntalking about throughout the Nation, including county commission races, \nState senate races, and all the races.\n  The numbers are hard to compare. I think the Senator would probably \nagree with that.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alabama, if we took into \nconsideration State and local races, the corporate skew would be even \nfurther out of whack because unions do get involved in local campaigns. \nBut it is usually through the grassroots level and very rarely is it \nmoney; where the corporations very rarely are involved in the \ngrassroots activities and are always involved in the money.\n\n  So if we added all that, the number may even be more than 11 times \nmore than what the unions spent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The numbers I have are that labor spent $370 million \nper election cycle on campaigns. I am not sure where all the numbers \ncome out, but that is quite a lot.\n  Would the Senator agree with that? Or does he disagree with those \nnumbers?\n  Mr. REID. I do not know from where the Senator is getting his \nnumbers. In the previous question the Senator asked, there was $40 \nmillion. And now it is how much?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Sweeney said they were going to spend $46 million \nin 34 targeted U.S. congressional races.\n  Mr. REID. Where does this other number come from?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The $370 million includes Federal election campaigns.\n  Mr. REID. Over what period of time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The last election cycle.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend the numbers that he has, I don't know \nfrom where they came. I do state that in America we have far too much \nmoney being spent, soft money and other kinds of money. The point I was \ntrying to make in my statement in response to my friend from Utah is \nthe fact that corporate spending, by any number you pick, is far out of \nwhack with union spending, whether it is 19 times more or 11 times \nmore. We all acknowledge it is a growing disparity.\n  The fact is, what is being attempted by my friend from the State of \nWisconsin is to stop the flow of all this soft money.\n  The fact is, there is a lot of talk about union money coming from \nworking men and women in this country. Remember, corporate money is \nalso money that represents shareholders. Certainly, they get no say in \nhow that money is spent.\n  So I suggest that before we start picking on organized labor, \nremember, is there anything wrong with the nurses of America, who are \nincluded in these numbers--the AFL-CIO, teachers, carpenters, cement \nfinishers--being represented? The answer is, they should be able to be \ninvolved in campaigns just as much as somebody who represents tobacco \ninterests and the very large health care industry in America. So they, \ntoo, need a voice.\n  I am glad that voice is being represented by this side of the aisle.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has been \nwaiting a long time.\n  I will yield to him in 1 minute. But I want to make a quick point \nwith regard to speech comments by the Senator from Colorado.\n  He and I had a good discussion the other day about this issue. I \nenjoyed it.\n\n[[Page S12741]]\n\nBut he said that a soft money ban would be unfair to the Republican \nParty. And this very much reflects the comments of the Senator from \nKentucky, who has made similar comments, that a soft money ban would \nsomehow unfairly limit the ability of the Republican Party, as opposed \nto the Democratic Party.\n\n  I find this very odd, since the comments this weekend of the chairman \ndesignate of the Democratic National Committee, the mayor of \nPhiladelphia, Ed Rendell, who is the chair of the DNC, who said in a \ncolumn, or was quoted in a column by David Broder:\n\n       ``If the Republicans pass McCain-Feingold, we would be shut \n     down,'' Rendell said.\n\n  So both parties apparently think it is the end of the line for them \nif we ban soft money--but only for one of them. I ask, how is it \npossible, since this whole soft money thing only happened 3 or 4 years \nago in terms of the vast amounts of money? We certainly had political \nparties before this--pretty good political parties. How can both \nparties be right? How can the Senator from Colorado be right and Mr. \nRendell be right?\n  The fact is, both parties have become addicted to soft money, and \nthey do not want to give it up. There is no reality to the notion that \nthe parties will be crippled or any particular party would be severely \nharmed by the soft money ban.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to make that point. At this point, since we \nare roughly trying to go back and forth, I hope the Senator from \nMassachusetts could proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I notice other colleagues wanting to \naddress the Senate. I would hope and ask consent--I see my colleague on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment? Will the Senator \nyield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Without losing his right to the floor.\n  In terms of order, I gather we are still rotating. I ask unanimous \nconsent that on our side I be able to follow Senator Kennedy. Senator \nLevin may come, in which case I can talk with him about how to proceed. \nI ask unanimous consent that on our side I be allowed to follow Senator \nKennedy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I know the occupant of \nthe chair was here to speak earlier. Is the Senator from Ohio going to \nbe in the chair until 3?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have no problem with the Senator's consent \nagreement, then, if I may ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nOhio be recognized at 3 to make some remarks. I think that would help \naccommodate him. Nobody is trying to quiet anyone. I just want to give \nthe Senator from Ohio a chance to get in the debate at 3. Does anybody \nhave a problem with that?\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem. We will begin rotating at this time. The \nSenator from Kentucky knows we have already had several speeches from \nRepublicans. We will start now rotating.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. So after Senator Kennedy speaks, Senator Voinovich may \nspeak. If necessary, you may cover the floor for him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We will work that out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I only planned to speak \nfor 15 or 20 minutes. I think what the Senator from Kentucky has \nproposed will certainly be agreeable, if that is all right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Ohio will be recognized after the \nSenator from Minnesota. We will make sure somebody gets in the Chair \nand gives him an opportunity to make his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will put in the Record the excellent \nsummaries of total contributions according to the Center for Responsive \nPolitics. That is a nonpartisan watchdog group. We can talk about \nnumbers here and numbers there. However, I think it is important for \nthe Record that we have summaries from the nonpartisan groups that have \nassessed the contributions by unions and corporations--hard money/soft \nmoney. As the Senator from Nevada, the Senator from Wisconsin, and \nothers have pointed out, the ratio is about 11 to 1. You can slice it \nany way you want but the fact remains--it is basically the difference \nbetween the contributions, according to nonpartisan groups. Others have \nother ways of adding and subtracting figures; all well and good.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the summary provided \nby the Center for Responsive Politics because I think it is helpful to \nhave the findings of those who have no ax to grind.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [AFL-CIO Fact Sheet]\n\n  Corporate vs. Union Spending on Politics--There's Too Much Money in \n                   Politics--But It's Not Union Money\n\n       The political balance of power is already tilted heavily in \n     favor of corporations. In the 1996 election cycle, corporate \n     interests spent more than $677 million on political \n     contributions--11 times more than unions spent. So while \n     unions contributed less than 4 percent of the $1.6 billion \n     raised by candidates and parties in 1996, corporations \n     contributed more than 40 percent.\n       The disparity between corporate and union spending is \n     growing. Since 1992 (when the ratio was 9-to-1), corporate \n     political contributions have increased by $229.8 million, \n     while union contributions rose by only $12.1 million.\n       In ``soft money'' contributions, the gap is even wider. \n     While both corporations and unions have increased their \n     unrestricted, so-called ``soft money'' contributions since \n     1992, corporate spending grew twice as fast. In 1996, \n     corporations spent more than $176 million--19 times more than \n     unions did.\n       Corporate special interests are pushing initiatives that \n     would skew the balance even further. By backing special \n     restrictions on unions while imposing no such limits on \n     themselves, big corporations are trying to remove working \n     families and their unions from the political playing field.\n       Corporations, right-wing foundations and anti-union \n     lobbying groups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars \n     to ``de-fund'' unions. At a recent meeting of the Republican \n     Governors Association, proponents of the initiatives noted \n     that the de-funding ploy has two strategic benefits: If it \n     works, unions will lose funding. Even if it doesn't, unions \n     will be forced to spend millions of dollars in the fight.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Year                 Corporations     Unions      Ratio\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal contributions:\n    1996...........................  $677,442,423  $60,352,761   11 to 1\n    1994...........................   492,956,181   48,319,054   10 to 1\n    1992...........................   447,594,985   48,152,256    9 to 1\n                                    ====================================\nSoft money contributions:\n    1996...........................   176,108,186    9,505,745   19 to 1\n    1994...........................    64,753,971    4,293,459   15 to 1\n    1992...........................    66,342,241    4,251,334   16 to 1\nHard money contributions:\n    1996...........................   501,334,237   50,847,016   10 to 1\n    1994...........................   428,202,210   44,025,595   10 to 1\n    1992...........................   381,252,744   44,067,720    9 to 1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, briefly, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On the number that the Senator said the unions spent, \nwhat was that number?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in \n1996, $60 million; 1994, $48 million; 1992, $48 million. On the \ncorporations, $677 million in 1996; $492 million in 1994; and $447 \nmillion in 1992. That is total contributions. It works out to a ratio \nof 11 to 1 in 1996, 10 to 1 in 1994, and 9 to 1 in 1992.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I note the Washington Post article I was \njust looking at indicated there was a $46 million commitment by Mr. \nSweeney in this election cycle for just 34 House of Representatives \nraces, so those numbers don't sound accurate to me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In 1996, the unions spent $50 million; the corporations, \n$501 million. So we are talking 1997, 1998, 1999. That figure may still \nbe consistent with the 10 to 1 or 11 to 1 figure. I don't find that \nthere would be any inconsistency if that were the figure being spent.\n  I was interested to hear our good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, \ntalking about people worrying at the dinner table about these issues. \nHe mentioned people are much more concerned about what is happening \ndown the street or near the school with regard to a shooting incident. \nI say that is right. And it is very interesting that I was not able to \nget a report, as a member of the conference committee on the juvenile \nviolence act, that deals with the availability and the accessibility of\n\n[[Page S12742]]\n\nguns to children in our society and of the criminal element. That has \nbeen locked up now for some 6 weeks. I don't think anyone on this floor \nis prepared to say the National Rifle Association doesn't have \nsomething to do with that.\n  He talked about taxes--people are concerned about taxes. People are \nconcerned about tax loopholes as well. How do the tax loopholes get \ninto the Internal Revenue budget? We have $4 trillion of what are \ncalled tax expenditures in the IRS at the present time. That is the \nfastest growing expenditure we have in the Federal budget, the \nexpansion of tax expenditures, tax loopholes. We don't have any debate \non it. Many of us have said, let's do for tax expenditures what we do \nfor direct expenditures--when we are cutting back on education and \nhealth care; let what is good for the goose be good for the gander. Do \nyou think you can get those issues raised here on the floor of the \nSenate? Of course not. We all understand why.\n  It is kind of interesting that those who have been the strongest \nspokespersons against this proposal also raise incidents in terms of \nwhat is on people's minds. It comes back, in many instances, to what \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have talked \nabout.\n  This country has waited long enough for campaign finance reform. The \ncurrent system is shameful, benefiting only the big corporations and \nlobbyists who have seemingly bottomless barrels of money to spend, \nwhile the voice of average citizens goes unheard in the special \ninterest din.\n  I commend Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their consistent \nleadership on this issue. Their commitment to reform gives us an \nopportunity to join the House of Representatives and cleanse our \ncampaign financing system of special interest abuses. The House took \neffective action earlier this year, transcending partisan differences \nto adopt long overdue reforms. The large margin by which the Shays-\nMeehan bill passed, 252 to 177, demonstrates that the public feels \nstrongly about the need for reform. The Senate should act now to \nsupport the McCain-Feingold proposal and give the country clean \nelections in the years to come.\n  Effective reform must include a ban on soft money. The McCain-\nFeingold bill does just that. Soft money contributions are increasing \nat alarming rates, while hard money contributions are barely rising. In \nthe 1992 Presidential election cycle, both parties raised a total of \n$86 million in soft money. Compare this to the $224 million total \nraised in the 1998 election cycle--a 150-percent increase of soft money \ncontributions in only 6 years. A more recent survey shows figures from \nJanuary to June 1999, soft money contributions totaled $46.2 million--\nand $30.1 million of that total was given by corporations and business \ninterests. In the 1996 elections, the consumer credit industry alone \ngave $5.5 million in soft money. True reform means closing this \nflagrant loophole that allows so many special interests to bypass legal \nlimits on giving money directly to candidates. Until we close it the \nspecial interests will continue to strengthen their hold on the \npolitical process.\n  The House reforms also ended other serious abuses in campaign \nfinancing. It ends the sham of the so-called issue ads loophole, which \npermits special interests to spend big money on campaign advertising \nobviously designed to support a candidate, as long as the ads do not \nspecifically call for the candidate's election. The House bill treats \nthese ads as the campaign ads they really are, and rightly subjects \nthem to regulation under the campaign finance laws.\n  The Senate should learn from the House, and join in ending these \nabuses that make a mockery of our election laws. Instead, the Senate \nRepublican leadership is bent on preserving the status quo. They oppose \ncampaign finance reform because they do not want to lose the support \nthey currently receive from their special interest friends.\n  Our Republican friends say they want to help working families--but \ntheir support of the Paycheck Protection Act demonstrates their \nantilabor bias, because that measure is designed to silence the voice \nof the American workers and labor unions in the political process. It \nis revenge, not reform--revenge for the extraordinary efforts by the \nlabor movement in the 1996 and 1998 election campaigns. It imposes a \ngag rule on American workers, and it should be defeated.\n  The act's supporters claim they are concerned about union members' \nright to choose whether and how to participate in the political \nprocess. But we know better. The Paycheck Protection Act should really \nbe called the Paycheck Destruction Act. It is part of a coordinated \nnational antilabor campaign to lock American workers and their unions \nout of politics.\n  And who is behind this campaign? It is not the workers, unhappy with \nthe use of their union dues for political purposes. It is businesses \nand their allies, anxious to reduce the role of labor. It is \norganizations like Americans for Tax Reform, which supports Social \nSecurity privatization, vouchers for private schools, and huge tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans. It is think tanks such as the American \nLegislative Exchange Council and the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis, which support so-called right-to-work laws, the TEAM act, the \nflat tax, private school vouchers, medical savings accounts, and other \nantiworker legislation. And it is right-wing Republicans in Congress \nand in the states.\n  We know that unions and their members are among the most effective \nvoices in the political process. They support raising the minimum wage, \nprotecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, improving education, \nand ensuring safety and health on the job.\n  Silencing these voices of working families will make it easier for \nthose with antiworker agenda to prevail. Sponsors of this legislation \nsupport prevatizing Social Security. They favor private school vouchers \ninstead of a healthy public school system. They would undermine \noccupational safety and health laws, end the 40-hour work week and \npermit sham, company-dominated unions. They oppose the Family and \nMedical Leave Act. They want to restrict Medicare eligibility and deny \nmillions of workers an increase in the minimum wage. They are not \ntrying to help working Americans. To the contrary--they are trying to \nsilence the workers' participation in the political process so they can \nimplement an agenda that workers strongly oppose.\n  Campaign abuses abandon other issues as well. The tobacco industry \nhas made extensive PAC and soft money contributions, and the Senate \nRepublican leadership has rejected much needed antitobacco legislation. \nThe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids reports that in the last 10 years, \nSenators who voted consistently against tobacco reform legislation took \nfar more money from the industry--four times more--than those who \nsupported the bill.\n  The dabate on the Patients' Bill of Rights is another vivid example \nof the obstructionist influence of industries and special interests. \nSince 1997, the health insurance industry has been making huge \npolitical contributions to Republicans. Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its \nstate affiliates made $1 million in contributions in the 1997-1998 \ncycle, with four out of every five dollars going to Republicans. \nManaged care PACs--including the American Association of Health Plans, \nthe Health Insurance Association of America, and Blue Cross/Blue \nShield--gave $77,250 to leadership political action committees. \nAccording to the Center on Responsive Politics, all but $1,500 went to \nthe Republican majority.\n  These contributions bought the industry at least 2 years worth of \nstall and delay tactics in Congress. And, when the Senate finally \npassed legislation this year, it was not what patients needed, but an \nindustry bill that places HMO profits ahead of patients' health.\n  Contributions from the credit card and banking industries have had a \nsimilar effect on the bankruptcy reform debate. Master Card, Visa, and \nothers doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled their spending to encourage \npassage of the bill they wanted. Visa increased its 1998 lobbying to \n$3.6 million from $900,000 in 1997. Master Card wasn't far behind--\ntheir lobbying expenses rose from $430,000 in 1997 to $1.8 million in \n1998. In the 1997-1998 election cycle, commercial banks and financial \nservice companies gave $20.8 million in large individual contributions, \nPAC money and soft money to candidates--\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\nand two-thirds of that total went to Republicans. The result? \nLegislation that House Committee Chairman Henry Hyde described as \n``pages and pages and pages of advantages [for] the creditor community \n* * *''\n  Honest campaign finance reform does not include phony proposals that \nseek to eliminate political expression by average families. It does \ninclude eliminating the flagrant abuses that enable big corporations \nand special interests to tilt the election process in their favor.\n  Real reform means giving elections back to the people and creating a \nlevel playing field on which all voters are equal, regardless of their \nincome. Broad campaign finance reform is within the Senate's reach. We \nshould follow the example set for us by the House. The greatest gift \nthe Senate can give to the American people is clean elections.\n  Over the course of debate, we have learned what the other side is \nagainst. We rarely learn what they are for. Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold have laid out something I think we should be for. In the next \nfew days, hopefully, the American people will speak through their \nrepresentatives and support those efforts.\n  One of the provisions we heard a good deal about, again from my \nfriend from Idaho, was the whole question about workers and whether \nthey have control over their dues. Of course, what exists in the \nMcCain-Feingold provision is an incorporation of the Beck decision, \nwhich permits workers to check off, at the time they pay their dues, \nthat they are not interested in the political process.\n  Today, evidently, they want something that is going to be harsher on \nworking men and women. Those forces that are pressing to restrict the \nvoice of working men and women are actually the major interest groups \nthat are strongly opposed to the agenda of working families, whether it \nhas been an increase in the minimum wage, whether it has been HMO \nreforms, whether it has been education and increasing the education \nbudget. These groups are opposed to workers participating because, in \nmany instances, the workers have been the ones to try to advance these \ninterests on our national agenda.\n  I think it is important. I don't know how many of us are getting the \ncommunications from workers on these particular issues. Yet we have \nseen what has happened over this past year, whether it has been on the \nHMO reform--the change in expenditures by the insurance companies at \nthe time when this body was debating whether doctors are going to be \nthe ones who are going to make the decisions on health care for the \nparticular patients, rather than the accountants and insurance \nindustry. Nobody could deny when we were debating those issues that the \ncontributions and expenditures by the insurance companies skyrocketed \ndramatically, escalated significantly. This is the kind of thing that \nwe are talking about in terms of the impact that campaign finance \nreform can have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a couple of unanimous consent \nrequests, cleared on both sides.\n  As in executive session, I ask that, at 5:45 today, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 270, the \nnomination of Florence-Marie Cooper to be United States District Judge \nfor the Central District of California.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then immediately \nproceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination and, following \nthat vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action \nand the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe we have a consent agreement \nunder which Senator Wellstone was to be recognized next. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is what I understand.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as I said earlier, when Senator Levin \ncame to the floor I would be pleased to yield the floor to him. Senator \nMcCain is here. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be allowed \nto speak, that we then go in order--I understand Senator McCain wants \nto speak, and I also know that the Chair, Senator Voinovich, seeks \nrecognition--and I be allowed to speak after Senator Voinovich.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak after Senator Levin.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Then Senator Voinovich, and I would follow Senator \nVoinovich.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from \nArizona was not here at the time, but Senator Voinovich was waiting \npatiently a little bit earlier. Would he have any objection to Senator \nVoinovich following Senator Levin?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin, then a Republican, and then a \nDemocrat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe I can sort it out. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Levin, then Senator Voinovich, then Senator \nWellstone, and then Senator McCain be recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I add to the request that Senator \nBennett be recognized after Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object to that because we are going back and forth from \none side to the other.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The two sides are not parties. The two sides are the \nissue, and by adding Senator Bennett and Senator Voinovich we get some \nbalance on the issue back and forth, which is what we had been trying \nto do earlier.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is appropriate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I hear the unanimous consent, just to be sure. \nParliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Levin, Senator Voinovich, Senator \nWellstone, Senator McCain, followed by Senator Bennett.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and all my colleagues. I particularly \nthank Senator Wellstone for allowing me to go at this time.\n  Mr. President, our Federal election laws are broken, and the issue \nbefore the Senate is whether we want to fix them.\n  In the 1970s, we passed laws to limit the role of money in Federal \nelections. Our intent was to protect our democratic form of government \nfrom the corrosive influence of unlimited political contributions.\n  We wanted to ensure that our Federal elected officials were, neither \nin reality nor in perception, beholden to special interests who were \nable to contribute large sums of money to candidates and their \ncampaigns.\n  Our election laws were designed to protect the public's confidence in \nour democratically elected officials. And for many years our election \nlaws worked fairly well. The limits they set were clear, and those laws \nare on the books today.\n  Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate \nper election, or $5,000 to a political action committee, or more than \n$20,000 a year to a national party committee, or $25,000 total in any \none year. Corporations and unions are prohibited from contributing to \nany campaign. That is the law on the books today. This is the election \nlaw: $1,000 per individual to a candidate in an election; $5,000 to a \nPAC. It is right in these laws--$5,000 PAC contribution to a candidate.\n  We are supposed to be limiting contributions to candidates. Yet, over \nthe last few years, we have heard story after story about contributions \nof hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, corporations, and \nunions, and even about contributions from foreign sources. Then the \nquestion is, How is it possible, when the law says $1,000 to a \ncandidate per election, that people can give $100,000, which \neffectively helped that candidate in that election? How is it possible?\n  This pretty good law of ours has holes in it, and both parties have \ntaken\n\n[[Page S12744]]\n\nadvantage of them. There are no longer any effective limits on \ncontributions. That is the bottom line. That is why we hear about a $1 \nmillion contribution to the RNC from a corporation, or a half-million-\ndollar contribution from one couple to the DNC.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley surely did not have this in mind. They \nunderstood the limits to mean that individuals can't contribute more \nthan the overall $25,000 limit for a calendar year. Look at what they \nsaid when they upheld that provision in the law. The Buckley Court \ndescribed the $25,000 limit as a modest restraint which ``serves to \nprevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who \nmight otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular \ncandidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political \ncommittees likely to contribute to that candidate or a huge \ncontribution to the candidate's political party.'' Yet that is exactly \nwhat is happening today under the soft money loophole.\n  So the Supreme Court foresaw that people would try to evade the \n$1,000 limit unless the Congress put in a $25,000 limit. They said that \nis one of the reasons the $25,000 limit per year is appropriate.\n  Yet, under the soft money loophole, precisely what is happening today \nis that the $1,000 limit has been obliterated, for all intents and \npurposes. Our task is to make the law whole again and, in making it \nwhole, to make it effective. If we don't, we risk losing the faith the \nAmerican people have that we represent their interests and that each \ncitizen's voice counts fairly.\n  The principal culprit in this erosion of our laws is the soft money \nloophole. Soft money has blown the lid off the contribution limits of \nour campaign finance system. Soft money is the 800,000-pound gorilla \nsitting right in the middle of this debate.\n  Look at the most recent data with respect to soft money \ncontributions. In the 1996 Presidential election year, Republicans \nraised $140 million in soft money contributions; Democrats raised $120 \nmillion. In 1998, even without a Presidential election, Republicans \nraised $131 million in soft money contributions and Democrats raised \n$91 million. The 1997-1998 combined soft money total was 115 percent \nmore than the 1993-1994 total. We are told that the soft money \ncontributions in the first half of 1999 have increased 55 percent over \nthe same period in 1997, and they are 75 percent higher this year than \nthey were in the first half of 1995.\n  The increases are stunning when we look at specific examples. One \ncorporation contributed $270,000 in soft money contributions in the \nfirst 6 months of 1997; it contributed $750,000 in the first 6 months \nof 1999. One union contributed $195,000 in soft money contributions in \nthe first 6 months of 1997; it has contributed $525,000 in the first 6 \nmonths of 1999.\n  Those are the increases we are experiencing. They are out of control. \nThe limits are effectively gone. There are effectively no more limits \non contributions that get into campaigns and support candidates.\n  That is not what the Supreme Court said in Buckley. The Supreme Court \nsaid in Buckley it is perfectly appropriate for Congress to limit \ncontributions to candidates and to effectuate that by limiting the \ntotal contribution to $25,000 a year that could be made overall as a \nway of implementing, assuring, that the $1,000 contribution would be \nupheld and not evaded. Yet with the soft money loophole, we have wiped \nout the $25,000 contribution limitation. For all intents and purposes, \nthere are no more limits on contributions that effectively assist \ncandidates in campaigns.\n  One case was discussed in the 1997 hearings. Roger Tamraz was a large \ncontributor to both parties who became the bipartisan symbol for what \nis wrong with the current system. Roger Tamraz served as a Republican \nEagle during the 1980s during the Republican Administrations and as a \nDemocratic trustee in the 1990s during Democratic Administrations. \nTamraz's political contributions were not guided by his views on public \npolicy or his desire to support people who shared those views. He was \nunabashed in admitting his political contributions were made for the \npurpose of getting access to people in power. Tamraz showed in stark \nterms the all too common product of the current campaign finance \nsystem--using unlimited soft money contributions to buy access. Despite \nthe condemnation by the press of Tamraz's activities, when asked at the \nhearing to reflect on his $300,000 contribution to obtain access, \nTamraz said: I think next time I'll give $600,000.\n  How do the parties entice wealthy contributors to make large soft \nmoney contributions? What they often do is offer access to decision \nmakers in return for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in a \nsingle contribution. The parties advertise access. It is blatant. Both \nparties sell access for large contributions, and they do it openly. The \nlarger the contribution, the more personal the access to the decision \nmaker.\n  We all know about large contributors to the Democratic National \nCommittee being invited to radio addresses given by the President, or \nto sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom, or to attend one of dozens of coffees \nwith the President at the White House.\n  Look at this invitation to be a DNC trustee. I believe this is from \n1996. For $50,000, or if you raise $100,000, the contributor gets two \nevents with the President, two events with the Vice President, \n``invitations to join party leadership as they travel abroad to examine \ncurrent and developing political and economic issues in other \ncountries,'' and monthly policy briefings with ``key administration \nofficials and Members of Congress.''\n  It is an open sale of access for large contributions. Does anyone \nwant to defend that at a town meeting in our home States? Does anyone \nwant to hold up this invitation from the Democratic National Committee \nin a town meeting and ask people whether or not they like this system? \nIf any Members who oppose this bill banning soft money think their \nposition is credible with the public, I challenge those Members to go \nback to a town meeting and hold up this invitation from the Democratic \nNational Committee or from the Republican National Committee and ask \nour constituents if they think it is right for $50,000 or for $100,000 \na year, if they raise it, to get two meetings with the President in \nWashington, two meetings with the Vice President in Washington, and \nhave annual meetings with policy makers and elected officials in \nWashington.\n  Take a look at the Republican National Committee's 1997 Annual Gala. \nFor $250,000, one gets breakfast with the Majority Leader and the \nSpeaker of the House and a luncheon with the Republican Senate or House \nCommittee Chairman of your choice. By the way, they get that for \n$100,000; some of the other perks they don't get. All the way down to, \nI think $45,000, they get lunch with the Republican Chairman of their \nchoice.\n\n  How many Members of this body want to take home these invitations, \nand in a town meeting with a cross section of constituents, hold up \nthat invitation and say, ``is this the way we want to fund campaigns?'' \nI don't think many Members want to do that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Senator if he is saying that this is the only \nsource of access and that only those who give have access?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I don't think that is true.\n  Mr. BENNETT. When I was on the committee with the Senator, we were \ndebating this issue. I said the best way to get access to me is to be \nregistered to vote in the State of Utah. Then I asked the Senator from \nMichigan, is that the same thing for himself--that he pays more \nattention to constituents from Michigan than he does to contributors \nwho come from outside the State.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope so, but that doesn't answer my point.\n  My point is whether or not we believe for 100,000 bucks we ought to \nsell access to the President of the United States. That is my question. \nIt is not whether one gets access in other ways. It is whether or not \nconstituents ought to be able to buy, for $100,000, access to the \nPresident or have a lunch with the Committee Chairman of their choice.\n  My question is, How many Members opposing the ban on soft money want \nto take that invitation to a town meeting and justify it? That is my \nquestion. There is an answer to it. The answer will come in whether or \nnot any of my colleagues take these invitations to\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\ntown meetings and say: Yes, nothing wrong with saying for $100,000 you \ncan have lunch with the Republican Committee Chairman of your choice.\n  Try to sell that to the public back home. I don't think we can. I \ncannot in Michigan; I won't speak for any other State.\n  That is not what we intended when we put limits on campaign \ncontributions and that is not what the Supreme Court intended in \nBuckley when they upheld the contributions because they specifically \nsaid in Buckley that the $25,000 annual limit on all contributions was \nintended to avoid evasion of the $1,000 contribution to an individual \ncampaign to make sure they cannot, in effect, give it to a candidate or \nhis or her campaign through a political party.\n  The answer to my question will come in whether or not any of the \nopponents to the ban on soft money on these large contributions take \nthese invitations home. And I mean both parties. We have a lot of other \ninvitations, too. We will give Members an invitation of their choice \nand see whether or not they are comfortable going home to their \nconstituents in a town meeting and saying: I'll defend this $100,000 to \nbuy a meeting with the President, or the Vice President, or a Committee \nChairman of choice.\n  I don't think Members will. We will find out. I want to hear from any \nof the opponents of the soft money ban as to whether or not they do \ntake that kind of an invitation home--selling access for large \ncontributions--and defend it at a town meeting. I am interested as to \nwhether or not your constituents say there is nothing wrong with that; \nthat is free speech.\n  That is not what the Supreme Court said in Buckley. They upheld \ncontribution limits as being consistent with the First Amendment. Our \ninstitutions in this democracy depend upon the public having confidence \nin our institutions. When access is sold for a large contribution and \nsomeone is told they can have lunch with a Committee Chairman of their \nchoice for $40,000 or a meeting with the President at the White House \nfor $100,000, I think the public is so totally turned off by that kind \nof flow of money for access that I believe very few will take me up on \nmy challenge to take this invitation back to a town meeting.\n  One invitation in 1997 to a National Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee event promised that contributors would be offered ``plenty of \nopportunities to share [their] personal ideas and vision with'' some of \nthe top Republican leaders and senators. Failure to attend, the \ninvitation said, means that ``you could lose a unique chance to be \nincluded in current legislative policy debates--debates that will \naffect your family and your business for many years to come.''\n  The letter from the Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee invites the recipient to be a life member of the Republican \nSenatorial Inner Circle: ``$10,000 will bring you face-to-face with \ndozens of our Republican Senators, including many of the Senate's most \npowerful Committee Chairmen.'' It goes on and on. That's access. That's \nwhat we're opening offering for sale for large contributions and that's \nwhat contributors are often buying. There are dozens of examples.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some of these invitations that are \nsimilar to the ones I have read be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 1997 RNC Annual Gala, May 13, 1997, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC\n\n\n                       gala leadership committee\n\n   Co-Chairman--$250,000 Fundraising Goal--Sell or purchase Team 100 \n      memberships, Republican Eagles memberships or Dinner Tables.\n\n       Dais Seating at the Gala.\n       Breakfast and Photo Opportunity with Senator Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on \n     May 13, 1997.\n       Luncheon with Republican Senate and House Leadership and \n     the Republican Senate and House Committee Chairmen of your \n     choice.\n       Private Reception with Republican Governors prior to the \n     Gala.\n\n  Vice-Chairman--$100,000 Fundraising Goal--Sell or purchase Team 100 \n      memberships, Republican Eagles memberships or Dinner Tables.\n\n       Preferential Seating at the Gala Dinner with the VIP of \n     your choice.\n       Breakfast and Photo Opportunity with Senator Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on \n     May 13, 1997.\n       Luncheon with Republican Senate and House Leadership and \n     the Republican Senate and House Committee Chairmen of your \n     choice.\n       Private Reception with Republican Governors prior to the \n     Gala.\n\n Deputy Chairman--$45,000 Fundraising Goal--Sell or purchase three (3) \n       Dinner Tables or three (3) Republican Eagles memberships.\n\n       Preferential Seating at the Gala Dinner with the VIP of \n     your choice.\n       Luncheon with Republican Senate and House Leadership and \n     the Republican Senate and House Committee Chairmen of your \n     choice.\n       Private Reception with Republican Governors prior to the \n     Gala.\n\n Dinner Committee--$15,000 Fundraising Goal--Sell or purchase one (1) \n                             Dinner Table.\n\n       Preferential Seating at the Gala Dinner with the VIP of \n     your choice.\n       VIP Reception at the Gala with the Republican members of \n     the Senate and House Leadership.\n       (*Benefits pending final confirmation of the Members of \n     Congress schedules.)\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Democratic National Committee\n\n\n             dnc trustee events and membership requirements\n\n                                 Events\n\n       Two Annual Trustee Events with the President in Washington, \n     DC.\n       Two Annual Trustee Events with the Vice President in \n     Washington, DC.\n       Annual Economic Trade Missions--Beginning in 1994, DNC \n     Trustees will be invited to join Party leadership as they \n     travel abroad to examine current and developing political and \n     economic in other countries.\n       Two Annual Retreats/Issue Conferences--One will be held in \n     Washington and another at an executive conference center. \n     Both will offer Trustees the opportunity to interact with \n     leaders from Washington as well as participate in exclusive \n     issue briefings.\n       Invitations to Home Town Briefings--Chairman Wilhelm and \n     other senior Administration officials have plans to visit all \n     50 states. Whenever possible, impromptu briefings with local \n     Trustees will be placed on the schedule. You will get the \n     latest word from Washington on issues affecting the \n     communities where you live and work.\n       Monthly Policy Briefings--Briefings are held monthly in \n     Washington with key administration officials and members of \n     Congress. Briefings cover such topics as health care reform, \n     welfare reform, and economic policy.\n       VIP Status--DNC Trustees will get VIP status at the 1996 \n     DNC Convention with tickets to restricted events, private \n     parties as well as pre- and post-convention celebrations.\n       DNC Staff Contact--Trustees will have a DNC staff member \n     specifically assigned to them, ready to assist and respond to \n     requests for information.\n       The ``Morning'' Briefing--DNC Trustees will receive daily \n     legislative and executive fax alerts, word on upcoming and \n     current political activities and member survey opportunities.\n       Multi-Program privileges-participation in BLF and NFC \n     events.\n\n                     Annual Membership Requirements\n\n       A general Trustee membership requires a contribution of \n     $50,000 a year or $100,000 raised.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. One solicitation offered, for a contribution of $10,000, \nthe choice of ``attending one of 60 small dinner parties, limited in \nattendance to 20 to 25 people, at the home of a Senator, Cabinet \nOfficer, or senior White House Staff member.''\n  One offer for the Republican Senatorial Trust said, ``Trust members \ncan expect a close working relationship with all Republican Senators, \ntop Administration officials and other national leaders. Personal \nrelationships are fostered at informal meetings throughout the year in \nWashington, D.C. and abroad.''\n  Another solicitation went so far as to say that, ``Attendance at all \nevents is limited.'' Listen to this one, ``Benefits are based on \nreceipts''; ``Benefits are based on receipts.'' You can't pledge \nmoney--cash must be in hand for that meeting with the chairman of your \nchoice. That's how blatant these offers to purchase access have become.\n  It is largely because of soft money. The amounts we see on these \nsolicitations, selling access, are not the $1,000 and $2,000 \ncontributions. They are large--$25,000 and $50,000 and $100,000 in soft \nmoney contributions. The soft money loophole has increased and \nintensified the sale of access.\n  Do these large money contributions create an appearance of personal \naccess and improper influence by big contributors? This is what the \nSupreme Court said in Buckley v. Valeo. I think they answered that \nquestion. The Supreme\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\nCourt said there is an appearance of corruption that is created from \nthe size of the contribution alone. They didn't even get to the \nquestion of the sale of access. They just said that unlimited \ncontributions inherently create an appearance of impropriety. It is \ninherent in unlimited contributions. That is the Supreme Court \nanswering, I believe, for the American people. The Court in Buckley \nupheld contribution limits as a reasonable and constitutional approach \nto deterring, not actual corruption, but the appearance of corruption. \nThis is what the Court said:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private \n     financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal \n     or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from \n     others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a \n     successful campaign. To the extent that large contributions \n     are given to secure political quid pro quos from current and \n     potential office holders, the integrity of our position of \n     representative democracy is undermined.\n\n  And then the Supreme Court said this, ``Of almost equal concern''--\nthe Supreme Court is saying:\n\n       Of almost equal concern to actual quid pro quos is the \n     impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public \n     awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime \n     of large individual financial contributions. . . . Congress \n     could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the \n     appearance of improper influence is also critical . . . if \n     confidence in the system of representative government is not \n     to be eroded to a disastrous extent.\n\n  I want to repeat a few of those words:\n\n       The impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from \n     public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a \n     regime of large individual financial contributions. . . .\n\n  And that, I believe, is what the American people are most deeply \nconcerned about. We, according to the Court, can correct it.\n  The Court went on to say:\n\n       . . . And while disclosure requirements serve many salutary \n     purposes, Congress was surely entitled to conclude that \n     disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution \n     ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal \n     with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a \n     system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even \n     when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of \n     their contributions are fully disclosed.\n\n  The Buckley Court repeatedly endorses the concept that the issue of \ncontributions without limits, alone, is enough to create the appearance \nof corruption and to justify the imposition of limits. Selling access \nin exchange for contributions would only take the Court's concerns and \njustifications for limits a step further.\n  The Buckley Court also said:\n\n       Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions \n     but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding \n     that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of \n     impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent \n     in the process of raising large monetary contributions be \n     eliminated.\n\n  Add to the equation the actual sale of access for a large \ncontribution and you have an even greater ``opportunity for abuse'' and \nthe appearance of corruption.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will confess, this whole question of the appearance of \ncorruption bothers me a very great deal. I do not know that the \ndrafters of the first amendment talked about the appearance of free \nspeech or the appearance of a vigorous political debate. So I ask the \nSenator this question.\n  Hypothetically, if the Senator from Michigan were to meet with the \nhead of the United Auto Workers on a Monday, in advance of casting a \nvote on the union's position on the following Tuesday, and vote in \nfavor of the union's position within 24 hours of that meeting, and then \non the following Wednesday, within another 24 hours, the union made a \nvery large soft money contribution to the Democratic National \nCommittee--in the opinion of the Senator from Michigan, A, would that \nbe the appearance of corruption; and, B, would that be something he \nwould seek to ban in the name of appearance of corruption?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the question assume that I solicited the UAW for that \ncontribution? That was not clear in the question of the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Let us assume the Senator from Michigan did not solicit; \nthat the solicitation came from the Senator from New Jersey in his \nposition--changing it, therefore, from the Democratic National \nCommittee to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the \nsolicitation came from the Senator from New Jersey in his posture as \nchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The fact I had a meeting with anybody within a day or a \nweek or an hour and voted as that person would have urged me to vote is \nnot the appearance of corruption, in my judgment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Nor in mine. But the fact is, there is a chain of \nevents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe in the view of the American people, and it is a \nreasonable view which has been sustained by the Supreme Court: Inherent \nin unlimited campaign contributions, inherent, is an appearance of \nimpropriety which undermines public confidence in our institutions. I \nbelieve the same thing. More important, the American people believe the \nsame thing. The timing of it is not the issue. The issue is that the \nsolicitation of unlimited amounts, huge amounts of contributions, and \nfrequently or very often in exchange for access, is inherently \ninappropriate in a democracy and creates public disrespect and a lack \nof public support for our democratic institutions.\n  That is, No. 1, my own belief very deeply. I believe the American \npeople believe that very deeply. Most important, though, in addition to \nwhat the American people believe, the Supreme Court has directly said \nthat inherent in unlimited contributions is an appearance of \nimpropriety. The Supreme Court has specifically said that in Buckley. \nWhen you put on top of that these kind of sales of access for $50,000 \nand $100,000 to the President or Committee Chairmen around here, you \nhave, it seems to me, made it triply clear what the Supreme Court did \nnot even need to see or find. They did not even look at the access \nissue. That was not even in Buckley. But it sure adds fuel to the fire, \nand that fire is a fire which can burn the institutions of this \nGovernment.\n\n  That is my judgment. Maybe a majority of us do not feel that way. \nBut, again, I challenge my good friend from Utah. I challenge him, take \nhome one of these invitations and try a town meeting; $100,000 for a \nmeeting with the President, $50,000 for a meeting with the Committee \nChairman of your choice. Give it a try at a town meeting. See what they \nthink about it.\n  I think I know what you will find. Maybe not; I don't represent Utah. \nI think you will find they would tell my good friend from Utah that \nthis is wrong. This is wrong. Unlimited huge contributions, buying \naccess--which is frequently the case--is wrong. I happen to agree with \nthem.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Was he aware on Friday Senator Kerrey of Nebraska came to \nthe floor and said:\n\n       I had the experience of going inside the beast in 1996, \n     1997, and 1998, when I was chairman of the Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Committee. I don't want to raise a sore \n     subject for the Senator from Maine. It changed my attitude in \n     two big ways. One, the apparent corruption that exists. \n     People believe there is corruption. If they believe it, it \n     happens. We all understand that. If the perception is it is \n     A, it is A, even though it may not be. And the people believe \n     the system is corrupt.\n\n  The Senator is aware of the statement of the Senator from Nebraska \nyesterday, which I think is a very precise and informed opinion?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Arizona.\n  Madam President, what these soft money contributions allow the \nparties to do is many things, but more and more, pay for ads, TV ads, \nwhich are claimed to be about issues but in reality are ads to help \ncandidates.\n  I want to look at two ads: A Republican ad and a Democratic ad. They \nboth have the same problem.\n  First, Bob Dole's ad. In this TV commercial, Mr. Dole said: ``We have \na moral obligation to give our children in America the opportunity and \nvalues of the Nation that we grew up in.''\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\nThen it talks a lot about Bob Dole and his very strong personal \nqualities. Then it ended by Bob Dole saying, ``It all comes down to \nvalues. What do you believe in? What do you sacrifice? And what do you \nstand for?''\n  That ad was paid for with soft money contributed by the Republican \nNational Committee. It is viewed as permissible under current law \nbecause that ad does not explicitly ask the viewer to vote for or \nsupport Bob Dole. It spends its whole time talking positively about his \ncharacter.\n  If it added four words at the end, which said, ``Vote for Bob Dole,'' \nit would be treated as a candidate ad, not an issue ad, and would be \nsubject to hard money limits. Any reasonable person looking at that ad \nat that particular time in the Presidential season would say: It's not \nan ad about welfare or wasteful spending; it is an ad about why should \nwe elect that particular nominee.\n  Democrats avail themselves of the same loophole.\n  In the 1996 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee \nran ads on welfare and crime and the budget which were basically \ndesigned to support President Clinton's reelection.\n  At our hearings on campaign finance reform, Harold Ickes was asked \nabout these DNC ads and to the extent to which people looking at the \nads would walk away with the message to vote for President Clinton. And \nhere is what Harold Ickes said. And my good friend from Utah, I think, \nis nodding because I think he remembers this.\n  Harold Ickes was asked: Do you think people looking at these ads \nwould walk away from these ads with the message that they should vote \nfor President Clinton? His answer: ``I would certainly hope so. If not, \nwe ought to fire the ad agencies.''\n  Those kinds of ads are paid for with soft money--so-called--\nunregulated, unlimited money. They are not supposed to be candidate \nads.\n  So we should not delude ourselves either about what the American \npeople believe this system is all about, and how it is run, and how it \nsells access for huge contributions. They are not deluded, and we \nshould not be deluded about their feelings about this system. And we \nshould not be deluded about how this money is spent. We should not kid \nourselves.\n  People are arguing that unless we can get the entire original bill \nwhich was introduced by Senators McCain and Feingold, we should simply \nnot accept half a loaf, which is what the revised version does. And my \nanswer to that simply is this: I would prefer the original McCain-\nFeingold bill because I think it is important that we not kid ourselves \nabout issue ads, how they are funded, and what their purpose and intent \nis. But the sponsors of the bill have indicated--and they are very \nhonest, smart people, with tremendous integrity--that we do not have a \nchance of getting the original McCain-Feingold approach passed, that \nour best chance of passing a bill with campaign finance reform in it is \nto try to ban soft money, to close that loophole, to stop parties and \ncandidates from either soliciting, themselves or through their \nemployees, or through their agents, money which is not regulated by \nlaw. And I accept that.\n  I think if that is the best we can get, if that is going to be the \nmost we can accomplish, that would be a significant accomplishment. It \nis not my preference, but it would be a significant accomplishment.\n\n  I would only say this: To a nation that is hungry for reform, a half \na loaf is better than no loaf. I hope that, at a minimum, we will be \nable to achieve that success this year.\n  The only way we will do it, I believe, is that when people --if they \ndo--filibuster against this approach, against the ban on soft money, \nthat those of us who support this reform not withdraw from the field.\n  The civil rights days proved that the only way to get these very \ndifficult reforms achieved is by telling the filibusterers: You have a \nright to filibuster. That is your right, and we'll protect it. But we \ndon't have to withdraw because you are filibustering. With voting \nrights, it took four cloture votes and about 6 weeks before cloture was \nable to be invoked and voting rights passed.\n  I would hope we would act with the same kind of determination as they \ndid in those days and the same kind of passion as the opponents have \nagainst this reform.\n  Finally, I want to close with a tribute to Senators McCain and \nFeingold. I know of no two people in this body who have taken an issue \nas they have and tried as long and as hard as they have to bring this \nto the fore, to bring this to national attention. They are entitled to \nthe thanks of the Nation for what they are doing.\n  I want to end my remarks with a personal thank you to our two good \ncolleagues for the fight that they are waging on this reform. It cannot \nhappen without them, without their integrity, without their \ndetermination. And they have shown it in the past. I am personally very \nmuch in their debt. Much more important, the Nation will always be in \ntheir debt for the fight they have waged and are waging and will wage \nfor campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator be willing to include me in the statement \njust made regarding Senators Feingold and McCain?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Include you in which way? Someone joining me in \ncongratulating and thanking them, or including you as one of the \nreformers? I am happy to do either one.\n  Mr. REID. Including me in underlining and underscoring your support \nfor these two men who have done so much to focus attention on this very \nbadly needed reform.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do.\n  Mr. REID. I just completed a campaign where, in the small State of \nNevada, with less than 2 million people, we don't know how much was \nspent, probably about $23 million on the two candidates.\n  So I certainly, as I had tried to do earlier, direct my attention to \nthe good work they have done. But you said it in a way that I think was \ngraphic. And I want to join your support, if you will allow me.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Nevada, and I think everybody \nwho is supporting this cause thanks him for his support of this effort, \nas well.\n  So, Mr. President, this kind of candidate advertising, which should \nclearly be subject to contribution limits, escapes those limits through \nthe soft money loophole. And it's that soft money loophole that the two \namendments before us would close.\n  Now some of my colleagues argue that if we only close the soft money \nloophole to political parties, the money we cut off to the parties will \nbe redirected to special interest groups. Well if the Daschle amendment \ncould pass, I would prefer it and I've supported similar proposals for \nyears, because it not only stops the soft money loophole to parties, it \nstops the use of sham or phony issue ads by third party organizations. \nBut I also say if all we can do is stop soft money to the parties and \nthat money then goes to outside groups, so be it. Candidates and public \nofficials running for reelection won't be raising it, the parties won't \nbe raising it, and the contributors won't be buying access to us with \nit. This bill would preclude a candidate or office holder from \nsoliciting soft money for private organizations running issue ads. \nUnder this legislation, I couldn't go and solicit money for an outside \ngroup to use for issue ads in some campaign. This bill would bar that. \nWill contributors of these large sums want to buy access to the Sierra \nClub or the National Rifle Association? Perhaps. If so, let them do it. \nWill they be able to buy access to us through these unlimited \ncontributions to third parties? No. If that were to occur, then it \nwould be in direct violation of the law. Under this soft money ban, \npublic officials and candidates will be out of the soft money \nfundraising loop, and that's the important step we'll be taking with \nthis legislation.\n  To a nation hungry for reform, a half of loaf is better than no loaf.\n  Mr. President, we've been here before--trying to pass campaign \nfinance reform, trying to stop the explosion of soft money. The \nquestion is--will it be different this time? 70% of the American people \nwant campaign finance reform. 70% of the American people want us to \nclean up our act. We're the only ones who can do it.\n\n[[Page S12748]]\n\n  The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it.\n  It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility \nfor our share of the blame. Congress alone writes the laws. Congress \nalone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the federal election \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, the Reid amendment closes the biggest loophole in our \ncampaign financing system and it restores that system to what Congress \nintended in the 1970's--that there should be reasonable limits to what \na person can contribute to a candidate, a PAC or a party and that \nunions and corporations should not be allowed to contribute to either \nparties or candidates. It's that simple. We had that system in the \n1970's; it operated pretty well for many years; soft money has torn \napart that system, and the Reid amendment puts it back together.\n  The public is appalled at these huge contributions which buy access \nto candidates and office holders and fund television ads which are for \nall intents and purposes about candidates. As the Supreme Court said in \nBuckley, the appearance of corruption is ``inherent in a system \npermitting unlimited financial contributions.'' And permitting the \nappearance of corruption undermines the very foundation of our \ndemocracy--the trust of the people in the system. We have the right to \nprotect our democratic institutions from being undermined by the open \nsale of access for large contributions which people believe reasonably \ntranslates into influence. And the greater the purchase price, the \ngreater the perception that access yields influence.\n  Mr. President, we can't afford to give Mr. Tamaraz a next time. We've \ngot to stop this practice of selling access now. And the amendment \nbefore us is the way to do it. It is time to enact campaign finance \nreform. That is our legislative responsibility. Otherwise we will be \nhaunted by the words of Roger Tamraz that in the next election he will \ngive $600,000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Voinovich, is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, this legislation before us today has \npresented me a dilemma, and that dilemma is that I have been publicly \nin favor of banning soft money. At the same time, I understand, in my \nState particularly, our labor unions would not be impacted by this \nlegislation, and for all intents and purposes, they are the Democratic \nParty in terms of things a party would do traditionally.\n  I also recognize the fact that we need to raise money for our own \ncampaigns and we need to also support our parties so they can do the \njob a party should be doing in our respective States and nationally. I \nrecall during my campaign for the Senate, I raised my money the hard \nway, hard dollars. But I kept worrying, toward the end of the campaign, \nwhether or not soft money would appear from somewhere and whether or \nnot I would be able to counteract that soft money coming into our \nState. In my particular case, it didn't. I suspect maybe it didn't \nbecause they thought I was going to win.\n  The fact is, I thought about this last weekend. I had intended to \ncome here today and present an amendment that I think would improve the \nMcCain-Feingold piece of legislation. Unfortunately, I understand no \namendments are going to be accepted. I was going to ask that the \nDaschle amendment be laid aside, but I understand such requests have \nbeen objected to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I was going to send to the \ndesk be printed in the Record and I be given a few minutes to explain \nwhat the amendment would have accomplished.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MODIFICATION OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Contribution Limit for Candidates and Political \n     Parties.--Section 315(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``$1,000'' and \n     inserting ``$3,000''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``$20,000'' and \n     inserting ``$25,000''.\n       (b) Aggregate Individual Limit.--Section 315(a)(3) of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(3)), \n     as amended by section 3(b), is amended by striking the first \n     sentence and inserting the following: ``An individual shall \n     not make contributions described in subparagraphs (A) and (C) \n     of paragraph (1) in an aggregate amount in excess of $25,000 \n     during any calendar year.''.\n       (c) Index of Certain Amounts.--Section 315(c) of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441a(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``subsection (b) and \n     subsection (d)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (1) and (3) of \n     subsection (a) and subsections (b) and (d)''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``means the calendar \n     year 1974.'' and inserting ``means--\n       ``(A) in the case of subsections (b) and (d), calendar year \n     1974; and\n       ``(B) in the case of subsection (a), calendar year 1999.''.\n\n     SEC. __. WORKERS' POLITICAL RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 441b) is amended by adding the following:\n       ``(c)(1) Except with the separate, prior, written, \n     voluntary authorization of a stockholder, employee, member, \n     or nonmember, it shall be unlawful--\n       ``(A) for any national bank or corporation described in \n     this section to collect from or assess such stockholder or \n     employee any dues, initiation fee, or other payment as a \n     condition of employment if any part of such dues, fee, or \n     payment will be used for political activities in which the \n     national bank or corporation, as the case may be, is engaged; \n     and\n       ``(B) for any labor organization described in this section \n     to collect from or assess such member or nonmember any dues, \n     initiation fee, or other payment if any part of such dues, \n     fee, or payment will be used for political activities.\n       ``(2) An authorization described in paragraph (1) shall \n     remain in effect until revoked and may be revoked at any \n     time.\n       ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `political \n     activities' includes communications or other activities which \n     involve carrying on propaganda, attempting to influence \n     legislation, or participating or intervening in any political \n     campaign or political party.''.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. My amendment would have leveled the playing field by \nempowering average Americans over special interests in their ability to \nparticipate in the electoral process. I believe the bill before us \ndoesn't do that. I think it further tilts the balance toward a handful \nof powerful individuals, individuals who have the ability to determine \nhow to spend the dues of some 16 million hard-working men and women. I \nam quite surprised we haven't heard more about that.\n  The good thing about this bill is that it will end the enormous \ncorporate donations to political parties, donations that reach into six \nfigures. I was glad the Senator from Michigan made a point of the fact \nthat soft money from corporations does not go only to the Republican \nParty but goes to the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. \nEditorially, I suggest the invitations to join the Democratic National \nCommittee or the Republican Committee, in terms of belonging to the \nclub, regardless of what happens to McCain-Feingold, ought to be \nsomething to which all of us stand up and object.\n  I recall, being Governor of Ohio, I never had a fundraiser in the \nGovernor's residence. I tried not to use my office to take money out of \nthe pockets of people who were encouraged to contribute either to my \ncampaign, someone else's campaign, or to the Republican Party. I hope \nafter this is over, all of us will indicate to our parties that the \ndays of the clubs and the rest of it should be over so that people such \nas Senator Levin can't get up and show the ways people are being asked \nto contribute. I think that is horrible. It sends a bad message to the \nAmerican people. It certainly adds to the cynicism and is one of the \nreasons we have fewer people show up on election day.\n  Unfortunately, a soft money ban without other reforms has the \npotential to severely impact the ability of our parties to continue \ntheir worthwhile activities, including grassroots mobilization and \nparty building. Banning party soft money is an objective I support. \nHowever, I am concerned about the devastating impact it could have on \nthe ability of our national parties to cover operating expenses and \ngrassroots activities.\n  Current contribution limits must be updated. Under current law, an \nindividual can give up to $25,000 per year total in campaign \ncontributions, with a sublimit of $20,000 of that amount to the \nparties. If we ban soft money contributions to the parties without \nadjusting total contribution limits, the parties will have to compete \nwith their own candidates for a limited supply of money.\n  My amendment would fix the problem. It would eliminate soft money and\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\nwould create two separate aggregate limits for yearly hard dollar \ncontributions--I am talking about hard dollar individual \ncontributions--a $25,000 limit to candidates and a $25,000 limit to \nparties. These limits would be indexed to inflation, so once they went \ninto effect, they would go up each year.\n  In addition to creating new aggregate limits, my amendment would \nadjust individual campaign contribution limits. As my colleagues know, \nour current campaign contribution limits are not indexed to inflation; \nthey have remained the same since the law was enacted 25 years ago. \nUnder current law, an individual cannot give more than $1,000 to the \ngeneral election campaign of a particular Federal candidate in a given \nyear. If this limit had been indexed to inflation, it would be \napproximately $3,000 today.\n  Adjusting the individual contribution limits is important for three \nreasons. That is what my amendment would have done. It would have \nincreased it from $1,000 to $3,000, and then it would have indexed it \nup each year.\n  First of all, it would reduce the amount of time candidates spend \nraising money. The people in this country should know about the hours \nand hours candidates running for national office and local office spend \ndialing for dollars. I have already started to raise money for my next \ncampaign for the Senate because I know if I don't spread it out over a \nlong period of time, I will be unable, during my last 2 years in this \nbody, to do the job the people of the State of Ohio have asked me to \ndo. We need to increase that campaign contribution limit.\n  Second, it would level the playing field for candidates competing \nagainst wealthy opponents who are bankrolling their own campaigns. With \nall due respect to many Members of this body, if we keep going the way \nwe are, people such as George Voinovich will not be able to be in the \nSenate because we are seeing more and more campaigns bankrolled by \nindividuals who can win primaries and, once the primary is over, they \ncan put their own money into the campaign. Money does have an impact on \nthe results of an election.\n  Third, it also would relieve the pressure for groups to seek out \nloopholes to circumvent the campaign finance laws. In fact, many \nexperts believe the reason we have the increase in sham issue ads in \nthe past few years is the tightening of the amount individuals can give \nin hard dollars. My amendment would address these concerns by \nincreasing the individual campaign contribution limit from $1,000 to \n$3,000 per election and then adjust it, as I say, each year.\n  Lastly, one of the greatest areas of abuse in the current campaign \nfinance system is the involuntary use of membership dues by union \nleaders for political purposes. In addition to making soft money \ncontributions to parties and engaging in issue advocacy, labor leaders \nalso spend millions of unauthorized dollars each election cycle in \norder to explicitly advocate for labor's preferred candidates among its \nrank and file, a rank and file which is over 16 million. That doesn't \ninclude the millions more that are in their families.\n  These express advocacy activities include phone banks, get-out-the-\nvote drives, newsletters, and scorecards. In my State, the Democratic \nParty does not do it; it is the labor unions that do it. No one, not \neven union members, is exactly sure how much union leaders spend for \nthese campaign activities because this money is unregulated and thus \nsoft. It is all soft money.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, party soft money would be prohibited, just as \nit should be. However, McCain-Feingold would allow this key form of \nunion money to remain entirely unchecked. I just can't understand why \nthose who are promoting McCain-Feingold haven't been willing to take on \nthis particular issue that seems to be put over on the side as not \nbeing something that is very important. It is really important to many \nof us around this country, particularly individuals such as myself who \nhave been the victim of that soft money effort.\n  Union leaders would be allowed to continue spending millions of \ndollars of membership dues to support the candidates of their choice \nand to influence elections, thereby tilting the playing field in favor \nof union-backed candidates.\n  We have heard this over and over again today. According to AFL-CIO \npresident John Sweeney, some $46 million in union funds is going to be \nused to influence this coming election. In the 1996 cycle alone, $30 \nmillion was spent. This $46 million is a 53-percent increase in \nspending from just a few years ago. Think of it, a 53-percent increase \nin the use of union dues for political purposes.\n  McCain-Feingold would not regulate any of that incredible amount of \nmoney--$46 million. That is just for the Federal candidates. It doesn't \ntalk about the money that is going to be used at the State and local \nlevel.\n  I believe an effective and constitutional way to address this issue \nis by requiring union leaders to get written authorization from each of \ntheir members before they use any portion of their dues for political \nactivities.\n  I heard earlier about the codification of the Beck decision. While \nthe Beck codification contained in McCain-Feingold bill is a step in \nthe right direction, it would only protect a very small group of \npeople: dues-paying, nonmembers in non-right-to-work States. However, \nno one should be compelled to give campaign contributions without \nexplicit approval.\n  I do not come from a right-to-work State. I have people in my State \nwho, in order to get a job, must join the union. Many of those \nindividuals complain to me that they have no control over how their \nunion dollars are being spent. I think those individuals, those hard-\nworking men and women, ought to have the opportunity to say whether or \nnot they want their union dues to be used for political purposes. I \ncan't help but believe that, if they did that, it would not be the \ngreat problem some think it would be. But it would cause the unions to \ngo out and really get their people involved and let them make their own \ndecision as to whether or not they want their dues to be used for \npolitical purposes.\n  My amendment would give them the right to know where their hard-\nearned dollars are being spent. Unfortunately, I have been denied the \nopportunity to offer that amendment.\n  The proponents of this bill have utilized parliamentary tactics \ndesigned to tie up the Senate without any meaningful discussion of some \nof these alternatives. That is their right. However, if we don't have a \nfull discussion of this bill--with the ability to amend and make the \nbill stronger--the proponents of this legislation should not expect \nSenators to support its passage.\n  We can debate this bill, amend this bill, and pass this bill in the \nhope we can get some real change in our current campaign finance \nsystem. Unfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues--and we \nsee this a lot in this body--are interested in scoring political \npoints. This is a problem, and I respect those who have tried to do \nsomething about it. But, from my perspective, if we don't allow working \nmen and women who belong to labor unions, the opportunity to decide how \ntheir union dollars should be spent, this bill is flawed to the extent \nthat I would vote against it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, as Congress considers various plans to \noverhaul the current campaign finance system, I think everyone can \nagree on one fact: the status quo is indefensible. The system needs to \nchange in order to restore the American people's faith in their \ngovernment.\n  The imbalances which exist in our election laws today were created by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act in the name of equality. They \nresulted in unfair advantages which are institutionalized in the name \nof fairness, protecting some forms of political speech while \ncriminalizing others. Enacting more laws along the same lines will only \nlead us further down the path of destruction. Freedom matters. Freedom \nworks. Free speech works. Free participation works. The current system \ndoes not. If we want real reform, we will scrap this bill, repeal \ncurrent law, and start over.\n  Campaign finance reformers think the solution is new regulations and \nmethods that I believe work only to preclude participation in politics. \nThey believe that new laws, more restrictions, and additional \nbureaucracy are the answer. This position is based upon the assumption \nthat current laws are working and they just need a few modifications to \nmake them better. I\n\n[[Page S12750]]\n\nstrongly disagree. Freedom of expression is an end in itself and can \nnot be subordinated to any other goals of society. Information is the \nbackbone to freedom, ignorance is the backbone to oppression.\n  Reformers tolerate these inequalities because they believe they will \nresult in lower-cost elections, less influence in the process by \nspecial interests, and will make the electoral system more accessible \nto challengers. Even if these goals could be achieved in this way, the \ntrampling of the First Amendment in the process is unacceptable.\n  The fact is, current laws do not work. Let's admit that. We wouldn't \nbe debating this issue if they did. They were passed in haste, as a \nknee-jerk reaction to the Watergate era, and while they were enacted \nwith good intentions, their result has been a disaster. We should \nrecognize that a mistake was made when the Federal Election Campaign \nAct was enacted, and no modifications to this law will improve the \nsystem.\n  Campaign finance laws restricting free speech should be repealed, and \nthe absolute freedom to engage in the political process should be \npromoted and defended. The American people should know that their \nparticipation is encouraged, respected, and welcome. If that \nparticipation includes fully disclosed contributions to candidates and \nparties, so be it. Disclosure is the key factor here. Let's give the \nAmerican people some credit. They are smart enough to judge for \nthemselves where conflicts of interest lie. They do not need the \nbureaucracy of the Federal Elections Commission to police their speech \nand thwart their involvement. The only job of the FEC should be the \nposting and reporting of all contributions in a timely manner so that \nthe American people can judge for themselves. Current law is an insult \nto the intelligence of the American people.\n  Soft money is perceived as a loophole in current law. Banning soft \nmoney is only one more step toward the elimination of free speech in \nelections. The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not a \nloophole. It is a fundamental freedom that protects, among other \nthings, political speech. Again, let Americans decide whether and to \nwhat extent they want to participate.\n\n  We should be protecting freedom of speech over everything else. We \nshould not enact legislation to preclude the public from voicing their \nopinions on the work we do here. We may not like what is said about us, \nbut we can all agree that people have a right to speak their mind, \nespecially their political mind.\n  This bill also recognizes that current law does not protect working \nAmericans' ability to decide which causes they will support. While this \nbill codifies the Beck decision which enables non-union workers to \nrequest a refund for the portion of their union fees used for political \ncauses. If it does not address the concerns of union members who are \nforced to participate in political causes without their consent.\n  No American should be faced with the direct or indirect threat of \nlosing their job because of their political beliefs. No one should be \nforced to participate in advocating for a cause or causes they find \nrepugnant. The rights of individuals to be free certainly extends to \ntheir political beliefs and the way in which they choose to participate \nor not to participate. No forced participation under any guise should \nbe tolerated or encouraged. Let individuals make choices for \nthemselves. That is the most fundamental freedom in a democracy.\n  A vibrant democracy depends on the ability of all voices to be heard, \nand how loudly one may wish to speak should be limited only by that \nindividual, not by government. If an individual can and is willing to \nexpend over $1,000 in support of a candidate, they should be able to do \nso. If they wish to express their support with their time or in any \nother fashion, then this, too, should be applauded and encouraged. And \nif individuals wish to ignore the political process altogether, then \nthis, too, is a right to be defended. To tinker with this fundamental \nright gives power to some at the expense of others.\n  Finally, I would submit, that we need to re-examine our attitude \ntoward money in the electoral process, and I would propose that \nspending money to communicate one's message is not the root of all evil \nin politics. Candidates for public office have the important task of \ngetting their message out to the voters. In statewide races across the \ncountry, candidates must spend substantial amounts of money for print \nand electronic media, since it is the best current method of reaching \nthe maximum audience.\n  Take a moment and think about the power of the media today--\ntelevision, newspapers and radio frame the debates of important issues. \nA candidate must be able to raise enough money to get his or her \nmessage out to the public.\n  When I was campaigning for my Senate seat back in 1988, I faced \nenormous opposition from the newspapers. Newspapers have vast resources \nto openly campaign for a candidate. Had I not had the freedom and \nability to counter their message, I would not be a Senator today.\n  True reform will not strip candidates, parties, or individuals of \ntheir ability to counter the messages in the media. True reform should \nrecognize the imbalance current law has created, and would seek to \nlevel the playing field between candidates and the media. Remember, the \nFirst Amendment protects freedom of the press, but it also protects the \nfreedom of individuals to speak loud and clear.\n  Madam President, I believe in the First Amendment. Protecting that \nright must be our primary goal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is unfortunate that the procedural \nstructure that has been erected stands in the way of moving forward on \nsignificant and thoughtful reform to our campaign finance laws. I would \nlike to have the opportunity to debate and vote on some of those \nreforms, particularly the measure offered by Senator Hagel, but we are \nprecluded from doing so. Today, I want to speak about campaign finance \nreform legislation I introduced earlier this year and about an \namendment I am prepared to offer.\n  This past May I introduced the Constitution and Effective Reform of \nCampaigns Act of CERCA, which I first introduced during the 105th \nCongress. This legislation is the product of 2 years of hearings during \nmy chairmanship of the Rules Committee, discussions with numerous \nexperts, party officials, and candidates, and nearly two decades of \nparticipating in campaigns and campaign finances debates in the Senate.\n  I view my legislation as an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is \na good faith effort to strike middle ground between those who believe \npublic financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe \nthe solution is to remove current regulations. If offers a package of \nproposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support \nand meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our \npresent system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed \nwith any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all \nprovisions had to be consistent with the first amendment: Congress \nwould be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a \nlikelihood of being struck down by the Federal courts.\n  Second, I oppose public financing and mandating ``free'' or reduced-\ncost media time which in my mind is neither free nor a good policy \nidea. Why should seekers of Federal office get free time, while \ncandidates for State office or local office--from governors to local \nsheriffs--do not receive comparable free benefits? Such an inquity and \nimbalance will breed friction between Federal and State office seekers.\n  Third, I believe we should try to increase the role of citizens and \nthe political parties.\n  Fourth, any framwork of campaign reform legislation must respect and \nprotect the constitutional right of individuals, groups, and \norganization to participate in advocacy concerning political issues.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill has been debated thoroughly in the Senate, \nand any objective observer of the Senate would agree that we are \ngenuinely deadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of \nMcCain-Fiengold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an \nobjective and pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign \nsystem. I commend other Members for coming forward, as I have,\n\n[[Page S12751]]\n\nwith proposals which objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what \ncan be achieved.\n  Several of the issues addressed in my legislation have been raised by \nother Members in the context of this debate. Amendments have been \nproposed on foreign soft money, increasing the hard dollar contribution \nlimits, and disclosure of last-minute expenditures, among others.\n  My focus today is how can we expand participation in the political \nprocess--both by voters and by potential candidates. I hope that any \nreform carries with it the opportunity for more small contributors to \nparticipate in the political process. And, I hope that reform will \nbring more candidates into the arena.\n  To this end, I want to focus on two reforms contained in my original \nlegislation. First, we need to ensure that the average voter can, and \nwill, contribute to the candidate of their choice. The influence of \nvoters on campaigns has been diminished by the activities of political \naction committees and interest groups. Therefore, I propose a $100 tax \ncredit for contributions made by citizens, with incomes under specified \nlevels, to Senate and House candidates in their states. This credit \nshould spark an influx of small dollar contributions to balance the \ngreater ability of citizens with higher incomes to participate. In \naddition, the increased individual contribution limit, as proposed by \nothers, should balance the activities of political action committees.\n  Second, we need to remove barriers to challengers. Compared to \nincumbents, challengers face greater difficulties raising funds and \ncommunicating with voters, particularly at the outset of a campaign. My \nsolution is to allow candidates to receive ``seed money'' contributions \nof up to $10,000 from individuals and political action committees.\n  This provision should help get candidacies off the ground. The total \namount of these ``seed money'' contributions could not exceed $100,000 \nfor House candidates or $300,000 for Senate candidates. To meet the \nconstitutional test, this provision would apply to both challengers and \nincumbents alike, but in the case of an incumbent with money carried \nover from a prior cycle, those funds would count against the seed money \nlimit. In addition, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the \nfranking privilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, \nrather than the 60-day ban in current law.\n  But elective office should not be for sale. Campaigns should be \ncompetitive. Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage \nthrough their constitutional right to spend their own funds. Therefore, \nif a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own money, the \nindividual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so that \ncandidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. Again, \nto meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all \ncandidates.\n  Mr. President, if we can do these two things--enhance citizen \ninvolvement, and level the playing field for condidates--we will have \nmade significant progress. Again, I hope the Senate will have the \nopportunity to address these issues. I was prepared to offer my \namendment and I hope I will have the opportunity to do so.\n  These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan \nfashion. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nmeaningful campaign reform, by looking at creative solutions to address \nthe real problems with our present campaign system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill summary and the \ntext of my amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Amendment No. --\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, I rise today in support of meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. It is high time that this Congress act to \nimprove our political process and to restore faith in our democracy. In \nfact, it is past time.\n  When I was elected by the people of my State in 1992, one of the key \nthings they asked me to do was to help fix our campaign finance system. \nI have been part of the reform effort since I walked through these \ndoors.\n  Well, here it is, 7 years later. And it's the same old story. \nCampaigns still cost too much money. And too often, the power of ideas \nis pushed aside by the power of money. That is not the way our system \nshould work. We need to do all we can to show the American people that \ntheir voices count--and to provide that their voices will be heard over \nthe roar of special interest money.\n  Overall, I do think we have made some positive changes in the way the \nCapitol operates since my election. I do think we have addressed some \nof the issues families care about. But our campaign finance system \nstill undermines our best efforts--draining public interest in our \npolitical process and sapping the energy from American voters in ways \nthat will affect our democracy for years to come.\n  The opponents say the public doesn't care about campaign finance \nreform. But, in fact, the role of money in our elections and the rise \nof special interest influence have a profound--and very negative--\neffect on public perception of politics. Many people believe that \nMembers of Congress are controlled by special interests and wealthy \ndonors--and are no longer listening to their concerns. It keeps them \nfrom voting and from participating in the decisions that affect their \nlives.\n  We are here to represent the people of our States. As a \nrepresentative of working Americans, I have felt from the beginning \nthat it is my duty to ensure their voices and concerns are heard loudly \nand clearly in the political process. If my constituents believe they \naren't being heard and that is partially due to the influence of \nspecial interests, then I must do something about it. This legislation \nis an opportunity to act.\n  I think this legislation could go further, for example, in the way it \ntreats types of advocacy. Express advocacy is designed to get the \npublic to vote for or against a specific candidate. For that reason, \nexpress advocacy is regulated. There is another type of advocacy that \nis not regulated. It's called ``issue advocacy.'' Issue advocacy \ncampaigns were intended to allow groups and individuals to communicate \ntheir support or opposition to particular policy issues. Unfortunately, \nthese activities have become organized campaigns run by partisan groups \nto influence the election or defeat of a particular candidate. At a \nminimum, the public has a right to know who is funding these so-called \n``independent expenditures'' by requiring the producers of these \ncampaigns to disclose their contributors. A earlier version of this \nbill would have made issue advocacy subject to similar restrictions as \nexpress advocacy. That is one of the improvements I would like to see \nas we go through the amendment process.\n  But there are other amendments that would weaken the bill's \nprovisions and could kill this legislation. One is the so-called \nPaycheck Protection Act. It is a poison pill to kill true campaign \nfinance reform. This provision would defund unions by setting up \nbarriers to their obtaining union dues to spend on political \nactivities. However, the Republican Paycheck Protection Act misses the \ntarget. Despite the rhetoric, no worker is ever forced to join a union \nor pay for political and legislative activities with which he or she \ndoes not agree. Never. But the vast majority of unions--and their \nsupporters--believe their voices are critical to a strong healthy \neconomy and to strong, healthy families. And I agree with them.\n  I am not optimistic about this process. We have some very determined \nfoes who oppose any attempt at reform. While we have 100 percent of the \nDemocratic caucus and a handful of brave Republicans, it appears we do \nnot have 60 votes to stop a filibuster against reform. This makes me \nunhappy, but not willing to give up.\n  I will continue to participate in the coalition of those Senators \npushing for reform. I will keep my commitment to bring public faith \nback into our political system and to return political power to our \ncitizens. And I will anxiously await the day when 60 of my Senate \ncolleagues agree with the American people that now is the time for \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, last Thursday, I listened aghast to the \nexchanges among Senators McCain, Bennett, Feingold, McConnell, and \nGorton concerning the implication that an appropriation was provided to \na project in my home in exchange for campaign money.\n  While my junior colleague from Utah made the case commendably, I do \nfeel compelled to respond for myself since I have actively sought and \npromoted these appropriations for my State.\n  The Senator from Arizona seems to have confused representation with \ncorruption.\n  Since when does standing up for one's State, its local governments, \nor its people constitute corruption?\n  I was under the impression that this is what we were sent here to do.\n  The Senator from Arizona is way out of line when he suggests that my \ncolleague, Senator Bennett, has done even one thing even remotely \nimproper in advocating for our State and for the help necessary to host \nthe 2002 Winter Olympic Games. He should include me in that accusation \nas well.\n  My definition of ``pork'' is an appropriation that is unjustified \n(i.e., unneeded), not meritorious (i.e., the proposal is poorly \nconceived or too expensive), or it is solely to benefit the entity \nreceiving the appropriation. The project that the Senator has labeled \nas ``pork'' is none of those things.\n  First, Salt Lake City was America's choice to host the Olympic games. \nThese are America's games. There are certain things we are going to \nneed help with and that can appropriately be done by the federal \ngovernment.\n  The so-called pork barrel project he has cited was for Ogden, UT, for \nwater, sewer, and storm water improvements. The Senator from Arizona \nhas intimated on his website that this project received appropriated \nfunds because members of the Senate--and I presume he means me and \nSenator Bennett--have been improperly influenced by soft money.\n  I wonder if my colleague has actually thought about that. Does he \nreally believe that Ogden, UT, is so tremendously wealthy that it can \nmake campaign contributions or that its citizens would even countenance \nsuch a thing to achieve this project grant? Does the Senator from \nArizona hear how ridiculous this sounds?\n  I have thought, while listening to the Senator's remarks, that we \nhave been debating that old question about the tree falling in the \nforest. If a dollar flows into a campaign chest, but no one takes any \naction in relation to it, does that make it corrupt? Is acceptance of \nany campaign contribution de facto corrupt? That certainly seems to be \nwhat Senator McCain is saying.\n  I was stunned by the personal nature of the Senator's remarks last \nweek, particularly as regards my colleague Senator Bennett, and most \nparticularly since Senator McCain could not\n\n[[Page S12754]]\n\nseem to cite any specific evidence that this line item for sewer \nimprovements was included as a payoff for a soft money--or hard money \nfor that matter--contribution.\n  No, the best he could do is to say that the appropriation was not \nauthorized.\n  I am the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--it is an authorizing \ncommittee. And, I can't tell you the number of times I have debated \njurisdiction with the Senator from Arizona. I am well aware of how \nstrongly he feels about the authorization process. I agree with him on \nthat.\n  But give me a break. The Judiciary Committee is not going to \nauthorize every individual grant to a law enforcement agency. I can't \nbelieve the Senator wants to authorize $2 million for water, sewer, and \nstorm water improvements in Ogden, UT.\n  And, I suspect that, if he were to be a spectator at the Olympic \ndownhill in 2002, and he needed to use the restroom, he would \nappreciate those sewer improvements.\n  Moreover, the authorization process is not the good housekeeping \nstamp of approval. If campaign contributions can taint the \nappropriations process, they can also taint the authorization process. \nThe logic of the Senator from Arizona is false on this point.\n  I will second the remarks made by Senator McConnell with respect to \nthe tenor of this debate. One would have hoped that we could debate our \nrespective ideas about campaign finance reform without getting into \naccusing one another of soft money-for-pork deals.\n  But, I hope my colleagues will listen carefully when the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Wisconsin attempt to smooth things over by \nsaying, ``we're not accusing you; it's the system.''\n  If these colleagues are not accusing us, then why do we need this \nbill? If members have not engaged in abuses--then this bill has no \nbasis.\n  When I was a youngster I remember being terribly irritated when the \nteacher made the whole class stay after school because a couple of my \nclassmates misbehaved. I remember too that sometimes the punishment was \nthat the rules governing library privileges or playground activity \nbecame stricter because certain classmates broke the old ones.\n  Today, our Government reacts much the same way when there have been \nabuses of freedome--we want to legislate a means of prevention. We want \nto tighten up the rules.\n  Because the people are justifiably outraged at abuses, particularly \nat breaches of their trust, we feel compelled to respond.\n  We think if we rail loudly in sympathy with their outrage and \nintroduce bills to address the cause of it, the people will think we \nare above it and have nothing to do with the dirty business. But, me \nthinks some doth protest too much. (So there will be no \nmisunderstanding, I refer here to the Clinton administration which has \nyet to sanction the appointment of an independent counsel to \ninvestigate the alleged campaign finance violations involving \ncontributions to the Democratic National Committee.)\n  At the end of the day, the people will not be fooled. While there is \nno doubt in my mind that those who favor the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation do so with the purest of motives, and I respect their \nviews, I believe that what the people really want is not new law, but \nhonest politicians. And, that, I say to my colleagues, cannot be \nlegislated.\n  Moreover, to the extent that there have been abuses of campaign \nintegrity, let alone existing law, the problem is not the lack of \nregulation, but the violation of it. Our efforts might be better spent \nin toughening both public and private oversight, enforcement, and \npenalties on the offenders.\n  But, we are instead debating legislation that would impose \nsignificant new regulations on the way we undertake the most \nfundamental of all American freedoms--elections for public office.\n  What on earth are we doing? Why are we even contemplating such \nsweeping changes--changes that would inevitably dampen free speech in \nour country? Changes that would damage the ``checks and balances'' that \nare inherent in our two-party system?\n  Well, in light of recent abuses of freedom in campaign fundraising \nand in light of what we politicians perceive to be mounting \ndissatisfaction among the electorate, we are debating a proposal for a \nnew law.\n  That'll fix it. We will all put out our press releases. We will \ncongratulate each other on our so-called ``reform'' legislation. And, \nif it's a ``reform'' bill, it must be good, right?\n  With all due respect to my colleagues Senators McCain and Feingold, \nwho have been working on this legislation for a long time and who I \nknow are sincerely dedicated to improving our campaign process, I must \nsay that, if we pass their bill, we will deliver broad-based reforms \nwhich we perceive to be popular at the moment. But, we will also be \nfundamentally changing the relationship between those running for \npublic office and those who elect them for the long term. We will be \nimposing significantly more regulation governing who can give what to \nwhom as well as how support can be given and how it can be received.\n  Let me comment briefly on this relationship. We all understand it--or \nwe should.\n  When we throw our hats in the ring for public office, we do so \nbecause we believe we have ideas and a point of view that would benefit \nour home state constituents and our country. And, I think it is safe to \nsay that we don't do it for the money--and we have pretty well \n``deperked'' this place as well.\n  But, our success depends on the support of others. Our candidacies \nall began in someone's office or living room. There may have been 3, 5, \n10, 15 people in the room. The first order of business was to get our \nviews and ideas before the people with the hope that our platform would \nappeal to enough people that they would join our bandwagon.\n  How do you grow a campaign? First, people have to know who you are. \nSo, you print some posters and campaign buttons. I might add that when \nI first ran in 1976, having never held public office before and running \nagainst a 3-term incumbent senator, I needed a lot of signs.\n  Then, since you can't really get much substantive information on a \nyard sign or button, you need some brochures. You need to put out some \npress releases. You need to buy some TV and radio advertising.\n  Assuming you get some positive response from the people to your \nviews, you will need to hire some staff to organize volunteer efforts \nand precincts. Later on, you will need to have some phone banks and a \nget-out-the-vote program.\n  All of this requires money--that people who believe in your candidacy \ndonate to your campaign. This is not money that is taxed and \napportioned by some governmental entity. It is money voluntarily given \nbecause, in giving it, people are expressing their preferences for \nthose who will represent them. It could be one dollar or a thousand \ndollars, but the act of contributing to a candidate for public office \nis an exercise of political freedom.\n  Now, the McCain-Feingold bill, for all of its good intentions, fails \nthis crucial test: it imposes new restrictions on how people can \nparticipate financially in campaigns.\n  Previous incarnations of the McCain-Feingold bill would have outlawed \nall soft money contributions and issue advocacy by special interest \ngroups.\n  The argument goes that sophisticated organizations are manipulating \ncandidates and elections by donating large amounts of money. And, the \nargument goes further that this manipulation is poisoning the political \nprocess for all citizens.\n  So-called coffees at the White House, nights in the Lincoln Bedroom, \nreceptions at Buddhist temples, fundraising from taxpayer-maintained \nterritory, specious connections to foreign governments--that is what \nhas affected people's faith in the electoral process. It isn't the \ndirect mail letter, the cocktail reception, or the $10 per person \nsummer weinie roast. People are pretty savvy. They know we have to \nraise the money to run, and they know it's not cheap.\n  But, this year, Senators McCain and Feingold have apparently accepted \nthat their proposed ban was blatantly unconstitutional. They have opted \nfor a half-ban--a ban on soft money contributions from political \nparties, but not on non-party organizations.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: political parties are already \nregulated by\n\n[[Page S12755]]\n\nlaw and regulation. These contributions and expenditures are already \ncontrolled. The Republican or Democratic National Committees cannot so \nmuch as buy a legal pad with 100 percent soft money.\n  This ban on party soft money merely elevates the importance of \nspecial interest soft money, which Senators McCain and Feingold have \ndeclared to be society's biggest evil. The League of Women Voters, \nwhich previously supported the McCain-Feingold bill, has now asked \nSenators to oppose it because it not only fails to correct the problem \nof soft money influence as they see it, but exacerbates it.\n  Additionally, this half-ban on soft money from political parties and \nits concomitant increase in the importance of special interest groups, \nserves to weaken our political parties.\n  I recognize that many Americans are frustrated with both parties--\nand, I admit, often for good reason. But, the fact is that a strong \ntwo-party system is what keeps American government working. Nations \nwith multiparty systems often have extreme difficulty finding consensus \nand are plagued with frequent reversals in ministerial leadership, \nnational policy, and unstable markets given political uncertainty.\n  The American two-party system is a healthy competition of ideas and \nviewpoints. And, national parties should not be curtailed in their \nefforts to build their state and local infrastructures and to support \ntheir slates of candidates.\n  A ban on the ability of national parties to send money to state and \nlocal parties and to candidates is like telling a major league baseball \nteam that it cannot support its farm teams or give a bonus to its \npromising players.\n  Last, but certainly not least, the revised McCain-Feingold bill \nremains constitutionally specious.\n  Despite the sponsors recognition that the ban on all soft money \nviolated free speech rights under the Supreme Court's decision ion \nBuckley v. Valeo, the half-ban still skates on very thin ice.\n  The Court stated:\n\n       The First Amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution, it is not the government but the \n     people--individually as citizens and collectively as \n     associations and political committees--who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.\n\n  But, the bottomline for today is that, quite simply, political \nparties are entitled to promote their views. The McCain-Feingold bill \nwould compromise that right.\n  Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts, balanced budgets, and health \ncare have all been the subject of issue advertising. And, neither \nRepublicans nor Democrats should be ``gagged'' by the provisions of \nthis bill. Since a political party exists to promote a particular \nviewpoint or philosophy of government, the McCain-Feingold proposal \nquite simply infringes on its right to do so.\n  But, unlike my school teacher's withholding recess, the McCain-\nFeingold proposal is not a simple trade-off of privileges for \naccountability. It asks Americans to exchange a fundamental freedom, \nwhich is coveted throughout the world, for the vague promise of \ncurtailing the influence of special interests in elections.\n  But, here again, the McCain-Feingold proposal misses the mark. Who \nare the special interests? I submit that the ``special interests are \nus.''\n  One man's greedy special interest is another man's organization \nstanding up for truth and the American way. It is impossible for this \nCongress--or any Congress--to make this distinction.\n  The prohibition on party soft money suggested by the McCain-Feingold \nbill does not even allow the people to exercise their own judgments \nabout the propriety of an expenditure or even about the candidates or \nthe issue. It simply outlaws soft money activity out of hand.\n\n  Some have said to me, ``But this is a bipartisan bill. It is a good \ncompromise.'' My response must be that just because a measure is \nbipartisan and called ``reform'' does not make it good.\n  Moreover, I remind my colleagues that the original plaintiffs in this \nsuit included James Buckley, the conservative Senator from New York and \nEugene McCarthy, liberal former Senator from Minnesota.\n  The diverse coalition of groups who have led the opposition to \nprevious versions of McCain-Feingold include the National Right to Life \nCommittee and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n  In my view, Mr. President, this is not campaign finance reform. No \nlegislation, certainly nothing called ``reform,'' should leave the \npeople with less freedom.\n  Let's look at this issue.\n  Many pundits and many colleagues here in Congress perceive that the \nAmerican people think that our government has become too fraught with \nspecial interest influence, bought with special interest campaign \ncontributions. We have all heard voters voice their frustrations about \ngovernment. Given some of the games we play up here that affect \nnecessary legislation--such as the bankruptcy bill to name just one \nexample--this attitude is not surprising or unwarranted.\n  It may be a mistake to interpret these frustrations as widespread \ncynicism about the influence of special interests rather than about the \ngovernment's inability to enact tax relief, inertia on long-term Social \nSecurity and Medicare reforms, and the tug-of-war on budget and \nappropriations.\n  Nevertheless, it goes without saying that maintaining the integrity \nof our election system and citizens' confidence in it has to be among \nour highest priorities. The question is: what is the right reform?\n  The best way to reform our campaign finance system is to open it up \nto the light of day and to allow citizens to make the judgments about \nhow much influence is too much.\n  For example, some people may believe that a single dollar from a \ntobacco PAC, an environmental lobby, or the AFL-CIO is too much. For \nothers, such contributions may not be as much of a concern.\n  Under a system of more prompt, user-friendly disclosure, people can \ncompare the source of contributions with votes cast by the candidate. \nThey can decide for themselves which donations are rewards for \nfaithfulness to a principle and representation of constituents and \nwhich contributions might be a quid pro quo for special favors.\n  I had planned to offer a substitute amendment to S. 1593. I called my \nproposal the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act.'' It would require all \ncandidates and political committees to disclose every contribution they \nreceive and every expenditure they make over $200 within 14 days on a \npublicly accessible website. This means people will not have to wade \nthrough FEC bureaucracy to get this information, and the information \nwill be continuously updated.\n  Further, my proposal would encourage--not require--non-party \norganizations to disclose expenditures in a constitutionally acceptable \nmanner the funds that they devote to political activity. Organizations \nthat chose to file voluntary reports with the FEC would make individual \ndonors to their PACs eligible for a tax deduction of up to $100.\n  This provision is designed to encourage voluntary disclosure of \nexpenditures of organizational soft money. Those organizations that did \nso would be shedding light on campaign finance not because they have \nto, but because it furthers the cause of an informed democracy.\n  An article in the Investor's Business Daily quoted John Ferejohn of \nStanford University as writing that ``nothing strikes the student of \npublic opinion and democracy more forcefully than the paucity of \ninformation most people possess about politics.''\n  The article goes on to suggest that ``many reforms, far from helping, \nwould cut the flow of political information to an already ill-informed \npublic.''\n  Citing a study by Stephen Ansolabehere of MIT and Shanto Iyengar of \nUCLA, which demonstrates that political advertising ``enlightens \nvoters,'' the IBD concludes that ``well-informed voters are the key to \na well-functioning democracy.'' [Investor's Business Daily; 9/20/99]\n  Morton Kondracke editorializes in the July 30, 1999, Washington \nTimes, ``Full disclosure would be valuable on its merits--letting \nvoters know exactly who is paying for what in election campaigns. Right \nnow, campaign money is going increasingly underground.''\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\n  This is precisely the issue my amendment addresses. My amendment, \nrather than prohibit the American people from having certain \ninformation produced by political parties, it would open up information \nabout campaign finance. Knowledge is power. My proposal is predicated \non giving the people more power.\n  Additionally, my legislation will raise the limits on individual \nparticipation in elections. Special interest PACs sprung up as a \nresponse to the limitations on individual participation in elections. \nThe contribution limit for individuals is $1000 and it has not been \nadjusted since it was enacted in 1974.\n\n  Why are these limits problematic? The answer is that if a candidate \ncan raise $5000 in one phone call to a PAC, why make 5 phone calls \nhoping to raise the same amount from individuals? My legislation \nproposes to make individuals at least as important as PACs.\n  My bill also raises the 25-year-old limits on donations to parties \nand PACs. It raises the current limits on what both individuals and \nPACs can give to political parties.\n  As the League of Women Voters has correctly pointed out, the \nactivities of political parties are already regulated, whereas the \npolitical activities of other organizations are not. If we are \nconcerned about the influence of ``soft'' money--that is, money in \ncampaigns that is not regulated and not disclosed--and cannot be \nregulated or subject to disclosure under our Constitution--then we \nought to encourage--not punish--greater political participation through \nour party structures.\n  We need to put individuals back as equal players in the campaign \nfinance arena. Special interests--both PACs and soft money--have become \nimportant in large part because current law limits are not only a \nquarter century old, but are also higher for special interests than \nindividuals.\n  The McCain-Feingold approach represents a constitutionally specious \nbarrier to free speech. It would, by law, prohibit political parties \nfrom using soft money to communicate with voters.\n  My amendment, in contrast, does not prohibit anything. It does not \nrestrict the flow of information to citizens--it does not restrict \nfreedom. On the contrary, my amendment recognizes that citizens are the \nultimate arbiters in elections. They should have access to as much \ninformation as possible about the candidates and the positions they \nrepresent.\n  Thus far, the information that is available to voters about campaign \nfinance has been difficult to obtain and untimely. My amendment, by \nempowering votes with this information, will put the role of special \ninterests where it rightfully belongs--in the eye of the beholder, not \nthe federal government.\n  I regret very much that Senator Daschle has elected to use this \nparliamentary tactic--filling the amendment tree and objecting to \nconsideration of other amendments--to foreclose all other amendments. \nHe has put the Senate in a take-it-or-leave-it situation.\n  Some of us had ideas for amendments to the McCain-Feingold bill--or, \nsuch as the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act,'' a proposal for a complete \nsubstitute. The opportunity for amendments, however, has been scuttled.\n  The proponents evidently believe they have done such a marvelous job \nthat they refused to consider any other amendment when Senator \nMcConnell asked consent to do so last Friday.\n  The proponents of McCain-Feingold will no doubt hit the airwaves and \nsay that the opponents do not support reform. They will say that we \nvoted to keep the status quo, that we support the so-called insidious \ncorruption of soft money.\n  These would be false statements. Many of us do support reform--we \nsimply want it to be fair and respectful of constitutional protections.\n  There is no righteousness whatsoever in voting for a reform bill that \nlimits freedom.\n  I would have liked to offer my proposal. I would have liked the \nSenate to consider the merits of its approach.\n  But, inasmuch as I will not be able to do that, and other senators \nwho may have supported my alternative will not be able to vote for it, \nwe are left with the Reid amendment, which does not even contain the \namendments offered by the Senator from Kentucky to beef up internal \nprocedures for accountability.\n  We are left with an unamended, constitutionally flawed piece of \nlegislation that has the effect of further bureaucratizing our \nelectoral processes and gagging our two most prominent political \norganizations, thus shielding the people from information as if they \nare incapable of making evaluations on their own.\n  If this is ``reform,'' it is not reform worthy of support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend yield for a moment for me to make a \ncomment to the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Ohio. I listened carefully to \nhis remarks. He accurately pointed out that labor unions are the only \norganizations in America that can raise political funds and spend them \non whatever they choose to without the consent of the donor, which is \nan aberration. Everybody else in the political system has to raise \nmoney from voluntary donations. They have to ask for it. I thank my \nfriend for pointing out that there really can't be any campaign finance \nreform that is meaningful without addressing this extraordinary abuse. \nI appreciate very much his comments on this debate.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. While I am in this \nbody, I am going to continue to try to work with other people to see if \nwe can't come up with something to ban soft money and deal with some of \nthe problems I discussed, which would have been in my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2306 To Amendment No. 2298\n\n    (Purpose: To allow a State to enact voluntary public financing \nlegislation regarding the election of Federal candidates in such State)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2306 to amendment No. 2298.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the language proposed to be stricken, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . STATE PROVIDED VOLUNTARY PUBLIC FINANCING.\n\n       Section 403 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 453) is amended by adding at the end the following: \n     ``The preceding sentence shall not be interpreted to prohibit \n     a State from enacting a voluntary public financing system \n     which applies to a candidate for election to Federal office, \n     other than the office of President or Vice-President, from \n     such State who agrees to limit acceptance of contributions, \n     use of personal funds, and the making of expenditures in \n     connection with the election in exchange for full or partial \n     public financing from a State fund with respect to the \n     election, except that such system shall not allow any person \n     to take any action in violation of the provisions of this \n     Act.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield for an \ninquiry?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't yield the floor, but I will yield for an \ninquiry.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My inquiry is this: Is the Senator from Kentucky \ncorrect that this amendment is offered to what we call around here the \nother side of the tree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator from Kentucky also correct that if \ncloture were invoked on either of the cloture motions tomorrow, this \namendment would be wiped out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that the \namendment would not fall if it is germane.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Germane, postcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S12757]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first of all, let me say to my \ncolleagues that I wanted to bring this amendment to the floor because I \nthought we should get on with business and have up-or-down votes on \namendments that deal with this, I think, critically important question.\n  Let me start out with some context. This is an editorial from the New \nYork Times, which actually was written Tuesday, October 20, 1998. The \ntitle is ``A Grass-Roots Message On Reform.''\n  This deals with some of the victories that have taken place around \nthe country; namely, two initiatives; one was in Massachusetts and one \nin Arizona. Of course, the Presiding Officer knows this all started \nwith Maine, and then there was Vermont. I am talking about the clean \nmoney/clean election option. This is an editorial that talks about the \nmomentum at the State level.\n  What has happened is, a good many States in our country have partial \npublic financing. In Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and also Arizona, \ncitizens of those States have decided that if people running for office \nwill agree, it is on a voluntary basis, they are going for a clean \nmoney/clean election option. If a State desires a States rights option, \nthey should be able to apply it to House and Senate races. I point this \nout to the Chair because I think it is all positive about her.\n  I notice in this paragraph, it says that it is no surprise that two \nof the seven Senate Republicans who challenged their leadership on this \nissue came from Maine, where similar public financing legislation was \npassed in 1996. It has been important to see what is happening at the \nState level.\n  I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 20, 1998]\n\n                    A Grass-Roots Message on Reform\n\n       In the weeks since campaign finance reform was killed in \n     Washington, it has been fashionable to say that the issue \n     never had much popular support. But that cynical view is \n     belied by the momentum behind two important initiatives this \n     fall, in Massachusetts and Arizona, where voters are being \n     asked to create publicly financed campaign systems that would \n     free politicians of their dependence on money from special \n     interests. Approval of these measures would provide a model \n     for how to clean up local political races and send a strong \n     signal to Washington to enact reform legislation next year.\n       Both initiatives call for extensive public money to pay for \n     political campaigns, to be awarded after the candidates have \n     raised modest sums on their own. Many state and local \n     governments, including New York City, have provisions for \n     public financing. The post-Watergate laws governing national \n     elections also provide for public subsidies. But in these \n     cases, the money kicks in only when the candidates themselves \n     have raised large sums. As the last round of scandals shows, \n     candidates have also circumvented the law by accepting public \n     money and then using unregulated ``soft money'' contributions \n     for their campaigns.\n       Even though it will cost them money, the voters in both \n     states are responding positively. In Massachusetts, the money \n     would come in part from taxpayers checking off a box on their \n     income-tax returns, and in part from legislative \n     appropriations. In Arizona, the money would be raised by \n     increasing the fee for lobbyists, a voluntary tax checkoff \n     and a surcharge on criminal and civil fines.\n       Another encouraging sign is that these reforms are \n     occurring in one of the most conservative states in the \n     country as well as in one of the most liberal. It is perhaps \n     no accident that the main sponsors of campaign reform in \n     Washington include Senator John McCain of Arizona and \n     Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Nor is it \n     surprising that two of the seven Senate Republicans who \n     challenged their leadership on the issue this year came from \n     Maine, where similar public financing legislation was enacted \n     in 1996.\n       Success in Arizona, Massachusetts and other states with \n     more limited campaign reform measures on their ballots could \n     build momentum, for change in Washington next year. Many \n     incumbent lawmakers have long argued that the public will not \n     tolerate public financing, by which they usually mean that \n     they do not want to give their challengers an equal chance. \n     They need only be reminded that voters can speak even more \n     loudly than campaign donations.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There was a piece also that David Broder wrote, on \nJuly 18, 1999, in the Washington Post, ``Federal Lag, State Reform.'' \nDavid Broder, a highly respected journalist, talks about the energy at \nthe State level. He talks about the work of public campaigns and \nvictories in Maine and Vermont and Massachusetts and Arizona. He also \ntalks about some of the activity around the country, the energy of \ngrassroots people, people in our States, at the State level, who say, \ndon't tell us we don't care about good government; don't tell us we \ndon't care about clean elections. They are passing these initiatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 1999]\n\n                       Federal Lag, State Reform\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       While Congress continues to procrastinate on changing the \n     campaign finance laws--the House will not take up the issue \n     until September; the Senate, who knows when?--things are \n     changing in the states.\n       More and more of them are moving beyond the regulatory \n     approach embodied in most of the proposals in Washington and \n     are deciding that public financing of elections is the best \n     way to reduce the influence of interest groups and wealthy \n     individuals--while satisfying the maze of legalities laid \n     down by the courts.\n       The latest and in some ways most surprising development \n     comes in Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson, the dean of \n     the 50 governors and a staunch Republican, is making headway \n     with a proposal for partial public funding of state \n     campaigns.\n       An appropriation of $750,000, urged by Thompson as part of \n     a reform plan devised by a bipartisan commission, has been \n     approved by the Senate-House finance committee and is \n     awaiting final action by the legislature. The full plan has \n     not yet passed and faces strong opposition, but Wisconsin \n     could become the second state in recent years, following \n     Vermont, to move to public financing by action of elected \n     officials.\n       Since 1996, three others--Maine, Massachusetts and \n     Arizona--have done the same thing by voter initiatives, \n     bringing the total of states with full or partial public \n     financing systems to 24, according to Ellen Miller, the head \n     of Public Campaign, a Washington, DC-based group supporting \n     these efforts. Missouri and Oregon may have such initiatives \n     in 2000, she says.\n       What is interesting about this phenomenon is that public \n     financing is considered beyond reach in the Washington debate \n     on campaign reform. Twenty-five years ago, Congress approved \n     partial public financing of presidential campaigns by a \n     checkoff on individual income tax returns--with matching \n     funds available to candidates accepting spending limits in \n     the primaries and a full subsidy available for the general \n     election.\n       But in recent years, it has been accepted wisdom on Capitol \n     Hill that voters rebel at the idea of more of their tax \n     dollars being used to pay for those TV spots everyone \n     despises. And yet, when measures to subsidize campaigns from \n     public sources are put to a vote of the people in states as \n     diverse as Arizona and Massachusetts, they pass--despite the \n     reluctance of many local political leaders to endorse them.\n       In Massachusetts, both Republican Gov. Paul Celluci and \n     leaders of the Democratic legislature looked askance at the \n     1998 initiative, but it passed by a 2 to 1 margin. Even with \n     that big win, there was doubt whether the legislature would \n     appropriate the money to begin funding the first publicly \n     financed elections, scheduled for 2002.\n       Celluci put no request in his budget, but, the \n     legislature--a bit squeamish about defying a public mandate--\n     did so, with the House voting for $10 million and the Senate \n     for $13 million. The House could not resist adding a joker--a \n     requirement that another initiative be passed in 2000 \n     reaffirming that voters really want tax money used for \n     campaigns--but it's not certain whether that will be in the \n     final version of the budget.\n       For now, backers of the measure told me, they are confident \n     that a series of annual appropriations plus voluntary \n     checkoffs will produce the $40 million kitty needed to fund \n     85 percent of the expenses of Massachusetts candidates who \n     accept spending limits in 2002.\n       In Arizona, where the initiative barely passed by a 51 \n     percent to 49 percent margin over the opposition of \n     Republican Gov. Jane Hull and others, opponents have filed \n     two lawsuits challenging the measure. The state Supreme Court \n     threw out the first one; the second is pending in a lower \n     court. Meantime, the financing machinery has begun to \n     function. Lobbyists are being asked to pay higher \n     registration fees, and a surcharge is being added to civil \n     and criminal penalties assessed in Arizona courts. Next year, \n     people filing their state income taxes will be told that, for \n     the first time, they can claim a tax credit of up to $500 for \n     political contributions--and, barring mishaps, public \n     financing will begin in 2002.\n       The Wisconsin move is particularly interesting because \n     Thompson, like most other Republicans, was initially opposed \n     to taxpayer-financed campaigns. He endorsed the package of \n     other reforms recommended by the bipartisan commission he had \n     named. But when that measure was stymied by partisan battling \n     in the legislature, Thompson endorsed the direct subsidy as a \n     way of breaking the deadlock. In a phone call from Alaska, \n     where he was vacationing, he told me that he hopes Wisconsin, \n     which pioneered welfare reform under his leadership, ``can be \n     a model for the country'' on campaign reform as well.\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\n       It will take more courage than Washington usually displays \n     for that wish to be fulfilled.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Finally, Madam President, I wish to read from a letter \nthat asks Senators to support this amendment which would allow States \nto enact voluntary public financing legislation, commonly referred to \nas clean money/clean election initiatives regarding the election of \nFederal candidates in the States.\n\n       Historically, the states have been ``laboratories of \n     reform.'' (a term coined by Supreme Court Justice Louis \n     Brandeis) where innovative public policies have been created \n     and tested. We believe, therefore, that the U.S. Senate, \n     which has been a champion of states' innovative efforts in a \n     number of policy efforts in recent years, should also support \n     the right of individual states to determine the campaign \n     finance system for their candidates for federal elections.\n\n  This letter goes on to talk about the great victories in Arizona, \nMaine, Massachusetts, and Vermont, and also goes on to cite a recent \npoll undertaken by the Mellman Group in Iowa--you know everybody is \nfocused on Iowa with the Presidential races--pointing out that voters, \n72 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans, support a system \nof voluntary full public financing and spending limits for campaigns. \nNot only did the support cut across party lines, but also there was \nsupport among ideologies within the political party.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter, which is signed by about 50 \ndifferent organizations that are working on reform at the State level, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Fifty Plus Citizen Groups in Support of Wellstone ``States Rights'' \n  Amendment to S. 1593, the ``Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999''\n\n                                                 October 14, 1999.\n       Dear Senator. As the Senate prepares to debate S. 1593, the \n     ``Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999,'' we the \n     undersigned urge you to support Senator Paul Wellstone's \n     amendment to allow states to enact voluntary public financing \n     legislation regarding the election of Federal candidates in \n     such states.\n       Historically, the states have been ``laboratories of \n     reform'' (a term coined by Supreme Court Justice Louis \n     Brandeis) where innovative public policies have been created \n     and tested. We believe, therefore, that the U.S. Senate, \n     which has been a champion of states' innovative efforts in a \n     number of other policy areas in recent years, should also \n     support the right of individual states to determine the \n     campaign finance system for their candidates for federal \n     elections.\n       The states are already moving in this direction with regard \n     to their own state elections. Twelve states currently offer \n     partial public financing to candidates for state offices. In \n     addition, four states have gone even further and have \n     recently passed full public financing systems for their state \n     elections--Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont. Three \n     of the four states will have such a system in place for the \n     2000 election cycle.\n       Finally, the American people, according to survey after \n     survey, say that the current campaign finance system is out \n     of control and they want it overhauled. A recent poll \n     undertaken by The Mellman Group in Iowa revealed that voters \n     (72 percent of Democrats, 63 percent of Republicans) support \n     a system of voluntary full public financing and spending \n     limits for campaigns. Not only did support for such a \n     voluntary system cut across party lines, but it also \n     maintained strong support from all ideologies within the \n     parties.\n       Again, we urge you to support Senator Wellstone's amendment \n     to S. 1593 and allow the states to have the right to decide \n     for themselves whether a voluntary public financing program \n     makes sense for the election campaigns of their own Members \n     of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arizona Clean Elections Institute\n     Citizen Action of New York\n     Coalition to Stop Gun Violence\n     Colorado Progressive Coalition\n     Connecticut Citizen Action Group\n     Democracy South\n     Dollars and Democracy Project/Ohio\n     Episcopal Church\n     Equality State Policy Center/Wyoming\n     Florida Consumer Action Network\n     Florida League of Conservation Voters\n     Friends Committee on National Legislation\n     Georgia Rural-Urban Summit\n     Illinois Citizen Action\n     Indiana Alliance for Democracy\n     Iowa Citizen Action Network\n     League of United Latin American Citizens\n     Lutheran Office of Governmental Affairs--Evangelical Lutheran \n           Church in America\n     Maine Citizen Leadership Fund\n     Mass Voters for Clean Elections\n     Michigan Citizen Action\n     Minnesota Alliance for Progressive Action\n     Missouri Alliance for Campaign Reform\n     Missouri Voters for Fair Elections\n     National Voting Rights Institute\n     NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby\n     New Hampshire Citizens Alliance\n     New Jersey Citizen Action\n     North Carolina Alliance for Democracy\n     North Dakota Progressive Coalition\n     Northeast Action\n     Ocean State Action\n     Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition\n     Oregon Political Accountability Network\n     Pennsylvania Consumer Action Network\n     Public Campaign\n     South Carolina Progressive Network\n     Southeast Forest Project\n     Texans for Public Justice\n     Texas Public Citizen\n     Union of American Hebrew Congregations\n     Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations\n     United Vision for Idaho\n     United We Stand--Arizona\n     U.S. PIRG\n     Utah Progressive Network\n     Vermont PIRG\n     West Virginia Peoples' Election Reform Coalition\n     West Virginia Citizen Action\n     Western States Center\n     Wisconsin Citizen Action\n     Working Group on Electoral Democracy\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, before I get started in arguing my \nbrief to this amendment, I appreciated the comments of my colleague \nfrom Ohio. I appreciate the sincerity in which he made his case, but \nthere are a couple of points on which I am in disagreement. I don't \nknow if this amendment will come up. I certainly hope it doesn't. We \nhave been focusing on soft money. I join Senator Levin in thanking \nSenators McCain and Feingold for continuing to be a strong voice for \nreform. I understand the pragmatism of their initiative. I think if we \ncould ban soft money it would be a significant step for our country--a \ngood step forward, not a great leap sideways. I thank them.\n  But I also want to point out for Senators, Democrats and Republican, \nthat there is also the hard money issue. People who are listening--soft \nmoney/hard money--I think are wondering what all of this is about.\n  When I hear other Senators say we ought to raise the limit from \n$1,000 to $3,000, actuality it would be $2,000 to $6,000 counting \nprimary and general elections. I want to point out a couple of figures.\n  This year, a spectacularly small portion--in the Presidential race--\nof U.S. citizens have contributed more than $200. So far this year, \nonly 4 out of 10,000 Americans have made a contribution higher than \n$200 to the Presidential race. That is .037 percent. As of June 30, \n1999, only .022 percent of all Americans have given $1,000 or more to a \nPresidential candidate. In the 1998 election, .06 percent of all \nAmericans gave $1,000. That was roughly 1 in 5,000 citizens.\n  If you say money is speech, then I guess we know who the people are \nwho are going to do all of the talking. I cannot believe that \nSenators--Republicans, Democrats--whoever they are, believe this will \ngive ordinary people more confidence and more faith in the political \nprocess.\n  Again, what we have right now, when you are talking about \ncontributions of over $1,000 this year, is .022 percent. Even over \n$200, it is only .037 percent. People do not have this kind of money. \nPeople can't afford to make these kinds of contributions.\n  Now what we are going to do is raise this from $1,000 to $3,000--\nactually $2,000 to $6,000, counting primary and general elections--and \nwe are going to call this a reform.\n  I want to say to everybody that in my not so humble opinion, about 90 \npercent of the people in the country will not view this as reform. They \nwill view this as a huge step backward, and they will view this as an \neffort to enable the wealthiest and high-income citizens to have even \nmore influence and more say over the political process than they have \nright now.\n  This amendment is a States rights amendment to this underlying bill. \nI hope it will have broad bipartisan support. This amendment allows \nStates to set up voluntary systems of full or partial public financing \nfor Federal congressional candidates that involve voluntary spending \nlimits on both personal and outside contributions as long as those \nsystems otherwise are not in conflict with the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. Again, it is entirely up to the candidates. It is only if \nthey agree to it. Clearly, we set a floor, which is the Federal \nElection Campaign Act.\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\n  Again, the letter I read to you was on the mark. States have been the \nlaboratories for reform. This States rights amendment would allow these \nlaboratories to do this work but in a safe way because we make it clear \nthat the Federal law remains the floor. No State can violate existing \nFederal law. No State can be in violation of existing Federal law. But \nif a State wants to do better--if Kentucky or Minnesota or Nebraska or \nArizona--Arizona has already done better, and Minnesota tried --they \nwant to apply some system of partial or full public financing to \nFederal offices, and they say: we are sick and tired of waiting for you \nall to pass this kind of legislation; we have the sneaking suspicion \nthat those interest groups that have the power have too much say in the \nSenate and you are not going to pass it; let us have a go at it, then \nwe ought to let States do so.\n\n  The Federal law is the floor. But it is a very low floor. We had this \ndebate the other day. I don't want to go over again in great detail the \ndefinition of corruption. Let me simply say one more time that I, for \none, I say to my colleague whom I have a lot of affection for, the \nSenator from Utah, that I am not going to make any arguments about a \none-to-one correlation between fundraising and ``corruption.'' I am not \ngoing to make any of those arguments, but I will say that to me \ncorruption is more serious than wrongdoing of individual officeholders. \nIt is systemic. That is what we have. It is simply a case of those \npeople who make these big contributions, the big soft money \ncontributions and the big hard money contributions--they are the \ninvestors. They are the heavy hitters. They are the players. They are \nthe ones who are well connected. They are the ones who have too much \ninfluence. And most citizens believe there is a connection between big \nspecial interest money and outcomes in American politics.\n  I am very sad to say that most citizens who believe that are right. \nPeople know that who has the money determines who wins and who has the \nmoney determines all too often what even gets put on the table in the \nfirst place. That is why people are turning away from the political \nprocess. That is why people are disillusioned. That is why people are \ndisengaged. That is why people feel, I will say it again, if you pay, \nyou play; if you do not pay, you don't play. That is what is going on.\n  Recent polls: 92 percent of all Americans believe special interest \ncontributions buy votes of Members of the Congress--92 percent. Again, \nI say to colleagues, I am not agreeing with that kind of thing, but it \nis one of the reasons we should want to change this system. It really \ndoesn't matter in the last analysis. If you get more money from oil \ncompanies, or labor unions, or environmentalists, or citizen groups, or \nfinancial institutions, the fact is people can always have that \nconcern. Why don't we try to break that?\n  Eighty-eight percent of people believe those who make large \ncontributions get special favors from politicians. Sixty-seven percent \nbelieve their own representatives in Congress would listen to views of \noutsiders who made major political contributions before they would \nlisten to their own constituents' views. And then, finally, nearly half \nof all registered voters believe lobbyists and special interests \ncontrol the Government.\n  I know the sponsors of the new McCain-Feingold bill have stripped the \nbill down in the hope that we are going to have the votes to achieve \ncloture and that we can move this long-stalled debate forward. I am in \nagreement. However, given the inability of Congress to agree on a lot \nof the incremental changes, which is important, let alone comprehensive \nreform--this is a stripped down bill. The authors will admit that. But \nthey are saying, let's try to move something forward. Let's take a step \nforward that will lead to improvement. I agree. But what I am saying \nabout this amendment is that it is also an ideal time to let States \ntake the lead. We should not allow States to undermine Federal election \nlaw. They won't do that. But the law should also not be an artificial \nceiling that prevents States from setting up systems of public \nfinancing such as Maine has done, such as Vermont has done, such as \nArizona has done, and such as Massachusetts has done that would allow \nthem to address this obscene money chase, that allows them to address \nvoter apathy; that allows them to address the kind of corruption that I \nhave talked about--both actual or corruption that is perceived.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am interested and pleased to hear the \nSenator say he does not agree with those polled who say money buys \nvotes and that the individual Members of the Senate are not corrupt.\n  My question to the Senator, since he is a teacher by profession is, \nif that perception in the public is not true, why shouldn't this \nteacher spend his time trying to educate the public as to what is true \nrather than to fall in with the sentiment expressed in the poll which \nis inaccurate?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I actually have not finished laying \nout the amendment.\n  To my colleague from Utah, I was saying the huge percentage of people \nwho believe this to be the case troubles me. I certainly do not believe \nthat in a majority of cases of Senators whom I know, to the extent I \nknow them--and I think I do--that that is the case, the ``money'' vote \nway. I don't think that is the link.\n  That is my sense, not in an individual way.\n  I have also argued, and the Senator has heard me say this many \ndifferent times, I do think we have a more serious kind of corruption, \nand it is the imbalance of power. It is systemic.\n  Therefore, from my point of view, my colleague from Utah could be \nreferring to one of two things: Either the statement I gave on the \nfloor the other day in which I said we have to change this system in \norder to give citizens faith in this political process--and they have \nevery reason to believe that; unfortunately, it is dominated by the \nfew--or the Senator could be referring to this amendment. I hope not \nbecause all this amendment says is, whether one agrees or not with the \nperception, if people in Utah or people in Minnesota decide they want \nto put into effect comprehensive reform and cover our Federal \nelections, House and Senate races, as they are doing in the State \nelections, they should have the right.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may, I was responding to the statement made by the \nSenator from Minnesota on the floor today when he talked about the \npoll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am yielding for a question.\n  Go ahead. I want to be clear I have the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Absolutely, and I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator, and I shall not interrupt again.\n  I have had the experience, the polls in Utah show a very large \npercentage of people holding the same opinion as the Senator from \nMinnesota has subscribed. Because I am convinced that McCain-Feingold \nis, (a) unconstitutional, and (b) unworkable, I have----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor and \nmay yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased, for my colleague from Utah, to yield for \na question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  I have had the experience of explaining my position and once \nexplaining, being endorsed.\n  My question to the Senator is, again, if he disagrees with the \nposition stated in the poll, even though it is held by 92 percent of \nthe respondents to that poll, inasmuch as he is a skilled, trained, and \nprofessional teacher, would he not spend his time well using his skills \nas a teacher educating these people in his State, as I have tried to do \nwith the people in my State, rather than simply going along with them \nand saying if that is your position, I will follow it legislatively \neven though I disagree with it? Would that not be a better use of the \nSenator's obvious teaching skills?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the first part of the question I \nappreciate.\n  The second part of the question I might have a slightly different \ninterpretation. To the first part of the question I want the Senator \nfrom Utah to know--for that matter, the Senator from Kentucky--that I \nbelieve in public service, and I am honored to be here.\n  I reject the across-the-board denigration of public service and \npeople in public service when and if anyone does\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\nthat. I haven't seen that done on the floor of the Senate. However, I \nhear people talking that way and I go out of my way to say to people \nthat there are many Senators whom I have met, including those who have \na very different viewpoint, who I think have a highly developed sense \nof public service, who believe in what they are saying, and believe in \nwhat they are doing.\n  If the Senator were to ask me whether or not I tried as a Senator or \nteacher to speak to this notion that there is all this corruption and \nwheeling and dealing and everything is cynical and everything is \ncorrupted, absolutely I do because I don't think that is true.\n  On the second point, I think my time is well spent supporting the \nMcCain-Feingold effort, and for that matter, supporting even more \ncomprehensive reform. I do believe the money chase and the mix of money \nand politics--especially big money politics--has undercut what I hold \nmost dear, which is this very noble and grand, wonderful, over-200-year \nexperiment in self-rule that we have had in this country.\n  I think this is a debate about representative democracy. I believe we \nhave to change the way we finance campaigns if we are to have a \nhealthy, functioning, representative democracy.\n  I thank my colleague for his question.\n  Madam President, if the American people, according to survey after \nsurvey, are going to say this system of financing is out of control and \nthey want an overhaul, then we owe it to them to get out of the way and \nlet the States go ahead and move forward and do what we as a Congress \nhave been unable to do. Just because the Senate can't move on \ncomprehensive reform doesn't mean we should tie the hands of States. My \ncolleagues can agree or disagree with what States will do, but give \nthem the option.\n  Let me give the legal context. My own State of Minnesota attempted to \nset up a system of public financing, a system for Federal candidates, 9 \nyears ago in 1990 when the State legislature passed the law offering \npartial public financing to candidates, the congress of Minnesota. \nUnfortunately, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit \nstruck down Minnesota's law in 1993 in Weber v. Heaney. The court ruled \nbecause the Federal Election Campaign Act did not specifically allow \nStates to create this kind of voluntary public financing program, then \nFECA prohibited it.\n  The amendment I am introducing corrects that by adding one simple \nsentence to FECA which specifically allows States to set up voluntary \npublic financing programs for the election of their own members to the \nHouse or the Senate as long as no program violates any provision of the \ncurrent Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\n  The court said, given what we are dealing with, given existing law, \nwe cannot go forward. If we change the law, it could very well be a \ndifferent court decision. In other words, if a State wants to create a \npublic financing fund and give its congressional candidates the option; \nit is a voluntary option of financing their campaigns wholly or \npartially with public money rather than the private contributions, then \nthat State would be able to do so, again, provided there are no \nviolations in the FECA provisions.\n  I want to emphasize this amendment makes these programs strictly \nvoluntary, as the system of public financing for the Presidential \ncampaign is voluntary. Some States are already moving in this direction \nwith regard to State and local elections. There is a lot of energy for \nthis. Twelve States already offer partial public financing to \ncandidates for State offices. In fact, one of the most advanced is in \nthe State of Kentucky. In addition, four States have gone even further \nand recently passed full or nearly full public financing systems for \ntheir State elections--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Senator \nMcCain's State, the State of Arizona.\n  Local and State elected officials, along with citizen activists in \nnearly 40 States around the country, have launched the Elected \nLeadership Project 2000. And this is an all-out effort for \ncomprehensive reform.\n  I say to colleagues, if the people in our States want to strengthen \nAmerican democracy, if they have the gumption and they have the citizen \npolitics to go forward with real reform that would get so much of the \nbig money out of politics--that would really create a level playing \nfield, that would reinforce people's faith in the elections, that would \nmean people could say these elections belong to us, this political \nprocess belongs to us--and that is why there has been so much support \nfor the clean money/clean elections initiative--then my amendment says \nto Senators: Let them do it. You might not agree. But if your State \nwants to do what Maine has done and Maine says we want to apply this to \nCongress as well, then Maine should be able to do it; Minnesota should \nbe able to do it; Kentucky should be able to do it, Utah should be able \nto do it.\n  This legislation goes to the root cause of a system which is founded \non private special interest money, and it cures the disease.\n  I hear colleagues talking about the need to tighten up campaign \nfinance laws. The problem is not what is illegal; the problem is what \nis legal. The real problem is that most of what is wrong with this \ncurrent sick system is perfectly legal. It is perfectly legal, those \nhuge amounts of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money \ncontributions that Senator Feingold and Senator McCain are trying to \nprohibit and which prohibition too many Senators are trying to block--\nhuge amounts of personal, individual contributions that really, \nbasically, very-high-income and wealthy people are able to contribute \nbut the vast majority of people are not--all of which determine who \ngets to run, who gets elected; all of which determine the people who \nhave the most access.\n  We have moved so far away from the principle that each person should \ncount as one, and no more than one, it is absolutely frightening. We do \nnot have elections any longer; we have auctions.\n  Why don't we get the big interested money out? We had this debate \nabout corruption. Again, maybe it is only the appearance of corruption. \nBut my friend Phil Stern, who is no longer alive, once wrote a book, \n``The Best Congress Money Can Buy.'' He made the following argument in \nthe book. I just thought of it. Bill Moyers, in a speech he gave called \n``The Soul Of Democracy,'' made the same argument.\n  Imagine what it would be like--maybe some people had a chance to \nwatch the ball games last night--imagine what it would be like if \numpires or referees received huge contributions from the players of the \ndifferent teams before the baseball game or before the football game. \nWould you have any confidence that they would be rendering impartial \ndecisions? You might be worried that they would not be. In a way, we \nhave something similar to that here. We make all these different \ndecisions about health care and health insurance reform, about \ntelecommunications legislation, banking legislation, where we are going \nto make budget cuts, labor legislation--across-the-board. At the same \ntime we receive all these contributions, we are the referees; we are \nthe umpires; we are going to make the decisions. It looks terrible. It \nlooks awful. It looks awful to people in the country.\n  What I am saying is that if, in fact, we want to give people an \nopportunity to have more confidence in their political process, then I \nthink we ought to go forward and we ought to agree to this amendment.\n  I have two final points. I have been waiting for a long time. I will \nbe done, but I want to make two final points.\n  First of all, I have heard it said that people do not care.\n  I do not think that is true at all. I think people have reached the \nconclusion that when it comes to their concerns, they are of little \nmatter in the Congress. I think people have reached the conclusion that \nthe influence of private wealth and power is strongly felt; that it \nshapes the acts and policies of government; that money crawls the halls \nof the Capitol and the halls of the White House.\n  No one in politics today can deny the shaping influence of money on \npublic acts. Few people who contribute vast sums of money to political \ncampaigns do it just out of profound ideological beliefs. They do it in \npart because they do have some hope for gain. It is an understandable \nambition for those individual figures, but one to which public figures \nshould not yield their larger commitment to all Americans. That is what \nthis debate is about, whether or\n\n[[Page S12761]]\n\nnot we as public figures maintain a larger commitment to all the people \nin our country, not just the people who have the financial wherewithal \nto make these contributions. That is what this debate is about.\n  In my view, until we take the big money out of politics, our historic \ndrive for more opportunities for citizens, for more justice, for a \nbetter life for all the people, for improving the standard of living \nfor all the people in our country, for really investing in children's \nlives, for making our country a better America, that drive will \ncontinue to be diverted and frustrated and ultimately denied.\n  This issue is the core issue, and this amendment I have introduced \nsimply says to my colleagues we ought to, if we are not going to go \nforward with comprehensive reform but at the State level our States \nwant to have clean money/clean elections, and they want to apply it on \na voluntary basis to races to the House of Representatives and the \nSenate, then they ought to be able to do so.\n  I do not see why we would not have strong bipartisan support for this \namendment because, frankly, I think, along with the efforts of Senator \nFeingold and Senator McCain--Senator McCain and Senator Feingold--the \nenergy for the reform is going to come at the grassroots level; it is \ngoing to come at the State level. That is what this public campaign has \nbeen about all across this country. That is what the victory in Arizona \nwas about. That is what the victories in Massachusetts, Vermont, and \nMaine were all about. That is what people in my State tried to do 9 \nyears ago. Let's just pass a law that would enable States to move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to table amendment No. 2299 and \nask consent the vote occur at 5:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky reserves the right \nto object.\n  Is the Senator objecting?\n  Mr. REID. I could not hear. The Senator moved to table the Reid \namendment; at what time would the vote occur?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was agreeable to the leadership. I was told they \nwanted a vote at 5:45, but I would be willing to set the time for that \nvote at any time. I am told by staff, 5:45 is the time for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. May I inquire which amendment we are talking about.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to explain to the Senator from Kentucky. \nIt is basically the soft money amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reid amendment, No. 2299.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the request is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Table.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Table the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a unanimous request pending to have \nthe vote occur at 5:45. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. To have the tabling vote on the Reid amendment occur \nat 5:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is the request of the Senator from Arizona?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the request. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in the interest of time, I would be glad \nto move to table the Reid amendment, which does not require unanimous \nconsent, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not debatable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the tabling motion occur at \n5:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want my colleagues to know this is a \ndefining vote of this debate. This is a defining vote because it all \nhas to do with soft money. This is the fundamental proposition that the \nSenator from Wisconsin and I are propounding.\n  There has been parliamentary maneuvering. There has been substitutes. \nThere has been a filling up of the tree. There have been a lot of \nthings that have been going on which have sort of not surprised me but \ndisappointed me.\n  Friday, on the other side, for reasons that are still not clear to \nme, the Senator from Nevada, and others, chose not to allow the \namending process to go forward. On this side, we have had some delays, \nwhich I would argue were not particularly helpful to the process.\n  So this tabling motion of the Reid amendment is basically a defining \nvote on whether or not we want to ban soft money. I intend to vote not \nto table the Reid amendment. I would hope that my colleagues would vote \nnot to table the Reid amendment. Then we will have the Senate on record \nas to whether we are for or against soft money in American political \ncampaigns.\n  On Friday, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska--it is funny; we were talking \nabout this today at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial luncheon today that \nSenator Hagel and I attended, that there is kind of an interesting \nrelationship that exists between those of us who had the privilege of \nserving in that conflict.\n  One of the traits I find true with Senator Hagel, Senator Cleland, \nSenator Robb, and Senators Kerrey and Kerry, is that there is a certain \ndegree of honesty and straightforwardness which I find extremely \nattractive.\n  Senator Kerrey, on Friday, who is also the former chairman of the \nSenatorial Campaign Committee, said:\n\n       There will be all kinds of amendments offered to change the \n     bill, some of which I support strongly. It seems to me our \n     only chance of getting this legislation passed is to stick as \n     closely as possible to the bill we currently have in front of \n     us.\n\n  He went on to say, in an exchange with the Senator from Wisconsin:\n\n       I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin will tell me if what \n     I am saying is true. I like Shays-Meehan. I like the bill. \n     The junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, has an amendment \n     I like as well.\n\n  He goes on to talk about:\n\n       . . . It makes it much more likely we will fail to break a \n     filibuster and, as a consequence of that failure, fail to \n     enact legislation, and as a consequence of that, we will \n     never go to conference and never change the law.\n\n  Then Senator Kerrey of Nebraska went on to say:\n\n       . . . The Senator is very kind to say I have always been a \n     supporter. Actually, I have not always been a supporter . . . \n     Speaking of campaign finance reform.\n\n  He says:\n\n       When I came to the Senate in 1989, this was not a very \n     important issue. Indeed, at one point, I joined the Senator \n     from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, to defeat campaign finance \n     reform.\n       Then I had the experience of going inside the beast in \n     1996, 1997, and 1998 when I was Chairman of the Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Committee--I do not want to raise a sore \n     subject for the Senator from Maine. It changed my attitude in \n     two big ways: One, the apparent corruption that exists. \n     People believe there is corruption. If they believe it, it \n     happens. We all understand that. If the perception is it is \n     A, it is A, even though we know it may not be, and the people \n     believe the system is corrupt.\n       Equally important to me, I discovered in 1996, 1997, and \n     1998 that there are men and women who would love to serve. \n     They say: I can't be competitive; I can't possibly raise the \n     money necessary to go on television; Oh, and by the way, my \n     reputation could get damaged as a consequence of what could \n     be said on television against me.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S12762]]\n\n\n       I am persuaded this law needs to be changed for the good of \n     the Republic, for the good of democracy. I hope Members, such \n     as myself, who are enthusiastic about changing that law will \n     take the advice of the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator \n     from Arizona to heart because we may have to vote against \n     things we prefer in order to make certain we get something \n     that not only we want but the Nation desperately needs.\n\n  Madam President, it is impossible for me to elaborate on that kind of \ncomment from my esteemed colleague and American hero, Bob Kerrey of \nNebraska.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me clarify what the Senator from Arizona is \nattempting in moving to table the Reid amendment.\n  I would ask the Senator from Arizona, when we take this vote on \ntabling, will you regard this vote on the Reid amendment as a true test \nof the question we have been asking our colleagues, and that question \nis, Are you for or against soft money?\n  Would the Senator from Arizona regard that vote as a procedural vote \nor a vote up or down on the question of whether you are for or against \nsoft money?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond to my friend.\n  I am hearing that the distinguished majority leader may try to remove \nthe bill from the consideration on the floor of the Senate tomorrow. We \nknow that it is cluttered with various amendments, some of them very \nimportant. The Senator from Minnesota spoke very eloquently in favor of \nhis amendment, which I am sure has some merit.\n  But the crux and heart of this matter is soft money. We all know \nthat. I worry if we do not get this vote, that we could possibly reach \na situation where the Senate is gridlocked; and eventually, over time, \nobviously, we would not even have recorded votes on this important and \ncrucial issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Can the Senator recall any other occasion in which the \nSenate has voted up or down on the question of whether to ban party \nsoft money?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding the Senate has never voted up or \ndown on that specific issue, at least since 1907, when, thanks be to \none of the greatest Republicans and greatest Presidents in history, \nTheodore Roosevelt, who alleged there was corruption at that time--and \nI will include many of his remarks in the Record--because of the \ninfluence of major corporations and robber barons and special interests \non the American political process, I believe the Senate did vote to ban \nsoft money. And I believe that statute is still on the books.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Again, I ask a further question. I appreciate that \nanswer because I think the problem we have had is we have not had a \nchance to get to the question of whether you are for or against \nunlimited contributions. For year after year, it appears that--and I \nask the Senator from Arizona to confirm--we keep trying to get to this \nvote, but we never seem to be able to get right at it; the bill is \npulled or a tabling motion is made on the overall bill or something, a \ncloture motion is filed. It is amazing, after 5 years, we have never \ngotten to this. But apparently we are about to.\n  Let me ask one other question, if I could, because the Senator from \nOregon consulted me on this. Senator Wyden, who does not limit himself \nto supporting our efforts, has been, in my mind, one of the strongest \nadvocates of campaign finance reform in this body. He has been creative \nand has a number of interesting ideas of his own that I like very much. \nHe asked me--and I certainly think you will answer the same way I did--\nwhether or not, after this motion is disposed of one way or another, \nSenators will still have the chance to amend the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course. Of course. I hope that would move the process \nforward, once we are on record. And perhaps that might increase our \nchances of reaching 60 votes, I would say to my friend.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator for bringing us to the point where \nfinally we can have an up-or-down vote on soft money.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. REID. I offered an amendment on Friday to establish a procedure \nwhereby there would be a vote to determine whether or not we would \ninvoke cloture on the so-called soft money ban. Is the Senator aware of \nthat? The Senator from Arizona has indicated and I may be paraphrasing \nthe words; that there were games being played and Senators were not \nbeing allowed to offer amendments.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, the Senator from Minnesota offered \nan amendment today. Amendments could have been offered Friday. Will the \nSenator acknowledge that having the two amendments, one being ``McCain-\nFeingold lite'' and the original version of the McCain-Feingold bill, \nthat we should be able in this body to vote on both those matters?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, first of all, I never argued that \ngames were being played. I would not make that allegation. I believe \nthe Senator from Kentucky and I had a colloquy on Friday where it was \nclear that the situation was such that even if an amendment were \nconsidered on Friday and adopted, it would have fallen with a vote on \nthe underlying legislation that was pending, which I think correctly, \nin the view of the Senator from Kentucky, made further amendments and \ndebate meaningless. I see the Senator from Kentucky is on the floor. I \nthink that was his comment. If he disagrees, I will be glad to yield \nfor a question from him in that respect. On Friday, I was disappointed, \nand I think the Senator from Kentucky was, that we didn't move forward \nwith genuine amendments that would have stood or fallen on their own \nmerit.\n  I am glad to yield to the Senator from Kentucky for a question on \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just ask one more question, maybe the Senator \ncould respond to both of them. I say to my friend from Arizona, I have \nstated publicly and privately, both outside these Chambers and inside \nthese Chambers, about the work that is being done by the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, and indeed it has been a \ntremendous effort bringing this very important issue before this body. \nYou have been undying in your efforts to bring this forward. You would \nacknowledge, would you not, that there are others in this body, other \nthan the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona, who \nbelieve strongly that there should be some campaign finance reform? \nWould you acknowledge that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. And would you also acknowledge that your method in \nobtaining campaign finance reform may not be the best way to go?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. I guess the point I want to make is that I am not sure I \ncan put my many efforts on behalf of campaign finance reform next to \nthat of the Senator from Arizona. He has done so much to move this \nissue forward. But I would say to my friend from Arizona--and I would \nlike the Senator to either acknowledge whether or not this Senator \nbelieves strongly that there should be campaign finance reform. Even \nthough my qualifications for asserting the need for campaign finance \nreform would not meet those of the Senator from Arizona, I think I am \nin the top 10 of members of this body who have been a strong advocate \nfor reform. For example, I have given speeches on the Senate floor, \nsince I came here with the Senator from Arizona in 1986, about the need \nfor campaign finance reform. Would the Senator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I not only acknowledge it, but it is worthy of mention; \nthe Senator from Nevada and I have been close and dear friends for \nnearly 20 years. One thing I have tried to do during the course of this \ndebate is keep it from in any way personalizing or showing any \ndisrespect to any individual, no matter where they stand on this issue.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Did the Senator from Kentucky want to make a comment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Arizona, he is correct. My \nunderstanding Friday was and remains that the right side of the tree, \nwhich is what we normally amend around here, was filled by the two \namendments and the two cloture votes. That effectively made additional \namendments somewhat an exercise in futility. What I recommended to our \nside--and it has\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\nbeen happening today--is that they discuss their amendments--I know \nSenator Hagel is here to discuss his--and indicate that they would like \nto have had a vote, a meaningful vote, which would have been on the \nright side of the tree.\n  So the Senator from Arizona does correctly state my opinion of \nFriday, which remains my opinion today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada; there are many ways to approach \nthe issue of campaign finance reform. I agree with him; there are many \nlaudable aspects of campaign finance reform that deserve serious \nconsideration.\n  One that doesn't seem to surface as much as it should is free \ntelevision time for candidates. The broadcasters receive $70 billion \nworth of free digital spectrum. It seems to me there should be some \nobligation along with one of the great rip-offs in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n  But we really are down to soft money, I say to the Senator from \nNevada. We are really down to that. We can build on that. There is no \nreform that could have any meaning unless it meant, at its fundamental \nheart, the banning of soft money. We have been through a number of \ndebates about what independent campaigns do.\n  By the way, before I leave the issue, I heard the Senator from Ohio \nsay that banning of soft money does not in any way affect labor unions. \nYesterday or the day before, there was a notice in the paper that the \nlabor unions plan on spending $45 million in soft money in the upcoming \ncampaign. I am afraid the Senator from Ohio is misinformed because this \nbanning of soft money does enormous damage to the ability of labor \nunions to engage in the kind of practices we are trying to eliminate, \njust as much as it does the other side.\n  I want to make perfectly clear, the reason that I and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin are seeking to table or asking for a vote on a tabling \nmotion is so we can have the Senate on record on the issue of soft \nmoney. If the Senate, in its wisdom, decides that we should table the \nReid amendment and that we should, therefore, not ban soft money, then \nobviously this entire exercise is largely futile. I think there are \nabout three Members on the other side who may not be voting who would \nvote for us, and I would take that into account in this vote because, \nreally, this vote is about the intentions and the will of the Senate.\n  The soft money reports from Common Cause: Soft money, CWA-COPE, \n$2,593,000; American Federation of State and County Municipal \nEmployees, $2,334,000--these are obviously all Democrats--Service \nEmployees Union, $1.5 million. I hope the Senator from Ohio will take a \nlook at the enormous amount of money that is coming in from labor \nunions that he somehow believes would not be affected by a ban on soft \nmoney.\n\n  Also, recently information came out that the Democratic Party is \nraising now as much soft money as the Republican Party, a very \ninteresting turn of events.\n  We have, at most, 48 hours left on this legislation. We have not made \na lot of progress. It is time we did. I believe having the Senate on \nrecord on soft money is a very defining vote. I talked extensively with \nSenator Feingold about this before we decided to make this move. I hope \nmy colleagues will vote not to table the Reid amendment, which bans \nsoft money. I hope my colleagues will vote not to table the McCain \ntabling motion of the Reid amendment.\n  I believe Senator Bennett is next under the unanimous consent \nagreement. I believe both Senators Hagel and Wyden have been waiting. I \ndon't know what the disposition of that is.\n  Senator Reid?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Bennett is \nto be recognized at the conclusion of Senator McCain's speech.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think Senator Hagel was here first. Is that OK?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Utah will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I haven't yielded the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what we should do, in keeping with what we \nhave done earlier in the day--Senator Bennett is opposed to the \nlegislation; he is going to speak next. Senator Wyden, who is in favor \nof the legislation, should speak next after the Senator from Utah, and \nthen we should go to Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask that I may follow after Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of Members, Senator Bennett--how long \nis he going to speak?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was planning to----\n  Mr. REID. He has been here for 2 days.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was planning to discuss the amendment that I was \nunable to offer. I want to spend 15 minutes or so on that. Then I want \nto make a general statement about the bill. I will try not to get \noverly enthusiastic about my arguments, but I might get carried away \nfor another 20 minutes or so about that, so between 30 or 40 minutes. I \nwill do my best to restrain myself.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. If I may----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think I have consumed 7 or 8 minutes. I hope the \nSenator from Utah will recognize that both the Senator from Nebraska \nand the Senator from Oregon have been here for a long time. I hope he \nwould give them the opportunity to speak before the 5:45 vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Arizona making a unanimous \nconsent request that after the Senator from Utah has finished his \nremarks, the Senator from Oregon would be recognized, followed by the \nSenator from Nebraska, followed by the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making such a request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to make that request.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Oregon \nwishes to speak for 15 minutes. This is so other Members will have an \nidea about what is going on. The Senator from Nebraska wishes how much \ntime?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I do not object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I amend the unanimous consent agreement. The Senator from \nUtah would like how many minutes?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to do 20 minutes on the bill itself and \ndelay my 20 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Utah for his courtesy. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Utah be recognized for 20 \nminutes, the Senator from Oregon for 15 minutes, the Senator from \nNebraska for 20 minutes, and then the Senator from Wisconsin for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I only ask if there is \nenough time to get us to 5:45.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Roughly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity. I have \nbeen following this debate and, indeed, have been involved in it with \ngreat interest ever since it began.\n  While I appreciate and, indeed, salute the sincerity with which the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin pursue their \nefforts to achieve what they sincerely believe will be good for our \ncountry, I must begin by stating that I am absolutely convinced that \nwhat they are pursuing would be bad for our country, would be bad for \nour political system, would be bad for campaigns in general, and would \nraise, rather than lower, the sense of frustration and disgust with the \npolitical system overall.\n  That has been the history of campaign finance reform. It has gone on \nin this town for decades. Every time, the reformers end up making \nthings worse. I say that with all respect for the sincerity with which \nthey pursue their goal. But, in my opinion, the goal they are pursuing \nis not available to them through the route they are following.\n  I wish to begin by quoting a column that appeared last week in the \nWashington Post written by Robert Samuelson. Robert Samuelson is not \nknown as one of the more partisan of the political commentators. He is \nbasically considered an objective commentator,\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\nspending more of his time on economics than other issues. But what he \nhas to say about this issue captures what I believe about it so well \nthat I am going to quote him at some length.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Few subjects inspire more intellectual conformity than \n     ``campaign finance reform.'' All ``right-thinking'' people \n     ``know'' that election spending is ``out of control,'' that \n     the present system of campaign finance is corrupt and that \n     only reactionaries block ``reform.''\n\n  I think that captures exactly what we have been hearing on the \nfloor--that all ``right-thinking'' people ``know'' that election \nspending is out of control and the present system is corrupt and only \nreactionaries block ``reform''.\n  Then he goes on:\n\n       Who cares if these common beliefs are either wrong or \n     wildly exaggerated--or that most ``reforms'' would do more \n     damage to democracy than any harm they might cure? The case \n     against ``reform'' is almost impossible to make, because \n     people's minds are closed.\n\n  That beginning of Mr. Samuelson's column, as I say, perfectly \ncaptures how I feel about this issue. Here is the history--again, in \nprevious debates, I have gone through the history at some length. Mr. \nSamuelson summarized well:\n\n       The history of ``campaign finance reform'' is that every \n     limit inspires new evasions. One possibility is that interest \n     groups will finance more independent campaigns . . . to elect \n     or defeat targeted candidates. ``Reformers'' view such \n     ``issue ads'' . . . as shams. And so, the next step would be \n     to curb such advertising, even if curbs flout the First \n     Amendment.\n\n  Mr. Samuelson then goes on with this very insightful quote from one \nof the reform groups that summarizes how this debate has crystallized:\n\n       ``Any effort to reform issue advocacy spending in \n     connection with federal elections must strike a regulatory \n     balance between protecting political speech and protecting \n     the integrity of our electoral process,'' says one reform \n     group.\n\n  Well, as Mr. Samuelson says:\n\n       The First Amendment says that ``Congress shall make no law \n     . . . abridging the freedom of speech.'' There's no mention \n     [in the First Amendment] of ``regulatory balance.'' And if \n     elections and ``issue ads'' aren't about political speech, \n     what are they about? ``Right thinking'' people minimize the \n     conflict between ``campaign finance reform'' and free speech, \n     because it is inconvenient.\n\n  Then Mr. Samuelson summarizes, and I think, again, this is the \nultimate summary of the debate:\n\n       As long as we have the First Amendment, the effort to \n     regulate elections--under the guise of ``campaign finance \n     reform''--is futile, self-defeating, and undesirable. The \n     hysteria about money's corrupting power worsens the very \n     problem that reformers claim to deplore: public cynicism. But \n     right-thinking people are oblivious to evidence or logic. \n     They are at ease with their own respectable conformity.\n\n  I could not have done it better, so I didn't try. That is why I \nquoted it at that length. Let's go to the debate for a minute. By the \nway, I ask that I be informed when I have 5 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nTorricelli, took the floor a day or two ago to give us a glimpse of the \nreal world that we are facing if certain portions of this bill go \nforward. He was arguing that we should not pass the substitute, \ncommonly known as Shays-Meehan, because he said it will limit the \nspeech of political parties and leave us to the mercies of special \ninterest groups. I wrote down some of the things he said.\n  He said, ``The debate will be fought by surrogates over our heads in \na far larger context.'' I agree with that absolutely. If political \nparties are limited in the amount of soft money advocacy in which they \ncan be involved but special interest groups are not, special interest \ngroups will simply ignore the political party by the ads themselves.\n  Mr. Torricelli laid out for us in great detail some of the stratagems \nthat would be followed, thus validating the comments Robert Samuelson \nmade about political money finding another way around, finding a new \nway to come into the arena. That is the real world we will face, and \nthe junior Senator from New Jersey was exactly right in outlining how \nit will work. Yet we seem to go plowing ahead on the assumption that \nsomehow the real world will be different if we just show how honest and \nanxious we are to appear not to be corrupt.\n  Let me give you some real-world examples. We have heard that from \nother Members of the Senate. People have talked about their own \nelections. I want to talk about several real-world examples from \nelections in which I have participated.\n  Let's go back to the 1998 election when I got reelected. My opponent \ncomplained about this very issue. He complained often and he complained \nas loudly as he could that somehow there is something broken about the \nsystem because, he said: I can't raise enough money to compete with \nSenator Bennett. What is the matter with a system where ordinary people \ncan't compete?\n  We pointed out to him in one of the debates that on the ticket with \nhim was a sixth-grade schoolteacher running for Congress who raised \nmore money than her incumbent opponent. What is the difference? The \ncandidate for the Senate can't raise enough money, he says, to compete \nwith me, whereas another Democrat in the same State, a sixth-grade \nschoolteacher, can raise enough money to compete against a sitting \nCongressman.\n  My opponent, by the way, according to his financial disclosure, is a \nmillionaire. The sixth-grade schoolteacher clearly is not. The sixth-\ngrade schoolteacher clearly depends upon her paycheck very heavily. The \ndifference was not because of my personality or his personality. The \ndifference was that the people who are involved in providing money for \npolitical races make a very cold calculation as to what your chances \nare.\n  When I first ran for the Senate, and I came to this town, and I did \nthe circuit of all of these terrible places we have been hearing about \non this floor asking them for money, they did not ask me what I \nbelieved. They didn't ask me, what will our access be if we give you \nmoney? They didn't say to me, gee, we want to know your positions \nbefore we decide. They wanted to know if I had a chance of winning \nbecause, they said: We don't back losing horses. And they were \nconvinced I was a losing horse, and they didn't give me any. I went out \nof this town empty-handed.\n  I was outspent 3 to 1, with my opponent in a primary in the State of \nUtah spending $6.2 million. That sets a record on a per vote cast that \nI don't think has ever been broken. I was able to put my message across \nwith a third of that amount, and I beat him, at which point people \nstarted to say: All right, now we will talk to you, because now that \nyou have won the Republican nomination, it looks as if you may have an \nopportunity.\n  The problem my opponent had had nothing to do with his positions, had \nnothing to do with his own bank account, had nothing to do with his own \npersonality. It was simply that he was perceived as a loser and the \npeople who were giving money decided they didn't want to back a loser.\n\n  But here comes a sixth-grade schoolteacher with no money in the bank \nand no political experience of any kind, and they thought she might be \na winner, so she got all the money she needed. She didn't win. One of \nthe reasons she didn't win is very appropriate to this debate. She \nsigned the term limit pledge; her opponent did not.\n  So Americans for Term Limits--or whatever they are called--came into \nthat congressional district with a whole series of issue ads attacking \nher opponent, attacking him for his failure to sign the term limit ad. \nThis is a special interest group with soft money. We have no idea where \nit came from. We have no idea in what amounts it was raised. We have no \nidea who signed on because they are not under the FEC. But they \nexercised their constitutional right. They came into the Second \nCongressional District in the State of Utah, and they flooded the \nairwaves with some of the nastiest, most vicious political ads I have \never seen attacking the incumbent Congressman.\n  What happened? Early polls showed that the sixth-grade schoolteacher \nwas going to beat the incumbent Congressman. She had more money than he \ndid. She had momentum. Then these ads started to run, and the reaction \non the part of the voters in the second district--I heard it everywhere \nI went campaigning--was: We hate those ads. How can Lily Eskelson be so \nvicious as to run those ads?\n  She then went on the air, and she said: I am not running them. I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\nhave anything to do with them. This is a special interest group. All I \ndid was sign the term limit pledge, and Congressman Cook didn't.\n  Congressman Cook went on the air and said: I am the victim of a smear \ncampaign. And in the minds of many voters, it was Lily Eskelson who was \ndoing the smearing. She had absolutely no control over the ads. If she \nhad, she would have pulled them. But she didn't. It was the special \ninterest group that was exercising its constitutional right, and there \nwas nothing she could do about it.\n  Congressman Cook appropriately protested: How can you attack me for \nviolating term limits when I am running for my first reelection? He had \nonly been in Congress one term. They were attacking him for being part \nof the system and not signing the term limit pledge that would have \ngiven him three terms. He said: Don't come after me until I have served \nat least the three terms you think are appropriate.\n  I think the special interest ads in the second district had a \nsignificant impact on the outcome of that election.\n  I point this out. Here is a sixth-grade schoolteacher with no money \nwho is able to outspend and outfundraise her opponent because those who \nput up the money thought she has a chance to win. That is the \ncriterion, nothing else. She lost the race because a special interest \ngroup came in and flooded the district with their ads, thinking they \nwere helping her but were in fact hurting her.\n  If we say that political parties cannot defend themselves against \nthese special interest ads, we will do exactly the thing about which \nthe Senator from New Jersey talked. We will create a situation where \nthe candidates become unimportant, and the special interest, in the \nwords of the Senator from New Jersey, ``fight over our heads in a far \nlarger context.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  This is the real world. The real world is a world in which attempts \nto get around the first amendment and attempts to find ways to regulate \npolitical speech backfire against the reformers, and they do not work.\n  One last description out of the real world. We have heard a lot on \nthis floor this afternoon about access. All right, maybe we are not \ncorrupt. We had that debate earlier last week whether or not we are all \ncorrupt. So now we are being told, well, no, we are not corrupt. At \nleast we have made that clear--not to Maureen Dowd, but to a lot of \nother people we are at least not corrupt. But we are somehow tainted by \nvirtue of the fact that we can't control this access, and access \nbecomes the issue rather than corruption.\n  As I said once before, the easiest way to get access to me is to be a \nvoter registered in the State of Utah. I will take your call, and I \nwill have you come into my office. But my opponent in this last \nelection raised this issue of access in this context. As it so happens, \nhe has been lobbying me for the entire time I have been in the Senate \nabout a program of which he is in favor. He successfully lobbied me. I \nagree with him on their program. It is microcredit. I have done \neverything I can as a member of the Appropriations Committee to \nincrease the appropriations for microcredit. And, frankly, I have been \nsuccessful. All I did during the campaign was ask him this one \nquestion: Every time you came to see me to try to lobby on behalf of \nmicrocredit, did anyone in my office ever ask you if you had made a \npolitical contribution to Senator Bennett?\n  He immediately said: No, no one ever asked me that question.\n  I said: Then why do you stand here and claim that access is for sale \nwhen you, now my opponent in this race, have had full access to my \noffice for the entire 6 years I've been here?\n  It boils down to those who are corrupt will be corrupt regardless of \nthe system; those who are not corrupt will not be corrupt regardless of \nthe system.\n  For those who say we are now far worse than we ever were, I offer two \nlast comments. No. 1, when I moved into the Dirksen Building, I noticed \nthere was a safe in every Senator's office. My father was here when the \nDirksen Building was built. Let me state why there is a safe in every \noffice--for the Senators to put the cash they receive in their offices \nfrom people who come to see them. That doesn't mean they are corrupt. \nMy father was not corrupt. But I watched him receive an envelope full \nof cash in his office in the Dirksen Building, and I watched him open \nthe safe and put it in there. It happened, by the way, to have come \nfrom one of the senior Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle who \nsaid, ``I don't want any other Republican to be the ranking member of \nmy committee; I want you to win, Wallace, and I raised this money for \nyou.''\n  It was $5,000, which in those days was in excess of 5 percent of the \ntotal cost of a campaign. Dad put it in his safe in the Dirksen \nBuilding. When my office was renovated recently in the Dirksen \nBuilding, what did I do? I took the safe out because I have never used \nit, and I don't think any other Senators ever use it. We don't get \noffered cash in our offices anymore.\n  Second, David McCullough wrote the biography of whom many considered \nthe most incorruptible President we have ever had, Harry Truman. In his \nbiography of Harry Truman, David McCullough reports that the highest \npaid individual on Harry Truman's staff was Bess Truman, who lived in \nMissouri and never came to Washington or entered the Senator's office. \nWhy was she his highest paid staff member? Because Senators routinely \ndid that in order to be able to live on their salaries.\n  According to Mr. McCullough, Harry Truman was terrified the people of \nMissouri would find out he was paying Bess the highest permissible \nsalary so he and Bess could handle the financial challenges of serving \nin the Senate. Was Harry Truman corrupt? No. Even in a corrupt system, \nand I am sure there are Senators who were, he was not a corrupt man. \nThere may have been an appearance but the appearance did not mean the \nreality.\n  They changed the system. We are now paid a living wage. We don't do \nthat anymore. We don't put our relatives on the payroll and have them \nnot show up. But let Members not sit here and say the system is far \nworse now than it ever used to be. Politics in America is as clean as \nit has ever been and far cleaner than it used to be. Let's not do what \nRobert Samuelson warns against: In the name of campaign finance reform \nmake things worse again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank our colleague from Nebraska for his \nthoughtfulness. He has been waiting a long time, as well.\n  I am a supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill, this iteration, as with \nall others. It is an important step in the right direction. However, I \nbelieve the biggest problem is that campaigning in America has become a \nnever-ending money chase. There is an election the first Tuesday in \nNovember. People sleep in on Wednesday and all the fundraising starts \nall over again on Thursday. It is truly a permanent campaign.\n  If I had my way, if I could write my version of what the Senate ought \nto do on campaign finance, we would look at some sort of approach along \nthe lines of what is used in several countries in Europe. They confine \ntheir elections to several months over a period of a couple of years. \nMoney can be raised. It has to be disclosed. It is spent. They have \ntheir election, and, heaven forbid, after a few months of campaigning, \nthey go back to tackling the issues that all Members get an election \ncertificate for--to improve health care, education, to try to stuff the \nnuclear genie back into the bottle, to create an opportunity for people \nwho work hard and play by the rules.\n  We are, obviously, not going to get that kind of reform, although I \nhave been amazed in the last few days when I have colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle say they like that and wish there was a bipartisan \nSenate task force to look at something similar. That really would be \nreform. We could spend most of our time doing a job for which we were \nelected.\n  For now, we are limited to steps that can be taken immediately that \nare effective. I have come to the floor this afternoon to talk about a \nstep that Senator Jeff Bingaman and I have developed. It is an \nimportant step in the view of Senator Bingaman and myself. It limits \nnegative campaigning.\n\n  My view from personal experience is negative ads are similar to a \nvirus.\n\n[[Page S12766]]\n\nThey infect everyone with whom they come in contact. In the special \nelection to replace Bob Packwood in the Senate, unfortunately I didn't \nsay no to some of those media consultants who told me to win, I had to \njust rip in to our colleague, my friend, Senator Gordon Smith, with \nnegative ads. I should have known immediately that all those negative \nads run contrary to everything I got involved with when I began the \nGray Panthers in Oregon to try to practice good government, but I \ndidn't step in when I should have on the negative ads, and I regret it \nto this day.\n  With a month to go before that special election, I did tell my \nconsultants I could not stand any longer the stench of the negative \nads, and I told them to take them off the air. Moreover, I apologized \nto the people of Oregon. I said I made an error in judgment and it \nwould not happen again. I ran my 1998 campaign, I am proud to be able \nto say, without mentioning my opponent at all.\n  I believe candidates ought to stand by their ads. They ought to be \ndirectly responsible for their ads. What Senator Bingaman and I will \npropose later this week is an approach we call ``stand by your ad.'' \nSpecifically, the Bingaman-Wyden proposal says a candidate who mentions \nhis or her opponent in a campaign ad must do so in person in order to \nget the lowest unit rate for advertising. Under current Federal \ncommunications law, broadcasters are required to sell commercial air \ntime to candidates for Federal office at the lowest available price, \nknown as the lowest unit broadcast rate. That means for 45 days prior \nto a primary or primary runoff, for 60 days prior to a general \nelection. In effect, everybody else in town--the car dealership, the \nrestaurant, the tire manufacturer--has to subsidize politics. Their ad \ncosts are greater because broadcasters have to give these cheaper rates \nduring the election cycle.\n  I think it is time to hold candidates personally responsible for \ntheir ads. I am amazed to find that all across the political spectrum I \nam joined in support of this idea. For example, in the House of \nRepresentatives, my Oregon colleague, Greg Walden, is a broadcaster by \nprofession. He doesn't think this is bureaucratic or hard to comply \nwith. He introduced in the House, as I did in the Senate, the ``stand \nby your ad'' approach that says candidates who mention their opponent \nhave to do it in person to get the lowest unit rate. No first amendment \nviolation here.\n  I recently received from the Library of Congress a legal opinion \nstating it would be constitutional to put in place the Bingaman-Wyden \namendment, and I ask unanimous consent that legal opinion be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1999.\n     Memorandum To : Honorable Ron Wyden. Attention: Jeff Gagne, \n         Legislative Assistant.\n     From: L. Paige Whitaker, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of Conditioning Receipt of Lowest \n         Unit Rate for Federal Candidate Broadcast Communications \n         on Compliance With Attribution Requirements.\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for an analysis of the constitutionality of a proposed \n     amendment to S. 1593 (106th Cong.), ``McCain/Feingold II,'' \n     which would amend 47 U.S.C. Sec. 315(b) to restrict the \n     availability of the lowest unit rate for campaign \n     advertising, in which a federal candidate directly references \n     an opponent, to only those radio and television broadcasts \n     where the candidate personally makes the reference. That is, \n     in the case of a television broadcast directly referencing an \n     opponent, the candidate would be required to make a personal \n     appearance and, in the case of a radio broadcast directly \n     referencing an opponent, the candidate would be required to \n     make a personal audio statement identifying the candidate, in \n     order to qualify for the lowest unit rate. Such personal \n     appearance and personal audio statements are often referred \n     to as broadcast attribution requirements.\n       In the landmark decision, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court made it clear that the right to associate is a ``basic \n     constitutional freedom'' \\1\\ and that any action that may \n     have the effect of curtailing that freedom to associate would \n     be subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny.\\2\\ The Court \n     further asserted that while the right of political \n     association is not absolute,\\3\\ it can only be limited by \n     substantial governmental interests such as the prevention of \n     corruption or the appearance thereof.\\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976) (quoting Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 \n     U.S. 51, 57 (1973) ).\n     \\2\\ Id. at 25 (quoting NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460-61 \n     (1958) ).\n     \\3\\ Id. (citing CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 567 \n     (1973) ).\n     \\4\\ Id. at 27-28.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Employing this analysis, the Court in Buckley upheld the \n     disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA), noting that the ``ability of the citizenry to make \n     informed choices among candidates for office is essential.'' \n     \\5\\ Also of relevance, the Buckley Court upheld the FECA \n     presidential public financing provisions, which condition a \n     candidate's receipt of public funding on the candidate \n     voluntarily agreeing to limit spending.\\6\\ The Court found \n     that the provisions did not infringe on free speech, but \n     rather constituted a proper means of promoting the general \n     welfare by actually encouraging public discussion and \n     participation in the electoral process.\\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ Id. at 14-15.\n     \\6\\ Id. at 57, fin. 65 (noting that ``[j]ust as a candidate \n     may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he \n     chooses to accept, he may decide to forgo private fundraising \n     and accept public funding.'')\n     \\7\\ Id. at 97-104 (finding also that conditioning receipt of \n     public funding on complying with spending limits was a less \n     onerous restriction than those in the ballot access cases \n     with respect to minor and new parties.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In view of the Supreme Court's holdings in Buckley v. \n     Valeo, it appears that the proposed amendment, to condition \n     federal candidate receipt of the lowest unit rate for \n     broadcast communications on candidates' voluntarily agreeing \n     to comply with certain attribution requirements, would be \n     upheld as constitutional. Similar to the FECA disclosure \n     requirements and presidential public financial provisions, \n     the proposal could be found to provide important candidate \n     information to the voting citizenry. Moreover similar to the \n     presidential public financing provisions, due to its \n     voluntary nature,\\8\\ the proposed amendment could be found \n     not to infringe on free speech, but rather to promote the \n     general welfare by increasing public discussion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ That is, a candidate could legally not choose to comply \n     with the broadcast attribution requirements and still \n     purchase broadcast time at a price higher than the lowest \n     unit rate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In addition, it appears that, requiring a radio or \n     television broadcaster to condition providing federal \n     candidates with the lowest unit rate for broadcast \n     communications on candidates' voluntarily agreeing to comply \n     with certain attribution requirements would also pass \n     constitutional muster under Supreme Court precedent upholding \n     reasonable access and equal time requirements.\\9\\ For \n     example, in C.B.S. v. Federal Communications Commission, The \n     Supreme Court considered a federal statute allowing the FCC \n     to revoke a broadcast license if the broadcaster willfully or \n     repeatedly failed to grant a federal office candidate \n     reasonable access to airtime or denied a federal office \n     candidate the ability to purchase reasonable amounts of \n     airtime. Although the Court did not rule that there is a \n     general right of candidate access to the broadcast media, the \n     majority held that the reasonable access statute \n     constitutionally provided, on an individual basis, legally \n     qualified federal office candidates with special access \n     rights.\\10\\ Moreover, as the Supreme Court found in Red Lion \n     Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., ``it does not violate the First \n     Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using \n     scarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire community, \n     obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of \n     great public concern.'' \\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\9\\ 47 U.S.C. Sec. 312(a)(7).\n     \\10\\ 453 U.S. 367 (1981). See also, Farmers Educational and \n     Cooperative Union v. WDAY, 360 U.S. 525 (1959) (upholding \n     F.C.C. equal time requirements.)\n     \\11\\ 395 U.S. 367, 394 (1969).\n\n       It is arguable that the subject proposal is a less onerous \n     burden on broadcast licensees than the equal time and \n     reasonable access provisions. As the Supreme Court has upheld \n     the constitutionality of the equal time and reasonable access \n     requirements, it is likely that the proposed requirement, \n     that broadcast licensees condition providing federal office \n     candidates with the lowest unit rate for broadcast \n     communications on candidate compliance with certain \n     attribution restrictions, would likewise be upheld.\n                                                L. Paige Whitaker,\n                                             Legislative Attorney.\n  Mr. WYDEN. We have a proposal the law division of the Library of \nCongress believes is constitutional which has been introduced by \nbroadcaster Gregg Walden, a conservative Republican serving in the \nother body. It is a chance to take a practical step to deal with these \nnegative ads. I believe it is possible to have a real debate about \npublic issues without taking an approach that coarsens the public \ndialog and alienates so many people from the political process.\n  I am very proud that Senator Smith and I put out a bipartisan agenda \nfor the people of our State. We said, on important things for our \nState, that politics is going to stop at the State's borders. We said \nwe do not want a part of the negative politics practiced in that \nspecial election to replace Bob Packwood. Frankly, Senator Gordon Smith\n\n[[Page S12767]]\n\nsummed it up pretty well when we talked about those negative ads after \nhe was elected to the Senate and people were talking about our working \ntogether. He asked me how I felt when he ran his ads; how my kids \nlooked at those ads?\n  I said: Well, Gordon, they were pretty upset by those ads.\n  He said: What did you tell your daughter?\n  I said: Gordon, I said when you ran those ads, me looking like I \nhadn't shaved for a couple of weeks, like a convict who had just gotten \nout of prison, I told my daughter Lilly, ``Gordon Smith doesn't mean \nthose things. He's just kidding, Lilly. He doesn't mean those negative \nads.''\n  Gordon, to his credit, said on television to the people of Oregon: I \nwant to tell Lilly Wyden she's right. I didn't really mean those things \nI was saying about her dad.\n  Madam President, colleagues, we all know that this system is out of \nkilter. We all know that. Clearly we are going to have to take some \nbold steps in a bipartisan way to put it back on track. But I ask my \ncolleagues to look seriously at the proposal that Senator Bingaman and \nI will bring to the floor later this week. It is a practical step that \nwe could take against the virus of negative ads, negative ads that \nproduce this spiraling effect where each side runs one that is more \nnegative than the previous one, and the public is alienated.\n  Our proposal, based on the analysis done by the law division of the \nCongressional Research Service, is constitutional. Frankly, it is a lot \nless intrusive than a variety of requirements imposed on broadcasters \nright now. Broadcast licensees have to comply with equal time and \nreasonable access provisions. The Supreme Court has upheld them. The \nproposal we made that broadcast licensees providing the lowest unit \nrate available to candidates actually make the candidates offer their \nstatements in person is one I am absolutely convinced the Supreme Court \nwill uphold. They upheld the equal time and reasonable access \nprovision. They will uphold this one as well.\n  It is time to change the current communications law and require, when \ncandidates reference their opponent in a radio or television ad, that \nthey have to appear in order to qualify for the lowest unit rate. If \nthey do not want the lowest unit rate, they can go about the business \nof having various anonymous groups and sources continue to attack their \nopponent. But I do not think there ought to be a constitutional right \nto a broadcasters subsidy--that is what we have today--and, \nfortunately, the Library of Congress agrees with me. I think candidates \nought to stand by their ads. Candidates for public office in the future \nought to have greater direct responsibility for their ads.\n  The amendment Senator Bingaman and I have prepared would do just \nthat. It is a complement to the proposal offered by Republican \nCongressman Gregg Walden in the other body. I hope my colleagues will \nlook favorably on it. As one who comes to the floor today to talk about \nthis negative ad question with personal experience, I will tell you I \nbelieve this issue, this question of the corrosive, ugly pettiness that \nhas dominated so much of television advertising, ought to be at the top \nof the list of the reforms we pursue in this body. It ought to be at \nthe top of our priority list, to look at ways to root out of American \npolitics the negative nature of so much of this debate.\n  We can have profound differences of opinion. We can have sharp and \nprofound differences of opinion without letting politics fall into the \ngutter of the negative, petty, ugly kind of politicking, as we have \nseen so many good people--good people--get caught up in across this \ncountry.\n  My colleague, Senator Bingaman, will have more to say about our joint \nproposal when he comes to the floor. I ask, again, when we get to this \nissue later in the debate, our colleagues look favorably on a proposal \nthat I think will make a real difference in American politics and will \nbegin to drain the swamp that has contaminated so much of our public \ndialog.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, is now recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise in support of campaign finance \nreform. I first commend my colleagues, Senators McCain and Feingold, \nfor their tireless efforts in keeping campaign finance reform alive and \nforcing the Senate to deal with its responsibilities.\n  The debate about campaign finance reform is one we need to have. All \nof us who have the high privilege to hold office have a responsibility \nto bring open and accountable government to the American people. This \nbegins with an open and accountable campaign financing system. The \nAmerican people must have confidence in such a system. Confidence in \nour political system is the essence of representative government. Our \nchallenge has been to reform the excesses of the system while \npreserving the first amendment rights of all Americans to express \nthemselves and engage in the political process.\n  In recent years, this challenge has caused Congress to shrink from \nserious attempts at campaign finance reform. We are better than that. \nAmerica deserves more than a vacuous sleepwalk through this debate.\n  The Supreme Court has said Government can regulate how campaign \nfinances are regulated as long as, No. 1, regulations are kept to a \nreasonable minimum, and, No. 2, they are designed to prevent corruption \nor the appearance of corruption. The appearance of corruption is a \nsignificant part of this debate.\n  My colleagues are not a bunch of campaign finance bandits or thugs, \nbut in a democracy where citizens freely choose their leaders, \nperception does matter because perception is directly connected to \nconfidence. Voters lose faith in the integrity of the political system \nwhen they lose confidence in the system. As they become demoralized and \ndetached, citizens lower their expectations and standards for public \nofficeholders. That produces a problem that goes beyond any remedy we \ncan offer here on the floor of the Senate.\n  No amount of legislation can prevent scoundrels from exploiting \ncampaign finance laws or any laws. We need to rise above partisan, \nideological, personal rivalries and find common ground on campaign \nfinance reform, elevate the debate, and enact relevant reforms.\n  For me, disclosure is the core of campaign finance reform. The \noverriding purpose of the campaign finance reforms enacted in the 1970s \nwas to increase transparency and accountability in the political \nsystem. Disclosure rules for all who participate in the political \nprocess need to be a part of whatever reform package we produce. The \npublic needs to see who is writing the checks, and for how much. The \nvoter needs to be aware of the flow of campaign dollars. We should not \nfear an educated and informed body politic. All elected officials have \nan obligation to be part of that educational process.\n  In recent years, interest groups have come crashing into races in the \nhome stretch, pouring huge amounts of money into radio and TV ads. All \nof us know stories of outside groups launching a late blitz of ads, \nmoving poll numbers in the final weeks or days of a campaign, and then \ndisappearing without the public knowing who they were and how much they \nspent for or against the candidate.\n  It is time to end this type of political stealth raid on campaigns. \nIf individuals and organizations are going to participate in the \nelectoral process--and they should; we encourage all individuals and \norganizations to participate--then the extent of their participation \nshould be revealed to the public. As long as the voter can see where \nthe money is coming from, and where it is going, our system will retain \nits integrity. I trust the American people to elevate this debate and \nevaluate the flow of money in campaigns.\n  In addition to the disclosure, we need to look at soft money \ncontributions to national party committees. I appreciate the legitimate \nfree speech and constitutional concerns in this area. Our purpose here \nis not to anticipate or resolve every hypothetical constitutional \nchallenge. Our job here is to make policy. If complications or honest \ndifferences of interpretation and opinion result, that is why we have a \njudicial system.\n  What I do know is this. The unaccountable status quo on soft money\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\nneeds to be changed. Most constitutional experts say an outright ban on \nsoft money probably is unconstitutional. Every court decision rendered \nso far on this issue has come down against an outright ban on soft \nmoney. But this unaccountable, unlimited flood of soft money cascading \nover America's politics should be checked. We have constitutional \nlimits on individual contributions--so-called hard money. Why then \nshould it be so outrageous to examine limits on soft money? What are we \nafraid of?\n  We need to find a middle ground between the extremes of banning soft \nmoney and leaving it unlimited, a middle ground where compromise is \npossible. We should also raise limits on donations of hard money by \nindividuals and political action committees. This can be done by \nindexing individual contributions to inflation.\n  Raising the limits would have beneficial effects. Individual \ncontributors would have an impact comparable to what Congress intended \nwhen reforms were first enacted in the 1970s. There would be more focus \non individual participation in campaign financing. More campaign money \nwould be under the direct control of candidates, making them more \naccountable for the spending and the conduct of their campaigns. \nRemember, this is hard money, accountable money.\n  These are the general principles behind the amendment I wanted to \ntalk about today. But before getting to the specifics of this \namendment, I have to say a word about the current process. We need \ncampaign finance reform, but we are not going to get it through the \npredicament in which we find ourselves today--limited opportunities for \ndebate, no opportunities for additional amendments, and no votes on \nthose amendments.\n  My colleagues, Senators Abraham, DeWine, Gorton, and Thomas, and I \nhad planned to offer amendments to McCain-Feingold today. Now we are \nleft only with the opportunity to talk about the amendments we would \nhave offered if we had been given a chance to do so.\n  The amendments my colleagues and I intended to offer contained \nseveral significant changes in current campaign finance law. I will \nfocus on the ones my colleagues and I believe are most important. Our \namendment, first, would limit to $60,000 a year the total amount of \nsoft money the national party committees combined could receive from an \nindividual, PAC, corporation, or union.\n  A donor could give all $60,000 to one committee or spread the $60,000 \nover several committees. But the aggregate soft money donation could \nnot exceed $60,000 per year. The limit would be indexed for inflation \nin future years. All union and corporate donations still would be \ntreated as soft money to be used only for party-building activities. \nUnion and corporate donations would not be treated as hard money for \nuse in express advocacy or transfers to Federal candidates.\n  This is not a ban on financial support of parties. It is a return to \nthe original intent of the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which \nworked until they were exploited and abused by, I might add, both \nparties. Nor is this a ban on political speech. There would remain many \noptions. Donors who wanted to give more money for political speech \ncould contribute to third party organizations.\n  I appreciate the legitimate free speech and constitutional concerns \nmany of my colleagues and I have about these kinds of caps. This \namendment offers a compromise that addresses the constitutional \nconcerns while moving forward with reform legislation.\n  If the cap were challenged in court within 30 days after taking \neffect, the cap would be suspended until the conclusion of the court \nchallenge. It is time now to adjust and index hard money contributions \nto inflation. For an individual, contribution limits would increase, \nfor example, from $1,000 to $3,000 per candidate per election--and so \nit would go, for PACs and all committees. In future years, all limits \nwould be indexed for inflation.\n  I have heard the argument that raising the hard money limits would \ngive the wealthy too much influence and access. If we cap soft money \nand do not adjust the hard money limits, we will chase more money into \nthe black hole of third party ads, where the public cannot view the \nflow of money. I want to bring more of that money into the sunlight, \ninto the daylight, where the American people have access to who is \ngiving money and how much. They can decide for themselves if a \ncandidate has been ``bought'' by anyone.\n\n  Financial disclosure is the core of any campaign finance reform. This \namendment would take the rules on broadcast ads that apply now to \ncandidates and extend them to all political broadcast ads.\n  Under current Federal regulations, when a candidate places a \npolitical ad with a broadcaster, the broadcaster is required to keep a \nfile on the ad that is open to any member of the public who wants to \nsee it. In that file is a record of the following: The time the spots \nare scheduled to air, the overall amount of time purchased, and the \nrates at which the ads were purchased. This information must be \nrecorded immediately and made available for public inspection.\n  Under current Federal regulations, when an interest group places a \npolitical ad with a broadcaster, it does not have to meet the same \nrequirements. The public cannot find out: Who bought the ad, when the \nad will run, how much time was purchased, and how much was paid for the \nad. It is closed from public view.\n  This amendment would require that interest group ads relating to any \nFederal candidate or issue also must go into the broadcaster's public \nfile. For those types of ads, the broadcaster would be required to \nrecord the same information it does for ads by candidates and parties, \nincluding the amount spent on the ad.\n  As with candidates and party ads, the information on these political \nads would be recorded immediately and made available for public \ninspection. There would be no added burden on the broadcaster. The \nbroadcaster would simply use the same form already used for candidate \nand party ads.\n  Full disclosure should apply to a political ad by an interest group \njust as it does for a political committee or candidate because the \nobjectives, after all, of all the ads are the same.\n  Let me make clear one thing this amendment does not do. It does not \nrequire unions, corporations, or any organization to identify \nindividual donors or provide membership lists. This amendment preserves \na reasonable balance between the public's right to know which groups \nare attempting to influence an election and the privacy rights of \nindividual donors to an interest group.\n  In conclusion, we have before us a unique opportunity to accomplish \nsomething relevant, reasonable, and meaningful. We have an opportunity \nto restore some of the confidence the American people have lost in \ntheir political system.\n  All of us in this noble profession of politics have a responsibility \nto set high standards in American politics. Improving our system that \nselects American leaders--who formulate and implement Government policy \nthat frames the governance of our Nation--is a worthy challenge. We can \nelevate the process and make it better--more open and more \naccountable--which leads to a more informed public through a more \nrelevant public debate, leading to a more accountable Government. Let \nus not squander this opportunity or debase our responsibility.\n  Before I yield the floor, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Michigan be allowed to follow me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Nebraska allow me to make a \ncouple quick comments?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand I am to speak for 20 minutes following the \nspeech of the Senator from Nebraska. Or does he have additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 7 minutes \nremaining. Was the Senator from Kentucky going to ask a question of the \nSenator from Nebraska or was he asking him to yield the floor?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Nebraska agree with me that \nsince he has 7 minutes left, it would not interfere unduly with the \nSenator from Wisconsin, who has spoken a\n\n[[Page S12769]]\n\nnumber of times over the last few days, to allow his cosponsor, Senator \nAbraham, to have the remainder of his time? Would the Senator from \nNebraska agree with the Senator from Kentucky that would be a good way \nto proceed?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I agree with the Senator from Kentucky and yield my \nremaining 7 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. With that understanding, I have no objection. I want to \nbe sure that we are not adding additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized for the remaining 7 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Michigan give me a moment to \nmake an observation?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will withhold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I assume this is off the time of the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the Senator from Nebraska. Some day \nwe are going to pass real campaign finance reform. I think the proposal \nthat my friend from Nebraska has outlined is very close to what \nsomeday, I hope, the Congress will pass. I commend him for an \noutstanding amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. May I inquire, in terms of the queue, what additional \nunanimous consent agreements have been entered into with respect to \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Following the approximately 5 minutes 15 \nseconds remaining for the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Feingold will be \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. May I ask, before the 5:45 vote that is slated, are \nthere any other unanimous consent agreements that have set aside time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are none.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask the Senator from Wisconsin if he would be willing \nto enter into a unanimous consent agreement which would allow me to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes and then have his 20 minutes following \nbecause we would still be within the timeframe for the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I am only interested in \nhaving about a minute right before the vote. Does the Senator from \nWisconsin have any problem with that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no objection to either request.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Then I ask unanimous consent that I have up to 10 \nminutes, followed by 20 minutes for the Senator from Wisconsin, \nfollowed by 1 minute for the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank my colleagues for their consideration.\n  I rise today in support of what I believe is a real, substantive \nsolution to the vexing question of campaign finance reform. To my mind \nthat question is this: how do we revive voter confidence in the \nelectoral process without violating the fundamental guidelines laid \ndown in our Constitution? The answer, I believe, lies in public \nexposure and voter knowledge. The more voters know about the sources of \na particular candidate's campaign funding, the better able they will be \nto determine whether that funding has or will interfere with the \ncandidate's ability to represent them.\n  The solution I support is in the nature of a substitute amendment. I \nhave cosponsored this amendment along with Senators Hagel, DeWine, \nGorton, and Thomas.\n  It was my hope that my colleagues and I would be able to introduce \nthis substitute on the floor and call for a vote. However, procedural \nbarriers have been created which have undermined meaningful debate on \nthis issue. In the end, these procedural barriers have prevented my \ncolleagues and I from submitting our substitute for a vote. However, \nbecause I believe campaign finance reform is a critical issue which \nwill be with us for some time to come, I feel compelled to say a few \nwords about the contents of the substitute.\n  I believe that provisions in the substitute correct key, perceived \nproblems in our campaign financing system. The first section of the \nsubstitute would increase disclosure. It would ensure that the public, \nand the candidates' constituents in particular, are made immediately \nand continuously aware the sources of candidates' financing. It also \nwould ensure public notification of any candidate financing by an \noutside organization or interest seeking to influence the election.\n  How would the substitute accomplish these ends? By requiring \nadditional monthly and quarterly disclosure reports for federal \ncandidates and for national political parties. The substitute would \nalso require national party committees to disclose their receipts and \ndisbursements from non-federal accounts--as they are currently required \nto do so for their federal accounts. A variety of other disclosure \ncomponents is also included in the legislation.\n  The second section of the substitute imposes reasonable restrictions \non soft money. I am very concerned about the constitutional \nimplications of a complete ban on soft money. Thus, our substitute \nwould place a $60,000 cap on soft money, pending an expedited review by \nthe Supreme Court. I believe this approach deals responsibly with the \nissue of soft money, without ignoring potentially serious conflicts \nwith the first amendment.\n  Also included within the substitute is a provision that would raise \nindividual and PAC contribution limits to adjust for inflation. The \npresent limits have been in place since 1974, when the first law \nregarding campaign finance was passed by the Congress. It is clearly \njustifiable that these limits be raised to reflect the present economic \nrealities while maintaining the disclosure provisions so that the \npublic can continue to be informed about the sources of financing.\n  In addition, I would have liked to have been given the opportunity to \nsubmit an additional amendment to campaign finance legislation. I would \nhave introduce an amendment limiting non-constituent contributions to \n50 percent of the total raised by the candidate. This amendment would \naccomplish a multitude of goals. It would instill a guideline for the \ncandidates, instill confidence in the voters, and would help dispel the \nall too common notion that candidates are improperly influenced by \ncampaign contributions. In my view it is not difficult for a politician \nto arrange financing in a way that avoids the appearance as well as the \nreality of corruption.\n  In the context of my amendment, all federal candidates would have to \nfollow the same rules, dictating that they receive no more than 50 \npercent of overall contributions from PACs and out of state donors. \nPolitical committees that do not have their national headquarters \nwithin the candidate's state would be considered ``out of state'' \ncontributions for these purposes. Any individual who is not a legal \nresident of the candidate's state and contributes $200 or more to a \ncandidate would also be considered an ``out of state'' donor.\n  Why do I suggest such an approach? Because I don't think we are \naddressing the serious perception problems that exist with respect to \ncampaign reform when we stand on the floor and focus all of the \namendments on who gives money to the national parties.\n  The fact is the party is not the individual who is on the floor of \nthe Senate casting votes. It is the 100 Members of the Senate. I \nbelieve what is relevant is who supports us. Can we claim to represent \nconstituents if more than 50 percent of the money we receive from our \ncampaigns come from people we don't represent? I argue the answer to \nthat is no.\n  I think much more than contributions to the national parties \nundermines our constituents' confidence that when we are on the floor \nwe are acting in the best interests of our constituents and our States. \nIn my judgment, this type of amendment--one that, unfortunately, will \nnot be voted on--is an important and integral part of any legitimate \ncampaign reform proposal. I am certain Federal candidates would find \nthat they can run successful campaigns with this 50-percent imposed \nlimit. More importantly, these limits would increase politicians' \naccountability to their own constituents and decrease the appearance of \nout-of-State special interest influence.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of my proposed amendment be printed \nin the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12770]]\n\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON OUT-OF-STATE CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431 et seq.), as amended by section 2, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 324. LIMIT ON OUT-OF-STATE CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--A candidate for nomination to, or \n     election to, the Senate or House of Representatives or the \n     candidate's authorized committees shall not accept an \n     aggregate amount of funds during an election cycle from \n     individuals that are not legal residents of and political \n     committees (other than a national political committee of a \n     political party or a Senatorial or Congressional Campaign \n     Committee of a national political party) that do not have \n     their national headquarters within the candidate's State in \n     excess of an amount equal to 50 percent of the total amount \n     of contributions accepted by the candidate and the \n     candidate's authorized committees during the election cycle.\n       ``(b) Exception.--For purposes of the limit under \n     subsection (a), a contribution in an aggregate amount of less \n     than $200 in an election cycle from an individual who is not \n     a legal resident of the candidate's State shall not be taken \n     into account.\n       ``(c) Time to Meet Requirement.--A candidate shall meet the \n     requirement of subsection (a) on the date for filing the \n     post-general election report under section 304(a)(2)(A)(ii).\n       ``(d) National Headquarters.--In the case of a political \n     committee which is a separate segregated fund under section \n     316(b)(2)(C), the term `national headquarters' means the \n     national headquarters of the entity which establishes and \n     maintains such fund.''.\n       (b) Definition of Election Cycle.--Section 301 of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(20) Election cycle.--The term `election cycle' means the \n     period beginning on the day after the date of the most recent \n     general election for the specific office or seat that a \n     candidate is seeking and ending on the date of the next \n     general election for that office or seat.''.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I believe the substitute, which I cosponsored with \nSenators Hagel and Thomas and Gorton and DeWine, along with my proposed \namendment, is the better way to reform campaign financing. I think it \nstrikes a reasonable balance between addressing the issues of \ncorruption with the constitutional concerns. I only wish these \namendments had been allowed to reach the floor. I can assure my \ncolleagues that I will continue to support real constructive campaign \nfinance reform.\n  As I say, it is unfortunate that the structure of our procedures \nwon't allow us to offer these variations. I think it is obvious to all \nAmericans that right now we have an impasse.\n  The reason we have an impasse is because we have essentially only one \nalternative that is being treated as the only option available with \nrespect to campaign finance reform. Clearly, the way to break a \nlegislative logjam is to consider other alternatives. That is what the \nSenator from Nebraska and I are trying to do. Perhaps it won't happen \nin the context of this year's debate, but I hope in future debates we \nwill go beyond the simple all-or-nothing approach that we have had in \nrecent debates and give the rest of us a chance to have our amendments \nconsidered and voted on. I think that is the only way we are going to \nget to a conclusion that does, in fact, change the process, and for the \nbetter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. If there is time remaining, I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend the Senator from Michigan, one of the \nMembers of this body who truly understands this issue. I think the \namendment he and the Senator from Nebraska have offered is a very \nimportant step in the direction that I ultimately think we will take--\nif we ever get serious about doing this on a bipartisan basis, rather \nthan in a way that advantages one side and disadvantages another.\n  So I wanted to commend the Senator from Michigan for his outstanding \nwork.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I haven't used all of \nmy time, so I am happy to yield back the remainder of my time and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, in a few minutes, the Senate, for the \nfirst time--let me reiterate that--for the first time, the Senate will \ngo on record on the central issue in this debate: Should the Senate ban \nsoft money?\n  It is a simple question that has a simple answer. And soon, finally, \nwe will see where each Senator stands.\n  The fact that our current campaign finance system has created an \nappearance of corruption justifies Congress acting to ban soft money. \nIn fact, if we don't act, we create the appearance that we don't care \nabout corruption. Creating a legislative record of the appearance of \ncorruption is critical because the Supreme Court has held that not just \nactual corruption but an appearance of corruption is adequate reason \nfor the restrictions on the speech represented by campaign contribution \nlimits.\n  Madam President, this is the central misunderstanding or flaw in the \nopposition's position. They have premised everything in this debate on \nthe idea that you have to show individual Senators who are guilty of \ncorruption. Well, of course, that isn't the standard at all. That isn't \nthe law. Let me quote from the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v. \nValeo because this is a crucial concept that opponents of reform often \nseek to ignore. The Court said:\n\n       Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro \n     quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of \n     corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions.\n\n  Madam President, I really don't think there is any doubt that our \ncurrent system presents the appearance of corruption. And it isn't just \nsoft money. We see it every day in the newspapers, and we hear it on \ntelevision talk shows. It is portrayed as common knowledge, \nconventional wisdom, on radio talk shows that the votes of politicians \nare bought and paid for by special interests. When the Senator from \nKentucky stands up and says that ``people contribute to our campaigns \nbecause they agree with what we are doing,'' I am sure he is sincere, \nbut the public thinks there is something more than general feelings of \nsupport or like-mindedness at work when somebody hands over hundreds of \nthousands of dollars.\n  Let me give some examples of news stories in just the last three \nweeks that drive this point home. All of them make it perfectly clear \nto me, and I think to almost any American, that political donations are \ngenerally a way of attempting to buy influence and access. All of them \nadd to the record that there is an appearance of corruption out there \nthat justifies the Congress taking action to ban soft money.\n  Madam President, if this applies to hard money contributions, it \nsurely must apply far more easily and obviously to soft money \ncontributions.\n  Exhibit A is a story from the National Journal of October 2, 1999. I \nask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Journal, Oct. 2, 1999]\n\n                   Banking on Paxon's GOP Credentials\n\n                          (By Peter H. Stone)\n\n       It sure didn't take long for former Rep. Bill Paxon, R-\n     N.Y., to shake up Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, the home \n     of Democratic superstars Robert S. Strauss and Vernon E. \n     Jordan. At Paxon's behest, the blockbuster law and lobbying \n     firm has joined the Republican National Committee's elite \n     Team 100, whose members give $175,000 to the party every four \n     years.\n       Since he joined Akin, Gump in January, after sifting \n     through a score of job offers, Paxon, the former chairman of \n     the National Republican Congressional Committee, has worked \n     diligently to boost the firm's standing in GOP circles. \n     Moreover, Paxon's arrival at Akin, Gump reflects the \n     determination of K Street firms loaded with Democratic ties \n     to adjust to the GOP's control of Congress.\n       It was no secret that Akin, Gump needed a GOP star. After \n     the 1996 presidential elections, the firm courted Bob Dole, \n     the GOP nominee and a former Senate Majority Leader. But \n     instead he joined another heavily Democratic firm, Verner, \n     Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand. Two years later, \n     Akin, Gump recruited Paxon aggressively and nabbed him as a \n     ``senior advisor'' for an annual salary of about $750,000. \n     Paxon gets an office next to Strauss, to boot.\n       Paxon, who was instrumental in the GOP's 1994 takeover of \n     the Congress, enhances Akin, Gump's credibility among \n     Republicans. After all, he has raised big bucks for House GOP \n     leaders, the party committees, and the leading presidential \n     contender George W. Bush, the Texas Governor. He has already \n     attracted roughly a dozen new clients to the firm, including \n     Americans for Affordable Electricity--a coalition of energy\n\n[[Page S12771]]\n\n     producers, led by Enron Corp., and large users, such as the \n     chemical industry--which backs quick utility deregulation. \n     Paxon also earns his keep by advising several long-standing \n     Akin, Gump clients on lobbying strategy.\n       Paxon conceded that Akin, Gump had a lot of fence-mending \n     to do with the GOP. ``The firm had a reputation as a \n     Democratic firm, unfairly so,'' he said. Despite the presence \n     of such GOP stalwarts as Donald C. Alexander, Smith W. Davis, \n     and Barney J. Skladany, the firm's superstars are former \n     Democratic National Committee Chairman Strauss and President \n     Clinton's golfing buddy Jordan. Joel Jankowsky, who heads the \n     firm's lobbying team, is also a Democrat. ``We have needed to \n     ratchet up our Republican profile to another level,'' Paxon \n     added.\n       Paxon, 45 and a nonlawyer, is certainly trying. Since \n     coming on board, Paxon has helped host 20 fund-raisers for \n     House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, House Majority \n     Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, Senator Majority Whip Don Nickles of \n     Oklahoma, and others in the GOP. What's more, Paxon and his \n     colleagues raised more than $250,000 for an NRCC dinner \n     earlier this year and another $150,000 for a GOP Senate-House \n     dinner. In late August, Paxon helped Hastert during the \n     Speaker's successful fund-raising trip to Las Vegas.\n       Not surprisingly, NRCC Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia is a \n     huge Paxon fan. ``Bill is still a very integral part of the \n     culture over here,'' said Davis, who talks to Paxon a couple \n     of times a week. ``He's been helpful in building bridges to \n     groups. I consider him a right arm up here.''\n       Paxon is also one of a small number of K Streeters who meet \n     regularly with Hastert to discuss party strategy and to swap \n     information. He does the same with Chief Deputy Majority Whip \n     Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who holds weekly meetings with lobbyists. \n     During a recent session, Paxon maintained that the GOP should \n     not worry too much about its record on Capitol Hill this \n     year, because the party's generic poll numbers remain high as \n     a result of the public's ``fatigue'' with the Clinton \n     Administration and other factors.\n       Nationally, Paxon has proved to be a key fund-raiser and \n     strategist for Gov. Bush. Paxon has raised more than $100,000 \n     for Bush, with a major slice of the money coming from New \n     York state. On Oct. 4, Paxon will co-host events in Buffalo \n     and Rochester that are expected to pull in close to $500,000 \n     for the Bush campaign. Campaign sources say that Paxon is \n     likely to be named a member of Bush's national finance \n     committee when the panel is expanded later this year.\n       Paxon has helped to secure congressional endorsements for \n     Bush, whom he has visited three times in Austin. Paxon was \n     instrumental in lining up Blunt as the point man for the Bush \n     campaign in the House. In addition, he has advised the \n     campaign on tapping various House members for fund-raising \n     and other help.\n       Paxon's fund-raising skills, plus the experience he gained \n     during five terms in Congress, have seemingly proved magnets \n     for new business. Although he is barred by ethics rules from \n     lobbying on Capitol Hill until next year, Paxon said he \n     offers clients a cornucopia of other services. ``I help \n     clients understand what kind of lobbying, grass-roots, and \n     PAC (political action committee) programs they need to be \n     effective in Washington.''\n       As for clients, Paxon is doing well. Americans for \n     Affordable Electricity, for example, is paying the firm \n     approximately $500,000 a year for Paxon's services, according \n     to coalition sources. Paxon is the group's national chairman. \n     What does Paxon do to merit such fees? For the AAE, Paxon has \n     offered advice about how to approach members and what \n     arguments sell well on Capitol Hill. He has also helped \n     organize fund-raisers that the coalition has held for key \n     members of the House Commerce Energy and Power Subcommittee, \n     including its chairman, Joe Barton, R-Texas. Paxon is a \n     former member of the panel.\n       In late September, Paxon and Marc D. Yacker, a member of \n     the coalition's steering committee and a lobbyist for the \n     Electricity Consumers Resource Council, attended a luncheon \n     with aides to roughly a dozen Governors to discuss utility \n     deregulation. Paxon has helped at the coalition's press \n     conferences and been a guest on several radio talk shows. \n     Paxon's name is also featured in the coalition's advertising \n     campaign.\n       Several coalition leaders give Paxon high marks. ``The very \n     fact that his name is on all the ads and that he's associated \n     with the issue and the cause is a major boost to the \n     coalition's legislative efforts,'' Yacker said.\n       But another coalition source complained that Paxon has \n     failed to raise enough money to enable the coalition to \n     compete with the utility industry's lobbying and advertising \n     efforts.\n       Paxon, a Buffalo native, has corralled new clients in areas \n     ranging from financial services to construction. Not \n     surprisingly, some of that business comes from the Empire \n     State. For instance, Paxon brought in the New York State \n     Health Facilities Association, which is seeking additional \n     Medicare reimbursement money. Moreover, Paxon is permitted to \n     lobby lawmakers outside Washington, and he has already done \n     some work in Albany, N.Y., for PG Generating Co., a unit of \n     Pacific Gas & Electric Co.\n       Paxon also devotes a fair chunk of his time to helping the \n     firm's longtime clients, such as AT Corp. In late \n     September, Paxon participated in a morning press briefing \n     hosted by the Competitive Broadband Coalition--of which AT \n     is a key member--to introduce a multimillion-dollar \n     television ad drive that will run in about 23 states and \n     inside the Beltway. The coalition's ad message is aimed at \n     countering lobbying by some Baby Bells, which want to \n     revise the 1996 Telecommunications Act to allow them to \n     provide high-speed data services in the long-distance \n     market. Paxon will also advise the coalition on \n     legislative strategy.\n       The lobbying battle has a personal dimension for Paxon. His \n     wife, former Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y., represents \n     iAdvance, a coalition that includes several Baby Bells. \n     ``Every now and then, we square off,'' quips Paxon. ``It's \n     not exactly (James) Carville and (Mary) Matalin.''\n       According to Paxon, his move from Capitol Hill has proved \n     to be relatively smooth. ``In the leadership, we spent a lot \n     of time strategizing on legislative issues, working on the \n     public angles, and trying to keep an eye on the big \n     picture,'' he added. ``It's the same downtown.''\n       Of course, Paxon's transformation from congressional leader \n     to thriving lobbyist, a success greased by plenty of campaign \n     cash, has provoked some indignation from longtime critics of \n     the money game. ``Bill Paxon may have changed jobs, but he \n     doesn't appear to have changed his role as a big-time player \n     in the Washington influence-money game,'' said Fred \n     Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a group that \n     advocates campaign finance reform.\n       But at Akin, Gump, legendary lobbyist bob Strauss is \n     bursting with pride about the success of the firm's \n     Republican hire. ``He fit in from day one,'' crows Strauss. \n     ``He's a franchise player. He'll continue to make \n     contributions, not just to the business of the firm, but the \n     character and the culture of the firm.''\n       Akin, Gump is banking on that.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this article reports that former \nRepresentative Bill Paxon, who retired last year, has signed with the \nlaw firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. Akin Gump is one of \nthe powerhouse lobbying firms in Washington. Its partners include big \nname Democrats Robert Strauss and Vernon Jordan. Paxon is not a lawyer, \nso his title is ``senior advisor.'' What that means is that he will be \na lobbyist and ``rainmaker'' for the firm.\n  Apparently, Akin Gump, a firm known for its Democratic Party ties, \nhired Mr. Paxon to ``mend fences'' with the Republican Party. And how \ndoes Mr. Paxon do that? According to this article, the main thing he \ndoes is raise money for Republican Members of Congress and the \nRepublican Party. The National Journal reports that Paxon has helped \nhost 20 fundraisers for the Speaker of the House, the House majority \nwhip, the assistant majority leader in the Senate, and other Republican \noffice holders. He has also raised more than $250,000 for an NRCC \ndinner, and another $150,000 for a Republican House-Senate dinner this \nyear. He has raised over $100,000 for Presidential candidate George W. \nBush.\n  Let me quote from the article:\n\n       Not surprisingly, NRCC chairman, Tom Davis of Virginia, is \n     a huge Paxon fan. ``Bill is still a very integral part of the \n     culture over here,'' said Davis, who talks to Paxon a couple \n     of times a week. ``He's been helpful in building bridges to \n     groups. I consider him a right arm up here.''\n\n  The article reports that Mr. Paxon participates in a weekly meeting \nthat lobbyists hold with Majority Whip DeLay and meets regularly with \nSpeaker Hastert.\n  The article continues:\n\n       Paxon's fundraising skills, plus the experience he gained \n     during five terms in Congress, have seemingly proved magnets \n     for new business. Although he is barred by ethics rules from \n     lobbying on Capitol Hill until next year, Paxon said he \n     offers clients a cornucopia of other services.\n\n  Madam President, let's leave aside the revolving door problems in Mr. \nPaxon participating in weekly meetings that Mr. DeLay holds with \nlobbyists. Can there be any question that that is an appearance \nproblem? Here we have a former Member of Congress whose stock in trade \nis raising big money for congressional leaders and candidates. Do we \nreally blame the public for thinking he is getting special treatment \nfor his clients?\n  Mr. Davis calls him an integral part of the culture over here. Just \nwhat kind of culture is this? Certainly not the kind of culture I would \nbe proud to tell my children and grandchildren about. Certainly not a \nculture that we should nourish and preserve for the future of our \ndemocracy.\n  He is a right arm for the congressional leadership? The public might \nbe excused for asking: Just who is the right arm for whom in this \nrelationship?\n  Exhibit B. On October 5, the day before the House considered the \nPatients'\n\n[[Page S12772]]\n\nBill of Rights, according to press reports, officials for Cigna, Blue \nCross-Blue Shield, and Aetna held a $1,000 per plate breakfast \nfundraiser for the Speaker of the House. Press reports the next day \nsaid that 15 or 17 health insurance industry lobbyists attended the \nevent. Atlanta Constitution columnist Tom Baxter wrote the following:\n\n       The condition of the political ground could be judged by \n     the keen attention of all the television networks to a \n     breakfast fund-raiser this week at which insurance lobbyists \n     arrived with checks for Hastert and others. Not that such \n     scenes aren't common these days, but the timing made this a \n     photo-op for campaign finance reform.\n\n  Indeed. I remember seeing reports on the national TV news about this \nevent. And I thought to myself: ``what can the average American \nwatching on TV think about this scene?'' ``How can anyone not think \nthis is wrong?'' Actual corruption? We will never know. The appearance \nof corruption? Without a doubt. The headline of this AP news story \ntells it all: ``Insurers Give Speaker Thousands on Eve of Vote.''\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this article from the \nBergen County Record on this fundraiser be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Bergen County (NJ) Record, Oct. 6, 1999]\n\n             Insurers Give Speaker Thousands on Eve of Vote\n\n                            (By David Espo)\n\n       One day before a closely watched vote on health care, House \n     Speaker Dennis Hastert attended a fund-raising breakfast \n     Tuesday with industry representatives who gave $1,000 apiece \n     to his political war chest.\n       ``I'd like to ask them about sitting down with America's \n     families instead,'' President Clinton chided from the White \n     House as he sought to build support for legislation granting \n     patients the right to sue their health insurance companies.\n       Hastert, who opposes the bill, defended his previously \n     scheduled meeting and sought to turn the tables on the White \n     House. ``Mr. President, I hope you will say no to helping \n     trial lawyers, and say yes to helping the 44 million \n     Americans who want health-care coverage,'' the Illinois \n     Republican said in a written statement.\n       The exchange underscored the deep philosophical and \n     political gulf between the two parties on health care at a \n     time when government statistics show the number of uninsured \n     continues to increase.\n       The White House, most Democrats, and some Republicans are \n     supporting legislation to strengthen patients hands in \n     dealing with their managed care companies. Among prerogatives \n     would be the ability to sue for damages when prescribed \n     care was denied.\n       Republicans counter that such provisions will merely raise \n     the cost of insurance and prompt some employers who now offer \n     insurance to their workers to drop it.\n       Facing a likely setback on that measure, the GOP leadership \n     is proposing a companion bill that provides numerous tax \n     breaks to make health insurance more affordable.\n       Their ``access'' bill also includes a provision opposed by \n     many Democrats to expand a current small program allowing \n     medical savings accounts. Another would give small businesses \n     the option to buy health insurance under federal rather than \n     state regulation. That would exempt them from state mandates \n     that bigger self-insured companies avoid.\n       ``It's not the severe poor who don't have health care,'' \n     Hastert told reporters. ``There are government programs that \n     reach out. It's working people today, who are working for \n     small business or who run their own shop or they go from job \n     to job, who need the ability to get health care.''\n       Hastert pledged a ``fair and open debate of the health-care \n     issue'' today when the legislation reaches the House floor.\n       The debate will come against a backdrop of a fresh \n     government report that estimates 44.3 million Americans, one \n     in six, had no health insurance coverage in 1998.\n       The Census Bureau survey found the number without coverage \n     grew by nearly a million, but overall population growth kept \n     the rate about steady, 16.3 percent in 1998, compared with \n     16.1 percent in 1997. In 1996, 15.6 percent lacked coverage.\n       Public opinion polls show the issue is high on the public's \n     list of priorities, and GOP leaders have struggled for months \n     in a narrowly divided House to keep control of it.\n       Hastert held the fund-raising breakfast for his political \n     action committee a few blocks from the Capitol.\n       Aides said it was scheduled several weeks ago. There was no \n     word on whether there was consideration of rescheduling the \n     event given the close proximity to the House's debate.\n       ``I've listened to everybody in the health-care business \n     for a long time,'' the Speaker told reporters in the Capitol.\n       ``The die is cast already on what the health legislation is \n     going to be. So there's no influence there whatsoever.''\n       An invitation to the event was issued in the name of \n     officials of Cigna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and Aetna.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, an article that appeared in the \nCapitol Hill newspaper The Hill on September 29. Here's another great \nheadline: ``Why 30 top Democratic lobbyists attended GOP chairman's \nbash.''\n  This article reports however, that 30 top Democratic lobbyists \nattended a fundraising dinner for a Republican committee chairman at \nthe home of Democratic super-lobbyist Tommy Boggs.\n  I bring this article to the attention of the Senate not to cast \naspersions on any Senator. My interest in this article is in the views \nof lobbyists on fundraising, and the appearance it creates for the \npublic that reads about it.\n  Let me quote from the article: ``Indeed, it would be tantamount to \npolitical suicide for Democratic lobbyists--or Republican lobbyists for \nthat matter--who specialize in the [the issues] that are the focus of \n[the chairman's] committee and the lifeblood of their corporate \nclients, if they desert him in his hour of need.''\n  Here are a few quotes in this article from lobbyists who were \nquestioned on the irony of Democratic lobbyists making contributions to \na powerful Republican chairman of a Senate committee. One said: ``In \nsituations like this, I tend to be a strong fan of incumbency.'' \nAnother said, ``Most lobbyists know which side their bread is buttered \non.'' And this is what a staffer on the House side had to say: ``Any \ntime you have a chairman of [a committee] running for reelection, and \nyou're lobbying . . . issues before the committee, you risk having your \nissue blown out of the water if you don't contribute to his campaign. \nThe game in this town is to support the incumbent.\n  Mr. President, I don't suggest that these lobbyists bearing gifts \nhave swayed or will sway a chairman on substantive issues, but they \nsure are trying. And I have avoided using the Senator's name because I \ndon't think he has been swayed. But we all have to admit that these \nkind of comments create a perception, an appearance, that campaign \ncontributions are given because of the effect they will have on policy.\n  Madam President, let me anticipate a question by the Senator from \nKentucky. Most of the fundraising in these articles is hard money \nfundraising, isn't it? It is all legal under our system. Thousand-\ndollar checks to candidates are permitted under the Federal election \nlaws, aren't they? The answer, of course, is yes. But what strikes me \nis the obvious appearance of corruption that is present when a lobbyist \nspecializes in throwing fundraisers for candidates or when members of \nCongress solicit even these relatively small donations from people with \nan interest in legislation, especially on the eve of a crucial vote.\n  Madam President, can there be any doubt that an outrageous appearance \nof corruption arises when the same Members of Congress are involved in \nraising hundreds of thousands of dollars of soft money in a single \nphone call for the political parties? As Justice Souter said just a few \nweeks ago at the oral argument in the Missouri case--``Most people \nassume, and I do certainly, that someone making an extraordinarily \nlarge contribution gets something extraordinary in return.''\n  That brings me to another exhibit in our legislative record of the \nappearance of corruption--a story that appeared yesterday in the \nWashington Post about the effort that the Democratic party--my party--\nis making to raise soft money in order to retake the Congress. \nAccording to the article, the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee \nincreased its soft money fundraising from $5.1 million in 1994 to $16.6 \nmillion in the '98 cycle. It is now going after the really big givers \nwith an innovation called Team 2000. The Post story describes Team 2000 \nas ``[A] new club for $100,000 and over donors who would be feted by \nthe party at exclusive events, including a weekend of clambakes and \nsightseeing.''\n  The article describes the wooing of Steven Wynn, owner of Mirage \nResorts in Las Vegas, who gave a $250,000 contribution to the DCCC in \nMay of this year. The article indicates that Wynn is angry about the \nimpeachment of the President and with the Republican failure to stop \nthe antigaming crusade of a Member of the House.\n  Incidentally, this information is not included in this particular \narticle, but\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\nI have learned that the Mirage Resorts gave an identical $250,000 \namount to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in July \nof this year.\n  So I guess Mr. Wynn got over his anger and realized that he had \nbetter play both sides of the fence, as many big soft money donors do.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this Washington Post story \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 17, 1999]\n\n                 Democrats' Fast Track Is `Soft Money'\n\n                         (By Susan B. Glasser)\n\n       The House Democrats' courtship of Steve Wynn--owner of \n     Mirage Resorts, grandiose prophet of the new Las Vegas, and \n     major Republican donor--began four years ago with a cold call \n     from David Jones, Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt's top \n     fund-raiser.\n       Wynn took the call, and soon Jones was flying out to \n     breakfast at his golf course mansion along with Rep. Charles \n     B. Rangel. The gravelly voiced New Yorker became the \n     Democratic point man, reciprocating Wynn's hospitality with a \n     tour of his Harlem district.\n       By last February, when Jones and Rangel met with Wynn in \n     his Las Vegas office, they didn't even have to make their \n     pitch. Wynn had told friends he was angry at ``mean-\n     spirited'' House Republicans for impeaching President \n     Clinton. Besides, he complained, they had neglected him, and \n     hadn't stopped Rep. Frank R. Wolf's (R-Va.) anti-gaming \n     crusade. He was ready, Wynn said, to help the Democrats \n     regain control of the House.\n       How much, Wynn asked, do you need me to help raise out of \n     Nevada for the 2000 election? Jones knew that during the \n     entire 1998 election, the House Democrats' campaign arm had \n     only collected about $110,000 from Vegas, so his answer was \n     an audacious one: $1 million to $1.5 million. Done, Wynn \n     replied.\n       The first installment--a $250,000 corporate check from \n     Mirage Resorts--was Wynn's downpayment on a bet that \n     Democrats will take back the House next year. It also \n     suggests one reason why they might succeed. With the \n     Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as their vehicle, \n     they are raising record amounts of money for next year's \n     races, trading on their new electoral competitiveness to \n     raise funds earlier and in larger amounts than ever before.\n       ``Soft money''--the term of art for the unlimited \n     contributions that corporations, unions and wealthy \n     individuals can give for so-called ``party building''--has \n     fueled an explosive growth in fund-raising for both parties \n     since the 1996 elections, when campaign operatives figured \n     out a way to legally spend it on TV ads that focused on \n     individual candidates.\n       But this year it is the House Democrats who have been most \n     aggressive in increasing the amount of soft money they raise, \n     even as they lead the campaign in Congress to eliminate it. \n     Driven by Gephardt and Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy (D-R.I.), \n     the chairman hand-picked by Gephardt, the DCCC is out to \n     reverse its traditional status ``at the bottom of the \n     fund-raising food chain,'' as former Rep. Vic Fazio (D-\n     Calif.) put it.\n       In just the first six months of this year, the DCCC raised \n     $17 million total--$9 million of that in soft money. That \n     marks a stunning 373 percent increase in soft money compared \n     with the first six months of 1997--the highest rate of growth \n     for any party committee. The fund-raising escalation \n     foreshadows an election season next year when both parties \n     will pour a million dollars or more into more than 30 House \n     races whose outcome will determine control of Congress.\n       Some of the money is from businesses like Wynn's Mirage \n     Resorts; some is from well-heeled individuals giving $100,000 \n     each, such as Slimfast founder S. Daniel Abraham, National \n     Enquirer heiress Lois Pope and Florida Marlins owner John W. \n     Henry. As of June 30, Democrats had attracted 21 six-figure \n     soft-money givers compared with 14 for Republicans, according \n     to data compiled by the Campaign Study Group. Those checks \n     came from groups or individuals who had never before made \n     such a financial commitment so early.\n       Since individual members can't raise soft money for their \n     own campaigns, the DCCC and the National Republican \n     Congressional Committee do it for them. This embrace of soft \n     money--legally meant to go only for ``nonfederal'' purposes--\n     is particularly ironic since the two campaign committees \n     exist for the sole purpose of electing federal candidates.\n       In recent years, the soft money powerhouse on Capitol Hill \n     has been the NRCC. Since the beginning of 1997, a new Common \n     Cause study found, the House Republican committee has raised \n     more of it than any other congressional committee: a total of \n     $37.8 million. So far this year, the NRCC has outraised the \n     DCCC overall $27 million to $17 million. And in House \n     Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), the subject of a story \n     Monday, the Republicans have the single most effective fund-\n     raiser in Congress.\n       But slightly less than a year before the congressional \n     elections, the House Democrats have significantly cut into \n     the GOP's fund-raising advantage.\n       The DCCC is running essentially even with the NRCC in soft \n     money raised this year, and Democrats are ahead for the first \n     time ever in cash on hand: $10.7 million to the NRCC's $10.1 \n     million.\n       ``Republicans have experienced growth,'' said David \n     Plouffe, the Gephardt strategist who is now executive \n     director of the DCCC. ``We've experienced much greater \n     growth.'' By design, the Democratic growth strategy has \n     focused on soft money, seeking contributions from a new \n     club--``Team 2000''--for $100,000 givers, and on what several \n     sources said was an organized effort to get labor unions to \n     ``frontload'' their contributions by giving as much as \n     possible early in the election cycle.\n       Republicans have hardly ignored big givers. After the \n     Democrats upped the ante, NRCC Chairman Tom Davis (Va.) \n     imitated them with his own $100,000 program--the \n     ``Business Leadership Trust,'' a name reflective of the \n     GOP's financial base. The GOP is also starting a new \n     national finance committee to recognize corporate CEOs and \n     top lobbyists. And when it comes to big checks, the NRCC \n     lays claim to the biggest single donation of the year: \n     $300,000 from Chiquita banana king Carl Lindner.\n       ``Soft money follows power,'' said Davis, recognizing that \n     the Republicans' takeover of Congress in 1994 has \n     immeasurably boosted their fund-raising capacity. But he \n     argued that Democrats have benefited most, leveraging the \n     power of the presidency for their financial gain.\n\n\n                          eroding the gop edge\n\n       For decades, Democrats have gone into campaigns knowing \n     they would be outspent. Taking over the DCCC in 1981, when \n     Republicans had a fund-raising lead of 13 to one, Rep. Tony \n     Coelho (D-Cal.) cut into that edge by convincing businesses \n     they should invest in what was then the congressional \n     majority. Coelho, now Vice President Gore's campaign \n     chairman, also professionalized the DCCC, insisting for \n     example that a campaign hire pollsters before it could \n     receive a dime from the committee.\n       But the game then was hard money--strictly limited \n     contributions of no more than $20,000 a year to party \n     committees. At the time, before a succession of court rulings \n     and Federal Election Commission cases, soft money was an add-\n     on, used to finance building projects and television studios \n     but never contemplated as a thinly veiled way around the \n     contribution limits to specific races. And so the dollar \n     amounts were low, amazingly so compared with the current \n     checks.\n       ``In retrospect, we were pikers,'' said one former Coelho \n     adviser. ``We thought we were pushing the envelope when we \n     were asking people for $5,000.''\n       And yet Coelho was a transformative figure, his close ties \n     to S power brokers and aggressive style memorialized in a \n     book, ``Honest Graft,'' by journalist Brooks Jackson that \n     showed members how the DCCC and the NRCC could become fund-\n     raising powerhouses and use that money to wield more \n     influence over campaigns. New York Republican Bill Paxon, who \n     took over an NRCC deeply mired in debt in 1993, said flatly, \n     ``Coelho was my model'' as he reinvented the committee in \n     time for House Republicans to win the majority for the first \n     time in 40 years.\n       In 1994, the last election before soft money's rise, the \n     NRCC raised $7.4 million in soft money, compared to $5.1 \n     million by the DCCC.\n       When Texas Rep. Martin Frost became chairman of the DCCC in \n     1995, he knew the Democrats were going to have to raise money \n     differently. In the minority after four decades of power, \n     they no longer had the legislative club that Coelho had \n     taught them to wield with the K Street lobbyists who \n     controlled business giving.\n       ``Once we went into the minority, we had to reach beyond \n     the PAC community in Washington,'' said Frost, who led the \n     DCCC in the 1996 and 1998 elections and is now the \n     Democratic Caucus chairman. ``We really had to work the \n     rest of the country aggressively.''\n       Clinton and his advisers supplied the blueprint, using the \n     Democratic National Committee to fund an unprecedented $35 \n     million ad campaign to boost his reelection and paying for \n     the ads with mix of hard and soft money. On Capitol Hill, \n     members quickly grasped the implications: soft money could \n     now be used to launch candidate-specific TV ads that were \n     legal as long as they avoided the magic words ``vote for'' or \n     ``vote against.''\n       Frost was planning to raise more soft money--but only to \n     fund more traditional activities, like election-day turnout \n     and overhead expenses. To start, he had to confront a party \n     committee without much of a national donor base. ``We weren't \n     really thinking about soft money,'' said Matt Angle, Frost's \n     top aide. ``We were thinking about new money.\n       When they arrived at the DCCC, Angle said, they found that \n     only 100 or so individuals had ever given more than $1,000 to \n     the DCCC. Democratic House members, still stunned by their \n     party's defeat, were reluctant to hit up their own big donors \n     for the committee. And most donors had never heard of the \n     DCCC, assuming it was an affiliate of the DNC.\n       ``We had one guy who was a $100,000 giver,'' Frost said, \n     New Jersey businessman Grover\n\n[[Page S12774]]\n\n     Connell, a rice broker who figured in the Koreagate scandal \n     of the late 1970s and as long ago as the Coelho days was \n     already giving $50,000 a year to the DCCC.'' ``He was the \n     only one we ever had,'' Frost said. ``I said, `Well, if \n     Grover will give that much, we should start asking other \n     people for larger figures.' ''\n       Meanwhile, the predicted switch in business giving was \n     coming to pass--Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-\n     Ga.) and DeLay, made an aggressive push to shut down \n     Democratic money on K Street. By the 1998 election, about 65 \n     percent of business funds were going to the House GOP.\n       Overall, the DCCC raised $16.6 million in soft money to the \n     NRCC's $27.8 million for last year's election--225 percent \n     more for the Democrats and 274 percent more for the \n     Republicans since 1994.\n       Gephardt was already a top fund-raiser, a master of ``the \n     big ask,'' and yet, said Frost, ``we didn't have 100 percent \n     of his attention.''\n       But last fall's election, when Democrats shocked even \n     themselves by whittling the House GOP's majority to just six \n     seats, galvanized Gephardt, a believer in the power of \n     political soft money since his 1988 presidential campaign \n     sputtered to a finish on Super Tuesday, several million \n     dollars in debt.\n\n\n                       gephardt aims for speaker\n\n       Two days after last year's election, Gephardt convened his \n     top advisers and started planning for the 2000 campaign. His \n     goal, it was clear, was to become speaker--not to run for \n     president. While he  didn't announce that decision until \n     February, Gephardt quickly began planning his DCCC \n     strategy, deciding to transfer virtually all his political \n     operation to the committee.\n       As chairman, Kennedy would be Gephardt's ``director of \n     sales and marketing,'' in the words of banking lobbyist Tom \n     Quinn, a longtime Kennedy family backer. Unabashed about \n     trading on his family name, Kennedy was seen by Gephardt's \n     team as a financial asset. ``Patrick being chairman means an \n     additional $10 million to $20 million for the DCCC,'' argued \n     a leading party fund-raiser.\n       Jones, Gephardt's top money man, was put on contract at the \n     DCCC. So was Richard J. Sullivan, the young lawyer who had \n     served as the DNC's finance director in the 1996 election and \n     was the lead-off witness in hearings held by Sen. Fred D. \n     Thompson (R-Tenn.) about the influx of foreign money to the \n     DNC in 1996.\n       The idea was to personalize the committee, selling donors \n     on the future speaker. Kennedy said he often tells would-be \n     contributors: `` `This is the Dick Gephardt for Speaker \n     committee.' They get that. It personalizes it.''\n       Gephardt himself calls big donors, not just to ask but also \n     to thank. ``He's the kind of guy who understands that in \n     order to get dessert, you have to eat your vegetables,'' said \n     Erik Smith, a Gephardt aide who is now the DCCC's \n     communications director.\n       Determined to take advantage of the political momentum \n     generated by the November election gains--and to play off the \n     outrage felt by Democratic donors about the GOP House's \n     impeachmnent of Clinton--the DCCC decided to focus its \n     efforts on soft money and to push earlier than ever for major \n     checks.\n       But Kennedy himself proposed the most audacious innovation, \n     according to his aides. Until then, the biggest dollar \n     program at the DCCC had been the Speaker's Club, price of \n     entry: $15,000 in hard money. Kennedy created ``Team 2000,'' \n     a new club for $100,000 and over donors who would be feted by \n     the party at exclusive events, including a weekend of \n     clambakes and sightseeing at the Kennedy family compound in \n     Hyannisport last month.\n       Big donations began to roll in: $250,000 from the \n     Communications Workers of America, whose political director \n     considers herself Kennedy's ``fairy godmother'' in the labor \n     movement; $210,000 from AFSCME; $102,000 from AT $100,000 \n     from Texas trial lawyer Walter Umphrey's firm, Price Club \n     founder Sol Price and others.\n       The Democrats are eagerly keeping score: according to the \n     sheet handed out at each week's Democratic Caucus meeting, \n     Gephardt has already collected $6.8 million for the DCCC and \n     House candidates this year, followed by Kennedy at $6.2 \n     million, aspiring Ways and Means Chairman Rangel at $1.9 \n     million and Frost at $670,000.\n       Contributors who have dramatically increased their help to \n     the House Democrats this year cite everything from personal \n     loyalty to Gephardt to disaffection with the Republicans to a \n     sense that the Democrats may lose the White House and \n     therefore need to go all-out to retake control of at least \n     one branch of government.\n       Richard Medley, a Wall Street analyst and former \n     congressional aide, mentioned all three. ``I've been a friend \n     of Gephardt's for probably ten years,'' said Medley, who \n     hosted a July dinner in New York with former treasury \n     secretary Robert E. Rubin that raised $300,000. But he also \n     referred to pessimism about Vice President Gore's chances to \n     win next November: With GOP front-runner ``George W. Bush \n     doing so well, it's important to take out an insurance policy \n     hoping to have at least one branch controlled by Democrats.''\n       Personal service from Gephardt and Kennedy also helps land \n     donors. That certainly was the case with the $100,000 check \n     from David Alameel, a wealthy Dallas dental clinic owner. \n     Alameel was already on the radar of Frost and his team, but \n     they had no idea he would become a six-figure contributor.\n       Frost duly set up the meeting with Kennedy and, in the end, \n     he said, ``Patrick was the one who convinced him.'' The \n     $100,000 check came in on June 21.\n       Indeed, Kennedy has produced a number of eye-popping checks \n     from unexpected sources, like the $100,000 from Lois Pope, \n     the Palm Beach heiress to the National Enquirer fortune. The \n     wooing of Pope included Kennedy flying to Florida to present \n     her with an award for her charity work.\n       ``One of the great joys of my job is meeting people who \n     inspire me,'' Kennedy gushed as he presented her with a \n     ``distinguished service award'' from Citibank Private Bank of \n     Florida. ``I feel the energy that they feel for this country. \n     Those of you who know Lois know that energy comes through.'' \n     That was on April 7. On May 28, the DCCC received Pope's \n     $100,000 check.\n       An even larger amount came as the result of his friendship \n     with John J. McConnell Jr., a trial lawyers for Ness Motley \n     Loadholt Richardson & Poole, a South Carolina-based firm that \n     has earned millions of dollars from representing states in \n     the tobacco settlement. Operating out of the firm's Rhode \n     Island office, McConnell worked hard to introduce Kennedy to \n     colleagues, flying him on the corporate jet so he could spend \n     time with senior partner Ronald L. Motley and hosting a \n     dinner on Capitol Hill for Kennedy, Gephardt and other trial \n     lawyers with deep pockets.\n       On June 30, the courtship paid off--with a check for \n     $250,000. ``No question about it,'' McConnell said, ``that \n     was a personal contribution to Patrick.''\n\n\n                          Spending in New Ways\n\n       That check--and all the others--will go into a new pot of \n     soft money that the DCCC will be able to spend next year in \n     ways not envisioned by the 1974 election law, which restricts \n     the parties to direct and coordinated gifts to their House \n     candidates of only about $100,000 each. The idea behind the \n     law was ``to take fund-raising out of the hands of the party \n     committees and give control of it to candidates themselves,'' \n     as GOP pollster Brian Tringali put it.\n       Instead, with soft money issue ads and sophisticated voter \n     identification programs, the parties are planning to spend \n     upwards of $500,000 or $1 million each in next year's key \n     districts. That gives the parties more say over how campaigns \n     are run, what they are saying and who they are saying it to.\n       ``Practically speaking,'' said a top Democratic fund-\n     raiser, ``you can take a race that is a $1 million House race \n     and turn it into a $3.5 million race with soft money. In a \n     day and age when parties themselves are not as strong, \n     individual party committees are stronger than ever.''\n       For Kennedy and his staff, the new emphasis on soft money \n     is simple political pragmatism. ``You can really draw a \n     direct correlation between the amount of money in a campaign \n     committee and the impact it has in terms of getting members \n     elected,'' he argued.\n       To win, Kennedy said, ``we need to raise an even greater \n     amount of money. In practical terms, that means we need to \n     raise it in bigger chunks.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how can we close our eyes to the \nappearance of corruption that this enormous fundraising effort \nprovides? How can we close our eyes to the appearance of corruption \nthat the double givers list that I have shown on this floor a number of \ntimes represents? Mirage Resorts is now on the list. Companies give \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to both political parties--hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to both political parties. What game are they \nplaying here?\n  The Senator from Kentucky said on the floor last week, ``Well, they \nhave a right to be duplicitous.'' Actually, Madam President, they are \nnot being duplicitous. We all know they are giving to both sides. They \nare just playing by the rules as we have set them up. They are not \ndoing anything that is dishonest. They are simply trying to cover their \nbases. Surely, the Senator from Kentucky doesn't think when AT gives \na big contribution to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee that it won't give money to the Senator from New Jersey's \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as well.\n  We all know why they do it, too--because in the candid words of a \nlobbyist, ``They know which side their bread is buttered on.'' Both \nsides--the bread is buttered on both sides. They play both sides of the \nfence so they can get their calls returned and their positions heard. \nThat, my friends, is on its face an appearance of corruption. And if we \nare so caught up in this fundraising game that we can't see it, the \ndisenchantment the public feels in its elected officials is well \nwarranted.\n  Last week, the Senator from Kentucky suggested that press reports \nabout the connection between campaign donations and legislative actions \narise from the desire of newspapers to\n\n[[Page S12775]]\n\nsell more copies or talking heads to get air time. But the newspapers \ndidn't create the appearance problem. We did.\n  I am reminded of what the great Senator, Robert La Follette, from my \nhome State of Wisconsin, said in response to those who argued that the \npress of his day--the early 1900s--was somehow spreading hysteria about \nthe power of the railroads over Congress. La Follette said:\n       It does not lie in the power of any or all of the magazines \n     of the country or of the press, great as it is, to destroy, \n     without justification, the confidence of the people in the \n     American Congress. . . . It rests solely with the United \n     States Senate to fix and maintain its own reputation for \n     fidelity to public trust. It will be judged by the record. It \n     can not repose in security upon its exalted position and the \n     glorious heritage of its traditions. It is worse than folly \n     to feel, or to profess to feel, indifferent with respect to \n     public judgment. If public confidence is wanting in Congress, \n     it is not of hasty growth, it is not the product of \n     ``jaundiced journalism.'' It is the result of years of \n     disappointment and defeat.\n\n  Years of disappointment and defeat--that is what the American people \nhave had as the soft money system has grown and Congress has done \nnothing about it. The system of soft money looks corrupt. Indeed, it is \ncorrupt. And it makes us, as its beneficiaries, look corrupt.\n  There is no other way to put it. There is an appearance of \ncorruption. There is an appearance of cravenness. There is an \nappearance of a smug confidence that the American people will not laugh \nout loud in disgust at the assertion that there is no corruption near. \nThere is an appearance of something terribly, terribly wrong that we \nrefuse to fix.\n  If that offends people in this Chamber, so be it. We had better get \nrid of this system so they won't be offended anymore because I am not \ngoing to stop talking about it until we do.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 19 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the Senator from North Carolina asked \nif I will yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I know the Senator has spent a great deal of time moving \nacross his home State of Wisconsin. How many counties are in Wisconsin?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Seventy-two counties.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Seventy-two counties, and the Senator has been in every \none.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I go to listening sessions in every one every year.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I wonder what the Senator would think what someone in \nrural Wisconsin, a farmer in rural Wisconsin, would believe in terms of \ntheir influence, vis-a-vis someone who gave $100,000 in soft money to, \nin our case as fellow Democrats to the Democratic Party, or to the \nDNCC, whether that rural farmer in Wisconsin would believe that they \nhave the same voice in the Senate that a $100,000 soft money \ncontributor has.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his \nquestion.\n  The example of the farmer is a wonderful example, because of what has \nhappened in Wisconsin in the last 18 years. We have lost something like \n18,000 dairy farmers, so farmers in my State are in no position to be \ngiving even $10 or $25 contributions.\n  When they hear, as the Senator is suggesting, that a person can give \neven $1,000, the possibility of doing that is pretty much off the \ncharts. When they hear that somebody can actually for the first time in \nthis century give $100,000, it is absolutely disappointing. And it must \nmake them even more despondent. They have enough problems already.\n  But to think they can't have their vote count for what it used to \ncount--we always had in Wisconsin the notion that the farm vote kind of \nshifted the balance, it is the swing vote traditionally in Wisconsin. \nBut in this kind of system where soft money ads can make a farce out of \nan election, they feel--I know from firsthand conversations--quite left \nout of the process and quite dispirited.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. How does the Senator think that farmer would feel in his \ngut about whether this representative democracy is working the way it \nought to work in a situation where he or she has at best one vote, and \nthat position vis-a-vis another individual who has given $100,000, when \nhe is working on his farm on a day-to-day basis? Does the Senator think \nthat farmer believes he has the same equal voice that he is supposed to \nhave in his representative democracy as somebody who wrote a $100,000 \ncheck.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I don't think there is any possibility that he feels \nhis voice is as strong as it used to be. A typical farmer in Wisconsin \nwith a certain amount of cows and a certain amount of acreage and a \nfamily, those are things that he had. He knew he had those things, and \nhe had his vote counting the same as everybody else's. That is where \nthe whole progressive movement in Wisconsin and the efforts of Robert \nLa Follette came from--a lot of these farmers who were able to put \ntheir votes together to elect people who would really represent them.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I could ask a followup question, there has been a lot \nof debate on the floor and a lot of private conversations about whether \nthere is any usefulness associated with simply banning soft money.\n  Let me ask the question again, using the example of this dairy farmer \nfrom Wisconsin. Does the Senator think it is important for the Senate \nto send a message to that farmer in rural Wisconsin that we are trying \nto do something real and meaningful to clean up campaign finance in \nthis country?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We absolutely have to. I don't know how we convinced \nourselves in the end of the 20th century of something that was the \nopposite conclusion at the end of the 19th century, early 20th century; \nand that is that unlimited contributions corrupt the process and make \nthe individual farmer or individual homemaker or any other person \nalmost a nonfactor in the political process.\n  We have to send this message and we have to do even better. We have \nto actually pass a ban on soft money as a first signal to that farmer \nthat we will do the rest of the job and actually return the notion of \none person-one vote to that farmer.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator agree that even if we are not able in \nthis Congress in this session to pass across-the-board comprehensive \nreform that it is critically important that we send a message to \nAmericans all over this country that this Senate and this Congress is \nwilling to take a strong and courageous step to do something real and \nmeaningful in terms of cleaning up campaign finance and that one of \nthose steps would be the banning of soft money?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. There is nothing more important than passing a ban on \nsoft money in this Congress. In a few minutes we will have the first \nvote, I say to the Senator from North Carolina, the first vote ever on \nthe question of whether we are going to allow party soft money or not. \nThis is not one of these votes that you have every once in a while, a \nbed check vote on a Monday night. This is the real thing.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina for distilling it down to the \nperspective of one farmer in Rice Lake, WI, who might be watching and \nsaying: Are these guys going to clean this place up or not?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me ask the Senator one last question. I agree. One \nlast question: In the Senator's mind, is this a party issue? Is this a \nDemocratic or Republican issue?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Clearly not. In fact, the only thing that can defeat us \non this is partisanship. That is why I worked for 5 years, not only \nwith Senator McCain but I have gotten to know a number of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle--people such as Senator Thompson of \nTennessee and Senator Collins of Maine. These are Republicans who I \nhave grown to know and enjoy working with who together have worked to \ntry to do something to ban soft money. So this is an example of how \nthis institution can work well in terms of our cooperation and \nbipartisanship.\n  Let's make sure that partisanship doesn't defeat our efforts.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and Senator McCain \nfor their courageous leadership on this critical issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly thank the Senator from North Carolina who \nin the few months he has been here has become a strong voice in the \ncampaign finance reform debate.\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Senator \nfrom Kentucky correct that the Wellstone amendment and any other \namendments that might be offered this evening would fall because they \nwere not filed by 1 p.m., if we ultimately get cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture occurs tomorrow. Amendments not \nfiled by 1 p.m. today would be out of order if they are first-degree \namendments\n  If cloture is invoked tomorrow, amendments not filed by 1 o'clock \ntoday would not be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since Friday, the open and fair process which was \nsought and agreed to has been derailed by parliamentary maneuvering.\n  Let me say to all of my colleagues, particularly those on my side of \nthe aisle who share the view of the majority leadership and myself on \nthis issue, this motion to table is a meaningless vote and should \nreflect that fact. Consequently, I urge all of my colleagues to vote \nagainst tabling on behalf of the majority leader, Senator Bennett, and \nmyself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. With the remaining minute, I say to my friend from \nWisconsin who is still on the floor, I appreciate very much the \nSenator's attempt to make this a bipartisan issue. The fact is, \nDemocrats have voted time, after time, after time to invoke cloture on \ncampaign finance reform, and we have been thwarted by the majority; is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the Senator from Nevada, we have not been \nthwarted by the majority, only thwarted by that portion of the majority \nwhich is actually a minority seeking to filibuster this issue and defy \nthe will of the majority of the people, which, of course, involves more \nDemocrats than Republicans.\n  Mr. REID. By a considerable number, is that not true?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is true.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Reid amendment numbered 2299 to the Daschle amendment \nnumbered 2298. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, in January of this year I reported on an \nimportant public-private partnership to protect our nation's \nunderground infrastructure--electric power and fiber optic cables, \ntelephone lines, water and sewer mains and pipelines. This partnership \nis based on S. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act, which \nI introduced in 1997 with the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle. The \nbill passed the Senate unanimously and became law as part of the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21.\n  Among other things, the bill called on the Secretary of \nTransportation to convene a comprehensive study of best practices in \nunderground damage prevention. This study was completed and released by \nSecretary Rodney Slater on June 30, 1999. The study has been a model \nfor conducting a cooperative effort between the public and private \nsectors. All those with an interest in underground damage prevention--\nthe excavation community, one-call notification center representatives, \nlocating contractors, railroads and underground facility operators \nworked together to produce the 250-page ``Common Ground'' report. This \nreport is a veritable gold mine of practical real-world advice for all \nthose involved in protecting our underground infrastructure in \ngovernment and in the private sector.\n  The study is so valuable because of the 160 people with hands-on \nexperience in underground damage prevention who worked together to \nwrite it. Nine teams covered the key aspects of underground \ninfrastructure protection: one-call center practices, excavation, \nmapping, locating and marketing, compliance, planning and design, \nreporting and evaluation, public education, and emerging technologies. \nThe full study is available at the DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety web \npage http://ops.dot.gov.\n  Steps are underway to keep this valuable and cooperative spirit alive \nand make the Common Ground process a continuing one, but this time with \nprivate leadership. This year's Senate Appropriations Committee Report \non\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\nTransportation Appropriations (S. Rept. 106-55) including the \nfollowing:\n\n       The Committee believes that the group effort, dubbed \n     ``Common Ground'', has the potential to serve as a basis for \n     a self-sustaining entity that can advance underground damage \n     prevention by identifying and encouraging best practices, \n     providing badly needed public education, and collecting and \n     disseminating information on damage to underground \n     facilities. The Committee directs OPS to use existing \n     resources to support the formation and initial operation of a \n     non-profit organization that will further the work of \n     ``Common Ground'' and implement other innovative approaches \n     to advance underground damage prevention.\n\n  On October 28, the Office of Pipeline Safety will respond to this \ndirection by convening a public meeting of the Common Ground \nparticipants and an even wider group of interests to lay the foundation \nfor the non-profit organization described in this Report language. This \nnon-profit damage prevention organization could be the key to a far \nmore robust and effective national effort to protect our underground \ninfrastructure that would be led and funded by the private sector.\n  To Secretary Slater's credit, the Department understands the \nimportance of letting the private participants take the lead. The \nDepartment of Transportation will provide the initial resources for \nstartup, but will then step back, so the private participants can be \nresponsible for defining the path forward for underground damage \nprevention. In order to succeed, the new non-profit organization cannot \nbe federally run or federally controlled. To succeed it cannot be run \nor controlled by any one of the interests in underground damage \nprevention. It must be a cooperative, power sharing enterprise in which \nexcavation community, one-call notification center representatives, \nlocating contractors, railroads, underground facility operators and \nother important interests join together to make decisions \ndemocratically.\n  The potential for such an organization to get things done is simply \nenormous, because it can include all the important affected interests \nfrom the beginning. The private effort and resources devoted to \nunderground damage prevention today are very significant, but \nfragmented. This non-profit damage prevention organization is the \nmissing piece that can pull these efforts together in a constructive \nway to create a powerful national impact on the largest preventable \nthreat to our underground infrastructure. I urge all those in \nattendance at the October 28 meeting to keep this big picture vision \nfirmly in mind. This is a tremendous opportunity that should not be \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Secretary of Transportation Rodney \nSlater for seizing the opportunity offered by the Common Ground \ninitiative. It seems to me that Secretary Slater, Research and Special \nPrograms Administrator Kelley Coyner and Office of Pipeline Safety head \nRichard Felder all have this exactly right. This effort will be most \neffective if it is privately led and privately funded. This is an \ninstance, all too rare, where the Federal Government is seeking to \nreturn power to the private sector. I urge all the Common Ground \nprivate participants--the excavation community, one-call notification \ncenter representatives, locating contractors, railroads, insurance \nproviders, equipment manufacturers and underground facility operators \nto take up the leadership responsibility the Secretary is offering.\n  I will continue to monitor developments in underground damage \nprevention and the efforts to set up the non-profit privately led \norganization envisioned in the Senate Appropriations Committee Report. \nI look forward to working with all involved to further improve \nprotection of our vital underground infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12777-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12777-S12778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we reach the end of this session of \nCongress, it's essential that we act on the Patients' Bill of Rights \nbefore we adjourn. In passing the Norwood-Dingell bill two weeks ago, a \nsolid, bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives voted for \nstrong protections for patients against abuses by HMOs. Despite an \nextraordinary lobbying and disinformation campaign by the health \ninsurance industry, the House approved the bill by a majority of 275-\n151. Sixty-eight Republicans as well as almost every Democrat in the \nHouse stood up for patients and stood firm against industry pressure.\n  Last Friday, the Senate appointed its conferees. Speaker Hastert has \nsaid that the House will appoint its conferees this week. Prompt action \non strong reforms is clearly within our grasp. But a series of recent \nstatements and actions provide ominous signs that the insurance \nindustry and its friends in the Republican leadership are at it again. \nTheir emerging strategy seems once again to be to delay and deny the \nrelief that American families need and that the House overwhelmingly \napproved.\n  The House vote was a major milestone toward enacting needed reform. \nIt came after the Senate passed legislation with only sham protections \nby a narrow, partisan majority.\n  It came after years of delay and denial by the Republican leadership \nin both Houses of Congress, working hand-in-hand with the health \ninsurance companies and HMOs to block reform.\n  Patients and doctors won a clear victory in the House. But now, the \ninsurance industry and their allies in the House and the Senate \nRepublican leadership are once again mobilizing to deny patients and \ndoctors the protections they deserve. The ink is barely dry on the \ndramatic House vote, and opponents of reform are already talking about \na new strategy of delay and denial--a strategy once again to put HMO \nprofits first and patient protections last.\n  The first part of this emerging strategy is to delay the work of the \nHouse-Senate conference committee as long as possible. A precondition \nfor appointing conferees and beginning the conference is formal \ntransmission of the House-passed bill to the Senate. That process \nnormally takes a day or two at most.\n  In fact, of 252 bills passed by the House in this Congress, the \noverwhelmingly majority were delivered to the Senate the day they were \npassed or the day after they were passed. Except for a few bills passed \njust before the beginning of a long recess, every bill passed by the \nHouse had been received by the Senate by the sixth day after passage. \nYet, on the seventh day after the passage of the Norwood-Dingell bill, \nthe legislation was still being held in the House of Representatives.\n  Only after the release of a CRS study documenting the extraordinary \ndelay in transmission of the legislation was the bill forwarded to the \nSenate and Senate conferees appointed.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, Senator Lott's response to \npassage of the House bill was that ``House-Senate conferences on other \nlegislation have a higher priority and that resolving differences on \nthis bill would take some time.''' According to the Baltimore Sun, \nSenator Lott also indicated that Congress might not have time to work \nout the differences and approve a final bill before it adjourns for the \nyear. According to the New York Times, aides to Senator Nickles said \nthat ``the conference committee will probably not begin serious work \nuntil early next year.'' And just this past Friday, CongressDaily \nreported that ``a Senate GOP aide said . . . Republicans do not plan to \nstart the conference before the end of this year's session, despite the \nappointment of conferees.''\n  Some Republicans are already beginning to lay the groundwork for a \nfailed conference. Comparing the Senate and House bills, Congressman \nBill Thomas said, ``You don't see many cross-breeds between Chihuahuas \nand Great Danes walking around.''\n  And, of course, the fingerprints of Republican-industry collaboration \nare there to see for anyone who cares to look. As Bruce Josten of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce put it, ``To see nothing come out of the \nconference is my hope. The best outcome is no outcome.''\n  Even if the strategy of delay and denial fails, the Republican \nleadership once again has an alternative to try to weaken the House \nbill as much as possible.\n  As the Baltimore Sun reported, ``House Majority Whip Tom DeLay \nsuggested that the Republican-dominated House conference would not \nfight vigorously for the House-approved measure in the Conference \nCommittee.'' Mr. DeLay said, ``Remember who controls the conference: \nthe Speaker of the House.''\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\n  A conference that produces legislation that looks like the Senate \nRepublican bill would break faith with the American people, make a \nmockery of the overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives, and \ncause unnecessary suffering for millions of patients.\n  That is why more than 300 groups representing patients, doctors, \nnurses, and other caregivers, and families support the Norwood-Dingell \nbill, but only the insurance industry supports the Senate proposal.\n  For every patient right in the Senate Republican bill, there is an \nindustry loophole. If the truth in labeling law applied to legislation, \nevery page of the bill would flunk the test, because every promise of \npatient protection comes with loopholes to protect HMOs and health \ninsurers. The promise to patients is always broken.\n  At its most basic level, the decision before Congress is whether \ncritical medical decisions will be made by doctors and patients, or HMO \naccountants.\n  It is time to protect families against abuses by a faceless insurance \nbureaucracy that can rob average citizens of their savings and their \npeace of mind, and often their health and their very lives.\n  For the millions of Americans who rely on health insurance to protect \nthem and their loved ones when serious illness strikes, the Norwood-\nDingell bill is a matter of life and death, and deserves to be passed \nby Congress.\n  Every day we delay in passing these reforms means that more patients \nwill suffer and die. Congress has an obligation to act and to act now.\n  The abuses that take place every day should have no place in American \nmedicine. Every doctor knows it. Every nurse knows it. Every patient \nknows it. The American people know it--and it is time the Republican \nleadership heeded their views.\n  The first test of the sincerity of the Republican leadership will \ncome this week when the House conferees are appointed. Will a majority \nof the House conferees come from those who supported the Norwood-\nDingell bill, not just on final passage, but on the critical vote to \nreplace it with the leadership-backed alternative?\n  The second test will come in the conference itself. The danger is \nthat the process will go into slow motion so that nothing happens until \nCongress adjourns for this session. There is ample time for genuine \nbipartisan negotiations to produce a strong, bipartisan bill that \nCongress can pass and the President can sign before the session ends.\n  The issues are well-known. There is no need for the conference to be \ntime-consuming--no need unless the objective is to pass a watered down \nbill, or nothing at all. The Norwood-Dingell bill received overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The Senate \nconferees should do the right thing and simply accept that bill.\n  The choice is clear. Prompt action to protect patients and their \nfamilies--or more delay and denial. Those who profit from the status \nquo have delayed action long enough. It is time for Congress to provide \nevery family the protection they deserve.\n  Mr. President, Friday, we had the appointment of the conferees to \nrepresent the Senate with the House of Representatives on the HMO bill, \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights legislation.\n  We want to let the Senate know we are prepared to meet today, \ntomorrow, the next day, and every single day to try to get a resolution \nof that issue because we know that every single day we do not act and \nhave strong legislation, like the House of Representatives, American \nfamilies are endangered and Americans are being hurt. That is wrong. We \nhave the chance to act. On our side of the aisle, we are prepared to \ntake action. We are prepared to meet. We believe this is one of the \nmost important efforts we will have in this Congress.\n  We will continue to challenge our colleagues on the other side to \nmove ahead and have a conference. We have debated these issues. We have \nhad a long time to debate them. We have had extensive debates in \ncommittee and for over a week on the floor of the Senate.\n  Let's get about protecting the American citizens on that Patients' \nBill of Rights--letting doctors make decisions rather than accountants. \nEvery day, as I mentioned, that we fail to do so, we fail to protect \nAmerican families. We want to go about America's business and families' \nbusiness on health care. We are prepared to meet in conference now and \nevery day in the future.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12778-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12778-S12779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ON THE 1999-2000 AMERICA'S CUP\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the battle for the America's Cup, which begins this week in \nthe Hauraki Gulf off Aukland, New Zealand. Five American and six \ninternational challengers are competing for the right to face Team New \nZealand in races beginning next February.\n  This competition, which promises to be a long, hard-fought affair, \ngives me an opportunity to share with my fellow Senators some thoughts \non Rhode Island's celebrated history in yachting. It began in London in \n1851, when the America's Cup was designed and crafted as a trophy for a \nrace around the Isle of Wight. The cup was named after the yacht \nAmerica which first won the trophy by beating the British yachts at \nCowes. Yacht racing had only recently begun in North America at the \ntime; John Cox Stevens had founded the New York Yacht Club in 1844 and \nin 1851 was still its first Commodore.\n  But yacht racing was not so new in Britain, where forms of yachting \nhad been a sport for about 250 years. In the mid-1850's, Britannia \nruled the waves in all respects, and it would never have occurred to \nthem that an American outfit could challenge their yachting dominance.\n  In 1857, John Stevens decided that the cup would be better in the \nhands of the New York Yacht Club for safekeeping and for organizing \nchallenges. The cup, which graced the halls of the New York Yacht Club, \nbecame known as the America's Cup and this has continued for 145 years. \nUntil 1983, the New York Yacht Club successfully defended the cup in \nraces off Newport, Rhode Island, a venue which deservedly has come to \nbe considered one of the sailing capitals of the world.\n  During these years, a great many Rhode Islanders stood out and earned \noutstanding reputations in this sport. Most notably, Nathanael Greene \nHerreshoff, ``The Wizard of Bristol,'' joined his visually impaired \nbrother in the manufacture of boats and went on to design six \nsuccessful America's Cup defenders--Vigilant (in 1893), Defender \n(1895), Columbia (1899 and 1901), Reliance (1903) and Resolute (1920). \nIn addition, the celebrated sailmaker and designer Ted Hood had more to \ndo with the development of the America's Cup from the 1950's to the \n1970's than any other person. Hood also won the Cup, helming Courageous \nin 1974.\n  Today, Hood's shipyard and many others in Rhode Island continue this \nproud tradition in the sailing world and have made the state's \nboatbuilding industry second to none. The east shore of Narragansett \nBay has 13 boatyards representing some of yachting's most famous \nlabels. In the words of one expert, ``people across the world think of \nquality boats when they think of Rhode Island.'' Combined with tourism \nfrom recreational boating, the state's marine industry generates about \n$1.2 billion annually and employees about 6,000 workers. Rhode Island \nyards built boats for three America's Cup syndicates in 1995 and two \nmore this year.\n\n  One of the American challengers is of particular interest to me and \nto my constituents in Rhode Island. Young America, a two-boat syndicate \nput forward by the New York Yacht Club, is one of the strongest \nchallengers in these races. The club has stated its intent to bring \nAmerica's Cup back to Newport, Rhode Island if--or should I say \n``when`'--it dethrones Team New Zealand next March. Many, many Rhode \nIslanders eagerly look forward to the return of this great tradition to \nNewport, where it had such an outstanding record of success for one \nhundred and thirty-two years.\n  Young America's president, John Marshall, has been long involved with \nworld-class sailing. Marshall won a bronze medal at the 1972 Olympics, \nand has been involved with eight America's Cups since 1974. Marshall is \na former president of and serves on the Board of Directors for North \nSails, the largest sailmaker in the United States.\n  Young America is skippered by Ed Baid, who played a key role in \nwinning the 1995 America's Cup as coach, trial\n\n[[Page S12779]]\n\nhorse skipper and sparring partner for Team New Zealand. Baird was the \n1995 World Champion of Match Race Sailing and placed second at the \nWorlds in 1997, 1996 and 1993. He is the only American to ever reach \nNo. 1 in the World. The 1995 Rolex U.S. Yachtsman of the Year, Baird is \na multiple world champion.\n  Let me also pay tribute to the several Rhode Islanders that have been \nnamed to the Young America team. They include Newport sailors Ed Adams, \nTom Burnham, Jamie Gale, Jerry Kirby, Tony Rey and Joan Touchette. The \nshore support and technical team includes Stewart Wiley of Portsmouth; \nKen Bordin, Steve Connett, Matthew Gurl and Bernie Roeder of Newport; \nWolfgang Chamberlain of Bristol; and Michael Spiller of Jamestown.\n  Young America's two boats were built by Bristol, Rhode Island's Eric \nGoetz shipyard, recognized as one of the world's foremost manufacturers \nof racing sailboats. I had the pleasure of visiting and touring the \nGoetz shipyard last April, and was greatly impressed with what I saw.\n  Goetz has built seven America's Cup contenders for the last two \nseries of America's Cup races--including boats commissioned by \ncompeting U.S. racing teams. This year's boats, which cost about $3 \nmillion each, are the product of a first-rate team of technicians and \nemploy the most modern design and technology. Included is a keel \ndeveloped by one of Rhode Island's most storied companies, Browne & \nSharpe Manufacturing. The competitors in New Zealand are no doubt \nfixated on the technological advancements being introduced by Young \nAmerica.\n  Three sets of round robin races begin this week and end on December \n14. The challenger semifinals and finals take place next January 2 \nthrough February 4 to determine which syndicate will face the defending \nNew Zealanders. The Finals of this grueling competition do not end \nuntil March 4.\n  So I hope all Senators can take a moment today to recognize the \ncommencement of one of the world's most prestigious sporting \ntraditions, the America's Cup. I wish good luck to all eleven \ncompetitors, but particularly to the Young America syndicate. For many \nof my state's enthusiasts, it has been a long sixteen years waiting for \nthis moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12779-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12779-S12781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, violent acts of bigotry based on race, \nreligion, ethnic background, sexual orientation, gender, and disability \ncontinue to plague the nation. These vicious crimes are a national \ndisgrace and an attack on everything this country stands for, and it is \nessential for Congress to act against them.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate added important provisions to combat \nhate crimes to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. This \nafternoon, Senate-House conferees will meet to vote on a conference \nreport that does not contain the hate crimes provision. Behind closed \ndoors, the conferees have tentatively decided to drop the provision, \nand I urge them to reconsider. It is essential for Congress to take a \nstand against bigotry, and do all we can to end these modern-day \nlynchings that continue to occur in communities across the country.\n  Many of us are aware of the most highly-publicized incidents, \nespecially the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and \nMatthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. But these two killings are just \nthe tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have \noccurred this year:\n  January 14, 1999, El Dorado, California--Thomas Gary, 38, died after \nbeing run over by a truck and shot with a shotgun. The assailant \nclaimed that Mr. Gary had made a pass at him.\n  January 17, 1999, Texas City, Texas--Two black gay men, Laaron Morris \nand Kevin Tryals, were shot to death and one of the men was left inside \na burning car.\n  February 7, 1999, Miami, Florida--Three young women stalked, beat and \nstabbed a gay man while yelling anti-gay epithets.\n  February 19, 1999, Sylacauga, Alabama--Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man, \nwas abducted, beaten to death with an ax handle, and set on fire on \nburning tires in a remote area.\n  February 24, 1999, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.--A black woman, Jody-Gaye \nBailey, died after being shot in the head by a self-proclaimed \nskinhead. Minutes before the shooting the perpetrator reportedly \nboasted of wanting to go out and kill a black person. Bailey and her \nboyfriend, who is Caucasian, were stopped at a red light when the \nkiller fired at Bailey seven times. The boyfriend was uninjured.\n  February 1999, Yosemite National Park, California--An individual \ncharged with the murder of four women--one of whom was a 16-year old \ngirl--in Yosemite National Park told police investigators that he had \nfantasized about killing women for three decades.\n  March 1, 1999, Richmond, Virginia--A gay, homeless man was killed and \nhis severed head was left atop a footbridge in James River Park near a \npopular meeting place for gay men.\n  May 1999, Kenosha, Wisconsin--A 27-year-old man intentionally swerved \nhis car onto a sidewalk to run over two African-American teens. After \nhitting the two cyclists, he left the scene and kept driving until \nstopped by police. Eight years earlier the same man rammed his car \ntwice into a stopped van carrying five African-American men and drove \naway.\n  June 2, 1999, West Palm Beach, Florida--Two teenagers admitted that \nthey beat a gay man, Steven Goedereis, to death on April 27, 1998 \nbecause he called one of them ``beautiful.''\n  June/July 1, 1999, Northern California--Three synagogues in the \nSacramento area were destroyed by arson. Two brothers, who have links \nto an organized hate group, are suspects in the arson as well as the \nshotgun murders of two gay men in Redding, Calif., Winfield Scott \nMowder and Gary Matson.\n  July 4th weekend, 1999, Illinois/Indiana--An indiviudal associated \nwith a racist and anti-Semitic organization, Benjamin Smith, killed an \nAfrican-American man, Ricky Byrdsong, and wounded six orthodox Jews in \nChicago before killing a Korean student, Won-Joon Yoon, in Bloomington, \nInd.\n  July 24, 1999, San Diego, California--Hundreds of people were tear-\ngassed when a military style tear-gas canister was released near the \nFamily Matters group at the San Diego gay pride parade. The 70-person \ngroup included small children and babies in strollers.\n  August 10, 1999, Los Angeles, California--A former security guard for \na white supremacist organization, Buford O. Furrow, wounded five \nindividuals, including young children, at a Los Angeles Jewish \ncommunity center, and later killed a Filipino-American postal worker, \nJoseph Illeto.\n  Clearly, the federal government should be doing more to halt these \nvicious crimes that shock the conscience of the nation.\n  Dropping the bipartisan Senate provisions from the DJS conference \nreport is a serious mistake. For too long, the federal government has \nbeen forced to fight hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. \nCongress must speak with a united voice against hate-based violence. \nAll Americans deserve to know that the full force of federal law will \nbe available to punish these atrocities.\n  Congress has a responsibility to act this year. The continuing \nsilence of Congress on this festering issue is deafening, and it is \nunacceptable. We must stop acting as if somehow this fundamental issue \nis just a state and local problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, \nand it's an outrage that Congress has been missing in action for so \nlong. I urge the conferees to reconsider their action, and include a \nstrong provision on hate crimes in the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I make these remarks because the timeliness of them is \nso important. I see my friend and colleague from Oregon, who shares \nthese concerns. Again, we wanted to address this issue, which will be \nbefore the conference committee on the State-Justice appropriations \nthis afternoon. We will be faced with this issue in a conference report \nin these next 2, 3 days. It is regarding the inclusion or exclusion of \nthe hate crimes legislation.\n  We passed hate crimes legislation as part of the State-Justice-\nCommerce appropriations. It is in conference at a time when this \ncountry has been faced with a series of acts that have been violent on \nthe basis of bigotry--based on race, religion, ethnic background,\n\n[[Page S12780]]\n\nsexual orientation, gender, and disability. These challenges continue \nto plague the Nation. These vicious crimes are a national disgrace and \nan attack on everything for which this country stands. It is essential \nfor Congress to act against them.\n  Just in the very recent times, we have seen the brutal murders of \nJames Byrd in Jasper, TX, and Matthew Shepherd in Wyoming. These two \nkillings are the tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred \nhave occurred this year.\n  On January 14, Thomas Gary died after being run over by a truck and \nshot with a shotgun. The assailant claimed that Mr. Gary had made a \npass at him.\n  On January 17, 1999, Texas City, TX, two black gay men, Laaron Morris \nand Kevin Tryals, were shot to death, and one of the men was left \ninside a burning car.\n  On February 7, 1999, three young women, stalked, beat, and stabbed a \ngay man while yelling antigay epithets.\n  On February 24, in Fort Lauderdale, a black woman, Jody-Gaye Bailey, \ndied after being shot in the head by a self-proclaimed skinhead. \nMinutes before the shooting, the perpetrator reportedly boasted of \nwanting to go out and kill a black person.\n  In February 1999, Yosemite National Park, California, an individual \ncharged with the murder of four women--one of whom was a 16-year-old \ngirl--in Yosemite National Park, told police investigators that he had \nfantasized about killing women for three decades.\n  The list goes on and on, and that is happening in communities all \nacross the country. This legislation has been taken into consideration. \nA number of the points have been raised by Members over the last 3, 4 \nyears. The statistics are very clear. This kind of problem is \nescalating, not decreasing. All we are asking is, in the very selected \ncases that would qualify under this legislation, that we not deny the \nFederal Government from participating with the State and local \nprosecutors in order to be able to solve these problems. These crimes \nare not just crimes against individuals, they are rooted in bigotry and \nhatred so deep that they have an important and dramatic and horrific \naffect upon a community.\n  We will see the opportunity, hopefully, for that Commerce Committee \nconference this afternoon to vote on these issues. We should at least \nhave a vote on these matters and, hopefully, the Commerce Committee \nwill not disappoint America's march toward justice.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator has made \na very eloquent statement on this matter of hate crimes. As we have \nseen so often on these issues of justice for gay folks, and when we are \ntalking about issues relating to race, the issue always is brought out \nthat in some way we are advocating ``special rights,'' or \n``preferences,'' or something of this nature. I think what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is asking for--and perhaps he can speak to this--is \nsimply to make it clear the U.S. Congress is going to draw a line in \nthe sand against violence borne out of bigotry and prejudice.\n\n  We are not talking about special rights. We are not talking about \npreferences for one group because of their sexual orientation or race; \nwe are talking about Americans' right to be free from violence borne \nout of prejudice and hatred. Is that what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is talking about?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it well and accurately. These \nkinds of crimes, as I mentioned very briefly, rip at the heart and soul \nof all Americans. No one could read about these extraordinary acts of \nviolence directed toward specified groups, such as those that took \nplace in Yosemite, where that individual had in his mind one purpose \nand one purpose only, and that was to kill women. That was it. It \nwasn't against someone with whom he had a difference. That is the kind \nof vicious intent we have seen. We have seen that regarding race, \nreligion, and sexual orientation.\n  All we are saying is, in the prosecution of those crimes, we are not \ngoing to fight it with one hand behind our backs. We are not going to \ndeny it in the very selective numbers that will be in--I think you are \nlooking at each group, and there are something like maybe 20, 30 cases \na year--probably even less--in the testimony of those who represent the \nJustice Department in any of these areas. But they are so vicious and \nso horrific that we are going to say we are not going to permit that to \ntake place in this country.\n  We have the opportunity to make a positive commitment in that area in \nour conference before we leave this year, and we don't want to lose \nthat opportunity. The Senator from Oregon has been a leader on this \nissue, and our friend and colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Specter have been strong leaders. This has been a bipartisan \neffort for a long period of time. We don't want to deny the chance of \nhaving success.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for one last point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid is very important for our colleagues to focus on as we go to this \nconference, which I think will be starting in a few minutes.\n  My understanding is that the bipartisan proposal of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and Senator Specter does not, in any way, preempt State \nand local authority in this area. My understanding is that it is only \nif and when State and local authorities don't act against these morally \nrepugnant crimes that the Senator from Massachusetts has described--\nthat only then would the Federal Government come in. I will say, from \nmy standpoint, what the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about \ncertainly meets my definition of what ought to constitute compassionate \nconservatism.\n  I am very pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, has \njoined with Senator Specter and others on the other side of the aisle. \nI so appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nwant him to know that I plan to stand shoulder to shoulder with him \nuntil we get this law passed. This is unacceptable. It is grotesque \nthat this Congress would not take up this issue, and we cannot allow \nthis issue to be ducked any further.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments that \nthe Senate adopted as part of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill is the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation amends the \nfederal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and \nreligious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the \nFederal Government on the problem of hate crimes committed against \npeople because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. I \ncommend Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this bill, and I am proud \nto have been an original cosponsor.\n  It is time to pass this important legislation. It has been over a \nyear since the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming, \nand the dragging death of James Byrd in Jaspar, Texas--brutal attacks \nthat stunned the Nation.\n  Since those incidents, we have seen other acts of violence motivated \nby hate and bigotry, including the horrific incident two months ago in \nLos Angeles, when a gunman burst into a Jewish community center and \nopened fire on a room full of young children. When the gunman \nsurrendered, he said that his rampage had been motivated by his hatred \nof Jews. The month before, a murderous string of drive-by shootings in \nIllinois and Indiana left two people dead and nine wounded. Again, the \nmotivation was racial and religious hate.\n  These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus public attention. \nBut there also is a toll we are paying each year in other hate crimes \nthat find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for the victims \nand their families.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that great and \nhonorable tradition.\n  When the Senate passed the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill\n\n[[Page S12781]]\n\nlast month, there seemed to be general agreement about the need to \nstrengthen our national hate crimes laws. Both the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act and a more limited hate crimes bill sponsored by Senator \nHatch were included in the managers' amendment by unanimous consent. \nThese bills complement and do not conflict with each other, and Senator \nKennedy and I have been working hard to address Senator Hatch's \nconcerns about our legislation.\n  I had hoped that a consensus provision would be worked out in time \nfor us to report as part of this appropriations bill, and I am \ndisappointed that we have been unable to meet this deadline.\n  Five months ago, Matthew Shepard's mother testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and called upon Congress to pass the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act without delay. Let me echo her eloquent words:\n\n       Today, we have it within our power to send a very different \n     message than the one received by the people who killed my \n     son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a \n     real problem that is destroying families like mine, James \n     Byrd Jr.'s, Billy Jack Gaither's and many others across \n     America. . . . We need to decide what kind of nation we want \n     to be. One that treats all people with dignity and respect, \n     or one that allows some people and their family members to be \n     marginalized.\n\n  There are still a few weeks left in this session; we should pass the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12781-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12781-S12782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FAIR TRADE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators \nDurbin, Hatch, Santorum, Byrd and Hollings in introducing the Fair \nTrade Law Enforcement Act of 1999. Unfortunately, because of the long \nand important debate on campaign finance reform last Friday, I was \nunable to make a statement with the rest of my colleagues when the bill \nwas introduced. However, I stand today to praise this legislation which \nwill take significant steps to update and enhance critical U.S. trade \nlaws. It has been far too long, well over a decade in fact, since the \nlast general reform of our trade laws, and current circumstances--\nincluding global recessions, economic turmoil and our surging trade \ndeficit--necessitate the prompt action of Congress.\n  The trade laws in question, particularly the safeguard, \ncountervailing duty and anti-dumping laws, are vital to the \nmanufacturing sector of our economy. They are often the first and last \nline of defense for U.S. industries injured by unfairly or illegally \ntraded imports. Companies, workers, families and communities rely \nheavily on these laws to prevent the ill-effects of unfair trading by \nour trading partners. Unfortunately, recent events like the steel \nimport crisis have demonstrated how painfully inadequate our current \ntrade laws are in responding to rapid import surges. The flooding of \nU.S. markets with unfairly or illegally traded goods causes severe and \noften irreparable harm to our workers and domestic injury, and it is \nhigh time we revisit our trade laws in an effort to make our laws more \nresponsive to the changing landscape of the global economy and \ninternational trade.\n  The reforms we are proposing today fall into three categories. The \nfirst are improvements to our safeguard laws. Current U.S. safeguard \nstandards are often more strict than the corresponding standards in the \nWTO Safeguards Agreement. This means U.S. manufacturers are playing at \na disadvantage to their foreign trading partners. Whereas a foreign \ntrading partner must prove only that an import surge, like the steel \nimport crisis we have seen since July of 1997, is a cause of injury, \ndomestic producers are hindered by U.S. trade laws which require our \ndomestic industry to prove that the imports are a substantial cause of \ninjury. This inequity hampers the ability of our domestic industry to \nreceive relief from unfairly traded imports, and creates an unequal \nplaying field on which our foreign trading partners have an advantage. \nIt also contributes to making the U.S. the dumping ground for illegal \nand unfairly traded imports. Our trading partners know the U.S. \nstandard is high, and they exploit that fact. This bill simply brings \nU.S. safeguard laws with respect to causation standards and injury \nfactors into line with WTO laws, and puts our domestic industries on \nequal footing with the rest of the world.\n  Second, this legislation amends our anti-dumping and countervailing \nduty laws. It establishes a presumption of threat and of critical \ncircumstances when imports surge and prices fall to an extraordinary \ndegree. A critical circumstances determination, which is provided for \nunder WTO standards, allows the ITC and the Department of Commerce to \napply relief to imports entering before the preliminary determination \nin a trade case when investigating authorities find a history of \ninjurious dumping or such a dramatic surge in imports that, absent \nretroactive relief, the effect of an anti-dumping measure would be \nseverely undermined. One of the proposals in this legislation simply \nprovides for the Department of Commerce and the ITC to apply these \nrebuttable presumptions when drastic import surges are coupled with \nsharp domestic price declines. Again, these presumptions are \nrebuttable, meaning all of our trading partners have the right to \nappeal the determination of threat or critical circumstances. All this \nprovision suggests is that we give our domestic industry the benefit of \nthe doubt regarding the injury they are suffering when huge spikes in \nimports are accompanied by a rapid decline in domestic prices. We saw \nfirst hand last year how effective the presumption of threat and \ncritical circumstances can be. When the Commerce Department determined \ncritical circumstances existed on numerous steel trade cases, the \ndecline in imports for the following months was immediately visible. \nThe specter of a retroactive tariff or duty is a powerful deterrent to \ncontinuing unfair and illegal trading practices.\n  This bill makes still other improvements in our anti-dumping and \ncountervailing duty laws. Our legislation will make it tougher for our \ntrading partners to circumvent an anti-dumping or countervailing duty \norder. No longer will foreign nations be able to skirt around our laws \nby making slight alterations to the products they are exporting to the \nU.S. We clarify that these AD/CVD orders include products that have \nbeen changed in only minor respects. The captive production \nclarification is an important provision to ensure fainrness as well.\n  Also, the Fair Trade Law Enforcement Act of 1999 prevents AD/CVD \ncases from being terminated by suspension agreements against the wishes \nof the injured U.S. industry. As we saw during the steel crisis, the \nAdministration reached suspension agreements on trade cases that the \ndomestic industry was confident of winning. Those cases would have \nprovided significant relief for the injured U.S. steel industry by \nimposing tariffs and or duties which would have ``priced out'' many of \nour guilty trading partners from the U.S. steel market. Instead, \nforeign nations which were facing the prospect of having zero or very \nrestricted access to the U.S. market were guaranteed a significant \nshare of our market as a result of negotiated suspension agreements. \nThe reforms in this bill will require the consent of a majority of the \ninjured industry, both companies and workers, in order for the \nsuspension agreement to be finalized. This particular piece of the bill \nhas already been reported out of the Finance Committee, and it is \ncritical to ensuring that any domestic industry injured by unfair or \nillegal imports is afforded proportional relief.\n  Finally, this bill also creates a steel import monitoring program \ndesigned to act as an early notification system when imports begin \nflooding the U.S. market. When the steel import surge began in July of \n1997 it was many months, even close to a year, before anyone in the \nAdministration would even admit that the spike in imports was occurring \nand that it was potentially harmful to the domestic industry. During \nthat time businesses went bankrupt and thousands of employees were laid \noff. The amendment we propose in this bill will make it much easier to \ntrack imports and will provide much quicker notification of potentially \nharmful import surges. Quite simply, the sooner we learn of unfair \nimport surges, the sooner the Administration, Congress and the industry \nitself can take the necessary steps to provide the industry, companies \nand workers with the relief they deserve.\n\n  This bill being introduced today provides much need adjustments to \nour trade laws. Too many of the provisions\n\n[[Page S12782]]\n\ncurrently designed to provide relief to our domestic manufacturing \nsector have been antiquated by recent changes in the global economy and \nthe structure of international trade. It is time we reaffirm our \ncommitment to our manufacturing base by updating and enhancing the very \nlaws designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair and illegal \nimports from abroad.\n  I should note to my colleagues that I remain an ardent supporter of \nopen and fair trade. Exports have become an engine of growth for the \nU.S. economy. The numbers speak for themselves. Last year, Americans \nexported over $688 billion worth of goods and services. In saying this, \nI proudly can point to my own state's experience, and how it proves in \na powerful way that we must pursue the opportunities of the global \neconomy. In the past decade, West Virginia has gone about, deliberately \nand energetically, changing its perception of the outside world in a \nway that has had tremendous economic payoff. In just the past five \nyears, our exports have increased by 40%. We have large and small \ncompanies alike exporting to China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. These \ncompanies exported over $2.2 billion worth of goods just last year. In \npercentage of products made which are exported abroad, West Virginia \nranks 4th among all 50 states. Perhaps the most stunning number to me \nis that every billion dollars in exports supports about 17,000 U.S. \njobs--that means that more than 35,000 jobs in West Virginia are \ndirectly linked to exporting.\n  I know that trade is critical to my state's continued economic \ndevelopment. West Virginia's case proves that even small economies can \nuse expanded trade opportunities as a mechanism for further growth and \nprosperity. However, our increasingly globalized and ever expanding \neconomy requires our finding new ways to adapt to change. Americans \nthrive in that environment and will therefore excel in this New \nEconomy. But transitions are almost always hard. I think how a country \ndeals with the dislocations of change says a lot about its priorities \nand about its ultimate success as we move into a new world and a new \ncentury.\n  I fully recognize that much in this bill will provoke debate. I \nwelcome it. The Finance Committee can and must begin to consider how \nbest to update our trade laws. I am confident that as trade becomes \nunquestionably one of the most powerful economic determiners in our \neconomy, we will do so.\n  My efforts to deal with the real world consequences for West Virginia \nsteel families, communities and manufacturers when they were hit with \nan unprecedented deluge of steel imports in late 1997 and 1998 resulted \nin my proposal of a steel quota bill that was considered on the Senate \nfloor and rejected largely on the grounds that we weren't playing by \nthe world's rules. I'm here to let my colleagues know that as the world \nchanges, we must change with it--we must support the expanded \nopportunities for trade by guarding against the acquiescence to \ncircumstances where our workers end up hurt with no recourse but to \npromote isolationism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12782-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE FY 2000 HUD/VA APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the VA/\nHUD Appropriations Act for FY 2000, which passed the Senate last \nFriday. I commend Chairman Bond and Ranking Member Mikulski for their \nskilled work on resolving the important issues involved in this \nlegislation. We could not have achieved such an excellent measure \nwithout their leadership and commitment.\n  I am pleased that the legislation includes significant new funding \nallocations for some of HUD's most critical programs. We have promised \nAmerica's citizens to stand up for their priorities, and this \nlegislation is an important part of keeping that promise.\n  The bill includes an additional 60,000 Section 8 vouchers. These \nvouchers are critical for struggling families across the country, many \nof whom pay more than half their income in rent.\n  The bill also restores $70 million for Round II Empowerment Zones. \nThis restoration honors our promise to the communities who have worked \nhard to build partnerships to revitalize their communities, based upon \nthe promise that they would have HUD resources to leverage the funds \nthey have raised in private-sector investments. The City of Boston and \nmany other communities will benefit from this effort, and I am pleased \nthat we support their initiative with these well-deserved resources.\n  I am also pleased that the Community Builders program is supported in \nthe Act. The program provides a single point of contact with HUD for \nclients and customers, and streamlines access to HUD resources. With \nthese improvements, HUD will be serving citizens more ably and \nexpeditiously, and the preservation of this important program is an \nessential part of the legislation.\n  These initiatives offer hope to many distressed communities and low \nincome families who are still left behind in this period of \nextraordinary economic growth. We must never forget our commitment to \nsafe and affordable housing for our neediest citizens. I commend my \ncolleagues for their skillful work which has led to this major \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12782-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION OF THE RECORD\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to authorize the State of Georgia to participate in the State \ninfrastructure bank pilot program; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n          state infrastructure bank pilot program legislation\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would allow my home state of Georgia to participate in the State \nInfrastructure Bank (SIB) program. Prior to the enactment of the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) all 50 states \nwere eligible for SIB revolving funds, which are capitalized with \nfederal and state contributions and used to provide loans and other \nforms of non-grant assistance to transportation projects. TEA-21, \nhowever, limited an enhanced SIB program to four states (California, \nFlorida, Missouri, Rhode Island). My bill would add Georgia as a fifth \nstate for participation in the SIB program.\n  Georgia and Metro Atlanta, I believe, can be a national model on how \nto meet clean air standards and manage suburban sprawl without \ncompromising economic growth. Governor Roy Barnes and the Georgia \nGeneral Assembly deserve a great deal of credit for grabbing the bull \nby the horns when they enacted historic legislation creating the \nGeorgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA). GRTA will work with \nother state agencies and organizations to solve the traffic, pollution, \nand sprawl problems that plague Metro Atlanta.\n  In order to carry out its legislative charge in conjunction with the \nGeorgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), the Metropolitan Atlanta \nRapid Transit Authority (MARTA), the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), \nand other transportation agencies, GRTA will need sufficient financial \nresources to become a regional authority with teeth. To assist in \nprocurement of these resources, the legislation I am introducing today \nwould extend the State Infrastructure Bank program to include Georgia. \nI believe that this program can be a vital component in funding such \nimportant projects as the multi-state high speed rail corridor.\n  The SIB program authorizes loans to a public or private entity to \ncover the partial or complete cost of an approved project, and it \nallows for innovative planning and development of funding streams for \nrepayment, which does not begin until five years after the completion \nof the project. Additionally, TEA-21 allows for the creation of a \nmultistate infrastructure bank system among the pilot states. In so \ndoing, states would be encouraged to share not only funds but also \nideas for combating pollution and traffic problems and encouraging \nalternative forms of transportation. Georgia would be a perfect \naddition to this mix.\n  Georgia can be a model for the nation--an example for other states \nthat are facing similar problems of balancing growth and livability. \nGeorgia's participation in the SIB program would provide more options \nto fund the solutions that will allow the proper balance to be struck. \nGRTA, GDOT and the other transportation entities in Georgia have \nexpressed to me their enthusiasm over the possibilities that are \npresented by Georgia's participation in the SIB program. I hope that my \nSenate colleagues will join with me in support of this legislation \nwhich will allow Georgia to participate in the SIB program and in doing \nso it will illustrate to the country the full potential of this \nprogram.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1511(b)(1)(A) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 181 note; 112 Stat. 251) is \n     amended by inserting ``Georgia,'' after ``Florida''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1745. A bill to establish and expand child opportunity zone family \ncenters in elementary schools and secondary schools, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n               Child Opportunity Zone Family Centers Act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nencourage communities to foster school-based or school-linked family \ncenters. These centers would provide a comprehensive array of \ninformation, support, services, and activities to improve the \neducation, health, mental health, safety, and economic well-being of \nchildren and their families.\n  As we strive to ensure the academic and future success of our \nstudents, we must recognize that the increasingly complex needs of \nchildren cannot be met by the education system alone.\n  Some facts to illustrate this point:\n  Today, 11.3 million children--more than 90 percent of them in working \nfamilies--have no health insurance.\n  7.5 million children under the age of 18 require mental health \nservices, while the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that \nfewer than one in five receive the help they need.\n  It is estimated that nearly five million school-age children spend \ntime without adult supervision during a typical week. Meanwhile, FBI \ndata show that the peak hours for violent juvenile crime occur during \nthe after-school hours of 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.\n  Also according to the FBI, juveniles accounted for 17 percent of all \nviolent crime arrests in 1997, and juveniles are victims in nearly 25 \npercent of all crimes.\n  To address these and other serious issues facing our children and \nfamilies, a few states and localities have established centers and \ndeveloped programs designed to provide families with access and \nlinkages to needed social services in a location that is easily \naccessed by families--their children's school. All too often, the \nprograms and services currently available to assist children and \nfamilies, like health and mental health care, nutritional programs, \nchild care, housing, and job training, exist in a fragmented fashion, \nmaking it difficult for many families to find a point of entry. The aim \nof my legislation is to bring these vital services under one familiar \nroof so children and families have easy access to needed services.\n  Research indicates that school-linked family center programs are a \ncost-effective way to provide supports to children and families. \nAccording to a report by the Northeast and Islands Regional Educational \nLaboratory, school-linked services can also ``help to increase student \nachievement, save money and reduce overlapping services, reach those \nchildren and families most in need, make schools more welcoming to \nfamilies, increase community support for the school, and help at-risk \nfamilies develop the capacity to manage their own lives successfully.''\n  My legislation, the Child Opportunity Zone Family Centers Act, builds \non a successful model in my home state of Rhode Island, the Rhode \nIsland Child Opportunity Zone (COZ) Family Center initiative.\n  The Child Opportunity Zone Family Centers Act would provide grants on \na competitive basis to partnerships consisting of a high poverty \nschool; school district; other public agency, such as a department of \nhealth or social services; and non-profit community organizations, \nincluding a family health center that provides mental health services. \nPartnerships would be required to complete a needs assessment, and then \nuse this information to provide children and families with linkages to \nexisting community prevention and intervention services in the core \nareas of education, health, and family support. In addition, \npartnerships would provide violence prevention education to children \nand families and training to enable families to help their children\n\n[[Page S12785]]\n\nmeet challenging standards and succeed in school.\n  The guiding principle of Rhode Island's COZ Family Centers is to help \nchildren and families get the assistance they need. This principle is \nreflected in my legislation, which contains accountability provisions \nto ensure that partnerships focus on improvements in student \nachievement, school readiness, family participation in schools, access \nto health care, mental health care, child care, and family support \nservices and work to reduce violence-related problems, truancy, \nsuspension, and dropout rates in order to continue to receive funding.\n  As we prepare to work on the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, I believe that it is critical that we do all \nwe can to provide a seamless, integrated system of support for children \nand families. By giving families an opportunity to get the support they \nneed, we can truly help children succeed in school and life. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. CHILD OPPORTUNITY ZONE FAMILY CENTERS.\n\n       Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n\n            ``PART L--CHILD OPPORTUNITY ZONE FAMILY CENTERS\n\n     ``SEC. 10995A.

A bill to authorize negotiation of a free trade agreement \nwith the Republic of Turkey, to provide authority for the \nimplementation of the agreement, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            the u.s.-turkey free trade agreement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S.-\nTurkey Free Trade Agreement Act of 1999. This bill provides traditional \ntrade negotiating authority--we once called it ``fast track \nauthority''--for a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Republic of \nTurkey. It would authorize the President to negotiate and conclude a \nfree trade agreement with one of America's most important allies and \nbring that agreement and any necessary implementing legislation back to \nthe Congress for an up-or-down vote, within a time certain.\n  I would begin by noting that Turkey has played a singular role at the \ncrossroads of East and West since 1923, when the legendary Mustafa \nKemal ``Ataturk'' built a western-oriented, secular state out of the \nashes of the collapsed 600-year old Ottoman Empire. Its constitution \nestablishes a democratic, parliamentary form of government with an \nindependent judiciary. Indeed, it is the only Muslim country with a \nsecular democracy.\n  Turkish-American friendship is longstanding: it was first consecrated \nin the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and \nthe Ottoman Empire in 1830. The 1929 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation \ncemented our commercial ties with the new republic, while the July 12, \n1947 agreement on aid to Turkey, implementing the Truman Doctrine, \ninaugurated the very close relationship that continues today. Our \nfriendship has since been reinforced by more than 60 agreements, \ntreaties and memoranda of understanding.\n  It is time to take that relationship a step farther, and begin \nnegotiations toward a free trade agreement with Turkey. Not only do our \nstrategic and political interests dictate closer economic integration, \nbut our commercial interests do so as well.\n  Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey has played a central role in \nsafeguarding the United States' security interests in the region since \nit first entered World War II on the side of the allies at the end of \nthe war. Turkey was a charter member of the United Nations and joined \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. It currently has \nthe largest military force in the Middle East, and the second largest \nmilitary force in NATO.\n  Its geography, history, and relative economic success put Turkey in a \nposition of potential influence in Central Asia, which is, of course, \npopulated mainly by Turkic peoples. To the west, Turkey plays an \nimportant role in Europe, both because of its NATO membership and the \nsituation on Cyprus. We applaud the recent improvements in Turkey's \nrelations with Greece, and hope for more. This past summer the two \ncountries held bilateral talks on a range of issues, talks which \ncontinued in early September. The tragedy of the recent earthquakes \nfurther reinforced this burgeoning relationship as Greece and then \nTurkey promptly dispatched emergency rescue crews and supplies to \nassist the other in dealing with these disasters.\n  And to the south, Turkey is, without question, one of our two most \nimportant allies in the Middle East. The other is its neighbor, Israel, \nwith whom the United States negotiated a free trade agreement that went \ninto effect in 1985. Less well known is the fact that Turkey and Israel \nnegotiated a free trade agreement in 1996, which was ratified in 1997 \nand is in force today. A U.S.-Turkey FTA would simply complete the \ntriangle.\n  Writing in the September 28, 1999 edition of The Washington Post, Dr. \nIsaiah Frank, the very distinguished William L. Clayton Professor of \nInternational Economics at Johns Hopkins University's School of \nAdvanced International Studies, argued persuasively on political \ngrounds for a free trade agreement with Turkey.\n\n       The EU's equivocation [over Turkey's proposed membership in \n     the European Union] has bred Turkish disaffection from Europe \n     and plays into the political hands of the Islamists who as \n     recently as 1996 were at the helm of the government. Clearly, \n     the enormous U.S. stake in a secular, Western-oriented Turkey \n     warrants action by the United States to offset the EU's \n     arm's length treatment and to strengthen and solidify the \n     country's Western political and economic integration.\n\n  But Dr. Frank was correct to point out as well that a free trade \nagreement with Turkey would also be in the United States' economic \ninterest. Turkey is an industrial country, underpinned by strong free \nmarket principles and a vibrant private sector. It was in 1961 a \nfounding member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, the exclusive club--there are today only 29 OECD member \ncountries--that serves as the principal economic forum for the \nindustrialized world.\n  In the 1980's, Turkey took major steps to liberalize its economy. \nProgress continues to be made: earlier this year, Turkey's parliament \npassed a significant banking reform bill, landmark social security \nreform and constitutional amendments removing obstacles to foreign \ninvestment and promoting the privatization of state-owned enterprises. \nTurkey's increasingly open economy has produced rewards: during most of \nthe 1990's, it has been one of the fastest growing of the OECD \ncountries and, for the past eight years, it has had the fourth highest \nannual growth rate, after Ireland, Korea and Luxembourg, recording a \n4.4% average annual rate of growth in GNP between 1990 and 1998.\n  Turkey has opened itself to the global economy in significant ways. \nIt became a Contracting Party to the General Agreement on Tariffs in \nTrade in 1951 and joined the World Trade Organization as a charter \nmember in 1995. Turkey signed a free trade agreement with the European \nFree Trade Association in 1991 and established a customs union with the \nEuropean Union in 1996. As Dr. Frank noted, it has sought full \nmembership in the EU, thus far without success. There has been, of \nlate,\n\n[[Page S12787]]\n\nsome limited progress in that regard: on October 13, 1999, the European \nCommission suggested that Turkey be made a candidate for possible EU \nmembership, but proposed that negotiations be deferred for some \nunspecified time. The matter is to be discussed at the EU summit this \nDecember. In 1992, Turkey joined ten other countries (Albania, Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia and \nUkraine) to form the Black Sea Economic Cooperation group, which aims \nat promoting multilateral cooperation and trade in that region.\n  Our own economic ties with Turkey have strengthened over the years as \nwell. In 1986, we concluded a bilateral investment treaty and in 1998 a \nbilateral tax treaty. And on September 29, 1999, President Clinton and \nPrime Minister Bulent Ecevit signed a Trade and Investment Framework \nAgreement, which establishes a bilateral Council on Trade and \nInvestment that will serve as a forum for regular discussions on \ncommercial matters. Helpful steps all, but, I would argue, not bold \nenough. I agree with Dr. Frank that a free trade agreement with Turkey \nought to be our goal.\n  Yes, our trade with Turkey is still on a small scale. In 1998, U.S. \nmerchandise exports to Turkey reached $3.5 billion, making Turkey our \n34th largest export market. Our imports from Turkey were even smaller--\n$2.5 billion, or less than 0.3 percent of total imports--making Turkey \nour 39th largest source of imports.\n  Certainly Turkey compares favorably with Chile, the only country with \nwhom the United States has begun free trade agreement negotiations \nsince the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into force. In \n1998, U.S. merchandise exports to Chile totaled $3.9 billion, only \nslightly higher than our $3.5 billion in exports to Turkey that year, \nwhile our imports from Chile in 1998 were the same as our imports from \nTurkey--$2.5 billion. And both countries fall within the World Bank's \ngrouping of ``upper middle income'' countries based on per capita GNP: \nin 1998's Turkey's stood at $3,160, compared with $4,810 for Chile.\n  Turkey's market potential is certainly greater than Chile's: Turkey's \npopulation is four times the size of Chile's population (62 million vs. \n15 million) and Turkey's total imports in 1998--about $42 billion--were \ndouble Chile's total imports that year--$19 billion.\n  To be sure, more than 50 percent of Turkey's trade--both exports and \nimports--is conducted with the European Union, but the United States is \nTurkey's second largest single-country trading partner, after Germany. \nAnd in 1993, the Department of Commerce designated Turkey one of 10 \n``Big Emerging Markets''--a focal point for U.S. export and investment \npromotion efforts--because of its ``outstanding growth prospects'' and \ngrowing market of 62 million consumers.\n  I am convinced that there are strong economic arguments for a free \ntrade agreement with Turkey. Our negotiators will have to take care, of \ncourse, that the benefits of the FTA are restricted to the United \nStates and Turkey. But this is a matter that will be addressed when the \nnegotiators write the rules of origin that will apply to the FTA.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would set us on the \ncourse of negotiating and implementing an FTA with Turkey, much as we \nnegotiated an FTA over a decade ago with Turkey's neighbor, and our \ndear friend, Israel. And much as Turkey and Israel have seen it in \ntheir mutual interest to negotiate a free trade agreement.\n  Dr. Frank made the case persuasively and succinctly in his op-ed \npiece in The Washington Post:\n\n       In light of Turkey's strategic role as a U.S. ally in a \n     rough neighborhood, a U.S.-Turkey free-trade agreement would \n     help consolidate Turkey's Western orientation and contribute \n     to stability in a highly volatile region of the world.\n\n  I am hopeful that this bill will start us down that path.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill and Dr. Frank's op-\ned article be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Turkey Free \n     Trade Agreement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Republic of Turkey (in this Act referred to as \n     ``Turkey'') has played an important strategic, political, and \n     economic role in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East since its \n     founding in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal ``Ataturk'' following the \n     collapse of the 600-year Ottoman Empire.\n       (2) The friendship shared between the United States and \n     Turkey dates to the late 18th century and was consecrated by \n     the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United \n     States and the Ottoman Empire in 1830.\n       (3) The United States reaffirmed its relationship with \n     Turkey by entering into the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation \n     of 1929.\n       (4) The United States and Turkey have subsequently entered \n     into over 60 treaties, memoranda of understanding, and other \n     agreements on a broad range of issues, including a bilateral \n     investment treaty (1986), a bilateral tax treaty (1998), and \n     a trade and investment framework agreement (1999), as \n     evidence of their strong friendship.\n       (5) Turkey is located in the strategic corridor between \n     Europe and Asia, bordering the Black Sea and the \n     Mediterranean Sea.\n       (6) Turkey has been a strategic partner of the United \n     States since it joined the allies at the end of World War II.\n       (7) The strategic alliance between Turkey and the United \n     States was cemented by--\n       (A) the agreement of July 12, 1947 implementing the Truman \n     doctrine;\n       (B) Turkey's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) in 1952; and\n       (C) the United States-Turkey Agreement for Cooperation on \n     Defense and Economy of 1980.\n       (8) Turkey is also an important industrialized economy and \n     was a founding member of the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations.\n       (9) Turkey has made significant progress since the 1980's \n     in liberalizing its economy and integrating with the global \n     economy.\n       (10) Turkey has joined other nations in advocating an open \n     trading system through its membership in the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade \n     Organization.\n       (11) Despite the deep friendship between the United States \n     and Turkey, their trading relationship remains small.\n       (12) In 1998, United States merchandise exports to Turkey \n     reached $3,500,000,000.\n       (13) In 1998, United States imports from Turkey totaled \n     $2,500,000,000 or less than 0.3 percent of United States \n     total imports.\n       (14) A free trade agreement between the United States and \n     Turkey would greatly benefit both the United States and \n     Turkey by expanding their commercial ties.\n\n     SEC. 3. NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES FOR A UNITED STATES-TURKEY \n                   FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       The overall trade negotiating objectives of the United \n     States with respect to a United States-Turkey Free Trade \n     Agreement are to obtain--\n       (1) more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access \n     between the United States and Turkey; and\n       (2) the reduction or elimination of barriers and other \n     trade-distorting policies and practices that inhibit trade \n     between the United States and Turkey.\n\n     SEC. 4. NEGOTIATION OF A UNITED STATES-TURKEY FREE TRADE \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to sections 5 and 6, the President \n     is authorized to enter into an agreement described in \n     subsection (c). The provisions of section 151(c) of the Trade \n     Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191(c)) shall apply with respect to a \n     bill to implement such agreement if such agreement is entered \n     into on or before December 31, 2005.\n       (b) Tariff Proclamation Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--The President is authorized to proclaim--\n       (A) such modification or continuation of any existing duty,\n       (B) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise \n     treatment, or\n       (C) such additional duties\n     as the President determines to be required or appropriate to \n     carry out the trade agreement described in subsection (c).\n       (2) Limitations.--No proclamation may be made under \n     paragraph (1) that--\n       (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty \n     that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the date of \n     enactment of this Act) to a rate which is less than 50 \n     percent of the rate of such duty that applies on such date of \n     enactment;\n       (B) provides for a reduction of duty on an article to take \n     effect on a date that is more than 10 years after the first \n     reduction that is proclaimed to carry out a trade agreement \n     with respect to such article; or\n       (C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applied \n     on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging.--\n       (A) Aggregate reduction.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty \n     on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a\n\n[[Page S12788]]\n\n     trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not \n     exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in \n     effect on such day if--\n       (i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of \n     one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had \n     taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction \n     proclaimed under paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement \n     with respect to such article; and\n       (ii) a reduction equal to the amount applicable under \n     clause (i) had taken effect at 1-year intervals after the \n     effective date of such first reduction.\n       (B) Exemption from staging.--No staging under subparagraph \n     (A) is required with respect to a rate reduction that is \n     proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that \n     is not produced in the United States. The United States \n     International Trade Commission shall advise the President of \n     the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging \n     under this subparagraph.\n       (4) Rounding.--If the President determines that such action \n     will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph \n     (3), the President may round an annual reduction by the \n     lesser of--\n       (A) the difference between the reduction without regard to \n     this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or\n       (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.\n       (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction or \n     increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph \n     (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such \n     reduction or increase is included within an implementing bill \n     provided for under section 6(c) and that bill is enacted into \n     law.\n       (c) Agreement Described.--An agreement described in this \n     subsection means a bilateral agreement between the United \n     States and Turkey that provides for the reduction and \n     ultimate elimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers to \n     trade and the eventual establishment of a free trade \n     agreement between the United States and Turkey.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS ON NEGOTIATIONS OF A \n                   UNITED STATES-TURKEY FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.\n\n       Before entering into any trade agreement under section 4 \n     (including immediately before initialing an agreement), the \n     President shall consult closely and on a timely basis on the \n     nature of the agreement and the extent to which it will \n     achieve the purposes of this Act with--\n       (1) the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate;\n       (2) the congressional advisers for trade policy and \n     negotiations appointed under section 161 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2211); and\n       (3) each other committee of the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate, and each joint committee of Congress, which \n     has jurisdiction over legislation involving subject matters \n     that would be affected by the trade agreement.\n\n     SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED STATES-TURKEY FREE TRADE \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Notification and Submission.--Any agreement entered \n     into under section 4 shall enter into force with respect to \n     the United States if (and only if)--\n       (1) the President, at least 60 calendar days before the day \n     on which the President enters into the trade agreement, \n     notifies the House of Representatives and the Senate of the \n     President's intention to enter into the agreement, and \n     promptly thereafter publishes notice of such intention in the \n     Federal Register;\n       (2) within 60 calendar days after entering into the \n     agreement, the President submits to Congress a description of \n     those changes to existing laws that the President considers \n     would be required in order to bring the United States into \n     compliance with the agreement;\n       (3) after entering into the agreement, the President \n     submits a copy of the final legal text of the agreement, \n     together with--\n       (A) a draft of an implementing bill described in subsection \n     (c);\n       (B) a statement of any administrative action proposed to \n     implement the trade agreement; and\n       (C) the supporting information described in subsection (b); \n     and\n       (4) the implementing bill is enacted into law.\n       (b) Supporting Information.--The supporting information \n     required under subsection (a)(3)(C) consists of--\n       (1) an explanation as to how the implementing bill and \n     proposed administrative action will change or affect existing \n     law; and\n       (2) a statement--\n       (A) asserting that the agreement makes progress in \n     achieving the objectives of this Act; and\n       (B) setting forth the reasons of the President regarding--\n       (i) how and to what extent the agreement makes progress in \n     achieving the objectives referred to in subparagraph (A);\n       (ii) whether and how the agreement changes provisions of an \n     agreement previously negotiated;\n       (iii) how the agreement serves the interests of United \n     States commerce; and\n       (iv) any proposed administrative action.\n       (c) Bills Qualifying for Trade Agreement Approval \n     Procedures.--The provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 apply to an implementing bill submitted pursuant to \n     subsection (b) that contains only--\n       (1) provisions that approve a trade agreement entered into \n     under section 4 that achieves the negotiating objectives set \n     forth in section 3 and the statement of administrative action \n     (if any) proposed to implement such trade agreement;\n       (2) provisions that are--\n       (A) necessary to implement such agreement; or\n       (B) otherwise related to the implementation, enforcement, \n     and adjustment to the effects of such trade agreement; and\n       (3) provisions necessary for purposes of complying with \n     section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 in implementing the applicable trade \n     agreement.\n\n     SEC. 7. CONSIDERATION OF IMPLEMENTING BILL.\n\n       (a) Congressional Consideration of Implementing Bill.--When \n     the President submits to Congress a bill to implement the \n     trade agreement as described in section 6(c), the bill shall \n     be introduced and considered pursuant to the provisions of \n     section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191).\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 151 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1), by inserting ``section 6 of the \n     United States-Turkey Free Trade Agreement Act of 1999'' after \n     ``the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)(1), by inserting ``or under section 6 \n     of the United States-Turkey Free Trade Agreement Act of \n     1999,'' after ``the Uruguay Round Agreements Act,''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1999]\n\n                           A Place for Turkey\n\n                           (By Isaiah Frank)\n\n       As Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit visits President \n     Clinton today, an important and highly sensitive subject \n     belongs on the agenda.\n       As a staunch ally of the United States, Turkey is unique. \n     It is the only member of NATO that has sought entry into the \n     European Union (EU) without success. The three most recent \n     NATO members--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--are \n     already engaged in accession negotiations with the EU, but \n     turkey, whose NATO membership dates back to 1952, has been \n     kept at arm's length. Is there anything the United States can \n     do to counter the deep disappointment and alienation felt in \n     Turkey at being excluded from full acceptance into an ever \n     more economically integrated European community?\n       During the Cold War, Turkey was regarded by the United \n     States and its Western allies as the main bulwark against the \n     southern expansion of Soviet power. Among NATO countries, its \n     military establishment has ranked second in size to that of \n     the United States. Since the end of the Cold War, Turkey has \n     continued its close security cooperation with the United \n     States. It played a key role in the U.S.-led Gulf War, its \n     soldiers joined U.S. troops in international peacekeeping \n     operations in Bosnia, and its provided valuable logistical \n     support to the recent U.S. air operation in Serbia. As the \n     only firmly established secular democracy among Muslim \n     states, Turkey is vital to U.S. interest in sensitive \n     regions, including the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East \n     and Central Asia.\n       In order to consolidate its secular and pro-Western \n     orientation as well as tighten its economic links to Europe, \n     Turkey has sought full membership in the EU virtually from \n     the organization's inception. The EU, however, has decided \n     that Turkey does not yet meet the required criteria. Instead, \n     the EU signed a customs union agreement with turkey, which \n     went into effect on Jan. 1, 1996. While Turkish officials \n     initially considered the customs union a step toward full \n     membership, it soon became clear that the European Union \n     regarded it as a substitute for full membership.\n       Despite continuing official EU reaffirmations of Turkey's \n     eligibility for full membership, the reality of de facto \n     rejection has increasingly sunk in. Not only is turkey \n     omitted from the list of countries (Poland, Hungary, the \n     Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus) with which \n     accession negotiations have already begun, it is also left \n     out of a project second wave of expansion that will include \n     five additional countries: Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, \n     Latvia and Slovakia.\n       Why is Turkey being excluded? A variety of reasons have \n     been given, including the Kurdish problem and related issues \n     of human rights, Turkey's macroeconomic situation, and the \n     opposition of Greece because of the Cyprus situation. But \n     there is some indication of a softening of the Greek \n     position, provided Turkey does not place roadblocks in the \n     way of Cyprus's current efforts to join the EU. As for the \n     Kurdish problem, Turkey is making progress in working out a \n     peaceful solution. And the EU acknowledges that the country \n     is headed in the right direction in reforming its economy.\n       If EU standards for resolving these problems are ultimately \n     met, will Turkey then be admitted? Many Turkish leaders \n     believe this unlikely because of officially unspoken EU \n     apprehensions. Turkey's population of 64 million is second in \n     size only to Germany's among present and prospective members \n     of the EU. In some European circles, this sends up several \n     red flags. If admitted, would Turkey exert undue weight in EU \n     decision-making? With EU membership entailing the free \n     movement of workers, what effects would the admission of a \n     populous and relatively\n\n[[Page S12789]]\n\n     low-income country have on European labor markets? And \n     finally, would the EU be willing to integrate fully with a \n     country that is almost entirely Muslim? None of these \n     considerations is discussed openly, but they are clearly in \n     the background of the debate.\n       The EU's equivocation has bred Turkish disaffection from \n     Europe and plays into the political hands of the Islamists \n     who as recently as 1996 were at the helm of the government. \n     Clearly, the enormous U.S. stake in a secular, Western-\n     oriented Turkey warrants action by the United States to \n     offset the EU's arm's length treatment and to strengthen and \n     solidify the country's Western political and economic \n     integration.\n       One such step would be for the United States to offer to \n     negotiate a free-trade agreement with Turkey. Indeed, there \n     is precedent for such a bilateral agreement, one motivated \n     more by political considerations than economic advantages, \n     and that is the 1985 U.S. free-trade agreement with Israel.\n       But the economic rationale for such an agreement with \n     Turkey should not be dismissed. For Turkey the advantages are \n     obvious; the United States ranks second as a market for its \n     exports and third as a source of its imports. For the United \n     States, Turkey is one of the world's 10 big ``emerging \n     markets,'' and this country is Turkey's largest foreign \n     investor.\n       A U.S.-Turkey free-trade agreement would not be a \n     substitute for Turkish membership in the EU, a goal that \n     Turkey should continue to pursue as it gets its political and \n     economic house in order. But it would help compensate for a \n     growing belief in Turkey that the country has little prospect \n     of entry into the EU mainly because of European prejudice \n     against a Muslim country. In light of Turkey's strategic role \n     as a U.S. ally in a rough neighborhood, a U.S.-Turkey free-\n     trade agreement would help consolidate Turkey's Western \n     orientation and contribute to stability in a highly volatile \n     region of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url":

Mr. President, This year marks the centennial of \nCatholic Charities of the Brooklyn-Queens Diocese, the largest Roman \nCatholic human services agency in the nation. Perhaps on earth. The New \nYork Times had the happy thought to mark the occasion with a profile of \nBishop Joseph M. Sullivan, the vicar of the diocese, who heads Catholic \nCharities. The warmth and wisdom of this great churchman comes through \nso clearly, so forcefully. As Yeats once wrote of such a man, ``he was \nblessed and had the power to bless.'' I have treasured his friendship, \nand share his fears as to the fate of New York's poor when they begin \nto fall off the five-year cliff created by the so-called Welfare Reform \nAct of 1996. We would do well to contemplate the fact that the only \nmajor social legislation of the 1990s was the abolition of Aid to \nFamilies of Dependent Children, a provision of the great Social \nSecurity Act of 1935. We could care for children in the midst of the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s, but somehow not in the midst of the \ngreat prosperity of the 1990s. I spoke at length about the gamble we \nwere taking when the legislation was before us. I hope I was wrong. But \nif Joe Sullivan is worried I think we all should be. I know we all \nshould be.\n  I ask that the story from The Times be included in the Record.\n  The story follows.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 13, 1999]\n\n          Now Pitching for the Rome Team, It's Bishop Sullivan\n\n                           (By Randy Kennedy)\n\n       ``The year was 1948 and a guy says to me, `Hey listen, you \n     think you're such a good pitcher, they're having a tryout for \n     the Phillies. So go.' ''\n       And so Joe Sullivan of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, went. ``And the \n     guy asked me to throw the ball. And I could throw pretty \n     hard. And I could throw a fairly decent curve.''\n       One thing leads to another ``and they wanted to sign me.''\n       If this were the made-for-television version of the life of \n     Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan, this is where the big turning \n     point would come: he chooses God over baseball. He gives up a \n     brilliant pitching career to go to bat for the souls of men.\n       But as it turns out, Bishop Sullivan never really liked the \n     baseball life that much anyway. ``It was essentially a boring \n     life,'' he remembers of his one summer canvassing the South \n     in a beaten-up bus and throwing for the Americus Phillies in \n     Georgia. ``You played all night ball in the minor leagues, \n     and you'd kind of lounge around most of the rest of the \n     time.''\n       He had always loved the church, however. He was a standout \n     in the choir. He missed being an altar boy only because he \n     was much too proud to stoop to asking Sister Blanche, the nun \n     who made the recommendations. (``Quite bluntly, I felt I \n     wasn't going to kiss . . . you know . . . you know?) But even \n     as a young boy and through high school, he almost never \n     missed a daily Mass at St. Ephrem's. ``I mean,'' he said, ``I \n     bought Catholicism as a young kid. I really believed.''\n       So the real turning point in his life, one not of his \n     making, came much later, after he had spent four years at \n     seminary and three years as the pastor of his first parish, \n     Our Lady of Lourdes in Queens Village. The bishop needed \n     social workers.\n       ``I got a call on a Tuesday night to see him Wednesday \n     morning. And I was registered for graduate school in social \n     work by Thursday morning. I didn't know what a social \n     worker was.''\n       He adds: ``When I went to school and they asked me, `Why \n     did you choose social work?' I said, `Because the bishop \n     appointed me.' The social work people's reaction to that was \n     that I was hostile. I said, `Well, it's the truth. I don't \n     know whether it's hostile or not.'\n       ``So then they asked me if I wanted to be a social worker. \n     And the answer was, `No!' ''\n       He pauses for a little dramatic effect. ``Best thing that \n     ever happened to me.''\n       Yesterday, Bishop Sullivan, an imposing, tough-talking, \n     immensely friendly man, was sitting in a makeshift television \n     studio in Bishop Ford High School in Brooklyn. He was \n     preparing for a live cable show in which he would talk about \n     the centennial, this\n\n[[Page S12794]]\n\n     month, of Catholic Charities of the Brooklyn-Queens Diocese, \n     now the largest Roman Catholic human-services agency in the \n     country, covering America's most populous diocese.\n       Despite not knowing what a social worker was back then, \n     Bishop Sullivan has devoted 38 years of his life to the job, \n     serving in welfare offices and hospitals, rising to direct \n     the charities and now serving as vicar for human services, \n     overseeing the charities' vast operations with their \n     director, Frank DeStafano. (Mr. Stefano couldn't resist a dig \n     at the boss yesterday as a reporter sat down: ``Not the \n     baseball thing again. He was only on the team for three days! \n     Myself, I was always dedicated to the poor. No time for any \n     kind of fund like that.'')\n       Bishop Sullivan's message to the cable audience yesterday \n     was that he could hope for nothing better during the next 100 \n     years of Catholic charity work than for one message to be \n     hammered home: ``To be a practicing Catholic means to be \n     involved in the lives of others.''\n       But as he relaxed after the show he had another, angrier \n     message not about personal but about public responsibility: \n     welfare reform. He complained that too few people are talking \n     about its effects now, which he says have hurt the poor in \n     Brooklyn and Queens as much as anything he has seen in three \n     decades of tumultuous change in the boroughs.\n       ``I agree,'' he said, ``that it had to be reformed, and I \n     agree that there had to be a change in the culture that work \n     must be more important than relief. But I radically disagree \n     with the way it was done.''\n       Four years ago, he and another bishop managed to wangle an \n     hour and 15 minutes in the Oval Office with President \n     Clinton, to try to talk him out of signing the welfare reform \n     legislation. Mr. Clinton said he understood them. Then he \n     signed the measure anyway.\n       ``But I will tell you,'' he said, his face coloring, ``that \n     I think most of what is being said about the success of these \n     programs is hype including here in this city. To me it's a \n     sham. You look at the food lines at Catholic Charities. You \n     look at the food lines at parishes. You look at the people \n     trying to pay their rents.''\n       He added: ``They haven't heard the last of this. We're only \n     into the third year, and the reality is that there will \n     always be dependent people who can't work.''\n       As he socked on a snap-brim hat to run out and give a \n     speech about health care, he was asked whether it ever \n     disheartens him--approaching his 70th year, his 44th as a \n     priest, and nearly as long as a social worker--that there are \n     still so many people suffering.\n       ``It might not make any sense but it doesn't,'' he said. \n     ``I really think this job as heaven on . . . way to heaven. \n     It doesn't come in the end. It begins here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12794-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ``LEOPOLDVILLE'' DISASTER\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a few days a small group of \nveterans will gather at Fort Benning, Georgia to commemorate one of the \nleast known tragedies of World War II.\n  On Christmas Eve 1944, the Belgian troopship Leopoldville was \ntransporting 2,235 American soldiers from the 262nd and 264th Regiments \nof the 66th Infantry Division across the English Channel. They were \ndestined as reinforcements for units fighting the Battle of the Bulge. \nMany soldiers on board were singing Christmas carols as they watched \nthe lights along the coast of liberated France.\n  The ship was designed to carry fewer than half the number on board, \nand the Belgian crew did not speak English. Reportedly, many of the \nAmerican soldiers were not issued life jackets. Just five miles from \nits destination of Cherbourg, France, the Leopoldville was struck by \ntorpedos from the German submarine U-486. Two and a half hours later, \nthe ship capsized and sank. According to many survivors, the crew \nabandoned ship in the lifeboats and left the American soldiers to fend \nfor themselves. Unable to free the ship's life rafts, many of the \ntroops jumped to their deaths in the frigid heavy seas. The British \ndestroyed HMS Brilliant saved some 500 troops. However, because it was \nChristmas Eve, no one else seemed to be around to help. By the next \nday, Christmas morning, 763 American soldiers were dead, including \nthree sets of brothers. The dead represented 47 of the then 48 states.\n  Mr. President, seven of the victims were from my home state of North \nDakota. Among them was my uncle, Pfc. Allan J. Dorgan. His body was \nnever recovered, and neither were the bodies of 492 other soldiers who \ndied in the incident. It was weeks before my family and the families of \nother victims heard the fateful knock on the door and were given the \ntelegram that said their sons, brothers, uncles, or fathers were \n``missing in action in the European Area.'' It took months more before \na second telegram informed them their loved ones had been ``killed in \naction in the European Area.''\n  Due to wartime censorship, the disaster was not reported to the news \nmedia. Survivors were told by the British and American governments to \nkeep quiet about what happened. American authorities did not even \nacknowledge the sinking of the Leopoldville until two weeks after it \nwent down. Later, after the war, the tragedy was considered an \nembarrassment and all reports were filed away as secret by the Allied \ngovernments. Some say that the American and British governments \nconspired to cover-up the incompetence involved in the incident. For \nwhatever reason, details of the disaster were withheld from the public \nfor over fifty years. Some of the victims' families never learned the \ntruth about how their loved ones perished that night.\n  For over fifty years, the young soldiers on the Leopoldville were \ndenied their due, and never accorded the honors and respect they \ndeserved. Finally, a few years ago, thanks to the efforts of \nLeopoldville survivor Vincent Codianni, former New York City police \ninvestigator Alan Andrade who wrote a book about the incident, and the \nVeterans Memorial Committee of Waterbury, Connecticut, the U.S. Army \nagreed to provide a site for a monument to the tragedy.\n  The Leopoldville Disaster Monument was dedicated on November 7, 1997 \nat Fort Benning, the ``Home of the Infantry.'' On the monument, the \nnames and hometowns of those members of the 66th Infantry Division who \nlost their lives on the Leopoldville and the names of those who \nsurvived the tragedy, but were later killed in action, are etched in \nstone. This was the first official recognition shown to any of the \nvictims or their families. It was long overdue.\n  It is almost 55 years since the sinking of the Leopoldville. When the \nsurvivors and their families gather again this week in Georgia, they \nwill honor their comrades who have passed away since their first \nreunion two years ago. I hope all my colleagues will join me in \nexpressing our appreciation for their courage and for the ultimate \nsacrifice they made for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12794-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12794-S12795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING 150 YEARS OF CONGREGATION B'NAI ISRAEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nCongregation B'nai Israel in Sacramento, California, and to celebrate \nits 150th year of vitality and service to the Sacramento community.\n  Congregation B'nai Israel was founded in 1849 by Moses Hyman and \nAlbert Priest. At the time, Gold rush-era optimism was everywhere in \nnorthern California, attracting opportunity seekers from as far as \neastern Europe, the home to millions of Jews desperate to escape \nviolent pogroms and rampant anti-Semitism. With his profound ability to \norganize people and his unrelenting desire to help the destitute, Moses \nHyman began his congregation in his home, and soon became known as a \npioneer of California Judaism and father of Temple B'nai Israel.\n  Moses Hyman, a major community philanthropist, also founded the \nHebrew Benevolent Society, which assisted the sick and poor, especially \nduring the Sacramento flood of 1850. Following that devastating \ndisaster, Hyman purchased burial land and a nearby house of worship \nfrom a Methodist Episcopal church. Moses Hyman and Albert Priest named \ntheir new congregation B'nai Israel, which translated into English, \nmeans ``Children of Israel.'' The rebuilt temple officially opened on \nSeptember 2, 1852 as the first member-owned synagogue west of the \nMississippi.\n  Congregation B'nai Israel has suffered through many hardships. After \nonly a decade in existence, its synagogue was destroyed by fire, and \nonly a year later, winter floods severely damaged cemetery grounds. The \ncongregation was tested repeatedly. They mourned but then regrouped and \nrebuilt, emerging stronger than before.\n  By the mid-1900s, the congregation outgrew its existing facilities \nand launched a major effort to build a new synagogue. Thanks to the \ngenerosity of congregants, its capital campaign was a huge success. In \naddition to a new synagogue, the congregation added an education wing, \nlater named after Buddy Kandel, in the early 1960s.\n\n[[Page S12795]]\n\n  Congregation B'nai Israel continued to grow. The year 1986 marked \nadditional milestones for what had become a community institution. In \nthat year, the congregation began construction of the Harry M. Tonkin \nMemorial Chapel and the Sosnick Library. The much-needed addition not \nonly led to a change in place of worship, but also an ideological \nchange for the B'nai Israel. Tikkun Olam, the Jewish belief in \nrepairing the world through good deeds and social action became a new \nfound interest of the congregation, pushing further their desire to \nhelp others in the Sacramento area.\n  Members of Congregation B'nai Israel had suffered through tremendous \nhardship in their history, but nothing could prepare them for the \nevents of June 18, 1999, when a fire bomber motivated by anti-Semitic \nhatred destroyed their library and severely damaged the sanctuary and \nadministration building. In an inspiring gesture of solidarity, the \nentire Sacramento community joined with the congregation and \ncollectively vowed not to let violence tear Sacramento apart.\n  In a historic event less than three days after the bombing, more than \n4,000 Sacramento residents joined congregation leaders at a unity rally \nto protest religious and ethnic violence. Former president of the \nInterfaith Service Bureau, Rabbi Bloom, called for the creation of a \nmuseum of tolerance to battle against the tide of hatred.\n  Mr. President, despite all kinds of adversity, Congregation B'nai \nIsrael has survived for 150 years and has grown into a vital and \nbeloved community institution. I send my congratulations and personal \nthanks for all it has done to help a diverse community find common \nground in the Sacramento area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12795-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CALEB SHIELDS\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCaleb Shields, retired Chairman and current Councilman of the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. \nCaleb is retiring from his elected position with the Tribe, after \ntwenty-four years of elected service. For those of you who don't know \nCaleb, I am sorry that you did not have an opportunity to meet this \nremarkable man during his many visits to discuss the myriad of issues \nfacing Native American people. He has a strength of character and honor \nabout him that you could not help but recognize and admire instantly \nwhen you met him.\n  Caleb's tenure of twenty-four years on the Board is truly a testament \nto his leadership and his character. As we all know, very few \npoliticians can have a career that spans twenty-four years and even \nfewer can do it with the grace and dedication that Caleb has. It has \nbeen an honor to work with Caleb on the many issues that we have worked \non together. His commitment and dedication to improve the lives of not \nonly the Native Americans on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, but the \nlives of Native Americans throughout the Nation, are an inspiration to \nme. He has worked tirelessly to improve the level of funding for Indian \nhealth care programs and Native American education programs. He has \nstood in the Halls of Congress, often in the face of severe opposition, \ndefending the governmental and sovereign rights of tribes. He has stood \nup to the federal government when the federal government has failed in \nits obligation to the tribes of this country. Significantly, he did all \nof this without ever making an enemy and without ever treating any \nperson with disrespect. We can all stand to learn something from this \nman who while he had many battles, he never made any enemies.\n  I will miss my friend's visits to Washington, but I will mostly miss \nhis advice on the Native American issues. Native American Country is \nlosing a great leader, but I am sure that the basketball teams in \nPoplar are regaining a loyal fan. I understand that Caleb hopes to \nwrite a book about the history of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes from \ntreaty time to modern time. I wish him well in his endeavor and look \nforward to reading his book.\n  At the request of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, the \nfollowing statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as \nfollows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12795-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12795-S12796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY'S 150TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding the Central \nConnecticut State University. To stand the test of time, as Central \nhas, an educational institution must respond to the educational needs \nof its students. At each turn over its notable 150-year history, \nCentral has effectively positioned itself to address the new challenges \nof the day. While a great deal has changed at Central--and for that \nmatter in the world--over the years, the school's primary concern and \nmotivating goal--educating students--has remained unaltered.\n  Central Connecticut State University is Connecticut's oldest \npublicly-supported institution of higher learning and enjoys a rich and \ncolorful legacy. Founded by order of the Connecticut State Legislature \non June 22, 1849, the institution, first known as the Normal School, \nwas a two-year teacher training facility. On May 15, 1850, Henry \nBarnard, the school's first ``principal,'' as he was then called, and a \nhandful of faculty and staff members welcomed the first class of 30 \nstudents.\n  The Normal School was the object of contentious political debate in \nHartford and intermittent appropriation cuts during its early years. In \nfact, the school was closed from 1867 to 1869 due to lack of funding. \nYet the school and its supporters persevered. Each passing year brought \nbigger classes to the Normal School and with them, greater support from \nthe members of the citizenry who understood the vital importance of \nhigher education to their future and the future of the state. As was \ncommon at many of the era's institutions of higher learning, the Normal \nSchool's student body was overwhelmingly unbalanced in its male to \nfemale ratio. Interestingly, however, at the Normal School women, not \nmen, made up the majority of the student body through the late 19th \nCentury. In fact, due to the social norms of the time, which held the \nteaching of elementary and grade-school children as women's work, men \ndisappeared from the student body at the Normal School for over thirty \nyears--a change that would forever influence the character of the \ninstitution. The loss of male students did not stop the expansion of \nNormal School. Growing beyond the confines of its original building at \nthe corner of Chestnut and Main in New Britain, in 1922 the school \nmoved to the spacious campus it now occupies in the Belvedere section \nof New Britain.\n  The institution began to blossom academically in 1933 when it started \nto offer four-year baccalaureate degrees, changing its name to the \nTeachers College of Connecticut. The expansion of academic offerings \ndrew men back to the college during the 1930s. Following World War II, \nthe Teachers College of Connecticut, like many academic institutions, \nexperienced remarkable growth and expansion. That growth led the State \nLegislature to grant the college the right to confer liberal arts \ndegrees and to rename the institution the Central Connecticut State \nCollege in 1959. As the needs of its students have continued to change \nand expand in more recent times, so too has Central. In 1983, Central \nbegan offering graduate degrees and evolved into its present form--\nCentral Connecticut State University.\n  With an enrollment of nearly 12,000 graduate and undergraduate \nstudents, Central is the largest of the four Universities within the \nConnecticut State System. With 80 programs of study, 38 departments and \n5 individual schools dedicated to disciplines across the spectrum of \nlearning, Central Connecticut State University has emerged as one of \nthe premier regional universities in New England.\n  Always on the forefront of educational trends, Central recognized the \nlack of emphasis placed on the historical role of women and drew upon \nthe significant role played by women in its own development to become \none of the first schools in the Nation to build, in 1977, a Women's \nCenter. The Center, which has become a highly respected credit to the \nuniversity, offers a number of services for and about women\n\n[[Page S12796]]\n\nand has become a model for universities around the country. In 1990, \nCentral became the first school in Connecticut to offer an accredited \nComputer Science degree, helping to prepare Connecticut students for \nthe Information Age. Its Robert C. Vance Distinguished Lecturer Program \nhas drawn United States Presidents and renowned leaders from around the \nglobe to speak in New Britain. It is clear, that through these special \nprograms, as well as others, Central Connecticut State University \nprovides its students with a valuable educational opportunity and has \nestablished itself as one of the Nation's finest regional universities.\n  So I say again, Mr. President, that I am proud to stand on the floor \nof the United States Senate to recognize the enduring dedication of \nCentral Connecticut State University to its students, to its state, and \nto excellence in education. Today, under the adept guidance of \nPresident Richard L. Judd and with the effort of so many talented and \ncommitted faculty and staff, the university continues to grow and \nprosper. I believe that Central's unceasing pursuit of excellence will \nensure it remains a vital academic institution for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12796-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12796-S12798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ON THE LIFE OF EDWARD C. BANFIELD\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Edward C. Banfield has died. This \nhad to come. He was 83. Yet little were those who loved him prepared. \nOr ready, you might say.\n  He held, of course, Henry Lee Shattuck Chair in Government at Harvard \nand, as Richard Bernstein notes in his fine obituary in The Times, was \nmost active in the Joint Center for Urban Studies of M.I.T. and Harvard \nin the 1960s and 1970s. For part of that time I was chairman of the \nJoint Center and so came to know him at the peak of his long, \ncomparably brilliant and yet understated career. In 1970, he published \nThe Unheavenly City, which stands to this day as the most salient and, \nwell, heart-wrenching exposition of the intractable nature of so many \nurban problems. He had been there before. As early as 1955 he wrote, \nwith Martin Meyerson, Politics, Planning and the Public Interest which \nargued that the near religious zeal for high-rise public housing then \ncurrent in Chicago, and across the land, would be a disaster. One notes \nit has taken Chicago the better part of thirty-five years to realize \nthis, and start dynamiting the projects, as they came to be known. Just \nso was the seminal, The Moral Basis of a Backward Society, a study of a \nsmall village in Southern Italy, which he wrote with Laura Fasano-\nBanfield, his radiantly intelligent wife and companion of sixty-odd \nyears.\n  Now of course, none of this work was welcome, especially in academe. \nNot least because it made too much sense to be rejected. James Q. \nWilson, once his student, now his heir, got this just right in a \nmemorial that appeared in last week's Weekly Standard entitled ``The \nMan Who Knew Too Much, Edward C. Banfield, 1916-1999.'' He was onto The \nMob, inside The Agency, privy to The Plan. And yet they never got him. \nHe was, as he would say, a ``swamp Yankee,'' a tough breed.\n  He was also a great teacher, something Robert J. Samuelson writes \nabout so wonderfully well in The Washington Post. Above all he taught \nhis students to pursue the truth, ``no matter how inconvenient, \nunpopular, unfashionable or discomforting.'' The greatest gift a great \nteacher can give.\n  He could be indulgent if the case seemed hopeless. I went to see him \nat the time I was thinking of running for the Senate. What would he \nadvise? ``Well,'' he said, ``you could do that. Who knows, you might \nmake a good Senator.'' Those words are with me to this moment.\n  I ask that the obituary from The Times, the article from The Weekly \nStandard, and the column from The Washington Post be included in the \nRecord.\n  The articles follow.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 8, 1999]\n\n        E.C. Banfield, 83, Maverick On Urban Policy Issues, Dies\n\n                         (By Richard Bernstein)\n\n       Edward C. Banfield, a professor emeritus of government at \n     Harvard University whose work on urban policy and the causes \n     of poverty gave him a reputation as a brilliant maverick, \n     died Sept. 30 at his summer home in Vermont. He was 83 and \n     lived in Cambridge, Mass.\n       Mr. Banfield, born on a farm in Bloomfield, Conn., held \n     Harvard's Henry Lee Shattuck Chair in Government for many \n     years. He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Harvard-\n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology Joint Center for Urban \n     Studies in the 1960's and 70's, when the problems of cities \n     were prominent on the national political agenda.\n       His books and articles had a sharp contrarian edge. He was \n     a critic of almost every mainstream liberal idea in domestic \n     policy, especially the use of Federal aid to help relieve \n     urban poverty. Mr. Banfield argued that at best Government \n     programs would fail because they aimed at the wrong problems; \n     at worst they would make the problems worse. He fostered \n     generations of graduate students, some of whom became leading \n     figures in American intellectual life. They included James Q. \n     Wilson, who succeeded him in his chair at Harvard, and \n     Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise \n     Institute in Washington.\n       Mr. Banfield received his B.A. in English for the \n     University of Connecticut in 1938 and went to work for the \n     United States Forest Service. After jobs with the New \n     Hampshire Farm Bureau and the United States Farm Security \n     Administration in Washington and California, he went to the \n     University of Chicago to work on his doctorate in political \n     science. Chicago at that time, under the influence of figures \n     like Milton Friedman and Leo Strauss, was a bastion of \n     Laissez-faire politics, a cause that Mr. Banfield later \n     promoted in his own work.\n       He served briefly on the faculty in Chicago, moving to \n     Harvard in 1959. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania \n     before returning to Harvard at the end of his career.\n       In 1955 Mr. Banfield and Mr. Meyerson collaborated on \n     ``Politics, Planning and the Public Interest,'' which \n     examined Chicago's public housing projects. That book was one \n     of several in which Mr. Banfield found Government programs to \n     be foiled by a law of unintended consequences. In the Chicago \n     case he predicted that creating tall institutional buildings \n     full of small apartments would have the unintended effect of \n     racially isolating the urban poor. A major theme of Mr. \n     Banfield's work on poverty, which was often angrily \n     criticized in liberal circles, is that culture plays a more \n     important role than factors like discrimination or lack of \n     education in impeding a person's economic progress.\n       Among his most influential books was ``The Moral Basis of a \n     Backward Society,'' a study of a small village in southern \n     Italy, researched in collaboration with his wife, the former \n     Laura Fasano. Mr. Banfield's thesis, summed up in a term he \n     coined, ``amoral familism,'' was that the narrow focus on \n     family relations prevented people from cooperating with those \n     outside the family or village.\n       He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Laura Banfield \n     Hoguet, a lawyer; a son, Elliott A. Banfield, an illustrator, \n     and four grandchildren.\n       Mr. Banfield's emphasis on culture as the basic element in \n     poverty drew accusations that he was promoting a ``blame the \n     victim'' attitude. In his 1970 book ``The Unheavenly City,'' \n     and in various papers that he published in the late 60's, he \n     recognized the existence and harm of racism but propounded \n     the view that economic class and not race was the essential \n     ingredient in poverty.\n       In that book Mr. Banfield constructed a sociological \n     portrait of what he called ``the lower-class individual'' as \n     someone who was very different from the middle-class \n     professionals who sought ways to solve his problems. ``The \n     lower-class individual lives moment to moment,'' he wrote. \n     ``Impulse governs his behavior either because he cannot \n     discipline himself to sacrifice a present for a future \n     satisfaction or because he has no sense of the future. He is \n     therefore radically improvident.''\n       Mr. Banfield's role as an adviser to President Richard M. \n     Nixon and chairman of his Model Cities Task force gave his \n     published views an extra measure of controversy. During the \n     Reagan Administration he served on a task force seeking ways \n     to increase public support for the arts. But his subsequent \n     book, ``the Democratic Muse: Visual Arts and the Public \n     Interest,'' argued that Federal support of the arts was \n     neither justified by the Constitution nor useful in practice.\n       ``Affording enjoyment to people is not a proper function of \n     organizations serving the common good,'' he wrote in that \n     book.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Oct. 18, 1999]\n\n        The Man Who Knew Too Much--Edward C. Banfield, 1916-1999\n\n                          (By James Q. Wilson)\n\n       In the increasingly dull, narrow, methodologically obscure \n     world of the social sciences, it is hard to find a mind that \n     speaks not only to its students but to its nation. Most \n     scholars can't write, many can't think. Ed Banfield could \n     write and think.\n       When he died a few days ago, his life gave new meaning to \n     the old saw about being a prophet without honor in your own \n     country. Almost everything he wrote was criticized at the \n     time it appeared for being wrongheaded. In 1955 he and Martin \n     Meyerson published an account of how Chicago built public \n     housing projects in which they explained how mischievous \n     these projects were likely to be: tall, institutional \n     buildings filled with tiny\n\n[[Page S12797]]\n\n     apartments built in areas that guaranteed racial segregation. \n     All this was to be done on the basis of the federal Housing \n     Act of 1949, which said little about what goals housing was \n     to achieve or why other ways of financing it--housing \n     vouchers, for example--should not be available. This was \n     heresy to the authors of the law and to most right-thinking \n     planners.\n       Within two decades, high-rise public housing was widely \n     viewed as a huge mistake and efforts were made to create \n     vouchers so that poor families could afford to rent housing \n     in the existing market. Local authorities in St. Louis had \n     dynamited a big housing project there after describing it as \n     a hopeless failure. It is not likely that Ed and Martin's \n     book received much credit for having pointed the way.\n       In 1958, Ed, with the assistance of his wife, Laura, \n     explained why a backward area in southern Italy was poor. The \n     reason was not government neglect or poor education but \n     culture. In this area of Italy, the Banfields said in The \n     Moral Basis of a Backward Society, people would not cooperate \n     outside the boundaries of their immediate families. These \n     ``amoral familists'' were the product of a high death rate, a \n     defective system for owning land, and the absence of any \n     extended families. By contrast, in a town of about the same \n     size located in an equally forbidding part of southern Utah, \n     the residents published a local newspaper and had a \n     remarkable variety of associates, each busily involved in \n     improving the life of the community. In southern Italy, \n     people would not cooperate; in southern Utah, they scarcely \n     did anything else.\n       Foreign aid programs ignored this finding and went about \n     persuading other nations to accept large grants to build new \n     projects. Few of these projects created sustained economic \n     growth. Where growth did occur, as in Singapore, Hong Kong, \n     and South Korea, there was little foreign aid and what \n     existed made little difference.\n       Today, David S. Landes, in his magisterial book that \n     explains why some nations become wealthy while others remain \n     poor, offers a one-word explanation: culture. He is right, \n     but the Banfield book written forty years earlier is not \n     mentioned.\n       In 1970, Ed published his best-known and most controversial \n     work, The Unheavenly City. In it he argued that the ``urban \n     crisis'' was misunderstood. Many aspects of the so-called \n     crisis, such as congestion or the business flight to the \n     suburbs, are not really problems at all; some that are modest \n     problems, such as transportation, could be managed rather \n     well by putting high peak-hour tolls on key roads and \n     staggering working hours; and many of the greatest problems, \n     such as crime, poverty, and racial injustice, are things \n     that we shall find it exceptionally difficult to manage.\n       Consider racial injustice. Racism is quite real, though \n     much diminished in recent years, and it has a powerful \n     effect. But the central problem for black Americans is not \n     racism but poverty. And poverty is in part the result of \n     where blacks live and what opportunities confront them. When \n     they live in areas with many unskilled workers and few jobs \n     for unskilled people, they will suffer. When they grow up in \n     families that do not own small businesses, they will find it \n     harder to move into jobs available to them or to meet people \n     who can tell them about jobs elsewhere. That whites treat \n     blacks differently than they treat other whites is obviously \n     true, but ``much of what appears . . . as race prejudice is \n     really class prejudice.''\n       In 1987 William Julius Wilson, a black scholar, published \n     his widely acclaimed book, The Truly Disadvantaged. In it he \n     says that, while racism remains a powerful force, it cannot \n     explain the plight of inner-city blacks. The problem is \n     poverty--social class--and that poverty flows from the \n     material conditions of black neighborhoods. Banfield's book \n     is mentioned in Wilson's bibliography, but his argument is \n     mentioned only in passing.\n       Both Wilson and Banfield explain the core urban problems as \n     ones that flow from social class. To Wilson, an \n     ``underclass'' has emerged, made up of people who lack \n     skills, experience long-term unemployment, engage in street \n     crime, and are part of families with prolonged welfare \n     dependency. Banfield would have agreed. But to Wilson, the \n     underclass suffers from a shortage of jobs and available \n     fathers, while for Banfield it suffers from a defective \n     culture.\n       Wilson argued that changing the economic condition of \n     underclass blacks would change their underclass culture; \n     Banfield argued that unless the underclass culture was first \n     changed (and he doubted much could be done in that regard), \n     the economic condition of poor blacks would not improve. The \n     central urban problem of modern America is to discover which \n     theory is correct.\n       Banfield had some ideas to help address the culture (though \n     he thought no government would adopt them): Keep the \n     unemployment rate low, repeal minimum-wage laws, lower the \n     school-leaving age, provide a negative income tax (that is, a \n     cash benefit) to the ``competent poor,'' supply intensive \n     birth-control guidance to the ``incompetent poor,'' and pay \n     problem families to send their children to decent day-care \n     programs.\n       The Unheavenly City sold well but was bitterly attacked by \n     academics and book reviewers; Wilson's book was widely \n     praised by the same critics. But on the central facts, both \n     books say the same thing, and on the unknown facts--What will \n     work?--neither book can (of necessity) offer much evidence.\n       Ed Banfield's work would probably have benefited from a \n     quality he was incapable of supplying. If it had been written \n     in the dreary style of modern sociology or, worse, if he had \n     produced articles filled with game-theoretic models and \n     endless regression equations, he might have been taken more \n     seriously. But Ed was a journalist before he was a scholar, \n     and his commitment to clear, forceful writing was unshakable.\n       He was more than a clear writer with a Ph.D.; everything he \n     wrote was embedded in a powerful theoretical overview of the \n     subject. ``Theory,'' to him, meant clarifying how people can \n     think about a difficulty, and the theories he produced--on \n     social planning, political influence, economic backwardness, \n     and urban problems--are short masterpieces of incisive prose.\n       His remarkable mind was deeply rooted in Western philosophy \n     as well as social science. To read his books is to be carried \n     along by extraordinary prose in which you learn about David \n     Hume and John Stuart Mill as well as about pressing human \n     issues. To him, the central human problem was cooperation: \n     How can society induce people to work together in informal \n     groups--Edmund Burke's ``little platoon''--to manage their \n     common problems? No one has ever thought through this issue \n     more lucidly, and hence no one I can think of has done more \n     to illuminate the human condition of the modern world.\n       A few months ago, a group of Ed's former students and \n     colleagues met for two days to discuss his work. Our fondness \n     for this amusing and gregarious man was manifest, as were our \n     memories of the tortures through which he put us as he taught \n     us to think and write. Rereading his work as a whole reminded \n     us that we had been privileged to know one of the best minds \n     we had ever encountered, a person whose rigorous intellect \n     and extraordinary knowledge created a standard to which all \n     of us aspired but which none of us attained.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 14, 1999]\n\n                      The Gift of a Great Teacher\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       If you are lucky in life, you will have at least one great \n     teacher. More than three decades ago, I had Ed Banfield, a \n     political scientist who taught mainly at the University of \n     Chicago and Harvard University. Ed's recent death at 83 \n     saddened me (which was expected) and left me with a real \n     sense of loss (which wasn't). Although we had stayed in \n     touch, we were never intimate friends or intellectual soul-\n     mates. The gap between us in intellectual candlepower was too \n     great. But he had loomed large in my life, and I have been \n     puzzling why his death has so affected me.\n       I think the answer--and the reason for writing about \n     something so personal--goes to the heart of what it means to \n     be a great teacher. By teacher, I am not referring primarily \n     to classroom instructors, because learning in life occurs \n     mainly outside of schools. I first encountered Ed in a \n     lecture hall, but his greatness did not lie in giving good \n     lectures (which he did). It lay instead in somehow \n     transmitting life-changing lessons. If I had not known him, I \n     would be a different person. He helped me become who I am \n     and, more important, who I want to be.\n       When you lose someone like that, there is a hole. It is a \n     smaller hole than losing a parent, a child or close friend. \n     But it is still a hole, because great teachers are so rare. I \n     have, for example, worked for some very talented editors. A \n     few have earned my lasting gratitude for improving my \n     reporting or writing. But none has been a great teacher; none \n     has changed my life.\n       What gave Ed this power was, first, his ideas. He made me \n     see new things or old things in new ways. The political \n     scientist James Q. Wilson--first Ed's student, then his \n     collaborator--has called Banfield ``the most profound student \n     of American politics in this century.'' Although arguable, \n     this is surely plausible.\n       Americans take democracy, freedom and political stability \n     for granted. Ed was more wary. These great things do not \n     exist in isolation. They must somehow fuse into a political \n     system that fulfills certain essential social functions: to \n     protect the nation; to provide some continuity in government \n     and policy; to maintain order and modulate society's most \n     passionate conflicts. The trouble, Ed believed, is that \n     democracies have self-destructive tendencies and that, in \n     modern America, these had intensified.\n       On the whole, he regretted the disappearance after World \n     War II of a political system based on big-city machines \n     (whose supporters were rewarded with patronage jobs and \n     contracts) and on party ``bosses'' (who dictated political \n     candidates from city council to Congress and, often, the \n     White House). It was not that he favored patronage, \n     corruption or bosses for their own sake. But in cities, they \n     created popular support for government and gave it the power \n     to accomplish things. And they emphasized material gain over \n     ideological fervor.\n       Postwar suburbanization and party ``reforms''--weakening \n     bosses and machines--destroyed this system. Its replacement, \n     Ed feared, was inferior. ``Whereas the old system had \n     promised personal rewards,'' he wrote, ``the new one \n     promises social reform.'' Politicians would now \n     merchandise themselves by selling false solutions to \n     exaggerated problems. ``The politician, like the TV news \n     commentator, must always have something to say even when \n     nothing urgently needs to be said,'' he wrote in 1970. By \n     some\n\n[[Page S12798]]\n\n     years, this anticipated the term ``talking head.'' People \n     would lose respect for government because many \n     ``solutions'' would fail. Here, too, he anticipated. \n     Later, polls showed dropping pubic confidence in national \n     leaders. Ed was not surprised.\n       He taught that you had to understand the world as it is, \n     not as you wished it to be. This was sound advice for an \n     aspiring reporter. And Ed practiced it. In 1954 and 1955, he \n     and his wife, Laura (they would ultimately be married 61 \n     years), spent time in a poor Italian village to explain its \n     poverty. The resulting book--``The Moral Basis of a Backward \n     Society''--remains a classic. Families in the village, it \n     argued, so distrusted each other that they could not \n     cooperate to promote common prosperity. The larger point \n     (still missed by many economists) is that local culture, not \n     just ``markets,'' determines economic growth.\n       What brought Ed fleeting prominence--notoriety, really--was \n     ``The Unheavenly City.'' Published in 1970. Prosperity, \n     government programs and less racial discrimination might lift \n     some from poverty, he said. But the worst problems of poverty \n     and the cities would remain. They resulted from a ``lower \n     class'' whose members were so impulsive and ``present \n     oriented'' that they attached ``no value to work, sacrifice, \n     self-improvement, or service to family, friends or \n     community.'' They dropped out of school, had illegitimate \n     children and were unemployed. Government couldn't easily \n     alter their behavior.\n       For this message, Ed was reviled as a reactionary. He \n     repeatedly said that most black Americans didn't belong to \n     the ``lower class'' and that it contained many whites. Still, \n     many dismissed him as a racist. Over time his theories gained \n     some respectability from the weight of experience. Poverty \n     defied government assaults; his ``lower class'' was relabeled \n     ``the underclass.'' But when he wrote, Ed was assailing \n     prevailing opinion. He knew he would be harshly, even \n     viciously, attacked. He wrote anyway and endured the \n     consequences.\n       This was the deeper and more important lesson. Perhaps all \n     great teachers--whether parents, bosses, professors or \n     whoever--ultimately convey some moral code. Ed surely did. \n     What he was saying in the 1960s was not what everyone else \n     was saying. I felt uneasy with the reigning orthodoxy. But I \n     didn't know why. Ed helped me understand my doubts and made \n     me feel that it was important to give them expression. The \n     truth had to be pursued, no matter how inconvenient, \n     unpopular; unfashionable or discomforting. Ed did not teach \n     that; he lived it. This was his code, and it was--for anyone \n     willing to receive it--an immeasurable gift.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/18/senate-section/article/S12798-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NOTICE\n\n\n                     registration of mass mailings\n\n  The filing date for 1999 third quarter mass mailings is October 25, \n1999.

So they had a chance to vote \nnot to ban soft money. Why didn't they do that?
