Today, the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nuntil 1 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach. It is expected the Senate will resume debate on the juvenile \njustice bill this afternoon. Senators who have amendments on the list \nwith respect to the juvenile justice bill should be prepared to offer \ntheir amendments today. I understand at least three Senators are \nprepared to offer one or more amendments, so that will take up, I am \nsure, a considerable amount of time. I understand that Senator Santorum \nand Senator Wellstone and Senator McConnell have amendments they will \nbe prepared to offer this afternoon. No rollcall votes will occur \nduring today's session.\n  Also, today it is the intention of the leadership to debate the Y2K \nlegislation for an hour or so at the end of the day, which would then, \nof course, take us over into tomorrow, when, under a previous unanimous \nconsent agreement, there will be a cloture vote on a motion to proceed \nto Y2K at 9:45 a.m.\n  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will, hopefully, complete \naction on the juvenile justice bill and the Y2K legislation. Also, the \nSenate will turn to the supplemental appropriations conference report. \nI understand that may not be available until late tomorrow afternoon or \nperhaps even Wednesday. Exactly when that will be brought up will \ndepend, in part at least, on the disposition of these other two bills. \nSenators should expect rollcall votes throughout each day and into the \nevening, if necessary, although I would not anticipate a late night on \nTuesday, but we could have to go into late nights Wednesday and \nThursday.\n  On Friday, we will not have any legislative business even though we \nmay have a pro forma session. There is a Democratic retreat similar to \nthe one the Republicans had last month, and that is scheduled for \nFriday. So we will not have any recorded votes so that they can attend \nthis meeting.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to again ask for cooperation by Senators in \noffering amendments and also trying to complete action on these two \nvery important bills. The Y2K liability issue is one of growing \nconcern. If you read the newspapers Friday and Saturday, you learned \nthat there is a growing problem with small businesses trying to become \nY2K compliant. There is a great deal of consternation about the \nliability exposure, and this bill provides a way for these problems to \nbe addressed without leading to a myriad of lawsuits. I have even seen \none statement that the Y2K litigation costs could exceed the cost of \nasbestos, breast implants, and tobacco litigation. That is massive. I \ndo not know whether that is accurate or not, but it is a problem with \nwhich we need to try to deal.\n  Also, on juvenile justice, this underlying bill has been in the \nmaking for 2 years. We have had amendments, and we will have other \namendments offered with regard to violence in the schools, how you deal \nwith that, with the impact of certain laws that we already have on the \nbooks as to schools and, of course, gun amendments. I hope we can come \nto a reasonable agreement of how we can complete both of these bills \nthis week and then go to the supplemental appropriations bill and be \nprepared late this week or early next week to turn to the defense \nauthorization bill. At a time when we have our men and women engaged in \ncombat, we need to go ahead and move this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  So those, along with the DOD appropriations bill, I hope to have \ncompleted by a week from Thursday night before the Memorial Day recess.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I observe the \nabsence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, the Senate today resumes consideration of \nthe youth violence bill. As we resume debate on this measure let me \nquote from a recent New York Times editorial:\n\n       In the past it was not hard to be struck by the way time \n     seemed to roll over a tragedy like a school shooting, by the \n     disparity between the enduring grief of parents who lost \n     children in places like Paducah and Jonesboro and the swift \n     distraction of the rest of us. This time, perhaps, things may \n     be different. The Littleton shootings have forced upon the \n     nation a feeling that many parents know all too well--that of \n     inhabiting the very culture they are trying to protect their \n     children from. * * * The urge to do something about youth \n     violence is very strong * * * but it will require an urge to \n     do many things, and to do them with considerable ingenuity \n     and dedication, before symptomatic violence of the kind that \n     occurred at Littleton begins to seem truly improbable, not \n     just as unlikely as the last shooting.\n\n  While I may not agree with the New York Times on everything, I doubt \nthat I could have described our task any better. I commend them for \nthis editorial. This issue is a complex problem which requires \ndedication, a spirit of cooperation, and an agreed-upon set of \nobjectives.\n  When I assumed chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of \nmy first actions was the creation of the Youth Violence Subcommittee. \nThe subcommittee made dealing with the problem of youth violence a \npriority, and our efforts on this front were paid greater attention in \nthe wake of juvenile crime tragedies. Yet, as the editorial in the New \nYork Times notes, the Nation's attention always seemed to be swiftly \ndistracted. Still, we pushed forward with our legislative efforts.\n  Senator Sessions held hearings in nearly empty hearing rooms. We \nspent more than 6 weeks in committee marking up the predecessor to the \nbill we have before us today. Some questioned our political \nequilibrium. After all, juvenile justice is fundamentally a State \nmatter, and our economy is robust. Why bother? That is what some felt. \nWell, we have worked on this bill and pushed for this bill because we \nthink it is the right thing to do and because it will improve juvenile \njustice and deter youth violence.\n  Some of us have invested substantial time, effort and political \ncapital in this bill. I have invested even more in this bill in these \nlast few days by supporting measures which, at an earlier time, I may \nnot have supported. I have put the goal of changing our culture of \nviolence and helping our young people first. The question for us now, \nhowever, is: Do we have the political strength as an institution to \ncome together and pass this bill promptly?\n  I firmly believe the work we have undertaken these last several days \ndemonstrates that we, on this side of the aisle, are dedicated to \naddressing the problems of youth violence and that we are willing to \nput our children first. We have made significant progress on this bill \nto date. We have voted on 14 amendments and I plan to accept even more \nin the managers' amendment. We have spent 4 legislative days on this \nmeasure. As a result, this is a better, more comprehensive bill than \nwhen we began the debate. If we focus our effort on where we can agree, \nas opposed to where we may differ, I believe we can pass this bill \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, the problem of school violence and juvenile crime is \nnot going to go away because we have debated the issue and voted on \nsome divisive amendments. In fact, the problem continued this weekend \nin Michigan where four juveniles, ages 12 through 14, were arrested and \ncharged with conspiracy to commit murder for plotting a school shooting \nsimilar to the massacre at Columbine High School. These four juveniles \nallegedly planned to kill their classmates by opening fire in the \nmiddle school assembly and then detonating a bomb on school grounds. \nMichigan prosecutors reported that the juveniles planned to kill more \nstudents than were killed at Columbine High School. A bomb that was \ndiscovered near the middle school campus on Thursday led school \nofficials to conduct school-by-school inspections and cancel school \nactivities.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have filed our antibomb amendment. It is \nastounding to me--the hundreds of articles on the Internet that teach \nkids how to do violence and make bombs.\n  In addition, a 13-year-old boy was arrested in Indiana this weekend \nfor planting seven pipe bombs in a car owned by one of his classmate's \nparents. One of the bombs exploded while the car was being driven. \nReportedly, the juvenile stalked the family after their daughter told \nauthorities that the boy had brought a gun to school.\n\n  Moreover, just days after the tragedy in Littleton, four junior high \nstudents in Wimberley, TX, were charged with plotting to kill students \nand teachers in a planned attack eerily similar to the one committed at \nColumbine High School. Gun powder, explosive devices, and bomb-making \ninstructions downloaded from the Internet were found at the juveniles' \nhomes. Incredibly, this was not a copycat plan. Rather, these 14-year-\nold boys had been planning the attack since the beginning of the year.\n  Mr. President, today, we believe and pray that the Columbine High \nSchool rampage will never be forgotten. Let's make sure that is the \ncase. Let's pass this bill. Remember, we said the same about similar \nshootings in recent years in schools in Pearl, MS, which left two dead; \nWest Paducah, KY, which left three dead; Jonesboro, AK, which left five \ndead; Edinboro, PA, which left one dead; and Springfield, OR, which \nleft two dead.\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n  These disturbing trends, which have occurred in every region of the \ncountry, provide further evidence that we should pass this legislation. \nNo longer can we reasonably say that youth violence is a random or \ninconsequential problem. In reality, this legislation is needed now \nmore than ever because juvenile crime and youth violence is \nunacceptably high by historical standards.\n  Given the magnitude of this problem--and the number of warning signs \nthat future tragedies may be imminent--we cannot afford to delay \npassage of this bill through amendment. Instead, we should come \ntogether and reach unanimous consent to pass this bill tomorrow. For \nthe sake of our children, let's wrap this bill up. This is a bipartisan \nbill. We have been open for suggestions from the administration and \nfrom the Justice Department. We haven't had any until this last \nweek. But most of those suggestions we have embodied in the bill or \nwill embody in the bill.\n\n  So let's pass this bill tomorrow. Let's get this bill enacted into \nlaw. Let's get the President to sign it, and let's do everything we can \nto prevent future tragedies like the one at Columbine High.\n  Elaine and I just had our 18th grandchild born a few days ago--a \nlittle girl named Madison Alysa. We are very concerned. We have 6 \nchildren and 18 grandchildren now. The 19th is on its way, and will be \nhere sometime in August. I have to say that I want to leave this world \na better place for them than it currently is. This bill is one \nmagnificent attempt to get us there. Nothing we do is going to \nabsolutely guarantee no future problems. But this bill will absolutely \nguarantee that there will be less of those future problems than we have \ntoday, and it may even, in the end, help us to guarantee that there are \nnone of these types of problems again, although I fully confess that I \nam probably wishing for too much under today's circumstances, with the \ninfluences that are besetting our kids throughout our society today.\n  Our problems are primarily cultural today. They are cultural. There \nis no question that we need to have accountability where kids learn to \nbe responsible for their actions, and learn that there is a price to be \npaid for actions that are denigrating to society. But we also need the \nprevention moneys in this bill that basically will help kids to realize \nthat if they have made a mistake, we are going to help them to get \nback, we are going to help them to be able to resolve their problems in \nlife.\n  We need the safe schools section of this bill. We need the section \nthat will help to change our culture by giving the entertainment \nindustry the tools by which they can voluntarily require compliance \nwith their retailers and their wholesalers so these adult and mature \nmaterials are not sold and disseminated to children.\n  We have a study in this bill by the FTC, the Federal Trade \nCommission, to study just whether or not some of these industries are \nactually targeting kids. Of course, we have other provisions as well. \nWe have the antitrust exemption, which would allow the companies to get \ntogether to voluntarily stop some of the things that are going on.\n  Last, but not least--I can talk about this all day--we need to get \ntough on violent juveniles. Some of these kids are every bit as bad as \nthe Mafia. They kill at the drop of a hat. They don't have any \nconscience. They laugh at those who are righteous and decent and \nmorally upright. And, frankly, we have to make sure that when they \ncommit these heinous crimes, that they pay a price for it. Hopefully, \nwe can rehabilitate them with the prevention moneys. But if we can't, \nthey ought to be removed from society so they can't kill other people \nor maim other people or cause the problems that they are currently \ncausing.\n  All of these things we can do with this bill. This is a bipartisan \nbill. We have good people on both sides of the aisle supporting it. I \nbelieve we need to get it done.\n  I appreciate the efforts of those who are here today willing to \npresent their amendments so we can get this matter finished, and so we \nknow, hopefully by the end of this day, just how many amendments we \nhave and what we need to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be offering a number of \namendments to this piece of legislation. First of all, I want to give \nthese amendments a little bit of context. I came to the floor last week \nready to offer these amendments. We had a whole series of other \namendments, many of them dealing with gun control and other important \namendments, we wanted to debate. I always said to my colleagues I was \nready, willing, and able to go forward with amendments that I thought \nwould dramatically improve this legislation.\n  I want to outline some of these amendments and then go to the \namendment which is before the Senate.\n  The first amendment would allow States to use the new juvenile \njustice delinquency prevention block grant funds ``for services to \njuveniles with serious mental and emotional disturbances in need of \nmental health services'' before they land in the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  This amendment also allows States to make the decision to use the \nJJDP block grant funds for ``projects designed to provide support to \nState and local programs designed to prevent juvenile delinquency by \nproviding for assessment by qualified mental health professionals of \nincarcerated juveniles who are suspected to be in need of mental health \nservices'' who need an individual treatment plan, and so forth.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this \nlanguage is very similar to what is actually in the House bill. I am \ntrying to say we ought to allow States to use the block grant funds for \na couple of different things.\n  No. 1, on the front end of this system, you have a kid--and this \nhappens to be an area in which I have done a fair amount of work--\nstruggling with mental illness. You want to be in a position to be able \nto use this money to identify this child with this particular problem \nand get the child into the kind of treatment that is needed as an \nalternative to incarceration.\n  We have entirely too many kids locked up who probably shouldn't be--\nnot probably; who shouldn't be--locked up in the first place. I met \nsome of these kids, kids who stole a moped or kids charged with \nbreaking and entering. They have never committed a violent crime, they \nhave a whole history of struggling with mental illnesses, but these \nkids weren't identified. There was no way of assessing this and \nproviding these kids with some treatment as an alternative.\n  We want to make sure we have specific language that provides funds \nfor services to juveniles with serious mental and emotional \ndisturbances, to juveniles in need of mental health services, before \nthey land in the juvenile justice system. It seems to me that any piece \nof juvenile justice legislation would want to include this language.\n  The second thing, it is absolutely brutal, it is absolutely harsh, it \nis absolutely unconscionable, that there are so many kids locked up in \nthese facilities ages 11, 12, and 13 who struggle with mental illness \nand don't get any treatment. Again, we want to make sure that we allow \nStates to use these JJDP block funds to do a much better job of \nassessing the kid's needs once that kid is incarcerated, figuring out \nwhat kind of individualized treatment plan will make sense and make \nsure the kids are treated.\n  I am sick and tired of the stigma about mental illness. It is pretty \nhorrible to see what can happen to kids. I think what many of my \ncolleagues absolutely have to realize is that many children--and there \nare children who wind up in these facilities--really are brutalized. \nThey are brutalized. They are not even in a position to defend \nthemselves, and they receive no treatment at all.\n  I am going to go on and come back to this amendment.\n  The second amendment I will be introducing is an amendment which \nallows States to use block grant funds for implementation of the \ntraining of justice system personnel. This comes out of the Mental \nHealth Juvenile Justice Act I introduced in January, a bill I have been \nworking on for about a year.\n  Again, basically what this says to States is, if you want to use \nthese block grant funds to make sure a lot of the individuals who are \nin our juvenile justice system--from the judges, to the probation \nofficers, to school officials, to a whole bunch of other people--are\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\ntrained so they can recognize kids who are struggling with these mental \nproblems, then you should be able to do so. Often you do not have \npeople within this juvenile justice system who have the training to \nrecognize a child who is struggling with mental illness, who needs \ntreatment for that illness. What this amendment says is let's allow \nStates to use some of this block grant money for such training. Again, \nI will go into this amendment in detail later on, but I find it \ndifficult to believe this is an amendment that would not be accepted to \na piece of legislation called juvenile justice.\n  The third amendment I am going to introduce has to do with children \nwho witness domestic violence. This area of work for me has become the \nopposite of academic. I do a lot of this work with my wife Sheila. It \nis based upon all sorts of women and children who have been victims of \nfamily violence.\n  As I said before on the floor of the Senate, roughly speaking, about \nevery 15 seconds a woman is battered in her home. A home should be a \nsafe place. All too often, children are battered as well. The \nconnection to this legislation is that if you ask judges what the files \nlook like of kids who appear in their court at 13, 14 years of age, \nquite often those judges will talk about the violence in the homes.\n  We have not done a good job. We are beginning to focus on the need to \nprovide support for women. That was the Violence Against Women Act on \nwhich Senator Biden and Senator Murray and many others provided a \ntremendous amount of leadership as did Senator Hatch. But what we have \nnot recognized is the effects of this violence against the parent--and \nall too often that is the woman--on the children. Even if the child \nhimself or herself is not battered--and quite often that happens--they \nsee it all the time. When they come to school, quite often they cannot \ndo well. Often it is not recognized by school authorities.\n  So this amendment, which is extremely relevant to this legislation, \nwould provide a comprehensive intersystem approach to limiting the \neffects of domestic violence on the lives of children. This is an \namendment, again, on which I will go into great detail, that will \nprovide the funds for our Nation to do a better job at the community \nlevel, to bring together all the different adults who come in contact \nwith these children, and get some support to these children.\n  I do not know how to put it except this way: You can have the \nsmallest class size, you can have the best teachers, you can have the \nbest technology, but if that child has been in a home where that child \nhas seen his mother beaten up over and over and over again, the chances \nare that child is in trouble. The chances are that child may not be \nable to do well in school. And the chances are right now we have a \nwhole lot of people, from school officials to law enforcement \nofficials, you name it, who will not recognize that. We need to figure \nout ways of enabling adults in the community to recognize children who \nare going through this, and we need to figure out a way to provide more \nsupport for these children.\n  The fourth amendment is an amendment of which I am very proud. I have \na lot of different support for it, from the Conference of Mayors to the \nAmerican School Health Association. This amendment would provide for \n100,000 new school counselors, plus school psychologists and school \nsocial workers. This would be Federal funds matched by funds from \nStates and local school districts.\n  It is very simple. There is no be-all, there is no end-all, but when \nI marshal evidence for this amendment I think my colleagues are going \nto be shocked at the extent to which we have really no infrastructure \nof support for so many of these kids when it comes to mental health \nservices. We do not have enough counselors. We do not have enough \nschool psychologists. We do not have enough social workers. We cannot \neven begin to help a lot of kids who need somebody to whom they can go. \nSo, again, I think this amendment is right on point.\n  Finally, I will have an amendment that will take some time, which is \nindirect to this legislation, which is the welfare recipient \naccountability amendment. There are two other amendments.\n  Just to put colleagues on notice on this, what I want to say is--and \nI, unfortunately, will be able to marshal a lot evidence--now that we \nare beginning to get the fragmentary reports of what is going on with \nthe welfare bill, we are finding, for the majority of women who are off \nwelfare, a dramatic reduction in the welfare roll is not equal to a \ndramatic reduction in poverty. The majority of these women are working \nat jobs, the prevailing wage of which is less than they were receiving \nbefore. In a lot of cases, these children are not getting decent child \ncare. Therefore, I have to worry about where these kids are going to \ngo.\n  Let's at least call on Health and Human Services to require States to \nprovide us with the data as to where these women and children are: What \nkind of jobs do they have at what kind of wages? What is the situation \nwith their children? We ought to know. We ought to know.\n  Tomorrow, this amendment, I think, will cause a major debate. I hope \nthere will be overwhelming support for it. There really were close to \n400 votes in the House of Representatives, I believe.\n  One of the flaws of this legislation is to take out the language that \ndeals with disproportionate minority confinement. I will spend a lot of \ntime on the floor tomorrow, with Senator Kennedy, on this question, \nbecause right now this piece of legislation takes us backwards. It \ntakes us backwards from the current situation, or from what the House \nof Representatives has proposed, which is we want to know about the \n``why'' of disproportionate minority confinement. We want to know why \nso many children of color are the ones who are picked up, so many \nchildren of color wind up in the court system, so many of them wind up \nin these so-called correctional facilities--all out of proportion to \nnumber of crimes committed. We do have to come to terms with race in \nAmerica.\n  The fact of the matter is the disproportionate minority confinement \nlanguage right now has enabled some States to do some very good work. \nStates on their own--on their own because of Federal legislation--are \ndoing some very good analysis of why we have so many of these kids of \ncolor in these facilities. This legislation would basically stop that \neffort. This legislation takes us backwards. It is a huge mistake. I \nhave not seen the civil rights community more focused on trying to get \nan amendment agreed to than this amendment. I look forward to this \ndebate. I think it is extremely important.\n  Mr. President, let me, then, introduce the first two amendments that \nI am hoping will be noncontroversial. They are drawn from the Mental \nHealth Juvenile Justice Act. Again, this legislation I introduced \nseveral months ago received the support of over 40 organizations. They \ngo all the way from the American Bar Association to the Children's \nDefense Fund, to district attorneys' offices, to State judges, \nprobation, and police officers, you name it. Right now, S. 254 pays \nonly lip service to the problem of children with mental illness in our \njuvenile justice system. These amendments have teeth, providing States \nwith grants to fund programs to keep children who struggle with mental \nillness out of the juvenile justice system altogether and to identify \nand treat those who are in it.\n  Elie Wiesel once said:\n\n       More than anything--more than hatred and torture--more than \n     pain--do I fear indifference.\n\n  We must be diligent and not allow ourselves to be indifferent to \nchildren's misery, particularly those children who may be sick, \ndifficult, and test our patience, our understanding and our compassion.\n  Yet, we have become in our country, I fear, deeply indifferent to how \nwe treat juveniles in the justice system who live in this shadow of \nmental illness. Each year, more than 1 million youth come in contact \nwith the juvenile justice system and more than 100,000 of these youth \nare detained in some type of jail or prison. These people are \noverwhelmingly poor and a disproportionate number of them are children \nof color.\n  By the time many of these children are arrested and incarcerated, \nthey have a long history of problems in their very short lives. As many \nas two-thirds suffer from mental or emotional disturbance; 1 in 5, 20 \npercent, has a serious disorder; many have substance\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\nabuse problems and learning disabilities; most of them come from \ntroubled homes.\n  The ``crimes'' of these children vary. While some have committed \nviolent crimes--and we have to hold a child or an adult accountable for \na violent crime--some have committed petty theft or skipped school. \nStill others have simply run away from home to escape physical or \nsexual abuse from parents or other adults.\n  The vast majority of children who are in these juvenile justice \nfacilities have not committed a violent crime. In fact, despite popular \nopinion, most of the children who are locked up are not violent. \nJustice Department studies show that 1 in 20 youth in the juvenile \njustice system has committed a violent offense--1 in 20 of youth in the \njuvenile justice system has committed violent offenses.\n  Jails in the juvenile justice centers are often found unprepared to \ndeal with the mentally ill. For instance, medication is not given when \nit should be given or it is not properly monitored or guards may not \nknow how to respond to a disturbed youth who is just not capable of \nstanding in line for orderly meals. As a result, many of these children \nare disciplined and put in solitary confinement.\n  What is happening to these troubled children--and this is why I want \nmy colleagues to accept this amendment; this is why I have been waiting \ndays for this amendment--is a national tragedy. All across the country, \nwe are criminalizing mental illness of children, and we are dumping \nemotionally disturbed kids into juvenile prisons.\n  What this amendment says is we at least allow States to take the \nblock grant money to do a better job of assessing these children when \nthey get into trouble, and if these children are struggling with mental \nillness or struggling with emotional problems and they have not \ncommitted a violent crime, let us at least make sure we provide some \ndiversionary programs, some community-based treatment, as opposed to \nincarcerating these children.\n  This comes right from this juvenile justice mental health \nlegislation. We ought to pass this amendment, I say to my colleagues.\n  What is happening to these troubled children is a national tragedy. \nWhy do so many youth with mental illness end up in the juvenile justice \nsystem? Children with mental disorders often behave in ways that bring \nthem in conflict with family members, with authority figures and peers.\n  Over the last 10 years, the public attitude toward juvenile crime has \ngrown tougher. Consequently, the juvenile justice system is casting a \nwider net. A growing fear and intolerance of children who misbehave or \ncommit nonviolent offenses have pushed children into the juvenile \njustice system who would not have ended up there in earlier times.\n\n  At the same time, our country has failed to invest adequately in \nservices and programs that can reduce the need for their incarceration. \nThese include mental health services. The warning signs for delinquency \nare well known: School failure, drug and alcohol abuse, family violence \nand abuse, and poverty. Yet, we have failed to put in place community \nprevention, screening, and early intervention services for those \nchildren who are most at risk.\n  Proper mental health treatment can prevent or reduce the offending, \nbut many, many, many communities do not have adequate services for \nchildren and their families. Let me read a couple of examples.\n  Matthew--and I am not going to use the full name--Matthew I. has a \nhistory of mental health problems. He has received services from the \npublic mental health center and has been hospitalized several times in \nprivate psychiatric institutions.\n  One night in 1996, Matthew heard voices telling him to run away from \nhome. He listened to the voices, and in the process of running away, he \nstole two bicycles. Matthew was arrested and charged with theft. He was \nsentenced to the Swanson Correctional Center for Youth. While in \nSwanson, Matthew was beaten and witnessed guards abusing other youths. \nMatthew received disciplinary tickets for falling asleep. His \npsychotropic medications made him sleepy, so he stopped taking his \nmedicine. Without his medication, Matthew was impulsive and had \ndifficulty following orders. So, again, he received disciplinary \ntickets.\n  Despite continued requests from his mother, Matthew did not receive \nan evaluation by a psychiatrist until he attempted suicide. After the \nsuicide attempt, Matthew saw the psychiatrist in 6-week to several-\nmonth intervals. He did not receive mental health counseling services. \nMatthew made several suicidal attempts after the first one.\n  After almost 2 years of confinement in the juvenile prison, Matthew \nis now at home. That is one example. This is from Shannon Robshaw, \nexecutive director of the Mental Health Association in Louisiana.\n  Daron R. was physically and sexually abused by his babysitters from \ninfancy to age 7. He has marks on his face where this couple threw \nrocks at him and hit him with a broom.\n  Daron is a brilliant child and categorized by the school as \n``gifted.'' Daron is explosive and has a hard time controlling his \ntemper. He is impulsive and has difficulty following directions. Now 10 \nyears old, Daron has a history of psychiatric hospitalization and is \ntaking several medications.\n  In September 1998, he became uncontrollable at home and was sentenced \nto Jetson Correctional Center for Youth. At his mother's request, \nDaron's school psychologist attempted to assist him by participating in \na telephone conference call. During this conference, she was told \nJetson did not have to provide educational services for gifted \nchildren.\n  In Jetson, Daron had problems so the guards responded by throwing the \n10-year-old against the wall. The psychologist asked if the guards were \ntrained in passive restraint and was told no. Daron's mother and \npsychologist took pictures of the bruises on Daron's body. Daron was \nreleased to a State mental hospital last Christmas.\n\n  A final example--and when people come back tomorrow, I am going to \nget colleagues to listen before we vote on this amendment. These are \nchildren's lives.\n  Travis M. was charged with stealing a bicycle. I met him. Travis M. \nwas charged with stealing a bicycle and sentenced to Tallulah \nCorrections Center for Youth for 3 months. Fourteen at the time, Travis \nhad been hospitalized for psychiatric problems three times, the most \nrecent only 1 month before being sentenced to Tallulah. Travis was \nlabeled with attention deficit disorder, oppositional defiant disorder \nand mild mental retardation. Travis takes three psychotropic \nmedications.\n  At Tallulah, Travis was unable to successfully complete the boot camp \nand received numerous disciplinary tickets for not following orders and \nfor falling asleep. These tickets extended his sentence by a year and a \nhalf.\n  While at Tallulah, Travis was abused by guards and saw guards beat \nothers. Travis witnessed guards putting a hit out on youths. While at \nTallulah, Travis contemplated suicide and was told by a guard to ``go \nahead, that will be one less to deal with.''\n  Eighteen months after being placed in Tallulah, Travis was released. \nNow he suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome and has flashbacks \nof his violent experience in Tallulah.\n  (Mr. LUGAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator be amenable to having a time agreement on \nthis amendment, because up to now we have been working on very short \ntime agreements and going back and forth. We have an amendment over \nhere that will be offered and then we can come back to the Senator for \nhis next amendment. If we can work pursuant to time agreements, it will \nbe very helpful to the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague that I do not \nintend to take a long time. It depends on what my colleague means by a \n``time agreement.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we agree to a unanimous consent time agreement of some \nlimit so we know when we can get somebody over here to present his or \nher amendment? I understand the distinguished Senator has three \namendments. We will be glad to come back to the distinguished Senator \nfor his second one, and then we will go back over here again, and then \ncome back again.\n  But I would like to be able to have some ability to know when I \nshould\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\nhave people here so we do not waste floor time, because we are \npressured. We have worked all weekend to get our amendments down from \nthe thirties to seven. The Democrat amendments are in the forties. I \nwould like you to do the same, to work them down to seven. But it does \nmean some cooperation on both sides. I do not want people over here \ngoing on with any length either. And I will try to make sure they \ncooperate with reasonable time constraints.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me ask my colleague. I would be \npleased to accommodate him. Here is the question from me. In fact, I am \nalmost surprised these first two amendments have not even been \naccepted. I have been working most of my adult life in this area, and I \nreally want to talk about mental health and juvenile justice.\n  I think there are two amendments here. I don't want to rush through \nthis and not give justice to what I think is an agonizingly important \nand painful question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But I have no intention of going on and on; so if we \ncould get a reasonable time limit. Could I ask this: Since I have a lot \nof amendments here, how long are we allotting to different Senators? In \nother words, Senator Sessions has an amendment.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Sessions has an amendment.\n  Ten minutes equally divided on your side, so we can keep the time \nconstraints here?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. For yourself? So 20 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. If there is no one to argue on the other side, it would be \na 10-minute amendment. Thus far, I do not know of anybody who is going \nto argue against it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be pleased to finish up on my \namendment in a short period of time. It sounds as if my colleague does \nnot need a lot of time, but I would like to be able to offer my \namendments here today.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is the purpose here. If I could bring to the \nSenator's attention, that is why we are listening to him, because we \nbelieve he is going to offer his amendments today. And we are certainly \ngoing to look at them.\n  I also tell the Senator, I am a strong supporter of mental health \nprograms.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know about that.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will have a major debate on mental health on the SAMHSA \nbill this year, and I am going to try to help him and others who feel \ndeeply about it. Certainly mental health concerns are a part of this \nbill, because we provide, in one block grant, that mental health \nconcerns can be part of that block grant. So we have not failed to \nconsider that. But we left it up to the States to make those \ndeterminations rather than dictate to them or tell them what they have \nto do.\n  Now, I guess what I am saying----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, this is why we may need more \ntime. This actually just allows for the States, but it has the same \nlanguage the House has which specifically lists mental health services \nso we make it clear this is part of what is to be done. We do not \nmandate this.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no problem with the Senator bringing up his \namendment. Could we, on this first amendment----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I can finish in 10 minutes and \nthen we can go to another amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator be \ngranted 10 more minutes on his amendment and then we go to the Senator \nfrom Alabama for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, after my colleague from \nAlabama is recognized, I ask that we then return to me and I can offer \nmy next amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could we determine a time limit on your next amendment? I \ndo not know of anybody here who is going to speak in opposition at this \npoint. They will probably wait until the 5 minutes before the \namendments are called up for a vote. But could we have a time limit on \nyour second amendment, as well? Then I will be able to tell the next \nSenator offering an amendment when to be here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am almost finished on the first one, \nbut I cannot----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator give it some consideration, and we will \ntalk about it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I ask that my unanimous consent agreement be \napproved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 356\n\n  (Purpose: To improve the juvenile delinquency prevention challenge \n                             grant program)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Minnesota send his \namendment to the desk.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 356.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 89, line 18, strike ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 89, line 21, add ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 89, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(H) to provide services to juveniles with serious mental \n     and emotional disturbances (SED) who are in need of mental \n     health services;\n       On page 90, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(4) projects that support State and local programs to \n     prevent juvenile delinquency by providing for--\n       ``(A) assessments by qualified mental health professionals \n     of incarcerated juveniles who are suspected of being in need \n     of mental health services;\n       ``(B) the development of individualized treatment plans for \n     juveniles determined to be in need of mental health services \n     pursuant to assessments under subparagraph (A);\n       ``(C) the inclusion of discharge plans for incarcerated \n     juveniles determined to be in need of mental health services; \n     and\n       ``(D) requirements that all juveniles receiving \n     psychotropic medication be under the care of a licensed \n     mental health professional;\n       On page 90, line 8, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 90, line 17, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 91, line 1, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n       On page 91, line 11, strike ``(7)'' and insert ``(8)''.\n       On page 91, line 17, strike ``(8)'' and insert ``(9)''.\n       On page 91, line 22, strike ``(9)'' and insert ``(10)''.\n       On page 92, line 6, strike ``(10)'' and insert ``(11)''.\n       On page 92, line 16, strike ``(11)'' and insert ``(12)''.\n       On page 92, line 24, strike ``(12)'' and insert ``(13)''.\n       On page 93, line 5, strike ``(13)'' and insert ``(14)''.\n       On page 93, line 13, strike ``(14)'' and insert ``(15)''.\n       On page 93, line 17, strike ``(15)'' and insert ``(16)''.\n       On page 93, line 20, strike ``(16)'' and insert ``(17)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just again, to summarize, this is not a \nmandate. The amendment allows States to use the new juvenile justice \ndelinquency prevention block grant funds for ``services to juveniles \nwith serious mental and emotional disturbances . . . who are in need of \nmental health services'' before they land in the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  This is the language from the House legislation. And this is language \nwhich is critically important, because if we do not have, I say to my \ncolleague from Utah, language with this kind of specificity, then I \nthink once again these kids just get lost in the shuffle.\n  I say to my colleague from Alabama, the second thing this amendment \ndoes is it says that for those kids who are incarcerated, let's allow \nStates--they do not have to do it--to use the block grant funds for \nprograms which will enable them to do an assessment of these kids, once \nin these facilities, who are struggling with mental problems, and make \nsure that they can get some treatment to these kids.\n  That is what these two amendments do.\n  I will talk about my visit to Tallulah--it is but one example--a \nfacility in Louisiana. The only thing I\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\ncan tell you is that all across the country, unfortunately--and \nTallulah is but one example--you have a lot of kids locked up who do \nnot need to be. They stole a moped. They did not commit a violent \ncrime. They have all sorts of mental problems. They are not getting the \ncare they need. They could be treated in their community. You do not \nwant to have them incarcerated. And then, God knows, for those who are \nincarcerated, you want to make sure they get the treatment.\n  That is what this amendment says. When I was in Tallulah, there were \nabout 650 kids, and about 80 percent were African American--we will get \nto the whole problem of disproportionate minority confinement tomorrow \nin the amendment--as young as age 11; and many of them--I am sorry, too \nmany of them--quite often are locked up in solitary confinement for up \nto 7 weeks, 23 hours a day, as young as age 11.\n  What I am saying is, at least let's allow States, with some clear \nlanguage here, to provide mental health services to these kids who need \nservices. That is what this amendment is all about. The way these \nchildren are treated is brutal; it is harsh; it is unconscionable; it \nis not right. I hope to get very strong support for this legislation.\n  While I am speaking, for those who may be watching, I thank the Chair \npersonally, as opposed to reading or writing notes, for having the \ncourtesy to listen to what I have to say as a Senator. I thank Senator \nLugar from Indiana for doing that. That is very important to me as a \nSenator when I am speaking about an issue that I think is important. I \nthank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Are we going to try to see whether we can work this \nout? I would reserve time if I thought there was going to be debate. I \nam ready to debate amendments. Whatever you want to do.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator's statements are going to be the only \nones until prior to the votes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. Then I will yield the floor and come back with an \namendment after my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator may put into the Record any additional \ncomments that he cares to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to do so. I just say to my \ncolleague from Utah, whom I do not want to anger, not because I mind \ndebating him--I appreciate the debates--but because I know how \naccommodating he can be, I am not going to come out here and talk and \ntalk and talk, but I want to have the opportunity to give some context \nto these amendments. I think it is really important.\n  So I would like to ask unanimous consent that I follow Senator \nSessions. And I will try to do it in as efficient a way as possible.\n  I do not think I can do every amendment in 10 minutes. I do not \nintend to. I just want to be honest with my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership on \ncrime issues of all kinds for quite a number of years. In particular, I \nhave had the honor to work with him on this juvenile crime bill. He is \na skilled legislator. He understands the criminal justice system in \nAmerica and contributes significantly to it. He is also an outstanding \nspokesman on behalf of a rational and well-thought-out system of \ncriminal justice in America.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment that I believe will be accepted \nwhich is very important and can be an effective step in improving \njuvenile justice. It deals with a juvenile hotline.\n  A number of years ago, when I was a U.S. attorney in Alabama, 7or 8 \nyears ago, not too long, we had a conference about young people \ncarrying guns and committing crimes and what we could do about it. We \ncame up with a plan--the chief of police, the district attorney, the \nprobation officer, the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile, and other \ngroups--to encourage people who saw children in trouble or in danger to \ncall. The police worked out their 911 number, and it can be boiled down \nto a bumper sticker. It said: ``Kid with gun, call 911.'' The idea was \nto get people involved in that kind of program.\n  Just recently, the State of Alabama developed a program to call a \nstatewide 1-800 number hotline. They have had some remarkable successes \nwith that.\n  I would like to introduce as one of the permissible uses of the funds \nin this bill a program we call the CRISIS grant program. It is a \nconfidential reporting of individuals suspected of imminent school \nviolence. I will introduce this amendment to S. 254.\n  Hotlines are violence prevention tools. The establishment of \nconfidential hotlines that parents, students, and teachers would call \nto alert State and local enforcement entities of threats of imminent \nschool violence or other suspicious criminal acts is an important \nprevention tool that can save kids' lives and prevent other wrongdoing.\n  Early identification of and intervention with potentially violent \njuveniles before they commit a violent act is certainly to be \nsupported. This amendment will allow the States to use this CRISIS \ngrant money to support both the independent State development and State \noperation of hotline programs. It will ensure that State personnel who \nwill be answering those calls are trained properly. It will allow the \nState to acquire technology necessary to enhance the hotline's \neffectiveness, including Internet web pages perhaps, enhance State \nefforts to offer appropriate counseling services to individuals who \ncall the hotline threatening to do themselves or others harm, and to \nfurther State efforts to publicize the service so that people will know \nabout it and will be encouraged to use it. No additional funds will be \nexpended out of this program, but it will utilize funds that have \nalready been considered part of our juvenile crime bill.\n  So this would be a program under the State, not Federal control. \nState governments are, I think, anxious in considering just these kinds \nof projects. I believe it will be something every State should give the \nmost serious consideration to.\n  Let me tell you a recent Alabama example, really in response to the \nLittleton tragedy. People asked themselves, what could we do? How could \nwe avoid that? Is there a communication problem? How can we respond to \nit? Alabama established this confidential free hotline. The program has \nthe support of Alabama's Democratic Governor and Republican Attorney \nGeneral. In the first 2 weeks of operation, the Department of Public \nSafety reports receiving over 800 phone calls from communities, large \nand small, urban and rural, throughout the State in Alabama. Each of \nthese incidents reported to the hotline are forwarded to the \nappropriate local law enforcement for investigation and followup. The \nprogram grades these calls in terms of severity of threat.\n\n  Of the 800 calls that came in to the hotline, almost 50 percent were \nclassified as an imminent threat, a possible threat, or a drug threat--\nthe three most severe categories. Calls made in these threat categories \nare referred immediately to local law enforcement for investigation.\n  In addition to law enforcement, Alabama has someone available from \nthe State Mental Health Department to counsel or refer individuals who \ncall in who are threatening suicide or to hurt someone else. It will \nhelp States achieve both the goals of enhancing law enforcement and \nprovide appropriate counseling to individual callers.\n  Additionally, the majority of the calls made to the State hotline \noccurred during the hours of 4 to 9 p.m. each day, and they came \npredominantly from parents of schoolchildren who are repeating or \npassing on things they heard from their children, perhaps some at the \nsupper table. Parents are serving as filters of information. They are \nnot likely to call in if they do not think there is any possibility of \na problem.\n  Usually most of the calls are deemed to have been credible that are \nbeing received by the hotline. It allows for the identification of \nindividuals who may have multiple complaints. So multiple calls about a \nparticular individual could lead to a positive law enforcement \nresponse.\n  The Huntsville Times editorialized in favor of this and wrote an \narticle about an incident in which five students at a junior high \nschool in Russell County\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nwere charged with planning to bomb their school and who had created a \nhit list of teachers and administrators. In addition to the hit list, \nsome witnesses reported seeing a detailed map of the school. It is the \nkind of information that could be brought in through a hotline.\n  I will quote from that editorial.\n\n       Because of the Columbine shooting spree, we will never \n     again be sure if threats are threats or merely false alarms . \n     . . We don't recommend panic or paranoia. But if the threats \n     come, they must be investigated. And if the evidence is \n     found, it can't be ignored or assumed to be a prank.\n\n  I believe this is a good program. I thank Senator Hatch for his \ninterest in supporting this. If I am not mistaken, I believe that \nMembers on the other side are perhaps prepared to accept this as an \namendment to our bill. I am pleased to note that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Alabama please have his \namendment reported to the desk?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will leave my remarks at this time. I \nam hopeful the managers will make that part of a managers' amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 357\n\n   (Purpose: Relating to the placement of a disclaimer on materials \nproduced, procured or disseminated as a result of funds made available \n                            under this Act)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I did want to offer at this time another amendment, \nwithout objection, a disclaimer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 357.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, between lines 20 and 21 insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. DISCLAIMER ON MATERIALS PRODUCED, PROCURED OR \n                   DISTRIBUTED FROM FUNDING AUTHORIZED BY THIS \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) All materials produced, procured, or distributed, in \n     whole or in part, as a result of Federal funding authorized \n     under this Act for expenditure by Federal, State or local \n     governmental recipients or other non-governmental entities \n     shall have printed thereon the following language:\n       ``This material has been printed, procured or distributed, \n     in whole or in part, at the expense of the Federal \n     Government. Any person who objects to the accuracy of the \n     material, to the completeness of the material, or to the \n     representations made within the material, including \n     objections related to this material's characterization of \n     religious beliefs, are encouraged to direct their comments to \n     the office of the Attorney General of the United States.''\n       (b) All materials produced, procured, or distributed using \n     funds authorized under this Act shall have printed thereon, \n     in addition to the language contained in paragraph (a), a \n     complete address for an office designated by the Attorney \n     General to receive comments from members of the public.\n       (c) The office designated under paragraph (b) by the \n     Attorney General to receive comments shall, every six months, \n     prepare an accurate summary of all comments received by the \n     office. This summary shall include details about the number \n     of comments received and the specific nature of the concerns \n     raised within the comments, and shall be provided to the \n     Chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, the \n     Senate and House Education Committee, the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the Senate, and the Speaker and Minority \n     Leader of the House of Representatives. Further, the comments \n     received shall be retained by the office and shall be made \n     available to the any member of the general public upon \n     request.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This amendment simply says that with regard to the \nmaterials that can be printed--and we expect a lot of materials will be \nprinted as a result of the almost $900 million-plus that will be going \nforward for juvenile crime programs--that those materials be \naccountable to the American people. I ask that we simply print on those \nmaterials a disclaimer that will note that this material was produced \nby the Federal Government. It would say, in fact, this:\n\n       This material has been printed, procured or distributed, in \n     the whole or in part, at the expense of the Federal \n     Government. Any person who objects to the accuracy of the \n     material, the completeness of the material, or to the \n     representations made within the material, including \n     objections related to the material's characterization of \n     religious beliefs, are encouraged to direct their comments to \n     the office of Attorney General of the United States.\n\n  It further requires that the Attorney General designate one of her \noffices to receive the complaints, and to submit summaries of those \ncomplaints to the Congress, including the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees, the majority leader, the Speaker, and minority leaders in \nthe House and in the Senate.\n  We believe this would be a unique opportunity to allow persons who \nare receiving materials funded by the Federal Government to express \nconcerns and provide information that may make those materials better. \nIn addition, we believe like it would allow the Congress to be able to \nmonitor the material, because what so often happens--and most people \nmay not even realize it--this Congress proposes funds and they go out \nto various organizations who print material that can be very helpful, \nand some of it is excellent. Some of it is not good. Periodically, we \nreceive complaints on materials that go against deeply held views of \nAmericans, and which are inaccurate.\n  So this amendment would allow for a disclaimer on such materials. \nWhen people see it, they will know where to write. They would have a \ncentral place within the Department of Justice to receive it. Then they \ncould, in fact, review the complaints and we could take steps to \ncorrect it.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit on this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will send an amendment to the desk \nshortly.\n  I appreciate my colleague's heartfelt words. Again, I hope we will \nhave a thorough debate about this legislation. I think there are some \nkids who commit really violent crimes, and they should be held \naccountable.\n  I want to say this very carefully to my colleague from Colorado, who \nis now in the Chair. From my own part, given what the Senator from \nColorado has been through, and what his State has been through--I have \nsaid it before and I will say it again--I don't want to make any one-\nto-one correlation. I still very honestly and truthfully believe that \nevery once in a while there is an act of violence that is such a \nnightmare, so God awful, it is so crazy, it is so sick, it is so \nincomprehensible that all of us should be very careful about doing any \none-to-one correlation. I think there are many things we can do better \nin our country to reduce violence in the lives of children and in our \ncommunities. But I don't want my remarks to be correlated at least 100 \npercent to what happened at Columbine High School. I am not comfortable \ndoing that.\n  Mr. President, where I would disagree with my colleague from Utah--\nthis is why I was on the floor earlier; this is why I have been waiting \npatiently for days to become involved in this debate--is that again we \nneed to understand that the vast majority of kids--I think over 90 \npercent of kids, as I read the statistic earlier--who are in these \njuvenile correctional facilities haven't committed a violent crime.\n  If this is juvenile justice legislation, then we ought to be talking \nabout justice. I will say one more time that a lot of these \n``correctional facilities'' don't correct, and that a lot of these \nkids, by the time they leave these facilities, are not on their way \ntoward productive citizenship. These places basically become kind of a \nstaging ground for them moving on to committing more crime and winding \nup in prison. That is one of the major flaws of this legislation.\n  If you do not look at this disproportionate minority confinement, and \nyou want to sort of take us backward so that States no longer can \nreally do a careful assessment of what is going on when so many of the \nkids who are winding up in prison are kids of color, not only is this \nnot right, not only is this a matter of discrimination, not only should \nwe not be allowing States and encouraging States to take a look at \nthis, quite often when those kids leave, they are far worse off than \nwhen they got there.\n  I have talked about just this one visit to the Tallulah facility. I \nam sorry to pick on the facility, but I will\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\ntell you the truth--most of these kids, about 80 percent of them, are \nAfrican American, as young as age 11, and 95 percent have committed \nnonviolent crimes.\n  I have done a lot of community organizing and a lot of low-income \nneighborhood work in my life. I probably would have been willing--I did \na lot of work with young people before I came to the Senate. I still \ntry to do that work. I would have been pleased to meet with any of them \nat 10 o'clock at night but not all of them, not after they were in \nTallulah, not after they were in the facility.\n  I will not support a piece of legislation that doesn't deal with the \ndisproportionate sentences of kids of color, or any piece \nof legislation that takes us backward, that really calls on us to turn \nour gaze away from this, any piece of legislation that allows, albeit \nincidental, contact between these kids and adults in some of these \nfacilities, with, God knows, what consequences. I cannot support a \npiece of legislation that doesn't do better. I am hoping we can have \nsome agreement on mental health services so that a lot of kids who \nshould not be in these institutions who never committed a violent \ncrime, can get treatment in their own communities as opposed to being \nincarcerated, or making sure if they are incarcerated, for God's sake, \nthat they get treatment. Any piece of legislation that doesn't allow \nStates to use the funding for that, or doesn't have explicit direction \nthat States can use that funding is short on the justice part.\n\n  Let me also say, although this is not today's topic but it is \nrelated, the fact is we can build a million new prisons and we can fill \nall of them. We are never going to stop this cycle of violence in this \ncountry unless many more children in this country have hope. When we \nhave, roughly speaking, close to one out of every four kids under the \nage of six growing up poor in America, and close to 60 percent of kids \nof color growing up poor in America, we have a whole agenda to deal \nwith here. Nobody should dismiss that agenda.\n  The amendment I am going to be sending to the desk speaks directly to \nwhat my colleague from Utah was talking about. This is the 100,000 \nschool counselors amendment.\n  The tragic school shootings in Littleton, CO--again, I don't want to \ndo any one-to-one correlation; I don't want to be glib about this, but \nit certainly shows that we must do better by way of making sure that \nkids who have some fear problems are identified. There has to be a lot \nmore infrastructure in our schools so we can do a better job of maybe \nseeing what could happen and getting to these kids earlier. There are \nno easy answers. There is no simple solution to the problem of school \nviolence, but there are some steps we can take to make our schools \nsafer and healthier.\n\n  I want to talk about expanding and improving the available mental \nhealth services in our Nation's schools as an essential step forward. \nFor this reason, I rise to offer this amendment, the 100,000 school \ncounselors amendment, to S. 254.\n  For months I have been receiving letters and calls--and I imagine \nother Senators have as well--from my constituents in Minnesota who have \nbeen asking for my help to find a way to get students the mental health \nservices they desperately need. They call and ask, Is there a way we \ncan hire more counselors to serve our schools in the State of \nMinnesota? I have a whole stack of letters I could hold up. Let me read \nfrom a few of them.\n  Betty Jo Braun, a school counselor from Cleveland public schools, a \nsmall town in Minnesota:\n\n       In my 15 years as a counselor, I observe younger and \n     younger students who feel that their only recourse is to \n     repay violence with violence. If I could somehow get to all \n     of them with violence prevention at an early age, we might \n     have a better chance with positive outcomes in High School. \n     But not at 767 students to 1 counselor unless overworked \n     teachers do all the work and all I do is consult. The violent \n     incidents that frighten me most are not the ones that I \n     manage to avert (fights, suicide attempts, etc.); the scary \n     ones are the ones I don't know about and that are waiting \n     like the other shoe to drop into our mostly calm rural life, \n     as they did in a neighboring school not too long ago. There a \n     young man came into the school with a pistol and managed to \n     shoot a police officer before being apprehended. Somehow I \n     believe that a good school counselor with his ear to the \n     ground could have avoided this incident by intervening with \n     this young man along the way. Unfortunately, this district \n     has a 1000 to 0 student to counselor ratio; they cut both \n     counseling positions the year before this incident occurred.\n\n  There are schools all across this country that cry out for an \ninfrastructure of counselors to be able to provide more support for \nkids who really need this additional help.\n  Across the country, counseling positions are being cut. It is \nincumbent upon the Federal Government, if we are going to talk about \nhow we respond to some of the violence that has taken place in our \nschools across the country, to share in this responsibility to hire \nmore counseling and mental health professionals.\n  Schools vary greatly in their support for counseling services. Due to \ncurrent incentives under Federal law, schools often place a higher \npriority on the hiring of additional instructional staff than on the \nestablishment of even modest counseling programs. Up until recently--\nmaybe the world has changed since Colorado, but up until very recently \nthe whole idea of school counselors was that counselors were like icing \non the cake; they weren't part of the cake; they were not that \nessential to what goes on in schools. Well, they are.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       We must make it affordable for schools to hire counselors, \n     school social workers and school psychologists.\n\n  My State of Minnesota prides itself on being a great education State, \nbut we fail those students who are in most need of our help because \nMinnesota has one of the worst counselor-to-student ratios in the \ncountry. California is dead last. Minnesota's student-to-counselor \nratio is 1,011 to 1.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the Senator sent his amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am going to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator prepared to enter into a time agreement?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have an idea it will take me a while \nto make the case, because I think it is pretty darn important. So I \ncan't say 10 minutes, 5 minutes. I will not go on all afternoon.\n  The Senator from Utah knows me. In very good faith, I have a \nstatement to make and I will finish the statement. I will probably do \nit sooner if my colleague doesn't keep asking me when I will be done.\n  I think I will be done within the next 20 minutes or so, not much \nlonger.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My question is, Is the Senator aware of just how much \nflexibility the prevention funds, that make up 55 percent of this bill, \nhave to expend for the kind of program that he mentioned? It goes on \nfor many pages.\n  For example: One-on-one mentoring projects designed to link at-risk \nand juvenile offenders who commit serious crimes; provide for treatment \nof juvenile defendants who abuse alcohol or drugs; getting priority to \njuveniles who have been arrested; projects to provide leverage funds \nfor scholarships; provide intake screening that may include drug \ntesting; delinquency prevention activities that involve youth clubs, \nsports recreation, training, and so forth; family strengthening \nactivities, such as mutual support groups for parents and children.\n  It goes from about page 75 through 93, and it concludes item in 16, \n``other activities likely to prevent juvenile delinquency.''\n  About 55 percent of the funds available here can be used for that. I \nthink the Senator is correct that we really need to do a good \nassessment right there at the beginning--whether it be drug problems, \nmental health problems, or anger problems.\n  I think this bill does more perhaps than the Senator realizes. I \nwonder if the Senator is aware of the breadth of some of the things we \ncould spend the money on.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague I respond in \nthree ways:\n  No. 1, while I, honestly and truthfully, this legislation is deeply \nflawed, there are some good things in this legislation and I know my \ncolleague has worked hard on it. I appreciate his comments about ways \nin which we can\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\ndo a better job on the upfront assessment for kids struggling with \nmental illness, some of whom probably really would be better off \ntreated not in these facilities.\n  I appreciate what my colleague has said. Everything my colleague \nlisted is important.\n  However, in my statement I will go into some of the training that is \nnecessary for counselors. I am talking about an infrastructure in \nschools, specifically in the schools, and I am talking about an \ninfrastructure that includes counselors, that includes social workers, \nand includes school psychologists.\n  The reason I am talking about 100,000 counselors and we are talking \nabout a cost that becomes one-third Federal Government, one-third \nState, and one-third school district, I say to my colleague from \nAlabama we have a ratio--and I am talking about my own State--in \nMinnesota we have a student-counselor ratio of 1,000-1.\n  The truth of the matter is, we have to do a better job. I think the \nFederal Government can be a player. I understand this is not a \nsubstitute for what my colleague has talked about, but I want there to \nbe a very specific focus on the need to have counselors and to have \nsocial workers and clinical psychologists in our schools.\n  That is the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think those are matters of great importance. How many \ncounselors? Is that the best way to spend money for our school systems? \nHaving wrestled with this bill for over 2 years, in my view those are \nmatters that need to come out of the education bill because they are \ndealing with education problems that may lead to crime later. We have \ntried to focus, as much as possible, on the crimes and with those \nchildren who are already in trouble, and how to fix and change their \nlifestyle.\n  I am just showing my colleague the theory of our bill. The amendment \nof the Senator may be worthwhile, but it simply goes beyond what we \nhave had hearings on, and really should come out of the Education \nCommittee. That would be my comment, with all due respect, because I \nknow how deeply the Senator believes in these issues.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, I understand what \nmy colleague said. I think throughout this legislation, again, and we \ntalked about truancy, we talked about the need for intervention, we \ntalked about kids who are getting into trouble. Again, we just have to \nget more counselors in our schools and the Federal Government should be \na real player. That is the ``why'' of this amendment.\n  I was mentioning that the Minnesota student/counselor ratio is 1,011 \nto 1. This means on average one counselor serves two times the number \nof House and Senate Members combined. So a great education State--in my \nopinion, the greatest progressive education environment and health care \nand family State in the country--in Minnesota, we have a ratio of 1000 \nto 1. That means on average, one counselor serves two times the number \nof House and Senate Members combined.\n  Minnesota is not the only State, however, that is in desperate need \nof school-based mental health services. Across America, schools are \nexperiencing a shortage of qualified counselors, psychologists and \nschool workers. My amendment would establish a funding program similar \nto the COPS Program that provides seed money to States that provide for \nmore mental health service providers in the schools. And we need to do \nthis.\n  Approximately 141,000 new counselors, social workers and \npsychologists are needed for our schools. My amendment would provide \nStates and localities with the resources to meet these children's \nneeds. It is on a one-third, one-third, one-third basis. America's \nstudents simply do not have adequate access to counseling services and \nother mental health services.\n  A student from Mahtomedi High School, in Mahtomedi MN, wrote about \nher counselor, Anne Melass. This student had a serious problem with \ncutting herself, and was admitted to a hospital for treatment. She \nwrites:\n\n       Since my return, I have been constantly working with the \n     counselors. I am in a foster home. My mother killed my \n     sister. . .\n\n  Can you believe what some kids have to go through?\n\n       . . . and my dad was unfit to take care of me. I was in \n     three different foster homes before I came to Joe and \n     Michelle's.\n\n  She concludes by saying:\n\n       A note to this is that (counselors) have so many people to \n     listen to whom they truly care about, but if someone is in \n     pain or needs help, they shouldn't have to wait in line. \n     There are way too many children who are waiting in line in \n     our schools. If we are serious about juvenile justice and we \n     want to do something about truancy, we want to do something \n     about kids at risk, we want to do something to help kids \n     before they get into trouble, then clearly this is a \n     direction we must go.\n\n  She is not alone. According to the National Institute of Mental \nHealth, although 7.5 million children under the age of 18 require \nmental health services, only one in five receive them--only one in \nfive. Yet another student writes of her frustration, because not enough \ncounselors are in the school:\n\n       I strongly feel that our school should have more \n     counselors, we have a difficult time making appointments when \n     we need to talk to someone.\n\n  Violence does not only happen in the schools and on the streets. \nViolence happens in homes. One young man writes:\n\n       Earlier this year I was going through some hard times with \n     my parents. My father especially.\n\n  He goes on to say that a counselor was able to give him the skills to \nprevent a fight with his father. He writes:\n\n       Through my parents' talking with the counselor, we decided \n     family counseling would be a good thing to try and we are \n     currently involved in that and it is starting to help a \n     little. With such high ratios, though, it can be difficult \n     even to get an appointment.\n\n  A counselor helped this young man and several others. Hundreds, \nthousands of students are not that lucky and they do not get the help \nthey deserve.\n  Anne Melass, a licensed school counselor, is one of those special \nschool counselors who gives students the extra time. She explained what \nbeing a counselor was like. She writes:\n\n       A typical work day for a school counselor is a new \n     appointment every 15 minutes. The caseloads per counselor \n     range from 400 to 1,800 students.\n       I believe ``school counselor'' is interpreted many \n     different ways but most people assume it is a non-threatening \n     person you can go to for help with any concern you have in \n     the school. I strongly believe that increasing school \n     counseling services could very well change the community \n     perception of public schools.\n\n  It could help a lot of kids. It could help a lot of kids before they \nget into trouble. It could prevent some of the violence we want to \nprevent.\n  The serious shortage of counselors, school psychologists and school \nsocial workers in America's schools has undermined our efforts to make \nschools safe, improve academic achievement, and assure bright futures \nfor the youth of America.\n  I will never forget a gathering I was at in Minneapolis about 2 \nmonths ago, of about 50 principals, title I teachers, support staff. \nThey said to me that by first grade--by first grade--if we don't have \nmore counseling services for these kids, even as I have said before, \nwith the best schools, smallest class size, best technology, these kids \nare not going to do well. We need to get the support services for the \nkids.\n  To respond to my colleague from Alabama, let me talk about the school \ncounselors, who they are and what they do. They are highly trained \nprofessionals. They are credentialed by law or by regulation. In all 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia, counselors are required to obtain \ngraduate education in guidance and counseling for entry-level \ncredentialing as a professional school counselor. Mr. President, 39 \nStates and the District of Columbia require the attainment of a \nmaster's degree in counseling and guidance or a related field.\n  We are talking about an infrastructure of professionals to get this \nhelp to kids. School psychologists have obtained a master's degree or \ndoctoral degree in school psychology, or a Ph.D. degree in counseling \npsychology, or a Ph.D. in school psychology or counseling psychology. \nAll school psychologists are certified or licensed by the State in \nwhich they work, usually by\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nthe State department of education. School psychologists and counseling \npsychologists who practice in a private school, community agency, \nhospital, or clinic may be required to be licensed by the State Board \nof Psychology as well.\n  School social workers typically possess a master's degree in social \nwork and are certified by the State's educational agency.\n  School counselors, school psychologists and social workers provide a \nnumber of importance services, designed to support students, parents \nand the teachers. They improve school functioning, school safety, the \nkids lives; they work to prevent school violence and to prevent a whole \nlot of other problems. They offer information and guidance on \npostsecondary education and training options. They provide consultation \nwith teachers and parents about the student learning, behavior and \nemotional problems. They develop and implement prevention programs \nincluding school safety and behavior management. They deal with \nsubstance abuse, they set up peer mediation, they enhance problem \nsolving in schools, and the fact of the matter is, we have done a \nterrible job as a nation of making sure we have the counselors, that we \nhave the social workers, and we have the psychologists in our schools.\n\n  On the average in our country, there is only 1 counselor for every \n513 students in our Nation's elementary and secondary education \nschools. In States like California or Minnesota, 1 counselor serves \nmore than 1,000 students. Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Mississippi, \nMichigan, Tennessee and Colorado are in the top 10 worst States in the \ncountry. In Colorado, the student-to-counselor ratio is 654 to 1. That \nis better than Minnesota. But it is real hard as a counselor to be able \nto help a lot of kids when you have 654 kids you are trying to deal \nwith. In Mississippi, another State victim of a school shooting, the \nratio was 635 to 1. Furthermore, more than 50 percent of full-time \nschool psychologists are working in settings with a ratio of greater \nthan 1 to 500.\n  I think I have made my point, but I want to just read a couple of \nother quotes. Then I will conclude. I would say to my colleagues, I \nactually could go on and on.\n  Margo Rothenbacker from Fridley Middle School, who is a counselor:\n\n       I am writing to plead with you to reduce counselor students \n     ratios for school counselors. My caseload is 475 and unless \n     there is an observable crisis, I do not see many of these \n     students. I only have time to deal with the students that \n     surface due to behavior or intervention by the county or \n     police. What about the students who need help desperately but \n     are not able to come forward or express their need in a way \n     to draw attention? As a former high school teacher I believe \n     that every elementary school should have a counselor.\n\n  And she is right. Margo Rothenbacker is right.\n\n       The counselor stays bonded with students as they transition \n     from year to year from kindergarten through middle school \n     through high school.\n\n  I have a letter about this 100,000 counselors amendment which I think \nis on the mark:\n\n       Senator Wellstone: . . . Please share with your colleagues \n     my dismay at their continued delay in moving toward increased \n     funding for prevention initiatives in our Nation's schools. \n     The basis of professional school counseling has always been \n     on prevention--educating young people about sound \n     decisionmaking skills in order to avoid poor choices later in \n     life. This is particularly true when it comes to conflict \n     mediation and violence prevention.\n       In Minnesota during the past few weeks since the Littleton, \n     CO, tragedy, much publicity has been focused on school \n     districts spending large sums of money to have ``tactical \n     assessments'' done on how to ``retake'' a school after such a \n     Littleton-like scenario. Good God, Senator--what have we come \n     to in our country? Have we so bankrupted our schools that \n     they have given up the fight and mission of trying to prevent \n     problems before they occur? Have our schools just decided \n     that we can no longer prevent the Littletons, the Jonesboros, \n     the Paducahs, the Pearls and are now just making contingency \n     plans to deal with it when it happens rather than try and \n     prevent it?\n       . . . Nationwide our ratios are absurd--in Minnesota we are \n     next to dead last in the Nation as far as student-to-school \n     counselor ratios go: . . . we average over 1,000:1. . . . We \n     need funding to hire more school counselors.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts regarding \n     this issue.\n\n  This is Walter Roberts, associate professor of Counselor Education \nProfessional School Counseling Program at Minnesota State University-\nMankato.\n\n  Terry Johnson of White Bear, MN--where my daughter teaches--knows the \ndemands and difficulty of being a school counselor. He writes:\n\n       I am a counselor at White Bear Lake High School-South \n     Campus. We are a suburban school located north of St. Paul, \n     MN. We currently have 1,400 students in our building, all \n     juniors and seniors. Our lower classmen are located in a \n     separate building. I am one of three counselors in our \n     building. We are unique in that our entire population is \n     dealing with graduation issues being imminent. Our load is \n     approximately 450 to 1; we have very little time to do real \n     counseling, as many of our colleagues nationwide also do not.\n\n  Sally Baas, a school psychologist in Anoka-Hennepin School District, \nwrites:\n\n       I have been responsible for school psychological services \n     for up to 3,500 students.\n\n  And because of this high ratio, she stated that ``many students are \nignored.'' They do not get the attention they deserve and the attention \ntheir families deserves.\n  There is a considerable amount of research which makes the point that \nthis works, which I will not go through right now--more counselors; \nmore school psychologists; more social workers; 100,000 counselors, \njust like the COPS program. It makes a whole lot of sense to do this.\n  We have been acting as if this is icing on the cake, counselors do \nnot matter that much, they are not that important, mental health \nservices is just not that important. It is critically important. There \nare a lot of kids in our schools in our country who are in trouble. \nThere are a lot of kids who need additional help, and if we are serious \nabout juvenile justice and we are serious about getting kids before \nthey get into trouble and we are serious about preventing the violence \nand we are serious about helping kids, then this amendment is right on \npoint.\n  Billie Jo Hennager, a counselor in Barnum High School in Barnum, MN, \nknows firsthand the serious damage we do to America's youth when \nadequate mental health and counseling services are not provided. He \nwrites:\n\n       I have a story, as do many counselors, that may be helpful \n     in helping others understand the importance of having lower \n     student/counselor ratios. One day during the first month, I \n     was contacted because there had been a violent incident the \n     night before that was witnessed by 9 to 10 students. A man \n     was getting violent toward a woman, yelling, pushing, et \n     cetera. The man returned a few minutes later with a gun, shot \n     the other man point blank in the face, shot at the woman (a \n     bullet grazed at her arm) and then swung the gun around at \n     the kids yelling, ``What the [expletive] are you looking \n     at?'' Not only did these kids have a gun pointed at them, but \n     they witnessed a man's face being destroyed by a bullet, \n     pieces of flesh flying through the air, and blood splattered \n     everywhere. I don't think I need to explain how traumatic \n     this situation was for those students. All students were in \n     school the next day, but no counselor was available. I rushed \n     to [their school] (an hour away) as soon as I could. These \n     kids will have that memory forever . . . there is definitely \n     a shortage of school counselors in Minnesota.\n\n  I add, all across the country:\n\n       Obviously, the situation there is less than ideal. \n     Unfortunately, it's not all that unusual.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe I have sent this amendment to the desk. Have \nI?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yet to send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 358\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for 100,000 additional school counselors)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 358.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that this \n100,000 school counselors amendment, very much patterned after the COPS \nprogram, is focused on an area where we\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\ncan make a huge difference. We do not have the counselors. We do not \nhave the social workers. We do not have the school psychologists. We do \nnot have the infrastructure of support for our kids.\n  We can do much better, and it is absolutely essential that the \nFederal Government and we in the Senate step up to the plate and \nauthorize this. Ultimately, I see this as a one-third, one-third, one-\nthird matching program in terms of where the funding comes from. I do \nnot see how we can be talking about juvenile justice and how we can be \ntalking about preventing the violence and how we can be talking about, \nas so many have, what happened in Columbine High School or, for that \nmatter, other high schools in the country.\n  Different people have talked about different things. Some people have \nfocused on more gun control. Some people have talked about tougher \nsentencing. Some people have talked about the problem of the culture of \nviolence in our country. Some people have talked about the problem of \nwhat we see on TV and what we see in the movies. Some people have \ntalked about the lack of spirituality in homes and the lack of \nspirituality in schools. And some people have talked about other issues \nas well.\n  Quite frankly, I agree with most of this discussion. My own work has \nbeen in the mental health area. But I am telling you that we have to \nget serious about having an infrastructure of support in our schools \nthat can make all the difference in the world for kids and can also \nhelp teachers deal with some kids who are not so easy to deal with, who \ncan be very difficult to deal with.\n  We have for too long viewed mental health services--I will say this \none more time--as an extra, as being just a frill, as not being that \nimportant, as being icing on the cake. My prediction is--why don't we \nget ahead of the curve in the Senate--we are going to see a whole lot \nof schools and a whole lot of school districts saying we need more \nhelp. We are going to see young women and young men, and not so young \nwomen and men, going to schools, getting their degrees in counseling \nand going into this work. I say, great, let's encourage that; it can \nonly help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Minnesota has \na commitment to ensuring that individuals who suffer from mental \nillness have the resources and support they need to combat this painful \ncondition.\n  I have heard from groups who assert that the amendment would help \nimprove school safety.\n  The sad truth is there is no evidence whatsoever to support the \nassertion that the recent tragedies in Littleton, CO, and in Oregon, \nwould have been prevented by having more school counselors.\n  Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, according to reports, had both gotten \nindividual counseling had undergone anger-management training and had \ngotten affirmative evaluations from counselors.\n  It has been reported that the 15-year-old Oregon shooter, Kip Kinkle \nwas in counseling, along with his parents, when he killed them and went \non to kill two classmates.\n  It has also been reported that an English teacher of one of the \nColumbine killers had expressed concern about Dylan Klebold's writing \nto his parents and a counselor.\n  I mention this not in an attempt to disparage the fine work done by \nour Nation's counselors, but to make the point that effective policies \nto identify and prevent acts of violence must be school and community \nwide in nature.\n  I read with interest a recent article in the Washington Post on April \n25, written by a Virginia teacher, Mr. Patrick Welsh, which described \nthe program already in place at T.C. Williams High School in \nAlexandria, VA. President Clinton recently visited this school.\n  I would like to read to you from Mr. Welsh's article, which describes \nthe efforts made by teachers and administrators and law enforcement \npersonnel at this school.\n\n       We make no pretense: The possibility of violence is a fact \n     of life here. There is usually a police car--and sometimes \n     two or three--in front of the building. A decade ago, that \n     would have worried parents. Now they appreciate it. The \n     police almost seem like part of the school staff. All of us--\n     administrators, faculty, students and police--are encouraged \n     to see maintaining security as our joint responsibility. . . \n     .\n       If at night there is a brawl in the community that might \n     spill over into school the next day, the police inform \n     administrators and often show up at school early in the \n     morning. Conversely, administrators let police know about \n     trouble at school that could spill over into the community. \n     But it's not just liaison with the police that administrators \n     value; it's liaison with the kids. Our principal, John \n     Porter, and one of his assistants are out in front of the \n     school nearly every morning greeting students and looking for \n     signs for trouble.\n\n  Mr. President, T.C. Williams should be commended for its initiative. \nThis school, and others around the country, has developed a program \nthat works for them.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that it is this type of individual school \nby school approach that my legislation and the Republican package of \neducation amendments attempts to support.\n  Violence prevention starts with trust. It's the availability of \nfaculty. It's principals walking around the school. It's kids who trust \nthe administration to respect their confidentiality. It's kids who feel \na part of their community and will work to keep it safe.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can support our teachers, counselors, and \nadministrators best by providing them with the resources needed to \nadequately fund current education programs and the flexibility to \nimplement an appropriate school violence prevention program that works.\n  I do not believe this would be the result of the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota. Therefore, I must oppose the Wellston \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota \nbelieves strongly in what he is saying. I just want to respond in a \ncouple of ways by saying this is a $1.5 billion bill of new spending, \nand over 55 percent of it is designed for prevention programs that can \nbe used for many of the things about which the Senator is concerned.\n  But it is not an education bill. I think that we do better if we are \ngoing to talk about 100,000 guidance counselors--which is a lot of \nmoney for that--that we need to talk about that in the Education \nCommittee. The Senator from Minnesota is a member of that committee. We \nneed to thrash it out. Maybe music would do better to reduce crime than \nhiring guidance counselors. Who knows? So I am not sure I can agree \nwith his amendment as broad as he has suggested.\n  The President of the United States has stated recently that he was \nnot happy with the way Hollywood has gone about presenting violence, \nand he suggested that they need to do better. The Vice President has \nalso suggested they need to do better. Then the President went out to \nHollywood this past weekend to raise money from these very same people. \nThe papers report that he raised $2 million from the ``glittering \nlights'' of Hollywood just over the weekend. And during that time he \nhad an opportunity, in an intimate surrounding, to talk personally with \nthe ``leading lights'' of that fair city. There have been a number of \nreports about it.\n  I feel strongly about this. I have worked very hard for this piece of \nlegislation, for over 2 years, and I have only been in this Senate for \na little over 2 years. I was a Federal prosecutor and a State \nprosecutor for 17 years, and I think I know something about crime.\n  I feel like I am sometimes in a different world. We are trying to \nbring forth a piece of legislation that can honestly strengthen the \njuvenile justice system in America, giving them opportunities and \noptions to confront young people who are going on the wrong road and to \ndirect them away from a life of crime.\n  Even, Mr. President, your area there in Littleton, even those \nindividuals, from my reading of the paper, had previously been arrested \nfor rather serious offenses. The pattern all over America is that they \nare released immediately. The suggestion the Senator from Minnesota \nmade that our jails are filled with nonviolent 11- and 12-year-olds is \nnot accurate. We have 70,000 beds for young people today in America. \nThat is a little over 1,000 per State. I am telling you, we have some \nserious crime. Adult bed spaces went up dramatically, and adult crime \nhas gone down dramatically. But for young people, the\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\njuvenile bed spaces have not gone up much, whereas juvenile crime, \nserious, violent juvenile crime, murders, assault with intent to \nmurder, armed robbery, those kinds of offenses have dramatically \nincreased in the last 15 years.\n  We have not responded adequately. We need a system in which, at their \nfirst offense, we have an intervention that occurs, serious \nintervention: Drug testing, is this child being driven to crime because \nof drugs; mental health assessment; prison, if need be; detention, if \nneed be. But most times it will not be detention on that first offense. \nMost of the time it will be probation.\n  Do we have just a paper probation where you come in once a month and \nreport to your probation office and say: I haven't been arrested this \nweek and I have been obeying all your laws? Or do you have a good \nintensive probation in which you go out and probation officers knock on \nthe doors at night to see if they are abiding by curfews; they talk to \ntheir parents; to have counseling programs; maybe get them into mental \nhealth? It is already funded in most States--just get them into these \nmental health programs or treatment or counseling; maybe drug treatment \nis available.\n  That is what a good criminal justice system does. If we care about \nthese kids, that is what we need to do. The idea we are going to spend \nbillions on programs that are not dealing with kids, who are really \nproven to be at risk, and not even strengthening our juvenile justice \nsystem so it can deal with the kids who are already getting in trouble \nwith the law, strikes me as absolutely beyond the pale; it is through \nthe looking glass; some sort of virtual reality.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Am I understanding the Senator correctly that he does \nnot think there is any connection between counseling support for kids \nwho are having trouble in school and whether or not they might end up \nin a juvenile corrections facility?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No. I did not say that. That is not what I meant.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. That is good, then.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am saying we are here to try to pass out of the \nJudiciary Committee a juvenile crime bill. And you are suggesting some \nsort of massive, national program to have more guidance counselors. I \nsuggest to you, the greatest way to keep kids from becoming adult \ncareer criminals is to intervene effectively in the juvenile court \nsystem when they are first arrested; maybe that first brush with the \nlaw will be their last. If we care about them, we will intervene. If we \ndon't care about them, we will continue the way we are now.\n  In Chicago, they spend 5 minutes per case, according to a front page \nanalysis by the New York Times. This is a system that is overwhelmed. \nYoung people with serious multiple offenses simply walk through a \nrevolving door. It is not good for them. If you care about them, you \nwill do something about them.\n  Now, briefly, I will--I see the Senator perhaps wants to ask \nsomething else, but I do want to go on to another subject.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased my colleague wants to go on to another \nsubject. Again, my colleague is talking about once arrested there has \nto be ways of intervening.\n  Does my colleague not think it makes sense to intervene even before a \nyoung person is arrested?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am perfectly prepared, in response to the Senator, to \nthink seriously about what we might do at earlier stages. I think \nperhaps in your committee, in the Education Committee, we ought to be \ntalking about that--Head Start programs, can they be improved; or even \nother kinds of programs connected to mental health, or what other \nissues might be good.\n  But our legislation isn't designed to fix the whole world. We cannot \nfix everything in every piece of legislation that comes down. We have \n$1 billion here, and a lot of it can be used for those very things you \nask for. In fact, I would say, 55 percent of it could be used for \nprograms very much consistent with what you favor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Last question for my colleague. This bill came \ndirectly to the floor, right? It didn't go through the Judiciary \nCommittee?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It came out of the Judiciary Committee last year with a \nbipartisan vote and could not be brought up in the close of the \nsession. It was brought up this year without additional hearings; \nalthough the ranking member of the Juvenile Violence Subcommittee, \nwhich I Chair, Senator Biden, had obtained a significant amendment to \nhave even 20 percent more money for the program for prevention that \nSenator Hatch and Senator Biden worked out together, and even moved \nfurther. But we did not have additional hearings this year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  I say, by way of conclusion, to our profound disagreement--though it \nis an honest disagreement--that I just do not think you can \ndecontextualize any of these issues. I do not think you can talk about \njuvenile justice without talking about all of the other issues that are \ncritical to children's lives. I really believe, I say to my colleague, \nthat the focus on building more jails and building more prisons--in \nperpetuity will never really stop the cycle of violence. That is what \nthis amendment that is offered is aimed at in a very effective way.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand the Senator's deep feelings. I just say, \nif you talk to judges, juvenile judges, who care about kids, too, \njuvenile probation officers, who have given their lives to kids, those \npeople tell me--and will tell you, if you ask them--they have \ninsufficient capacity to confront them.\n  I have visited superior juvenile court systems. They have schools, \nboot camps, detention facilities, work programs, and so forth; and this \nbill would support all of those.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to raise again and \ndiscuss the frustrations I have of where we are today, that, to me, are \nincomprehensible. I think I know why. We are talking about politics and \nmoney too often. We have a number of amendments in this bill and \nprovisions that deal with improving the culture that our children grow \nup in. I do not think there is anyone that disagrees that violence on \ntelevision and in movies exacerbates tendencies of violence in young \npeople.\n\n  Now, our President has gone out to Hollywood, after scolding them a \nbit a few days ago, to meet with the leaders out there and raise a \nlittle money--$2 million. This is what the Washington Times reported \nthis morning:\n\n       President Clinton told the makers of violent films and \n     video games over the weekend that they are not ``bad'' people \n     as they showered him with $2 million.\n       He assured them they had no personal responsibility in the \n     Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colo.\n       Instead of blaming Hollywood for making violent films, he \n     said, the real blame lies with the theaters and video stores \n     that show and sell them to minors.\n       The president told the audience of stars and studio moguls \n     that they should not blame the gun manufacturers, either, but \n     blame instead the Republican members of Congress who won't \n     enact stringent gun-control laws.\n\n  Every year we pass more gun laws. I am going to talk about that in a \nminute. This administration has gutted the prosecution of gun laws in \nAmerica, and I will show the numbers to prove it.\n\n       The president gingerly suggested at a Saturday-night fund-\n     raiser in Beverly Hills that that sustained exposure ``to \n     indiscriminate violence through various media outlets'' can \n     push vulnerable children ``into destructive behavior.''\n\n  I think that is universally agreed.\n\n       But, he quickly added, the producers, directors and actors \n     who ponied up $25,000 per couple are not at fault.\n       ``Now, that doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any \n     video game or any television program a bad person or \n     personally responsible with one show for a disastrous \n     outcome,'' Mr. Clinton said. ``There's no call for finger-\n     pointing here.''\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Although Mr. Clinton had resolved earlier to nudge \n     Hollywood away from some of its violent excesses, he appeared \n     reluctant to broach the sensitive subject during remarks to \n     the entertainment executives who included Steven Spielberg, \n     Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, founders of Dreamworks \n     SKG Studio.\n       ``You've helped me through thick and thin for all these \n     long years,'' the president said. ``The people of California \n     were very good to\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n     me and Al Gore and to our families. . . And I am very, very \n     grateful.''\n\n  He said he was ``having a good time in Los Angeles.''\n  Although the president complained that underage children are often \nallowed to rent or view movies that are PG-13 or R, he was careful to \nexempt Hollywood glitterati from this criticism.\n\n       ``There's a lot of evidence that these ratings are \n     regularly ignored--not by you, but by the people who actually \n     sell or rent videotapes or the video games or run the movie \n     theaters,'' Mr. Clinton said.\n\n  The president reserved his strongest criticism for congressional \nRepublicans, who last week voted against legislation that would have \nrequired background checks of those seeking to purchase guns as gun \nshows.\n  That is incorrect. We voted last week to substantially increase and \nstep up the enforcement of laws at gun shows.\n\n       He said he has ``been to a lot of these gun shows. . .''\n\n  Now, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Richard \nGephardt, and Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, were also present, \nand they gave speeches to the guests, according to the article, ``who \nnoshed on baked coconut clusters and chocolate-dipped strawberries, \nprepared by Wolfgang Puck, caterer to the stars.\n\n       The Democratic congressional leaders, staying away from the \n     subject of Hollywood violence, lashed out at Republicans \n     as extremists who unfairly impeached the president and \n     must be deposed from power in Congress next year.\n\n  This is what the minority leader in the House of Representatives \nsaid:\n\n       The group that controls the Senate and the House is \n     extreme, almost radical, in their views on all of the issues \n     that I suspect you care about.\n\n  That is what Mr. Gephardt said. I take offense at that.\n\n       Mr. Daschle emphasized that Democrats comprised the party \n     that best represents the views of Hollywood.\n\n  Probably so. I won't dispute that. That was the Washington Times.\n  This is what the Associated Press reported in a national story. \nSandra Sobieraj of the Associated Press:\n\n       President Clinton slipped his right hand into his pants \n     pockets and his voice eased into a conversational tone: \n     ``Let's talk about the entertainment issue.''\n       The eyes on him, from a small stone patio overlooking the \n     lights of Los Angeles, belonged to Hollywood's hottest--\n     Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Rob Reiner, Goldie Hawn, \n     Kurt Russell, Dennis Quaid, Steven Spielberg, whom Clinton \n     called ``Steve.''\n       All had just paid the Democratic Party between $25,000 and \n     $100,000 for a Wolfgang Puck-catered dinner with the \n     President. ``You've helped me through thick and thin all \n     these long years,'' the President told the intimate assembly.\n\n  What does he mean, ``You've helped me through thick and thin''? Well, \nthe Clinton legal defense fund, when he had himself in a fix and had \nimpeachment charges against him, started raising money to defend him. \nHere are some of the contributions: Kate Capshaw-Spielberg, $10,000; \nDavid Geffen, $10,000; Norman and Lyn Lear, $10,000; Steven Spielberg, \n$10,000; Barbra Streisand, $10,000. Yes, they have been with him \nthrough thick and thin.\n  Continuing with the AP report of this event:\n\n       So it was that Clinton, pushing a national campaign against \n     the kind of youth violence seen in the Colorado school \n     shootings, only gently took entertainment types to task for \n     movies and TV shows that glorify violence. He softly prodded \n     changes in their ads and ratings.\n       ``There's no call for finger-pointing here. We are \n     determined to do this as a family,'' he said.\n\n  Hollywood and Mr. Clinton are in the same family.\n\n       He spoke Saturday at Greystone Mansion, a city-owned \n     landmark.\n\n  Hawn, squeezing past the reporters to sneak a smoke with Kurt \nRussell, ignored questions about the president's challenge to \nHollywood. Lisa Kudrow, of TV's ``Friends,'' played dumb: ``What? I \nhaven't spoken to him,'' she said.\n  I don't suppose he raised the question of the showing of smoking in \nmovies and TV now or questioned whether Goldie Hawn ought to be out \nsmoking.\n  The article goes on to note that:\n\n       Dinner with the President: $25,000 to $100,000 per couple. \n     Shoes optional.\n       Hawn padded around the elegant and Gothic-styled Greystone \n     Mansion in a halter top and bare feet, picking at her rat's \n     nest hairdo.\n\n  That is what the AP said.\n\n       Spielberg and Geffen wore white sneakers. Russell sported \n     cowboy boots. Quaid was in T-shirts, jeans and bomber jacket.\n       Looking ahead, Clinton said he was consulting on his Little \n     Rock, Ark., presidential library with Spielberg. ``We were \n     talking about whether we could have some virtual reality \n     effects in my library in the museum, you know,'' he said. \n     ``Sometimes I feel like I'm living in virtual reality, so I'm \n     highly interested in this.''\n\n  Sometimes I think I am living in some sort of unreal reality.\n  The President of the United States has made some statements about \njuvenile justice, and I want to talk about them in just a minute. They \nstrike me as being very unreal. This is the Washington Post article \nright here, a staff writer covering the same event, John Harris:\n\n       President's Message on Movies Undergoes a Change of \n     Address.\n\n  Here in Washington he was fussing about the movies.\n\n       President Clinton let Hollywood have it Saturday night. \n     Ever . . . so . . . gently.\n       ``There's no call for finger-pointing here,'' Clinton said \n     during a Democratic fund-raiser in Beverly Hills, a \n     glittering evening attended by some of the most potent names \n     in Hollywood.\n       Just hours earlier Clinton had broadcast a radio address in \n     which he bluntly challenged purveyors of violent movies and \n     video games to accept a share of responsibility for tragedies \n     such as the Columbine High School massacre--\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague yield for a moment? Can I ask a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I apologize for breaking up the flow of the Senator's \npresentation. I wonder, the Senator is not offering the amendment, is \nhe? He is speaking in general, is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have been waiting. I will probably leave for a \nwhile. My understanding was that they wanted us to be offering \namendments. My colleague can take as long as he wants. I just want to \nknow if he is going to take a considerable amount of time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't expect to take more than 10, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So, at this event, the Washington Post staff writer had \nnoted:\n\n       Just hours earlier Clinton had broadcast a radio address \n     [nationwide] in which he bluntly challenged purveyors of \n     violent movies and video games to accept a share of \n     responsibility for tragedies such as the Columbine High \n     School massacre, based on evidence that some young people \n     become ``desensitized'' by, and more prone to emulate, what \n     they see on-screen.\n\n  I think there is a universal belief that a violent tendency can be \nexacerbated by seeing graphic violence in a movie, particularly in a \nway that shows anger being carried out and vented, which disturbs me \nmost about some of these scenes.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       As luck would have it, Clinton had a chance to deliver that \n     same message in person thanks to a fund-raiser for Democrats \n     (up to $100,000 per couple) catered by Wolfgang Puck's Spago \n     and hosted by DreamWorks Studio titans David Geffen, Jeffrey \n     Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg.\n\n  There were many stars in the audience, including Dennis Quaid, Meg \nRyan, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, and Rob Reiner.\n\n       But this time, Clinton made his point with all the force of \n     a down pillow. To be sure, some young people will be pushed \n     over the edge by violent imagery, he acknowledged. But that \n     ``doesn't make anybody who makes any movie or any video game \n     or any television program a bad person or personally \n     responsible with one show for a disastrous outcome,'' Clinton \n     said. And he allowed that ``for most kids it won't make any \n     difference'' what sort of bloody gore they are exposed to.\n       He said Hollywood should recognize that ``all these things \n     go together'' and that their movies can lead to bad results, \n     when combined with . . . guns.''\n       Clinton said he didn't want to lecture, and praised the \n     entertainment industry for working with him and Vice \n     President Gore to craft . . . ratings. ``We are determined to \n     do this as a family,'' he said. . . .\n\n       All in all, it was a sermon so polite in its message, and \n     so tentative in delivery, that it will no doubt hearten \n     critics in the Republican fold who will point out how \n     difficult it is to enjoy duck potstickers with ponzu and wild \n     mushroom ravioli in one moment, then rise up the next to tell \n     the friends you're sharing the meal with some of their work \n     is a form of cultural pollution.\n\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n\n  I think we do have a problem. I think the President is too close to \nHollywood. I don't think he is capable of carrying through a policy \nthat can improve what has happened. It is sad. I wish it weren't so. I \nthink it is accurate, though. Which do you think they are going to \nbelieve? The radio address he made for politics? They understand this. \nThat is a radio address for politics. But when he comes out and talks \nwith them one-on-one, eyeball-to-eyeball, they know he is really not \nserious because he told them that. I have a problem with leadership \nwhen it is not consistent and firm and doesn't mean what it says.\n  The article goes on to note:\n\n       In his radio address, for example, Clinton issued ``three \n     specific challenges'' for the entertainment industry to clean \n     up its act. Saturday night, the word ``challenges'' was \n     dropped in favor of ``other things,'' that Clinton presented \n     as humble suggestions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Clinton's politesse was understandable. Hollywood actors \n     and studio executives, overwhelmingly Democratic and \n     financially generous, are famously sensitive about their \n     craft. Several have publicly bridled at widespread commentary \n     in recent weeks that the Columbine killings and other \n     murderous incidents involving young people might have been \n     spurred by entertainment celebrating violence.\n       In any event, Clinton is personal friends with many people \n     in Hollywood. In fact, before leaving for San Diego for yet \n     another fund-raiser, his motorcade made an unannounced stop \n     in Malibu. Clinton hopped out for breakfast with Barbara \n     Streisand.\n\n  Well, I say that because I am here, and I have been working to have a \ngood crime bill that will help reduce juvenile violence in America, \nbased on what my experience tells me and my friendships and \nconversations over a career, a lifetime of prosecuting tells me it is \nimportant. I know many juvenile probation officers personally. I know \nmany juvenile judges personally. I have visited the court systems in \nAlabama and in Ohio with Senator DeWine, and we have talked about it. I \nhave talked with many prosecutors. I have known them for years. I know \nassistant district attorneys who prosecute juvenile cases and probation \nofficers who work with them, and people who manage juvenile detention \nfacilities. Some have probably heard that this bill just puts everyone \nin prison. ``You just want to lock them up,'' they say.\n  I don't want to lock up young people. I don't believe Alabama is far \ndifferent than most. A juvenile judge tells me they have a point system \nfor the State juvenile detention center, and it takes four prior \nburglary convictions before they will take a young person, because that \nis how serious a crime has to be.\n  We had a murder in Montgomery, AL, where a night watchman was killed \nby three young people. I called the police chief, who I have known for \nyears, and asked him what kind of prior records they had. They were 16 \nand 15 years old. One had 5 prior arrests, another had 5 prior arrests, \nand the third one had 15 prior arrests.\n  Talk to your police officers, talk to your juvenile judges. They will \ntell you that the juvenile court system in America is overwhelmed. We \nhave had very little increase in the last 15 or 20 years in juvenile \ndetention space because--I guess it is the liberals who always say: You \njust want to lock up kids, and people recoil from that. But we have, in \nthis last 15, 20 years, more than a doubling, maybe tripling or \nquadrupling, of serious crime, the kind of crime you can do something \nabout. I am talking about armed robberies, assault with intent to \nmurder, murders, and rapes. What are you going to do when a 16-year-old \ncommits an armed robbery?\n  You have to have something to be done. I suggest we ought to do like \nMobile, AL, has, and Judge Grossman has in Ohio, a system where he \nbrings that child in, they will do drug testing to see if they are \nstrung out on drugs, they will bring their family in for counseling, \nand if it is appropriate, he will be detained for either a short period \nor perhaps sent through a boot camp that has an intensive supervision \nwith a school.\n  We have learned that boot camps are not the cure-all we thought they \nwere. So now any good boot camp has a very intensive follow-up. When \nthey go back into the community, they appear to be changed. But if they \ngo back to the same friends and the same neighborhood, they tend to \ndrift back into crime. You don't get the change in them you thought you \nhad when they walked out of that boot camp saying, ``Yes, sir,'' and, \n``No, sir.'' It is a sad thing. We are always trying to improve that.\n  But you have to have the capacity for the courts to discipline. \nPolice officers tell me all the time: ``Jeff, these kids are laughing \nat us. We can't do anything to them, and they know it.'' We tried to \nmake some changes in the Federal regulations that would allow children \nwho are arrested in rural areas for serious offenses to be held in a \nseparate part of a local jail, totally apart from any adult. ``Oh, no, \nthat wouldn't do. Oh, no. Some adult may yell down the hall at them and \nsay bad names to them and damage their psyche.''\n  The reason this is important--I want you to understand--is that \npolice and sheriffs in small towns cannot afford to build a separate \njuvenile jail for a half dozen young people. They don't have them, and \nit is stupid and inefficient to require them to have them. The Federal \nmandate says you cannot spend one night in anything but a juvenile jail \nthat is certified as a juvenile jail.\n  What the police tell me--when I was attorney general, I rode for a \nyear and a half with the police chief of 18 years, as fine and decent a \nperson as I have ever known--commuting back and forth, both of us, to \nMontgomery. We talked on those long drives about what was happening. \nAnd what he tells me is--and what I talked to hundreds of police \nabout--is that policemen out at night can catch a youngster \nburglarizing a house, or catch them in a store, and they take them down \nto the police station. Maybe there is one officer on duty. They put \nthem in the lobby of the police station. They call the judge, and they \ncall his mom. His mom comes and gets him and takes him home. The next \nmorning, he is out on the street and he is telling his running buddies \nabout getting caught and being let loose.\n  That is what is happening. They can say whatever they want to, but I \nam telling you, you ask your police officer if that is not what is \nhappening. We need a better ability to deal with that. We have only a \nvery minor improvement in that regard, because our ``psyche'' may be \ninjured.\n  But it is not good for those children, if you care about them, to \njust arrest them and let them go, with minimal probation or \nsupervision. They commit another crime, and they commit another crime, \nand still nothing is happening to them.\n  I am telling you that 11-, 12-, and 13-year old kids are not in jail \nin juvenile courts in America for any minor offense. That is not the \nreality. So we believe we need to enhance the ability of that juvenile \ncourt to intervene effectively to improve it. We believe we can do more \nin that regard.\n  That is the core of this bill, for those who wanted so many different \nideas of prevention--there is a lot of money in there for a lot of new \nand creative ideas for prevention programs.\n  But one thing President Clinton's Department of Justice did was have \na study of the prevention programs in America. What they found is, we \nare spending the money on programs that do not work well, and in fact, \nwe are spending more money on the programs that work the least. It is a \nvery serious criticism of prevention programs. We have to be sure they \nwork before we send the money. We ought to have some in-depth hearings \non that.\n\n  Finally, the reason I spent some time talking about these Hollywood \narticles is that I think there are real numbers of factors that go into \ncausing crime. The President says it is the Republicans because they \nwon't pass every gun law he can create. And as soon as you pass one, \nthey come up with another one. He is out with his family now in \nHollywood, with members of his philosophical family. He is letting his \nhair down. And what does he say? He says it is Republicans who won't \npass gun laws. There is never an end.\n  That is why these issues are important.\n  I served for 12 years as a Federal prosecutor. I prosecuted a lot of \nviolation of gun laws by criminals, people who were committing crimes \nand shooting people regularly. We were very aggressive on it. The \nFederal law is tough. It has 5 years without parole\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nif you carry a gun during the commission of a felony. It has the Speedy \nTrial Act. You are tried within 70 days. When you are sentenced, there \nis no parole, and the Federal law mandates just how long you have to \nserve. It is a long time. People who are caught with guns don't want to \ngo to Federal court. Some think Federal court is easy. Not so. Federal \ncourt is much tougher than most State courts in America, particularly \non gun cases.\n  When I left office at the end of the Bush administration, there were \n7,048 prosecutions of gun violations in America. Since President \nClinton has been in office, that number has dropped every year until it \nreached 3,807 in 1998, a 40-percent decline in prosecutions.\n  So the test is, if you really care about guns, according to the \nPresident and the Attorney General, Will you pass a new law? I would \nsay to you, the real test is, Will you enforce the laws we have?\n  You remember a number of years ago when we added a Federal law to \nmake it a felony to take a firearm on a school ground, a Federal law \nthat makes it a crime to deliver a firearm to a young person, a Federal \nlaw against carrying assault weapons, those all passed by this \nCongress.\n  Let me show you the results of the prosecutions by this Department of \nJustice and this President who believes so passionately that guns cause \ncrime.\n  Possession of firearms on school grounds:\n  In his press conference just a few weeks ago, he said there were \n6,000 incidents of carrying firearms on school grounds. In 1997, \nnationwide, all 92 U.S. attorneys prosecuted 5 of those cases; in 1998, \n8 of them. That is all that were prosecuted.\n  Why do we pass laws if they are not going to be prosecuted? The \nreason is politics. It is not crime fighting, it is politics.\n  Unlawful transfer of firearms to juveniles: Not a bad law; in 1997, \nJanet Reno's Department of Justice prosecuted five; in 1998 they \nprosecuted six.\n  Possession or transfer of semiautomatic weapons: The assault weapons \nban--such an important law, that if anybody didn't vote for it was a \nvirtual criminal, who just wanted to have people shot by assault \nweapons--we passed the Federal law before I got here. There were only \nfour prosecutions in each of the past 2 years.\n  I deeply believe in this. Are we at a point where the reality in \nAmerica is what you say and not what you do? Is that what the reality \nin America is today? No wonder the President calls the Hollywood stars \nfamily, because they do not live in a life of reality. The only thing \nthat counts is what you say on the screen. It doesn't make any \ndifference what your life is outside of that. It is the vision that \ngoes on.\n  I couldn't help but recall that incident in which we had perhaps the \ngreatest untruth ever told by any President in the history of this \ncountry when the President of the United States had his news \nconference, pointed his finger, and said, ``I did not have sexual \nrelations with that woman.'' We know how that was done now. It was \norchestrated by the Thomases, his closest friends from Hollywood. They \ndirected, scripted and choreographed how he would make that denial.\n\n  I submit that I am not really concerned about how we come up with \nlanguage about sales of guns at gun shows. If anybody in this country \nthinks that is going to have a substantial impact on crime in America, \nI ask them to stand up, right now. It won't have a substantial impact. \nIt may have an impact. It may be a good law. We will work to \naccommodate the President's request.\n  It concerns me that when we have a culture of violence the President \nwon't stand up and be counted against it.\n  Those movies will have more impact on crime than whether or not we \nhave a gun show law.\n  I have never been in a legislative body before. Maybe this is the way \nthings happen all the time. I know this: We have tried to accommodate \nthe Democrats time and time again. We have increased funding beyond my \noriginal vision of a bill that would help our juvenile court systems \nimprove--even to more expansive prevention moneys, 55 percent of the \nmoney going to prevention, even a small part of that could even be used \nfor any kind of boot camp or detention facility or treatment \nalternative school.\n  I am concerned about it. I believe we can improve the efforts against \ncrime in America. I believe we need to enforce the laws that we have. I \nbelieve if we had 7,000 prosecutions in 1998 instead of 3,800, there \nwould be innocent people alive today. These are target criminals. They \nought to be prosecuted. I believe we can do better.\n  I am open to improvement in our legislation. Certainly, Senator Hatch \nhas managed the bill and has done a great job with it. I respect his \nviews. His leadership has been invaluable in moving this legislation \nalong. What concerns me is we may be moving to a point where Members on \nthe other side just don't want legislation. No matter how much we \ncompromise, no matter how much we work together to make the bill to \ntheir liking, they still won't give us a time agreement.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. The majority leader has a lot \nof things he needs to do in this Senate. If we are going to have a \nfilibuster, how can we stay on this bill? If the Democrats are going to \nfilibuster and kill this bill--if they stick together, they have that \npower--it would be a great tragedy.\n  There is much in this legislation that could improve our ability to \nreduce juvenile crime, to intervene in young people's lives and save \nyoung people from being victims of crimes. I hope we don't go that \nroute. I hope we don't, after all this effort, have this legislation \nkilled for political reasons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent passage of the \njuvenile justice bill, S. 254, occur no later than 6 o'clock p.m. on \nTuesday, May, 18, 1999.\n  Let me emphasize that this is the third request I have made to try to \nfind a way to have fair debate on amendments and votes and a conclusion \nat some point. Last week, I had suggested we take Friday and Monday to \nhave a number of amendments offered and debated, as we are doing. We \nasked that the votes on amendments occur on Tuesday morning and that \nfinal passage occur by noon. That was objected to. So I said we could \nhave votes on Tuesday morning on the amendments, continue on amendments \nwith votes throughout the afternoon, and complete it by 5 on Tuesday. \nThat was objected to.\n  This now moves it another hour. Before there is a reservation or \nobjection, let me emphasize why I am doing this. We had thought we \ncould take up this juvenile justice bill that has been in the process \nfor 2 years, have debate, amendments and votes, and complete it by last \nThursday night, since we started on Monday. We had Tuesday, Wednesday, \nand Thursday. That turned out not to be practical because there were \nother amendments still pending, even though we had taken up 15 \namendments, and I think now we have taken up probably 20 or more. We \nthought about trying to continue on Friday and Monday and then complete \nit on Tuesday.\n  This week, we don't have a Friday session because there is a \nDemocratic retreat, so we won't be able to have legislative business or \nvotes on Friday. Let me emphasize that is not intended to be critical \nbecause we had a similar Friday last month for Republicans. We each \ntake one Friday during the year to do that and it makes sense to do \nthat.\n  During this week, we have a vote or votes on the Y2K liability issue, \nwhich is very important to small businesses, to industry people trying \nto comply with the Y2K bill. The computer industry in general has a \ntremendous liability problem that should be treated as finding a way to \nsolve the problem rather than just trying to find a way to have a whole \nlot of lawsuits.\n  We also have a supplemental appropriations bill. Unlike some \nsupplemental appropriations bills that go through here lickety-split in \nan hour or two, this one very well may take some time. It is large and \nhas a lot of moving parts. It needs to be explained completely. In \norder to complete Y2K, the juvenile justice bill and supplemental \nappropriations, we have Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday--3 days. We \nwill have to find some way to get some time agreements and move these \nbills through to completion.\n  That is my request.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I want to point out I\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\ndon't know whether this has been cleared with the minority leader. \nSpeaking as a Democrat, I want to say to the majority leader that I \nthink altogether we have been on this bill 3\\1/2\\ days. We have a \nfinite list of amendments that we have locked in. We have not been \ndilatory. I, myself, was out on this floor, as my good friend from Utah \ncan testify, all last week waiting, all today. I enjoy my colleague \nfrom Alabama, but the last hour or so were questions to me and what he \nhad to say, which was important. I have been waiting for other \namendments.\n  So in all due respect, I don't think what the majority leader has \nsaid is quite accurate. We have substantive amendments, a finite list, \nlocked in, which speak to this bill, which could improve this bill and \ndeliver.\n  To protect the Democrats, I object.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is the fifth day on this bill. I mentioned in my \nremarks today other incidents occurring around this country with \njuveniles who don't have to expect any real retribution as a result of \na lack of law.\n  We can make a difference in this country right now or we can keep \nfooling around and not get anything done. I can't blame the \ndistinguished Senator for representing his side and protecting the \nminority leader, except I can't imagine the minority leader not wanting \nto finish this by 6 o'clock tomorrow.\n  As far as I am concerned, we should finish it 2 minutes from now, get \nthis bill on the record, get the House to pass it, the President to \nsign it, and hopefully get a set of mechanisms the bill will provide \ninto operation so we can help our families and our children throughout \nthis society to be protected from these violent juveniles.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I regret the objection by our Democratic \ncolleagues. This juvenile justice bill is critically important. Just \nlast night here in the Washington suburbs, two 15-year-old young men \nwere charged with murder and charged as adults. This is not new. This \nis a pattern that has evolved not only here in this metropolitan area \nbut across the country. I think this juvenile justice legislation is \nvery important and is long overdue. As a result of the objection from \nthe minority, I have to say it looks as if at this point it will be \ndifficult to get this bill done this week without this sort of concept \nof final passage.\n  I am trying to get some way to identify how to get this bill done. I \nwant this juvenile justice bill done. It has been in the mill for 2 \nyears. I think we need it. We had good debates, we had some amendments, \nand I presume we will have more amendments. If we can't get some sort \nof time agreement, we will never reach a conclusion. There is a finite \nnumber of amendments, but I think it must be 40 or 50 amendments that \nare still pending. None of the three consents I propounded has been \ncleared by the minority, and I do find this very disturbing.\n  Having said that, I realize that the Democratic leader is not here. \nHe will be coming in later on this afternoon and we will, I am sure, \nconfer together. I assume my colleagues want this bill completed. Let \nme state where I am.\n  Give me some practical suggestion. What are we talking about here? \nHours? Days? Weeks? Months? I think the Democrats think they found a \ngood issue, but I don't think it's a good issue if we don't deal with \nthe problem of juvenile crime in this country, if we don't deal with \nthe problem of violence in our society and the cultural decline in our \ncountry, and with the gun amendments that have already been debated. So \nI think we ought to find a way to get it done. Let's find a way to do \nit, because we have other legislation we have to deal with: a great big \nliability problem with Y2K, a tremendous problem with the need for \ndisaster supplemental appropriations, and funds for our military men \nand women who have been doing bombing raids right now.\n  I think we ought to try to get that done. All I am trying to do is \nfind a way to do those three bills this week. And with your help, we \nwill keep looking for it and hopefully we will find a way to get it \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask the majority leader, what you are asking for is \nsimply that we take the amendments we have and you need so you can \nmanage this body, and a time when we are going to complete? Because \nunder the rules of this body, one person can talk and talk for days on \none amendment, isn't that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That's correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is a realistic request. I have to say, I \nhave seen this debate for a long time. I believe there is a group on \nthe other side that wants no bill. I believe they don't want this bill \nto pass. I believe if we get this bill up it will pass. And I am very \nupset about it. I know Senator Hatch has done such tremendous work for \nit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, sir, I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been here all weekend hoping we can find some help \non the other side to resolve this matter. Now, there may be valid \nreasons why people on the other side did not meet with us, but we have \nbeen open to meeting and resolving this. I think I have exhibited a \ndesire to resolve this bill time after time after time. We have tried, \nin an evolutionary sort of way, to resolve some of the gun problems. We \nknow that is the way it is going to have to go. We are trying to do it. \nBut we have not been able to get any cooperation.\n  Now that we are here on Monday, it seems to me we ought to start \ncooperating and helping our majority leader get this done.\n  I understand the Senator has an amendment for this side that he can \ncall up. Is it the Ashcroft amendment? And then we can go back to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Let me, without yielding my right to the floor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor. Has \nthe Senator yielded the floor?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my colleague yield one more time to me?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the Senator from Minnesota how he would like \nto proceed? He has one more amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like an opportunity to respond to both of my \ncolleagues for a moment, and then I would ask my colleague from \nAlabama, when he was speaking--at some period of time, I thought I was \ngoing to do another amendment. But I will leave for a while and come \nback later.\n  Mr. HATCH. What I am trying to do is get an amendment done in just a \nfew minutes, turn to you, and then I hope you will be reasonably short. \nI know the majority leader has indicated to me he is getting pretty \ntired of this and he wants to get back to Y2K.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask my colleague for 2 minutes to respond to \nwhat has been said here?\n  Mr. HATCH. Surely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alabama yield the floor?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will not yield at this point on that subject.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's proceed this way. Let's have the Senator from \nAlabama present the amendment on behalf of Senator Ashcroft. He will \ntake about 2 to 3 minutes to do that. And then let's resolve the \nproblem of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from Minnesota and I will probably \nnot agree on this, and I would want to respond to what he said.\n  Mr. HATCH. Fine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 348\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce violent juvenile crime by encouraging States to \n              prosecute violent armed juveniles as adults)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk. This \namendment is to reduce juvenile violent crime by encouraging States to \nprosecute violent armed juveniles as adults if they are over 14 years \nof age. It has been submitted by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. \nSenator Ashcroft serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a former \nattorney general of Missouri and a former Governor of Missouri. \nRecently, our Juvenile Crime Subcommittee went to Missouri and held \nfield hearings where we dealt with the problems of using young people \nto commit serious crimes because they could not be punished for them \neffectively.\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n  This amendment would be Senator Ashcroft's effort to say to those who \ncommit murder and robbery and forcible rape while using a dangerous \nweapon, that they would be treated as adults if they carried a firearm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding with the \namendment, notwithstanding the fact the bill is not yet pending?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object. I am going to object \njust for a second because I actually was involved in another \ndiscussion. What was the request, again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is seeking to propose an \namendment. The pending business is the motion to proceed to Y2K \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Alabama \nstill has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Did the Chair say we were on the Y2K?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the pendency \nof the motion to proceed, to offer this amendment on Senator Ashcroft's \nbehalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is. I object. I would like to see the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Alabama \nstill has the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the pendency of the motion to proceed, to offer this \namendment on Senator Ashcroft's behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I renew my offer of the Ashcroft amendment, I believe \nNo. 348.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for Mr. Ashcroft, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 348.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 228, line 11, strike ``and''.\n       On page 228, line 14, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 228, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(4) Prosecution of Juveniles as Adults for Certain \n     Offenses Involving Firearms.--The State shall prosecute \n     juveniles who are not less than 14 years of age as adults in \n     criminal court, rather than in juvenile delinquency \n     proceedings, if the juvenile used, carried or possessed a \n     firearm during the commission of conduct constituting--\n       ``(A) murder;\n       ``(B) robbery while armed with a dangerous or deadly \n     weapon;\n       ``(C) battery or assault while armed with a dangerous or \n     deadly weapon;\n       ``(D) forcible rape; or\n       ``(E) any serious drug offense that, if committed by an \n     adult subject to Federal jurisdiction, would be punishable \n     under section 401(b)(1)(A) of the Controlled Substances \n     Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960(b)(1)(A)).''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I thank you. I thank the Senator from \nUtah for his kindness in allowing me this opportunity to address what I \nconsider to be a very serious national problem. It is a problem of the \nincreasingly violent nature of juvenile crime.\n  First, I would like to address my amendment that gives States \nincentives to try armed and violent juveniles as adults. That is \namendment No. 348.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for his outstanding leadership on this \nproblem. He has traveled far and wide across the country. His \nexperience as an attorney general, his experience as a U.S. attorney, \nis most valuable in helping us approach this problem with the kind of \nsensibility that I think will give us an opportunity to make a real \ndifference.\n  It seems that nearly every day we hear encouraging news about the \nprogress we are making in the fight against crime. There is no doubt \nthat this is good news.\n  But reports about reductions in the crime rate obscure two \nunfortunate realities: First, although the rate of crime has dropped \nover the past few years, the level of crime remains far too high.\n  The rate may have gone down but crime is still too high.\n  Second, whatever progress has been made in the reduction of overall \ncrime rates, we are still confronted with a serious problem with \nviolent juvenile crime.\n  Statistics about crime rates are useful, but what really matters is \nthe level of violent crime.\n  Let me just give you an example.\n  On last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 200 \npoints. If we were to focus on that fact alone, it would appear that \nthe stock market was down, when in fact the Dow is near its all time \nrecord high. The same is true of crime, especially juvenile crime.\n  We had a little dip in crime recently. But juvenile crime and violent \njuvenile crime are still very high.\n  Although the most recent data show some drops in the crime rate, the \noverall level of crime, especially juvenile crime is unacceptably high.\n  There are about as many violent crimes committed today as in 1987. \nThe number of violent juvenile crimes is at roughly the 1992 level and \nat 150 percent of the 1987 level. I do not think anyone thought they \nwere safe or secure enough in 1987 or in 1992, that we could afford to \nget to be 150 percent of that level, which was the 1992 level, and that \nis the level to which we have returned. But it is still far above a \nlevel acceptable in our culture.\n  Statistics about crime rates also mask the increasingly violent \nnature of juvenile crimes. Seventeen percent of all forcible rapes, 50 \npercent of all arsons and 37 percent of all burglaries are committed by \njuveniles.\n  Finally, the recent dip in crime rates is cold comfort for victims of \nviolent crimes. My constituents in Missouri continually identify \nviolent juvenile crime as a paramount concern, and you only have to \nread the newspaper to understand why. When parents read in the \nnewspaper about a 16-year-old who raped four young girls in St. Charles \nCounty, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile \ncrime. When parents in Hazelwood read about a 13-year-old convicted of \nmurder for fracturing his victim's skull with the butt of a sawed-off \nshotgun, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile \ncrime. And when people in Poplar Bluff read about a 16-year-old, \nencouraged by his 20-year-old accomplice, who held a pizza delivery man \nat the point of a shotgun to steal $32, they understand the importance \nof targeting violent juvenile crime.\n  Madam President, that is precisely what we need to do. We need to \ntarget violent juvenile crime. We need to update our current juvenile \njustice laws to reflect the new vicious nature of today's teen \ncriminals. We must treat the most violent juvenile offenders as adults \nand punish them as adults.\n  For too long now we have treated juvenile crime as something less \nthan real crime. Even the language we use--referring to adult crimes, \nbut to acts of juvenile delinquency--suggests that juvenile crime is \nnot real crime.\n  To those young girls who were raped, to those individuals who are \nmurdered, to their families, these crimes are real crimes. We are not \ntalking about spitballs in the hall or the old Charlie Brown song of \nthe 1950s. We are talking about murder, assault, and rape. And I assure \nyou that for the victims of these crimes, the crimes are all too real--\nno less so because the perpetrator was under eighteen. The time has \ncome to take junveile crime seriously and protect our children from \nviolence.\n  Juveniles are increasingly committing adult crimes. What is more, all \ntoo often, juveniles are using adult means to facilitate these crimes. \nArmed crime among juveniles is at unacceptably high levels.\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\n  These adult crimes committed with adult means cannot be dismissed as \nyouthful indiscretions. They cannot be dismissed as delinquencies or \nstatus offenses. These are crimes. These are horrendous crimes. People \nlose their lives. People are victims of serious assaults, and the \ncrimes should be treated and prosecuted as adult crimes.\n  Accordingly, this amendment provides States with incentives to try \njuveniles as adults when they commit armed violent crimes.\n  Specifically, this amendment encourages States to try juveniles as \nadults when youth over fourteen use firearms to commit murder, forcible \nrape, armed robbery, armed assault, and major drug crimes.\n  We need to send a message that crimes committed with firearms will be \nprosecuted and taken seriously. This administration has dropped the \nball in prosecuting the Federal gun laws. We tried to address this by \nfunding firearm prosecutions in the Hatch/Craig amendment--this is the \nso-called project CUFF. Having sent a message to the administration to \nprosecute Federal gun crimes, now is the time to send a message to the \nStates--violent gun crimes are serious ``adult'' crimes and deserve \n``adult'' time.\n  In the ``juvenile Brady'' provisions in the core bill, we are \ntreating juveniles as adults for purposes of preventing gun ownership \nin the future, just like if you commit a felony as an adult, you \ndisqualify yourself from owning guns in the future. There is no basis \nfor treating juveniles as anything but adults when they use firearms to \ncommit violent crimes.\n  The unpleasant fact is that all too many juveniles commit serious \narmed crime. The answer is to prosecute these crimes vigorously--to the \nfull extent of the law. This amendment provides States with substantial \nincentives to give adult time to juveniles who commit adult crimes.\n  This is not a direct mandate on States. The amendment simply says \nthat the new pot of Federal money authorized by this bill--the juvenile \naccountability block grants--will only be available to States that try \njuveniles as adults.\n  In short, this is an incentive tied to new money that is designed to \ncurtail the violent juvenile crime in this country, not a mandate to \nthe States.\n  It is ironic that some of the same individuals who clamor now for \nFederal gun control object to this proposal on the grounds of \nfederalism.\n  They say the Federal Government has no business being involved here \nand encouraging States to take a serious approach. The Federal \nGovernment has long asserted a role in policing crimes committed with \nfirearms.\n  The entirety of chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code is a \ntestament to the Federal interest in policing crimes committed with \nfirearms. Rather than following the lead of chapter 44 in directly \ncriminalizing firearm offenses for juveniles, this amendment takes the \nless drastic step by encouraging States to treat violent juvenile \noffenses committed with a firearm as seriously as the same offense \nwould be if committed by an adult.\n  States remain free to define the elements of and set the penalties \nfor the underlying crimes. We simply ask, as a condition for being the \nrecipient of Federal funds targeted on reducing serious violent \njuvenile crime, that States treat violent juvenile firearm offenses as \nseriously as adult firearms offenses.\n  Those who complain about this mandate should take a look at the 1974 \nJuvenile Justice Act, passed by a Democratic Congress, full of mandates \nfrom the beginning. As amended, the act now includes more than two \ndozen mandates. Some of these mandates are just administrative, but \nothers are putting real burdens on the States, preventing the \nincarceration of status offenders, and mandating complete sight and \nsound separation of juvenile offenders from adults. These are costly \nmandates, especially in rural areas.\n  With so many mandates that are designed to protect the juvenile \noffenders, it wouldn't hurt to have some incentives that protect the \nrest of us. Violent juveniles who commit armed violent offenses with a \nfirearm are a serious threat to all of us. We need to treat those adult \ncrimes as just that--adult criminal acts and require juveniles who \ncommit them with firearms to answer accordingly. We need to send a \nmessage that violent firearm offenses will be prosecuted. Age should \nnot be a defense to serious gun crimes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am happy to recommend that the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota call up another of his amendments, \nand I will then call up one for Senator Santorum. We will proceed in \nthat way. It is my understanding the distinguished Senator will take \nupwards of a half hour for his amendment, and then I will offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, before going forward with this \namendment, there are two statements which I think need to be made for \nthe record.\n  One is, I say to both my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nbecause I did not get a chance to respond earlier, there is no evidence \nwhatsoever, as suggested by my colleague from Alabama, that there are \nSenators on this side who are trying to kill the bill. Nobody has \nfilibustered. Believe me, I know how to filibuster and so do other \npeople. Nobody has filibustered. We have agreed to a finite group of \namendments.\n  As to what the majority leader said as to the practical suggestion, \nwe should handle this bill like we do any bill, which is we plow \nthrough amendments. That is the practical suggestion. I have not been \nhere as long as my colleague from Utah, but I am sure he can recall \nmany more examples than I can of a bill of this importance that has \nbeen on the floor and has taken a week, sometimes taken 2 weeks. \nSenators have amendments. We debate amendments. We vote them up or \ndown. That is the Senate. That is how we conduct our work.\n  In all due respect, it is not credible if the majority leader wants \nto pull the bill and he wants to find a pretext for pulling the bill. \nHe can come out here and make this claim, but it is not credible.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield for a question in a moment.\n  Again, let me be clear. Many of us have been waiting to offer \namendments. We have a finite list of amendments. We are going through \nthe amendments. That is how we do business in the Senate. That is how \nwe complete this bill. You do not have somebody--now I am not speaking \nfor the party, I am speaking for myself--you do not have somebody come \nout here and basically say: You agree to do the amendments you have in \na short of period of time; we will give you one more day, that's it, \nbecause this is a great bill, this is really important, and we have to \npass it tomorrow.\n\n  It may be a great bill, but some of us have disagreements with \nportions of this bill. My colleague from Mississippi talked about what \nhappened last night in D.C. Two kids are going to be tried as adults. \nThat is done locally. They did not wait for this bill to be passed. I \ncan give examples of kids struggling with mental illness who have died \nin some of these juvenile correction centers, and I want to see \nsomething done to protect them. I feel as strongly about that as the \nmajority leader feels about other provisions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware this bill will help with some of the \nthings about which he is concerned? In fact, all of them.\n  With the Senator's indulgence, this is the fifth day we have been on \na bill that should have been passed on the third day or second day. \nThere is not a thing in this bill, to my knowledge, that most people on \nthis floor would not want to protect our children and our society and \nour families.\n  We have all kinds of past illustrations where monumental bills have \nbeen done in fewer than 5 days. Tomorrow will be the sixth day we have \nbeen on this bill. This is not that controversial a bill. There are \nsome controversial parts to it, and we have been working in an \nevolutionary way to deal with those. I think the distinguished Senator \nknows I have worked hard to accommodate my colleagues on the other side \nas well as my colleagues on this side, and there are wide disparities \nwith regard to the gun problem.\n  I do not blame the majority leader. He has a job to do. We have the \nY2K\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\nbill that is critical for the software industry in this country. It is \ncritical to the court system of this country. It is critical to civil \njustice in this country. It is critical to our dominance in \nintellectual property. And I can go on and on.\n  We have the bankruptcy bill that probably is not going to come up now \nbecause we do not have time to bring it up, and that is absolutely \ncritical to this country.\n  We have the supplemental appropriations bill. The majority leader is \nright, it is not an itty-bitty, normal supplemental appropriations bill \nwith which everybody is happy. It is one that has a lot of components \nto it.\n  We have the Department of Defense authorization. We have our young \nmen and women waiting for us to back them up. I think the majority of \npeople here want to do that.\n  I find no fault with the distinguished Senator anguishing over things \nthat he believes are very important. I do, too. But this bill will move \ntoward solving those problems as well. They may not be solved in \nexactly the identical way the distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nwants them solved, but this bill makes a lot of inroads in helping in \nthese areas about which he is concerned.\n  For the first time, in my recollection, we have both sides together \nat least giving more money for prevention purposes, for which the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota fights so hard, than we do on the \naccountability or law enforcement side. I have worked hard to get that \ndone because I believe in both sides.\n  The distinguished Senator has indulged me to make these comments.\n  I do not blame the majority leader, and I know a lot of very \nimportant bills passed in 2 days, let alone 5 or 6. Frankly, this is \nnot one that should be delayed even 1 minute longer. There are sincere \namendments. That is why we are here.\n  I appreciate the willingness of my friend from Minnesota to present \nat least three of those amendments today. I do not think there is any \ndesire for this side to take unfair advantage. There is a desire to \nmove forward the work of the Senate, and there is a point beyond which \nthe majority leader cannot go. We absolutely know there are some people \nin the Senate who really do not want this bill, who really want \npolitical advantage more than they want a bill.\n\n  Frankly, I am not one of them. I am one who wants this bill. I think \nit is time to get it; that is why we are here. I appreciate my \ncolleague extending me this courtesy to make these comments. It is \nimportant to move ahead. It is important we get this done by tomorrow \nnight, and I hope we can.\n  There will come a time when this bill manager is going to become \nexasperated enough that I will move to table every amendment that comes \nup, and I hope my colleagues will support me in that. There comes a \ntime when deleteriousness and slowing down and repeating what we are \ntrying to do in this bill--only getting our particular views other than \nwhat the bill says when it already does those things, we will have had \nenough of that. I warn everybody that I am reaching that point. I am \nnot there yet, but I am going to get there.\n  If we cannot get this done by tomorrow night and we take the chance \nof losing this bill because of 40 amendments when we have done \neverything in our power to whittle ours down by the end of this day--we \nwill have 3 or 4 amendments left, maybe fewer than that--then I think \nthis sends a message.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Utah, I apologize for \nsmiling. I was only smiling because initially I yielded for a question. \nI know him well enough to know, if he feels strongly about something, \nhe is going to go on for a while. I appreciate what he said. Madam \nPresident, I do not ever have a problem yielding to Senator Hatch for a \nquestion or comment because he is always gracious as a Senator.\n  We will get to the substantive debate, but I have to say for the \nrecord that if the majority leader wants to pull this bill because he \ndoes not agree with some of the amendments that have been adopted or he \ndoes not want to debate some of the other amendments that deal with gun \ncontrol or other controversial amendments, he can pull the bill. So be \nit.\n  You cannot have it both ways. As the old Yiddish proverb says: You \ncan't dance at two weddings at the same time. You cannot say this is an \nincredibly important piece of legislation to deal with violence; it is \nso important in taking steps on prevention and stricter law enforcement \nwith children, and then all of a sudden say: We are done as of tomorrow \nevening; if not, I will pull the bill.\n  It does not work that way.\n  If we come to a supplemental bill, we can act on it and then go back \nto this legislation.\n  Let's be clear about what is going on here. I think it would be a \nterrible mistake for the majority leader to pull this legislation. If \nthat is what he wants to do, then he can do it, but it has nothing to \ndo with Senators not willing to be out here debating amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the effects of domestic violence on the lives of \n                   children, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I now offer my third amendment. This \nis an amendment that is called the children who witness domestic \nviolence protection amendment.\n  We have heard a lot about the violence children see on television or \nthe violence that children see in movies. We have heard a lot about the \nviolence that bombards our children from video games. Do you want to \nknow something? The worst part of all is the violence in the lives of \nchildren that is not in the spotlight. Increasingly, children are \nwitnessing real-life violence in their homes.\n\n  In fact, it is in their own homes that many children witness violence \nfor the first time. Over 3 million children in the United States of \nAmerica are witnessing violence in their homes each year and it is \nhaving a profound impact on their development. Whether or not these \nchildren are physically injured by the violence, they carry with them \nlasting emotional scars from having been exposed to the threat of and \ntrauma of injury, assault, or killing.\n  This exposure to family violence changes the way children view the \nworld and may change the value they place on life itself. It affects \ntheir ability to learn, to establish relationships, and to cope with \nstress. Witnessing domestic violence has such a profound impact on \nchildren, placing them at high risk for anxiety, depression and even \nsuicide.\n  Furthermore, these child victims may exhibit more aggressive \nantisocial and fearful behaviors. They are also at much greater risk of \nbecoming future offenders, which is one of the reasons I offer this \namendment to this legislation. Exposure to family violence, many \nstudies suggest, is the strongest predictor of violent delinquent \nbehavior among adolescents.\n  It is estimated that between 20 and 40 percent of chronically violent \nadolescents have witnessed extreme parental conflict. When I talk to \njudges back home, they tell me it is all predictable who the 13- and \n14-year-olds are who are going to appear in their court. They go back \nthrough their records and they see the violence in the families, many \nof these kids having experienced this violence directly or having seen \nit.\n  In a Justice Department-funded study of children in Rochester, NY, \nchildren who had been victims of violence within their families were 24 \npercent more likely to report violent behavior as adolescents than \nthose who had been maltreated in childhood. Can you believe that? This \nstatistic says that kids are even more prone to become violent as \nadolescents who have just witnessed violence in their families as \nopposed to those kids who have actually been maltreated themselves, \nabused in their childhood. Adolescents who were not themselves \nvictimized, but who had grown up in families where domestic violence \nhad occurred were 21 percent more likely to report violent delinquency \nthan those not so exposed. Overall, children exposed to multiple forms \nof family violence reported twice the rate of youth violence as those \nfrom nonviolent families.\n  So, again, if we are talking about how to prevent the delinquency, \nhow to deal with kids before they get into\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\ntrouble, we have to get more support to kids who witness this violence \nin their homes.\n  A 1994 survey of 115 mothers in the waiting room of Boston City \nHospital's Primary Care Clinic found that by age 6, 1 in 10 children \nhad witnessed a knifing or shooting. An additional 18 percent of the \nchildren under age 6 had witnessed pushing, hitting or shoving. Half of \nthe reported violence--half of the reported violence--occurred in the \nchild's home.\n  Let me tell you about Tony and Sara from Minnesota. Tony is 10 years \nold, and his sister Sara is 8. Tony and Sara were severely traumatized \nafter seeing their father brutally attack their mother. They were \nforced to watch their father drag their mother out to the driveway, \ndouse her with gasoline, and hold the flaming match inches from her. \nTony and Sara are not the only children in our country who were \nterrified by violence like this, sometimes on a daily basis.\n\n  Children who witness domestic violence are often traumatized and they \nneed support. Who is a child going to turn to when their mother is the \nvictim of their father? Who is a child going to talk to when their \nsibling has emotionally shut down and no longer speaks? Who is a child \ngoing to go to for help when they need assistance? Children like Tony \nand Sara have the right to know that what is happening in their home is \nwrong. Children like Tony and Sara have the right to feel that we care \nabout their safety.\n  My legislation, which I am offering as an amendment today, is a \ncomprehensive first step toward confronting the impact that witnessing \ndomestic violence has on children in America. This bill addresses this \nissue from multiple perspectives--including mental health, education, \nchild protective services, supervised visitation centers, law \nenforcement, and crisis nurseries.\n  Mental health. I have visited, with my wife Sheila, programs in \nBoston and San Francisco that are forging creative partnerships in \ntheir communities to meet the needs of traumatized children. That is \nwhat this amendment is about. More must be done. To address the \ndevastating impact that witnessing domestic violence has on the mental \nhealth of children, my amendment provides nonprofit agencies with the \nfunds needed to design and implement multisystem interventions for \nchild witnesses.\n  This partnership would involve the courts, the schools, health care \nproviders, child protective services, battered women programs, and \nothers. What we would be talking about would be guidelines to evaluate \nthe needs of children who witness this violence, safety and security \nprocedures for child witnesses and their families, counseling and \nadvocacy, and outreach and training to community professionals.\n  I met Pamela in Brainerd, MN. Pamela was a battered woman. Her \nhusband threatened to kill her, so she finally left him after 9 years \nof abuse. But Pamela says that the damage has already been done to her \nchildren. She has two children. They are 18 and 15 years old. She says \nthat both her children have turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with \nthe abuse they witnessed. Pamela's 15-year-old son is currently in a \ntreatment facility.\n  Pamela and her children would have had a better chance if mental \nhealth services had been available to them sooner. We cannot send more \nof our Nation's children into drug treatment facilities and juvenile \nprisons when we have the opportunity to intervene early and to heal \nthem. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Education. My amendment also encourages collaboration between \ndomestic violence community agencies and schools to provide educational \nprograms and support services for these kids. What happens is that the \nschool officials quite often do not recognize what is going on. This \nchild has seen this violence in his or her home over and over and over \nagain. They come to school; they may not stay awake because they did \nnot sleep that night because they were so terrified; they may act out; \nthey maybe cannot concentrate, and yet quite often what happens is that \nthese kids, because they have witnessed this domestic violence, are not \nable to learn, but our education community does not know what is going \non with them. So we provide the funding and the support for \ncollaboration. This is a great amendment, I say to my colleague from \nUtah.\n  When I was out in rural Minnesota, I met a woman who serves as a \nguardian to a boy who has witnessed domestic violence. The boy's mother \nis a battered woman and is now separated from the boy's father. The \nguardian told me that the boy's teacher reported that the boy had been \nmean to a girl across the aisle in the classroom, so the boy was sent \nto be ``timed out.'' When this boy was asked about how he was treating \nthe girl, he said that he was not being mean. He said that he hit the \ngirl because he wanted her to do what he said. He said he hit her \nbecause, and I quote, ``that's how dad gets mom to do things.'' I will \nquote that again. This little boy said: I hit this girl because \n``that's how dad gets mom to do things.'' ``That's how dad gets mom to \ndo things.''\n  Children cannot always compartmentalize traumatic events. Instead, \nthe domestic violence comes to school with each and every child \nwitness. It undermines their school performance, their relationships \nwith other children, and we need to get them help.\n  Child protective services, the third part of this. This legislation \nalso addresses domestic violence and the people who work to protect our \nchildren from abuse and neglect. There is a significant overlap between \ndomestic violence and child abuse. In families where one form of \nviolence exists, there is a likelihood that the other does, too. In a \nnational survey, researchers found that 50 percent of the men who \nfrequently assaulted their wives also frequently abused their children. \nThe problem is that the child protective services and the domestic \nviolence organizations have separately set up programs to address one \nof these forms of violence yet few address both when they occur \ntogether in families. This amendment provides incentives for local \ngovernments to collaborate with domestic violence agencies in \nadministering their child welfare programs.\n\n  Madam President, I want to go to the second part of this amendment. \nWhat you have here is a picture of Brandon and Alex Frank. I met their \nmom. These two children were murdered by their father. This amendment \nincreases the funding available for supervised visitation centers.\n  What happens quite often is visitation provides a batterer with \nanother way to batter. This amendment would create a grants program \nwhereby domestic violence service providers could apply for money for \nwhat we call family visitation centers. This is extremely important. \nFor example, usually it is the woman who is battered. The man is now \nout of her home, thank God, but he still has custody rights. He comes \nto visit the child. Quite often when he brings the child back to the \nhome or when there is an exchange at the home, the violence takes place \nagain, or he has custody and he can get the children over a weekend. \nThese visitation centers would enable that father to still see the \nchildren but it would be supervised visitation to protect the children.\n  On July 3, 1996, 5-year-old Brandon and 4-year-old Alex were murdered \nby their father during an unsupervised visit. Their mother Angela--\nSheila and I met her not too long ago; she has met her several times--\nwas separated from Kurt Frank, the father. During her marriage, Angela \nwas physically and emotionally abused by Frank, and Frank had hit \nBrandon and split open his lip when he stepped in front of his mother \nduring a domestic violence incident. Angela had an order of protection \nagainst Kurt Frank, but during custody hearings her request for her \nhusband to only receive supervised visits was rejected. Kurt Frank \nmurdered his two sons during an unsupervised visit. These are the two \nchildren. This amendment says, let's do a better job of protecting \nthese children.\n  Madam President, this amendment also provides further training to law \nenforcement officers. We have met with some great people in the law \nenforcement community, and they say that they now realize they come to \nthe home but they quite often have not been able to understand the \neffect that this has on the children. They come to break it up. They \ncome to protect the woman. They come to make it clear to the man that \nthis is a crime. The children fall between the cracks. This\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nwould enable the law enforcement community to recognize the needs of \nchildren who have witnessed domestic violence, to meet children's \nimmediate needs at the scene of the crime, to establish a collateral \nworking relationship between police officers and local domestic \nviolence agencies.\n  Finally--I want my colleague to know that I am actually summarizing \nthis amendment; I am almost finished--crisis nurseries. Families faced \nwith domestic violence also need a safe place for their children during \na time of crisis. Mary Ann, a mother of two, was dealing with an \nabusive boyfriend, and she knew that she needed to end the \nrelationship. Mary Ann turned to a local crisis nursery for help. The \nnursery volunteers cared for her children while she ended the abusive \nrelationship. The nursery staff played a critical role in supporting \nand encouraging Mary Ann and helping her to make a better life for \nherself and her children.\n\n  This amendment provides funds to States to assist private and public \nagencies and organizations to provide crisis nurseries for children who \nare abused, neglected, at risk of abuse or neglect, or who are families \nreceiving child protective services. Nurseries will be available to \nprovide a safe place for children and to alleviate the social and \nemotional stress among children and families who are impacted by \ndomestic violence.\n  I have to say to you that I believe this amendment that deals with \nproviding support services for children who witness domestic violence \nis one of the most important amendments I have ever brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. I want my colleagues to believe--not many of them \nare here, and this is one of the things that bothers me the most. I \njust don't believe 2\\1/2\\ minutes is going to be enough time. I want \nDemocrats and I want Republicans to understand that for all too many \nchildren, at least 3 million children in our country, this is \ndevastating. Every 15 seconds, a woman is battered; every 15 seconds, a \nwoman is battered in her home. A home should be a safe place. These \nchildren, even if they themselves aren't battered, they see this \nviolence and it has a devastating impact. It is directly related to \nthis legislation.\n  Judges will tell you that a very high percentage of kids who end up \ncommitting violent crime are kids who come from homes where they have \nwitnessed this violence. This amendment is a great amendment which \nsays, we do it at the community level, but we provide the support and \nthe incentives and enable local communities to pull together law \nenforcement, to pull together child protection people, to pull together \nwelfare department people, to pull together women who work at battered \nwomen shelters, to pull together teachers and education people, and we \nget the support services for these kids that they so desperately need. \nThat is what this amendment is about.\n  Madam President, I will at this time send the amendment to the desk, \nand I ask my colleague from Utah--I will conclude in 5 minutes. I send \nthis amendment to the desk. I ask my colleague if I could have 5 \nminutes, and only 5 minutes, to make a statement on one terribly \nimportant issue to me, and then I will be done. I send this amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would require unanimous consent \nfor his amendment. The pending motion is a motion to proceed on the Y2K \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent to send this amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Is this the amendment you gave us before?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. On domestic violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. WELLSTONE] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 359.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment, No. 359, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have listened to the Senator on his \nlast amendment. Our bill does exactly what the Senator from Minnesota \nsuggests in his amendment. This bill already does that. A core purpose \nof the accountability block grant is, from page 225 of the bill: ``The \ncoordinated delivery of support services for juveniles who are at-risk \nfor contact with the juvenile criminal system.''\n  That is exactly what the Senator from Minnesota is suggesting with \nthis amendment. That is a point that I am making. We are repeating \nthings that we have already long thought out for more than 2 years \nwhile we formulated this bill. And so I think it is very important that \nwe realize we can beat these things to death when we already have \nconsidered what he wants.\n  We may not have considered it exactly the way he wants it, but it is \ncertainly part of this bill. I commend him for having the feelings that \nhe does and for being sincere about those feelings. But we are, too. We \nhave worked on this bill, and we think we have covered most of the \ncomponents of the amendment of the distinguished Senator. On the other \nhand, where they are too expensive or don't work, we have considered \nthem, but the bill has a better approach. Be that as it may, I admire \nthe Senator for his sincerity. We will have to vote on the amendment \nand see what happens.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 360\n\n (Purpose: To encourage States to incarcerate individuals convicted of \n                  murder, rape, or child molestation)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Missouri be accorded the floor to make a statement about these \nmatters following a short statement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased to support the amendment I \nam offering on behalf of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum. \nThis amendment adds new incentives for States to ensure that violent \noffenders are incarcerated for the public's protection, by transferring \nFederal crime fighting resources from States that fail to incarcerate \ntheir criminals to States where the criminals commit subsequent crimes.\n  Congressionally funded truth-in-sentencing grants, which provide \nfunds to States to build prisons, have been instrumental in lowering \ncrime by encouraging States to incarcerate violent and repeat offenders \nfor at least 85 percent of their sentence. In January, the Justice \nDepartment reported that 70 percent of prison admissions in 1997 were \nin States requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their \nsentence. More significantly, the average time served by violent \ncriminals nationally has increased 12.2 percent since 1993. Perhaps the \nbiggest reason for recent declines in violent crime is due to these \ntruth-in-sentencing prison grants. Simply put, violent criminals cannot \ncommit crimes against innocent victims while in prison.\n  But as important as these grants have been, we can do more. While \ncrime is a local issue, its effects are interstate. In our highly \nmobile society, the criminals let out of prison in one State too \nfrequently end up committing crimes in a neighboring State, or even in \na State across the country. In my view, States owe a duty not only to \ntheir own citizens, but to the citizens of other States as well, to \nkeep their worst offenders locked up. Senator Santorum's amendment \nprovides a modest incentive to States in this regard, by putting them \non notice that if one of their murderers, rapists, or other sex \noffenders commits a similar offense in another State after being \nreleased, the second State may be reimbursed out of Federal criminal \njustice assistance funds allocated to the first State for the costs of \nincarcerating the criminal in the second State.\n  These transfers would apply if the first State is not a truth-in-\nsentencing State, does not have penalties at least 10 percent above the \nnational average for murder, rape, or other sexual offenses, or in the \nindividual case of triggering the transfer, the inmate did not serve at \nleast 85 percent of his or her sentence.\n  Madam President, no State should allow crime to be a major export. \nThis amendment is a modest proposal to ensure that all our States \nabsorb at least part of the costs of their trans-border crime. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 361\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, all across our Nation, local schools \nare trying to ensure that tragedies like the one in Littleton do not \nhappen again.\n  The Federal Government in Washington is not in a position to make the \nbest decisions for those local schools. No government--let alone the \nFederal Government--can produce a single solution, to prevent school \nviolence.\n  The problems have deeper roots in our culture. Nonetheless, there are \nsome important steps we can take to help local school districts and \nparents make schools safer.\n  In a few moments, I will send to the desk an amendment on behalf of \nMembers of the Youth Violence Education task force, a task force which \nI helped Chair, that will help ensure that our schools once again \nbecome safe havens, rather than places of jeopardy. I thank those who \ncame together on this task force to contribute to the amendment. \nSpecifically, Senators Hutchinson, DeWine, Gregg, Helms, Coverdell, \nAllard, and Abraham.\n  This package is comprehensive in that it contains numerous provisions \nthat give tools to schools and communities to prevent youth violence. \nFirst and foremost, we need to put local schools at the top of our \nagenda and free them to use Federal money where it will do the most \ngood to prevent future violence. Time and experience have exposed as an \nutter falsehood the notion that we know what is best in every \neducational setting.\n  One-size-fits-all regulations won't help local schools reduce their \nparticular risks or solve their unique problems. As we provide \nresources, we need to provide freedom.\n  The cornerstone of our education amendment would open up existing \nDepartment of Education funds to allow school districts new options for \nputting Federal dollars to work. Under this amendment, schools can \nchoose where best to spend Federal resources under titles IV and VI of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act--specifically, the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools program, and Innovative Educational Program \nStrategies funds.\n  Schools can decide whether to spend the money on training, equipment, \nschool assessments, or more personnel. For example, under this \namendment, local school districts could use Federal money for \npurchasing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, for training \nschool officials in recognizing and averting potentially dangerous \nsituations, or for introducing school uniform policies, if they so \nchose.\n  Local school districts would remain free to choose the use that best \naddresses local needs. The Federal Government provides a great deal of \nmoney for education and related funding. The fiscal year 2000 budget \nresolution conference report called for $66.3 billion in education and \nrelated funding for fiscal year 2000; $404.1 billion over 5 years; and \n$782.4 billion over 10 years.\n  Compared to current spending levels, this represents an increase of \n$8.1 billion over 5 years and $33 billion over 10 years.\n  As a result of this budget resolution, Congress will be providing \nmuch-needed funding to education programs in fiscal year 2000. While we \nknow that local schools need our help, we do not always know how best \nto provide that help. We need to provide the opportunity and authority \nfor local schools\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nto do what they can to improve the climate for safe and secure learning \nenvironments on campuses. For this reason, this amendment will give \nschools the flexibility they need to best provide for the safety and \nsecurity of their students.\n  Another component of this amendment would clarify that nothing in the \nFederal law stands in the way of local decisions to introduce a dress \ncode or school uniform policy--not to mandate from Washington, but make \nit clear that the Federal law does not prevent it or preclude it. To \nmake sure that we don't constrain efforts to build working communities, \nthis legislation makes it abundantly clear that Federal law does not \nprohibit schools from instituting dress codes. Dress codes can create a \nsense of belonging and unity among students and help eliminate the \ndivision of schools according to cliques. By doing so, dress codes can \nhelp schools have a sense of community among students, and Federal law \nshould not block local educators from fostering this sense of \ncommunity.\n\n  In Kansas City, MO, the George Washington Carver Elementary School, a \nmagnet school, established a dress code policy for the 320 elementary \nschool students in 1990. The results are positive. Philomina Harshaw, \nthe principal for all 6 years that Carver has had uniforms, observed \nthat a new sense of calmness exists throughout the school after \nstudents began wearing uniforms. ``The students feel good about \nthemselves, as uniforms build a sense of pride,'' she has reported.\n  Long Beach, CA, has a school uniform in all its elementary and middle \nschools. District officials found in the year following the \nimplementation of the school uniform policy, overall school crime \ndecreased 36 percent, fights decreased 51 percent, sex offenses \ndecreased 74 percent, weapons offenses decreased 50 percent, assault \nand battery offenses decreased 34 percent, and vandalism decreased 18 \npercent, sending a clear message that some of the resources which can \nbe used to implement such a policy is sending a clear message of \nfreedom to our schools that they are free to act in the best interests \nof their students.\n  The federal government should be in a position to assist schools in \nmaking decisions that they believe can make a difference, particularly \nwhen the record is clear about the difference made in other districts.\n  In addition, this task force, which was formed to look at our federal \neducation policy to see if anything could be done to reduce the impact \nof violence in schools, included in the amendment a provision which \nprovides certain liability protections for school personnel when they \nundertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, and a safe \neducational environment.\n  This provision, to which Senator Coverdell will speak shortly, is \nbased upon similar liability protections for volunteers that was signed \ninto law, as well as a number of state laws that offer teachers limited \ncivil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits. We must \nassure that teachers and other school personnel are able to do what is \nnecessary to provide a safe and stable learning environment for all \nstudents.\n  This amendment also includes language that makes certain that school \ndiscipline records follow a student when a student transfers to another \npublic or private school.\n  The receiving school should have information about the discipline \nrecords of a student coming into that school environment. In the last \nCongress I sponsored an amendment that ensured that juvenile records \nwere available to schools when students transferred.\n  My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of 15-year-\nold Christine Smetzer in a restroom at McCluer North High School in St. \nLouis County. The male special education student convicted of murdering \nSmetzer had a juvenile record and had been caught in the women's \nrestroom at a previous school. However, teachers and administrators at \nMcCluer North say they were not informed of the student's record when \nhe transferred to their school.\n  It was tragic the transfer didn't involve the disciplinary records, \nbecause it cost Christine Smetzer her life.\n  In response, I secured a provision in the law requiring that, under \nIDEA, student disciplinary records must transfer to a new school when \nthe student goes to a new school.\n  The language in the task force amendment expands that provision, so \nthat any student's discipline record--whether or not the student is \nserved under IDEA--will be available to any school--public or private--\nto which the student transfers.\n  We need to send all the information we can about a student to a new \nschool when a person transfers.\n  These provisions and others were developed by the Republican \nEducation Task Force which I chaired. I want to again thank my \ncolleagues who worked with me on the Task Force--Senators DeWine and \nHutchinson, Gregg, Coverdell, and Helms. I look forward to working with \nthem to ensure that these proposals are included in the final bill.\n  It is in response to these considerations. As a result of the work \nproduct of this task force, we developed a package of considerations in \nan amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, \n     Mr. Allard, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered \n     361.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5416-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5416-S5419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A UNION OF MINDS WORTH EXPLORING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have scoured the newspapers in recent \ndays in an effort to begin to unravel the pieces of the puzzle that led \ntwo young teenage boys to commit such senseless atrocity at Columbine \nHigh School. It is long past time to stop wringing our hands over this \nissue of school violence. We can no longer afford to sit idly by, \nwatching our nation's schools being infiltrated by hoodlums and hate \ngroups more concerned with converting schools into places of fear than \nmaintaining them as havens of learning and enlightenment. This Congress \nand the American people must join forces and take action now to protect \nour young.\n  Now, that is very easy to say--very easy to say. And I think everyone \nwould agree on that, that they must join forces. We must find ways to \nrestore discipline. Now, that is a little tougher. That is a little \nharder to bring about. We must find ways to restore discipline.\n  The ancient Romans practiced discipline. And it began in the home \nwhere the children were taught to venerate their ancestors, to respect \ntheir gods. They were pagan gods, but nevertheless they were the gods \nof the Romans. And the young men and women in the homes were taught to \nrevere their parents and to respect the law. Each Roman believed that \nthe gods had designed a destiny for Rome. And each Roman believed that \nit was his duty to help bring about the fulfillment of that destiny \nwhich the gods had designed for the Roman state. That discipline \noverflowed from the home and into the Roman legions, and it was in \ngreat part because of that iron discipline that the Roman legions were \nenabled to conquer all of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea and \nto subjugate them. It was that discipline that was first learned at the \nhearth, in the family circle, in the home. That is where it has to \nstart today. That is exactly where it has to begin today--in the homes.\n  We must instill in our children basic values and provide them with \nthe knowledge and the skills to confront the many demands that are \nplaced upon our society. We must prevent, if we can, a recurrence of \nthese ruthless slaughters that continue to rock the institutional base \nof our Nation's education system.\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n  It is now time to do what we can. I am only one, but I am one. I \ncannot do everything, but I can do something. And what I can do, by the \ngrace of God I intend to do.\n  It is time to do what we can do, and to search out additional avenues \nthat will return peace and tranquility to our schools and our society. \nSo, today, I heed my words, and come to this hallowed chamber to take \nan essential step forward in this unfolding national debate by joining \nwith my colleagues Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain to call for the \nconvening of a National Commission on Youth Violence.\n  I know we appoint lots of commissions. I spoke of the Romans a while \nago. So did they; they appointed commissions. I make mention of the \nRomans many times. Of course, I could speak of our English forebears as \nwell. But I mention the Romans because Montesquieu thought that the \nancient Romans were a unique people. The framers were acquainted with \nMontesquieu. He admired the ancient Romans so much that he wrote a \nhistory of the ancient Romans. It was back several years ago, when we \nwere discussing the line-item veto, I thought that, inasmuch as \nMontesquieu had studied with thoroughness the ancient Romans, I would \ndo the same. And it was there that he learned about checks and \nbalances, and separation of powers--in his study of the Romans. So they \nappointed commissions as well.\n  This amendment, which I am pleased to learn has been accepted into \nthe managers' package, focuses on the formidable challenge of \nidentifying and reconciling the root causes, the underlying motives, \nand the influences fueling this widening streak of lawlessness plaguing \nthe heart and soul of America.\n  By gathering together men and women of the highest caliber of \nexpertise in law enforcement, school administration, child and \nadolescent psychology, parenting and family studies, we call upon all \nparties--all parties--to listen and learn, galvanizing a true national \ndiscussion on school safety. This National Commission will seek \ndifficult answers to some difficult questions--What drives children to \ncommit such violence?\n  When I was a little boy and when I was a young man, we never heard of \nsuch violence. We would never have thought of carrying a gun to school.\n  The most outrageous thing I ever did in school back in that little \ntwo-room school--I was always glad when the teacher appointed me as one \nof the two boys who would go over the hill to the spring house and \nbring back to the school a bucket of water, out of which we all drank. \nWe all drank out of the same bucket and with the same dipper. One day, \nI decided to put a few tadpoles in my pocket and put those tadpoles on \nthe desk of one of the little girl classmates. Well, I thought it was \nfunny, but when the teacher got through with me, it wasn't so funny. \nShe didn't think it was funny.\n  On another occasion, when I was in high school, I was asked by one of \nmy teachers, whose name was Margaret McKone, a question. I said, \n``Huh?'' And I went on reading at my desk. I was not aware of the fact \nthat she walked to the back of the room, came up the aisle, and had \ngotten just level with me until she slammed me in the face with a hard \nsmack of her hand. I can feel it still, and I can feel the \nembarrassment that went along with it. She said, ``Robert, don't you \never say `huh' to me again.'' I did not give her any back talk, and I \nnever said ``huh'' to her again.\n  My old coal miner dad said: If you ever get a whipping in school, you \nwill get another one when you get home. I knew something about his \nwhippings. He started out with a hickory limb. Later, as I became a \nlittle older, he used a razor strap.\n  One day, we had a substitute teacher. We never thought of doing \nviolence in school. Violence? Why, it wasn't allowed in our school. \nNobody talked about violence. I took a piece of paper and I folded it \nand made myself a toy airplane. When I saw the teacher's back was \nturned--this was a substitute teacher, as I say--when the substitute \nteacher's back was turned, I sailed that paper airplane across the \nroom.\n\n  The teacher turned just in time to see the airplane still suspended \nin air and my outstretched hand. He said, ``Robert, come up here.'' He \ncalled me to the front of the class. He put a chair up there. He said, \n``Robert, get up in that chair.'' He drew a circle on the blackboard \nand said, ``Stick your nose in the center of that circle.'' I did. When \nI did, there were resounding whacks on my posterior which I will never \nforget, after which I turned to my seat red faced amid the snickers of \nmy classmates. They were somewhat veiled snickers, but I heard them. It \nwas embarrassing. I got just what I asked for.\n  What would you think of the things some children are doing in school \nthese days? They are not sailing paper airplanes. And up until a few \nyears ago, we did not have these outrageous, violent crimes being \ncommitted by youngsters.\n  My old coal miner dad never bought me a cap buster at Christmastime. \nI was lucky to get an apple, or an orange, or a piece of candy. He \nnever bought me a cap buster. He never bought me a cowboy suit. He \nalways got me a drawing tablet or a watercolor set or a book. He taught \nme to learn. He urged me to learn so I would not have to work in the \ncoal mine.\n  Those were the two people who raised me. They were religious people. \nThey were not of the religious left, not of the religious right. They \ndid not make a big whoop-de-doo over their religion, but they were \nreligious. How did I know? Many times when the lights were out and in \nmy early boyhood, the house was lighted by a kerosene lamp. We did not \nhave any running water in the house, no electricity. But when the light \nwas out, I would hear that great lady who raised me praying. I would \nhear her praying in another room. I knew she was on her knees. I had \nseen her many times on her knees. When my old coal miner dad left this \nworld, he did not owe any man a penny.\n  They taught me to be honest, pay your debts, and work, work hard. It \nnever hurt anybody. It may have killed John Henry, but that is about \nall I can recall. We were taught to work, to be honest, to revere our \nfather and mother. The Bible says: Honor thy father and thy mother. We \nwere taught to do that, not talk back.\n  Thank God I am one of those few Americans left who grew up in the \nGreat Depression, who knows something about the Great Depression, who \nwas in school during the Great Depression.\n  I was the coal mining community's scrap boy. I went around the coal \ntown and gathered the scraps from the coal miners' tables and fed my \ndad's pigs. He always bought about 10 to 12 Poland China pigs. I would \nfeed those pigs. I would gather the scraps year round. I was the \nvillage scrap boy. Some people called it the village ``slop boy,'' the \ntown's ``slop boy.''\n  When we were in school, we always had prayer every morning and \npledged allegiance to the flag of the United States. I am the only \nMember of 535 Members of this Congress today who can say that I was \nhere, in Congress, on June 7, 1954, when the House of Representatives \nvoted to insert the words ``under God'' into the Pledge of Allegiance--\n``under God,'' on June 7, 1954. The Senate followed suit the next day, \nand on June 14 it became a law.\n  The first thing we did was have prayer. They do not do that these \ndays. It did not hurt any of us. It was good for us. If there is \nanything about which I would amend the first amendment, it would be \nthat. I am not above amending the Constitution, but I think we had \nbetter be very slow about it. Don't do it very often, certainly. But \nthat is one thing that I think would help, if the Nation returned to \nGod first.\n\n  ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord. Bring up a child in \nthe way that he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from \nit.''\n  When we parents are looking around wringing our hands and we \npoliticians are looking around and wringing our hands saying, ``What \nshould we do?'' let's return to some of the country's basics, the \nfundamentals that made this a great nation.\n  The Bible says remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have \nset. That is one of the old landmarks. We have gotten too far away, \ndrifting too far from the shore. My friend from Alabama will remember \nthat old hymn--drifting too far from the shore.\n  I will tell you, there is nothing wrong with this Nation that some \nold-time religion will not cure. It does not have to\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nbe my religion; it does not have to be a Baptist; it does not have to \nbe Methodist, Presbyterian, whatever--just a basic belief in a Creator.\n  Now, you might say: Well, Charles Darwin didn't believe that. You \nread his books. Read his books. He mentions the Creator in ``The Origin \nof Species.'' And in ``The Descent of Man,'' he said he made a mistake \nin ``The Origin of Species,'' he had exaggerated, he had gone too far.\n  We can pass all the laws that we can pass, all the laws we care to \npass, but it has to start out in the home. In the home, that is where \nit begins. That is the root.\n  So what drives children to such violence? Why are students taking the \nlives of their classmates? How do we prevent future incidents like \nthose at Columbine High School from recurring? I hope the commission \ncan find some prescriptions for change as a result of these \nexplorations. But perhaps, most important of all, the commission's \nmandate will serve as a catalyst for our Nation's parents, teachers, \nindustry leaders, and their communities, to each--each; you, me; each; \nhim, her; each--take responsibility in protecting our Nation's \nchildren.\n  One of the many charges delegated to the National Commission is an \nexploration of the ever-important role of school teachers and \nadministrators in the lives of their students--school teachers. Part of \nthe cure, I believe, lies in the need to restore basic discipline--\nbasic discipline--to the classroom.\n  When I was a young boy, I attended to my lessons and I attended to my \nlessons. I threw a paper airplane once in a while, but I attended to my \nlessons. And in a two-room schoolhouse my teachers were my role models. \nI wanted to be the best in the algebra class; I wanted to be the best \nin the geometry class; I wanted to please my teacher, and I wanted to \nplease that old couple who took me to raise. They were my role models.\n  I have met, in my long political career, with kings and shahs and \nprinces and queens and Presidents and Governors and men and women of \nthe highest station in this world, but one of the few great men whom I \never came to know was that old coal miner dad who raised me. He was a \ngreat man. I never heard him say God's name in vain in all the years I \nwas with him--not once, not once.\n  So those teachers, along with my adoptive parents, taught me the so-\ncalled ``old values'' of integrity, honesty, respect, and loyalty that \nI carry with me to this very day.\n  Now, I am no paragon. I do not claim to be a paragon of rectitude or \nwhatever, but, as Popeye used to say, I am what I am. My old dad and \nmom, they taught me to be what I am, and they taught me to believe in a \nhigher power, taught me to believe in God.\n  Now, if parents ingrain that kind of teaching in the child, they may \nstray from the righteous path from time to time but they will come \nback, they will come back.\n  The classroom was a sacred precinct where a quiet and wholesome \nenvironment prevailed, and where students came to learn. They came to \nlearn the fundamentals of math and science and grammar and literature \nand history. Discipline was expected and discipline was enforced.\n  And on that little report card that I took back home, there was one \nitem, deportment--deportment. I was always careful that my dad would \nsee a good mark in every category, and particularly in deportment.\n  When disorder broke out, as it did very rarely, the teacher had the \nauthority and the command of the classroom to bring students to upright \nand full attention.\n  Mr. President, I know that it is easy to hear someone from my \ngeneration speaking of morals and values and the way things used to be \nand simply dismiss those words and sentiments as being old-fashioned or \nout of step with the world today. Well, in some things I do not want to \nbe in step with the world today. Let the world go its way. But for the \nsake of our future, I think we can learn from our past.\n  Today, the discipline that we once knew has eroded to the point that \nstudents no longer resolve conflicts with words, but with weapons. The \nnormal angst of adolescence has given way to anger and outright \nviolence. As a consequence, we have teachers who fear the very \nenvironment in which they one day thrived, wondering whether they, too, \nmight be caught in the line of fire.\n  I remember there was a class in agriculture when I was in school in \nSpanishburg, WV, may I say to the distinguished Senator from Missouri, \nwho is presiding over the Senate today with a degree of dignity and \nskill that is so rare as a day in June. The teacher was talking about \nthe potato and about the eyes of the potato. He called on me and asked \nme a question. I thought it would be funny if I said that the potato \ngot dirt in its eyes. I thought that was kind of funny. And he said, \n``Robert, stand up. Now, you apologize to the class for what you just \nsaid.'' See, I was making a little light of a serious matter. I thought \nI was being a kind of showoff, which I did not particularly try to do \nmany times. But he said, ``You stand up and you apologize to the \nclass.'' And I apologized to the class.\n  Mr. President, our teachers deserve the opportunity to teach just as \nour children deserve the opportunity to learn.\n\n     A Builder builded a temple,\n      He wrought it with grace and skill;\n     Pillars and groins and arches\n      All fashioned to work his will.\n     Men said, as they saw its beauty,\n      ``It shall never know decay;\n     Great is thy skill, O Builder!\n      Thy fame shall endure for aye.''\n     A teacher builded a temple\n      With loving and infinite care,\n     Planning each arch with patience,\n      Laying each stone with prayer.\n     None praised her unceasing efforts,\n      None knew of her wondrous plan,\n     For the temple the Teacher builded\n      Was unseen by the eyes of man.\n     Gone is the Builder's temple,\n      Crumbled into the dust;\n     Low lies each stately pillar,\n      Food for consuming rust.\n     But the temple the Teacher builded\n      Will last while the ages roll,\n     For that beautiful unseen temple\n      Was a child's immortal soul.\n\n  So the worth of a good teacher can never be measured. But without the \ninvolvement of parents, I fear that the madness overrunning our \nnation's classrooms will not abate. We have sadly learned that, all too \nfrequently, one parent's complacency can result in another parent's \nworst nightmare. And so I call upon parents to be alert and active \nparticipants in their child's education--whether it means attending \nparent-teacher conferences or reviewing their child's math assignments. \nParents should strive to know their children inside and out--their \ntemperament, their habits, their strengths and their weaknesses. And \nthey should make it a priority to know their children's friends and the \nparents of their children's friends. In today's two-working parent \nsociety, such supervision is extremely difficult and places a greater \nburden on the community, as a whole, to look at this dilemma in a new \nlight, and to help parents juggle competing demands. It is my hope that \nthe National Commission will help parents refocus on this role of \nindividual responsibility, reinforcing the urgency in parents' stepping \nup to the plate, and enabling them to take a more active and involved \nrole in their children's lives.\n  Furthermore, with parents caught up in the hustle and bustle of their \nown everyday life, many children today have much too much unsupervised \ntime on their hands, with free run of their own money--I never knew \nwhat it was to have a loose nickel in my pocket when I was a boy--and \ntheir own leisure activities. Mr. President, I do not mean to \ndiscourage the idea of children working after school. It instills \nwithin our children at a young age a strong work ethic and an \nappreciation for the value of a dollar. If you want to know the value \nof money, try and borrow some. For some families, it is necessary to \nensure that the family's needs are met, or to save for college. But too \noften, at the hands of disengaged parents, the lessons have been lost, \nwith after-school jobs serving only to enable misconduct--giving young \npeople the unchecked financial means to purchase guns and to buy bomb-\nmaking materials. Once again, we witness the eternal need for parents \nto be an integral component of their children's lives, to teach them \nright from wrong, and be their first line of defense in leading them \naway from these kinds of troubling situations.\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\n  Today, with the overwhelming amount of violence and amorality \ninundating kids' minds from the media and entertainment industry, \nparents face an even greater challenge than before.\n  How fortunate my wife and I are that our children, our two daughters, \nwere virtually grown women before we had a television set in our home. \nI know it must be more difficult today than it was when our two \ndaughters grew up.\n  It saddens me to think that we have reached a point where a National \nCommission is necessary to explore these pervasive negative \ninfluences--movies. I have been in the Washington area 47 years this \nyear. I have been to one movie in that 47 years, and I haven't lost \nanything. I have watched some good movies--Alistair Cooke's great \nmovies, performed by British actors who knew the English language and \nwho could speak it well: ``The Six Wives of Henry VIII,'' ``Elizabeth \nR,'' great movies. But I went to one movie. I walked out before it was \nover. It was boring. Yul Brynner played in that movie. I walked out. I \nhaven't lost anything. But I have seen some great movies on television, \nI mean great movies.\n  I wouldn't waste my time on trash, because I don't have a lot of \ntime. You don't either. You don't have much time. We are only here a \nshort time. Why waste it on trash--movies, video games, television. I \nsuppose if I had young children in my house, the first thing I would \ntake out is the television set. Take it out. And they wouldn't miss \nanything except a lot of junk. That is not to say that television is \nall bad. It is a great medium, a great medium for informing the people. \nIt is a great medium, a great tool for good, but all too often the \nprogramming is absolutely lousy. It is built around the dollar, the \ndollar. What can make money. Movies, video games, television, the \nInternet, and other free-wheeling vehicles, to explore these pervasive \nnegative influences for disseminating smut and violence, smut and \nviolence. You watch many of the advertisements on the TV. They are full \nof violence, the advertisements themselves.\n  It is particularly troublesome that the bad tends to overshadow the \ngood aspects of the entertainment arena. When I think of movies such as \nthe recent ``October Sky,'' which tells the story of three young boys \ngrowing up in Coalwood, West Virginia in the late 1950s, with a dream \nto build and launch their own homemade rockets in the hopes of winning \nthe National Science Fair's college scholarship awards, I realize that \nthere, too, are wholesome stories to be told. The kind that inspire and \nmotivate youth to push beyond their daily homework assignments and to \nshoot for the stars. To find a mission in life, once thought \nimpossible, and tackle it. The kind of movie that all parents ought to \ntake their children to see. There are some good movies.\n  We have learned from the recent events the ease with which a \nyoungster can access dangerous information, dial up polluted Web sites \nadvertising recipes for bomb making and solicitations for joining hate \ngroups. Likewise, we know that violent video games in the home and at \nthe arcade confuse or override a child's moral sense of right from \nwrong by rewarding them with points for shooting their enemy dead. \nUntil we find solutions to curb or counteract this madness spewing \nforth from the TV set, the radio, and cyberspace, we, as a community, \nmust demonstrate greater vigilance and care, and think twice before \ngiving our children free rein of the remote control or leaving \ninquisitive young minds unattended in the wilderness of cyberspace.\n  Mr. President, seemingly, in the blink of an eye, we have witnessed \nthe true demise of part of the American dream. The once peaceful and \nserene schoolhouse has been marred by episodes of violence and \nbloodshed, with precious young children falling victim--children who \nmay have grown up one day to be great teachers, great physicians, great \nlawyers, great architects, great physicists, businessmen and women.\n  There is no one-step solution to ending schoolyard slaughters, but it \nis my strong hope that this National Commission will provide answers to \nthe many whys and hows infesting America's psyche, and begin to remedy \nthis harrowing problem once and for all. Let us all work together to \nensure that the tragic events of Columbine are not revisited in another \nAmerican neighborhood.\n\n       I took a piece of plastic clay\n       And idly fashioned it one day\n       And as my fingers pressed it still\n       It moved and yielded to my will.\n       I came again when days were past,\n       The bit of clay was hard at last.\n       The form I gave it, it still bore,\n       And I could change that form no more.\n\n       I took a piece of living clay\n       And gently formed it day by day.\n       And molded with my power and art\n       A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n       I came again when years were gone,\n       He was a man I looked upon.\n       He still that early impress wore,\n       And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  Our children, the home, that is where we got off the track. That is \nwhere we are going to have to get back on the track--the home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the great delights in the Senate \nis being able to listen to Senator Byrd, on a number of occasions, \nshare his wisdom with us. I think the story of the Roman legion and \nothers he has shared with us are not unimportant. They go to the very \nheart of the decline in discipline and order in America today, and it \nis deeper than most people think.\n  I have often thought what good does it do to have a $500 text book if \na 14-year-old won't read it, would even scoff at the thought of reading \nit, and has no intention of reading it or paying attention to the \nteacher, who we are paying and encouraging to try to teach. It does go \nback to the home. The home is also being undermined, I think, by the \npopular culture, as Senator Byrd suggests. It is difficult to conceive \nhow we can have any moral order not founded in religion.\n  I suggest that we really don't need to amend the First Amendment. We \nreally need to have it enforced as it is written. It says that Congress \nshall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion. In other \nwords, Congress can't establish a religion. That is us. Congress cannot \nestablish a religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof. Congress \ncan't prohibit the free exercise of religion. I think we need to get \nback to the first 175 year's interpretation of the plain words of that \namendment, and little children might be able to have a prayer in the \nmorning. I don't think it hurt me. I think it was a benefit. As a \nmatter of fact, I know the Senator knows Judge Griffin Bell, former \nAttorney General under President Jimmy Carter. He was asked once at a \nbig bar meeting what he thought about the litmus test President Reagan \nwas applying to judges. I think he shocked everybody in the room when \nhe stepped up to the microphone and said, ``Well, we need a litmus \ntest. Nobody ought to be a Federal judge who doesn't believe in prayer \nat football games.'' I have thought a lot about that. Maybe that had a \nlot of insight to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5419-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5419-S5420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be having a critical \nvote in the morning. It will be a vote on cloture to the Y2K legal \nreform bill that will be coming up. It is being subjected to a \nfilibuster, unfortunately, by members of the minority. I hope that in \nthe morning the agreements can be reached so that that vote will result \nin our ability to proceed with the bill and that we could make some \nprogress.\n  To share a few comments on it, the computer industry is critical to \nAmerica's growth, prosperity and ability to be competitive in the world \nmarket. It is one of our major exports. People come here from all over \nthe world to learn about computers. Our design and technology has \ncreated a huge number of jobs that have been very helpful to America, \nand we are exporting around the globe large product in that area, which \nhelps us with our balance of payments, which is not good in general.\n  In addition, and maybe even more important, high tech computer \nequipment is increasing our productivity as a nation. As a matter of \nfact, Alan Greenspan has raised the question in several moments of \ntestimony I have been present to hear in the last 2 years as to how it \nis possible that we can have an increase in wages much higher than the \nincrease in inflation, the cost\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nof goods and services. If salaries are going up, why isn't inflation \ngoing up? He has been afraid and expressed his fear that if we keep \nraising wages--and I hope we can just keep raising wages, but his \nconcern was it would drive inflation. But it has not. He has speculated \nin recent speeches and testimony, and many people have expressed the \nview that this is because of the impact of high technology, the \ncomputers. Now, a worker can produce so much more today than he could a \nfew years ago because of the benefits of this high tech ability. So it \nis a critical thing for us as a Nation.\n\n  We want to be able to pay higher and higher wages. We want our \nproductivity to continue to go up, but we don't want to create \ninflation at the same time. So this is a big deal. So we have this \nglitch, this year 2000 bug; when the numbers all become zeros out \nthere, there is a concern, a very real concern, that a lot of computers \nare not going to work well, that whole systems may be in trouble--maybe \na bank, maybe a grocery store in a checkout computer line, and things \nsuch as telephone systems and others could be in serious jeopardy and \ncost a lot of money. If it causes that, we have problems.\n  We are a combative society. It is a good thing for us sometimes, and \nsometimes it is not so good. The recent conference of the American Bar \nAssociation--and I made one comment previously on this. I suggested \nthis was an official position of the ABA. I didn't mean to say so, but \nI think I suggested that. There was a seminar at the American Bar \nAssociation, and experts expressed great concerns about the impact of \nthis litigation. We have received information that 500 or more law \nfirms are already preparing seminars on how to handle the flood of \nlitigation that is coming. It has been estimated that the legal costs \nof Y2K lawsuits could exceed that of asbestos, breast implants and \ntobacco all combined.\n  How could this be? Well, there are computer systems in every town in \nAmerica. Every small town has them, and certainly the bigger towns have \neven bigger systems. If those systems cause a store to mess up, their \nstock inventory to mess up, or the phone system not to work, and those \nsorts of things, then we have a real problem. Somebody could file a \nlawsuit.\n  Now, we have a problem with filing lots of lawsuits. Let me share \nthis story with you. A number of years ago, asbestos companies \ncontinued to sell asbestos after they had a reasonable basis to know \nthat breathing asbestos by workers could make them ill. They should not \nhave done that. They should have been held liable for that. Lawsuits \nwere filed. To date, 200,000 asbestos lawsuits have been concluded, \n200,000 more of them are pending, and it is estimated that maybe \nanother 200,000 asbestos cases will be filed.\n  But the real tragedy--and as a lawyer who loves the law, I have to \nsay this is a very real tragedy--was that only 40 percent of the money \npaid out by the asbestos companies actually got to the victims. Costs \nate up 60 percent of that. These cases took years to conclude. \nIndividuals who had been victimized died before they ever got a dime. \nSometimes even their wives died before their heirs received any \nbenefits. It was not a good day for litigation in America.\n\n  One more thing: Seventy-percent of the asbestos companies are in \nbankruptcy today.\n  Don't tell me that if we unleash a flood of lawsuits in every county \nin America against the greatest, most innovative, creative industry \nthis Nation has perhaps ever created, we can't damage that industry; \nindeed, we have the capacity to bankrupt. It is a threat to our \nnational economic vitality, in my opinion, and we need to do something \nabout it.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Hatch have been working on this \nlegislation. They have done everything they can to develop a bill with \nwhich both the Democrats and the Republicans can live. It will require \nthat a computer company be given notice of the problem and have a \nchance to fix it before a lawsuit can be filed. Just give them a chance \nto fix it. They have to fix it.\n  Arbitration: If there is a disagreement, there will be compensation \nfor damages, but it limits punitive damages to three times the actual \nlost, or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  That is the general framework of what the bill contains--a reasonable \nattempt to get compensation and to focus on fixing the problem so that \nthis country's commercial activities can continue in a very efficient \nway to put our money on fixing the problem and not on lawyers and \nlawsuits. If we fail in this, if we allow this to happen, somebody is \ngoing to bear the responsibility for it. Members who vote against this \nbill, who are not giving it a chance to work and are not willing to \nface up to this are going to have to bear a heavy responsibility.\n  We have to have real reform, too. If it is not going to go halfway, \nwe might as well not try it.\n  By the way, 80 lawsuits have already been filed. We had testimony in \nthe Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Missouri, who is presiding \nnow, is a member of that committee. The witness liked the lawsuits. He \nwon a couple of million dollars. I asked him how long it took. He said \n2 years. I don't know how he won before he ever had a Y2K problem. But \nhe won. I am thinking, there were just a few lawsuits filed at that \ntime. It took him 2 years. What if you have hundreds of thousands of \nlawsuits clogging the courts? How can anybody get any legitimate \ncompensation? It is going to be jackpot justice. One jury is going to \ngive somebody $10 million, one is going to get zero, and that is not a \nway to handle it.\n  This bill for this one Y2K problem will provide a national framework, \nbecause this is clearly interstate commerce, in settling these matters \nand trying to give the computer industry a chance to fix the problem \nand to get our industries' computer systems working.\n  I am really concerned about the vote tomorrow. It is a critical vote \nfor the American economy. Those who fail to realize that could damage \nour country.\n  The vote will be coming up in the morning and everybody should be \naware of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5420-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 344\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my reasons \nfor voting in favor of amendment No. 344, offered by Senators Hatch and \nCraig, to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill. I am extremely \ndisappointed that the amendment does not close the loophole permitting \nsales of firearms at gun shows without background checks. I supported, \nand continue to support, the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg, \nthat would close the gun show loophole once and for all. I regret that \nthe Hatch amendment does not go as far as that of my colleague from New \nJersey.\n  Nonetheless, I recognize that there are not yet the votes in the \nSenate to pass the Lautenberg amendment and I do not wish to overlook \nthe positive crime-fighting proposals that the Hatch amendment makes. \nThese include establishment of the CUFF (``Criminal Use of Firearms by \nFelons'') program, which will provide $50 million for tougher \nenforcement of existing gun laws, and expansion of the Youth Crime Gun \nInterdiction Initiative, to facilitate the identification and \nprosecution of gun traffickers. The Hatch amendment also sets tough \npenalties for gun offenses involving juveniles and seeks to facilitate \nbackground checks for gun purchases. These are important, worthy \nprovisions, and they are the reason for my voting in favor of the Hatch \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5420-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5420-S5421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate \nseveral times in the last 2 weeks to talk about Kosovo. When the \nmajority leader was talking about our crowded schedule, I couldn't help \nbut thinking to myself that we need to find the time on the floor of \nthe Senate to have a thorough discussion and debate about Kosovo and \nwhat is happening there.\n  This weekend in Korisa, as a result of airstrikes, somewhere in the \nneighborhood of about, I think, 70 or 80 innocent people were killed. \nNow, it is quite unclear whether or not we made the mistake, or whether \nor not the Serbs somehow brought people back to this town and used them \nas human shields--and they have done that.\n  But I come to the floor of the Senate to make two points. One, about \n2 weeks ago, I said I thought we should have a\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\npause in the bombing. I did not make it open-ended. I made it crystal \nclear that we would communicate to Milosevic that if he used this 48-\nhour period of time to repair radar systems, to resupply military, and \nif he did not stop the slaughter and if he did not remove troops, we \nwould immediately begin to bomb again. But I felt it was critically \nimportant to do that because of the momentum of the G-8 countries going \nto the United Nations and a possible diplomatic solution.\n  I wish we had done that because then there was the bombing of the \nChinese Embassy and all that has happened since. I just want to make \nthe following point: I then came to the floor again last week and \ncalled for a temporary pause in the bombing, and I do so again this \nweek. I do not want to engage in moral equivalency. I did not want this \ncentury to end this way. I did not want Milosevic to be able to get \naway with what he has been able to get away with, which has been the \nmurder of innocent people, noncombatant civilians.\n  But, by the same token, it troubles me when I read reports that we \ndon't use Apache helicopters for fear that we would be flying too low \nand we could see some of our Americans shot down and killed. I have \nthat same concern.\n  When I first voted for airstrikes, I assumed we would be prosecuting \nthe war in Kosovo. I assumed this was the risk. I stayed up thinking, \nmy God, we are going to lose people. What if it were my son or \ndaughter? Would I believe they were doing the right thing?\n\n  I believe our intentions are good, but I think these high-tech, high-\nfly airstrikes, if it continues on and on, it is going to lead to the \ndeath of many other innocent people, and it is going to undercut our \nmoral case. There is no question about it.\n  When we took this vote--and I read from the Record and I will \nconclude on this--I asked my colleague, Senator Biden:\n\n       Could my colleague, for the purpose of the legislative \n     record, spell out the objective? Could my colleague spell out \n     what his understanding is when we say the President is \n     authorized to conduct military operations?\n\n  Senator Biden's response, which I think was a good one, was:\n\n       My understanding of the objective stated by the President \n     is that his objective is to end the ethnic cleansing in \n     Kosovo and the persecution of the Albanian minority \n     population in Kosovo and to maintain security and stability \n     in the Balkans as a consequence of slowing up, stopping, or \n     curtailing the ability of Milosevic and the Serbian VJ and \n     MUP to be able to go in and cause circumstances which provide \n     for the likelihood of a half million refugees to destabilize \n     the region. The objective at the end of the day is, \n     hopefully, that this will bring Milosevic back to the table. \n     Hopefully, he will agree to what all of NATO said they wanted \n     him to agree to, and hopefully that will occur. In the event \n     it does not occur, the objective will be to degrade his \n     military capability so significantly that he will not be able \n     to impose his will upon Kosovo as he is doing now.\n\n  I suggest that perhaps our objectives have shifted because much of \nthe massacre has taken place--and maybe more would have if not for the \nairstrikes, I don't know. But many people have been murdered and \nemptied out of their country, forced out of their country. In addition, \nthis bombing goes way beyond degrading Milosevic's military capacity.\n  So I call on my colleagues to seriously consider a very thorough, \nhonest, serious debate about the war in Kosovo, about where we are, and \nwhere we need to go. I don't think any of the options are good. I don't \nwant us to leave and abandon the people. I want the people to be able \nto go back to their country. I want there to be an international force, \na militarized force, and I want people to rebuild lives. But I would \nlike to see much more emphasis on what we need to do to pursue a \ndiplomatic solution to this. I don't think there is any other \nalternative. It is not going to be the ground troops; it is not going \nto be Apache helicopters, apparently. I don't think it can be 5 or 6 \nmore months of airstrikes.\n  So, again, I come to the floor today to call for a pause in the \nairstrikes, very focused, for 48 hours, with clear conditions, the \nemphasis being on a diplomatic solution to this military conflict.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to child labor; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          House Resolution 118\n\n       Whereas, many children in developing countries, or in \n     countries that are in transition to a market economy, are \n     employed in the export sector, especially plantations and the \n     textile, garment, footwear, and sporting goods industries; \n     and\n       Whereas, many of these child workers are subject to \n     inhumane and hazardous working conditions, including slavery, \n     debt bondage, child prostitution and sexual abuse and are \n     usually badly paid, if at all; and\n       Whereas, the International Labor Organization has developed \n     and tested a survey methodology which estimates that a total \n     of 250 million children worldwide are working: half of these \n     children between the ages of five and fourteen are working \n     full time and at least one-third are performing dangerous \n     work; and\n       Whereas, according to International Labor Organization \n     statistics, 61 percent of all working children or nearly 153 \n     million are found in Asia, 32 percent or 80 million are in \n     Africa, and 7 percent or 17.5 million live in Latin America; \n     and\n       Whereas, even though Asia has the largest total number of \n     child workers, Africa has the highest proportion of its \n     minors working--40 percent of the children between the ages \n     of 5 and 14; and\n       Whereas, although poverty is the most important reason for \n     child labor, followed by lack of schooling and illiteracy, \n     oftentimes social traditions explain the persistence of child \n     labor; and\n       Whereas, furthermore, because of different cultural and \n     economic traditions among nations, there is not a generally \n     accepted minimum age for work, and even the concept of \n     ``work'' is defined or interpreted differently among \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, for example, not all work done by children can be \n     defined as child labor: in many societies, children who work \n     along with their parents are viewed as learning to live in \n     society; and apprenticeships are seen as part of a young \n     person's education and preparation for a livelihood; and\n       Whereas, work by children clearly becomes child labor, \n     however, if the work being performed is ``harmful to [a \n     child's] physical or mental health, safety, and \n     development''; and\n       Whereas, several international organizations have made \n     eradication of child labor a priority; and\n       Whereas, in 1989, the United Nations approved the \n     Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely \n     subscribed international convention in history, which \n     includes general restrictions on child labor; and\n       Whereas, Article 32 of the Convention recognized ``the \n     right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation \n     and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous \n     or to interfere with the child's education or to be harmful \n     to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, \n     or social development''; and\n       Whereas, the International Labor Organization, has adopted \n     a number of conventions restricting the work of minors, \n     including Convention No. 138 (1973), entitled ``Minimum Age \n     for Admission to Employment,'' which sets the following \n     minimum age requirements: age 15 or not less than the age of \n     completion of compulsory schooling, if higher than 15, for \n     admission to employment of work; and age 18 for hazardous \n     work; and\n       Whereas, these age limits are written into the national \n     legislation of countries that formally agree on the Minimum \n     Age Convention; and\n       Whereas, despite these efforts, the problem of child labor \n     persists;

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to George \n     Washington's Birthday; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 543\n\n       Whereas, from 1885 when President Chester Arthur signed a \n     measure making George Washington's Birthday a federal holiday \n     until 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson approved the Monday \n     Holiday Law, the nation celebrated February 22 as the \n     birthday of a great Virginian and the ``father of his \n     country''; and\n       Whereas, since 1968 when the observance was moved from \n     February 22 to the third Monday in February, the holiday has \n     increasingly, but inaccurately, come to be called \n     ``Presidents Day''; and\n       Whereas, in line with the common misperception that \n     Congress changed the holiday from George Washington's \n     Birthday to ``Presidents Day,'' a misguided effort is under \n     way to honor both Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano \n     Roosevelt on this spurious ``Presidents Day''; and\n       Whereas, both Lincoln and Roosevelt were indisputably great \n     presidents, and it is not an insult to the memory of either \n     of them to suggest that the George Washington's Birthday \n     holiday should honor only George Washington; and\n       Whereas, it was George Washington who termed liberty \n     mankind's ``noblest cause''; it was George Washington of whom \n     Jefferson wrote, ``his name will triumph over time and will \n     in future ages assume its just station among the most \n     celebrated worthies of the world''; and it was George \n     Washington whom Light Horse Harry Lee eulogized as ``first in \n     war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his \n     countrymen''; and\n       Whereas, at any time but especially in this 200th \n     anniversary of George Washington's death at Mount Vernon, \n     rendering George Washington's Birthday but another vague, \n     generic Monday holiday is to dilute the memory of the \n     nation's first and greatest leader, with no concomitant \n     benefit to either President Lincoln or President Roosevelt; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is entirely proper that the nation annually \n     honor its first president, and the most effective manner of \n     doing so is to retain George Washington's Birthday as a \n     national holiday: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, the house of delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged (i) to \n     reemphasize to the American people that the third Monday in \n     February is to be celebrated as a national holiday called \n     George Washington's Birthday and (ii) to resist efforts to \n     degrade George Washington's Birthday into an amorphous and \n     ultimately meaningless ``Presidents Day'' holiday; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Congressional \n     Delegation of Virginia so that they may be apprised of the \n     sense of the General Assembly of Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-116.

Truman in 1950, was designed to directly \n     reimburse public school districts for the loss of traditional \n     revenue sources, such as property, sales, and personal income \n     taxes, and vehicle license fees, because of exempt property \n     due to federal presence or federal activity; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Impact Aid Program is currently funded \n     at about 45 percent of the full funding; and\n       Whereas, Virginia, home to the Navy's Third Fleet and many \n     other military installations, and personnel, is among the \n     states most impacted by the presence of the military, \n     federally impacted school divisions, schools operated by the \n     United States Government, and several schools attended \n     primarily by First Americans; and\n       Whereas, federally impacted school divisions in Virginia \n     enroll children from a variety of categories of eligible \n     students, including children who reside on Indian tribal \n     lands, military dependent children residing both on base and \n     off base, children residing in federally subsidized low-rent \n     housing units, and children whose parents are civilian \n     employees of the federal government; and\n       Whereas, federal funds received pursuant to the Federal \n     Impact Aid Program are significantly less than the average \n     cost to educate a child in Virginia, leaving a deficit that \n     the state and localities must assume; and\n       Whereas, the local and state taxpayers in Virginia are \n     subsidizing the educational services for federally connected \n     children which should be an obligation of the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, public schools make up the basic foundation of a \n     healthy society and economy; and\n       Whereas, approximately 1,600 school districts throughout \n     the United States educate about 1.4 million federally \n     connected children; and\n       Whereas, Virginia and other federally impacted states \n     should receive full funding for the educational services \n     provided federally connected children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, the house of delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to enact laws \n     to provide federal impact aid relief for Virginia public \n     schools and public schools throughout the United States; and, \n     be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the President of the United States, and the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation so that they may be apprised of the \n     sense of the General Assembly in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-117. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to patient \n     protection with respect to self-funded, employer-based health \n     plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 487\n\n       Whereas, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by the U.S. \n     Congress in 1945, established a statutory framework whereby \n     responsibility for regulating the insurance industry was left \n     largely to the states; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     (ERISA) of 1974 significantly altered this concept by \n     creating a federal framework for regulating employer-based \n     health, pension and welfare-benefit plans; and\n       Whereas, the provisions of ERISA prevent states from \n     directly regulating most employer-based health plans that are \n     not deemed to be ``insurance'' for purposes of federal laws; \n     and\n       Whereas, available data suggests that self-funding of \n     employer-based health plans is increasing at a significant \n     rate, among both large and small businesses; and\n       Whereas, between 1989 and 1993, the General Accounting \n     Office estimates that the number of self-funded plan \n     enrollees increased by about six million; and\n       Whereas, approximately 40-50 percent of the employer-based \n     health plans are presently self-funded by employers, who \n     retain\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n     most or all of the financial risk for their respective health \n     plans; and\n       Whereas, as self-funding of health plans has grown, states \n     have lost regulatory oversight of this growing portion of the \n     health insurance market; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has been slow to enact \n     meaningful patient protections such as mechanisms for the \n     recovery of benefits due plan participants, recovery of \n     compensatory damages from the fiduciary caused by its failure \n     to pay benefits due under the plan, enforcement of the plan-\n     participant's rights under the terms of the plan, assurance \n     of timely payment, and clarification of the plan-\n     participant's rights to future benefits under the terms of \n     the plan; and\n       Whereas, in the absence of federal patient protections, \n     state-level action is needed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate, the house of delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to either \n     enact meaningful patient protections at the federal level \n     with respect to employer self-funded plans or, in the absence \n     of such federal action, amend the Employment Retirement \n     Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 to grant authority to all \n     individual states to monitor and regulate self-funded, \n     employer-based health plans; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the United States \n     of House Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the President of the United States, the Secretary of \n     the United States Department of Labor, the Congressional \n     Delegation of Virginia, and to the presiding officer of each \n     house of each state's legislative body so that they may be \n     apprised of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in \n     this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-118. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to ``Know Your \n     Customer'' banking regulations and policies; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of \n     Thrift Supervision have been considering a proposed rule \n     known as the ``Know Your Customer'' regulation. Although \n     currently withdrawn from formal consideration through the \n     federal regulatory process, this proposed measure would \n     require banks and savings institutions to develop and enforce \n     programs to monitor banking transactions to identify those \n     that may be connected to certain illegal activities; and\n       Whereas, The ``Know Your Customer'' concept is a response \n     to concerns over activities such as money laundering, drug \n     trafficking, tax evasions, and fraud. The regulation places \n     an enormous burden of responsibility on banks, while ignoring \n     the fact that provisions already exist to help deal with \n     suspicious banking activities; and\n       Whereas, In addition to the proposed rule, which prompted \n     overwhelming objections during the public comment period, \n     federal banking officials already require banks to have \n     ``Know Your Customer'' guidelines and procedures in place to \n     identify suspicious activities. The Federal Reserve Bank's \n     Secrecy Act compliance manual specifies this policy and \n     directs bank examiners to look for compliance with this \n     practice; and\n       Whereas, The ``Know Your Customer'' concept represents a \n     serious threat to the privacy of law-abiding citizens. Giving \n     the banks the duty of monitoring all banking transactions--\n     without probable cause and appropriate search warrants--is a \n     clear threat and likely violation of the Fourth Amendment, \n     which states, in part, the right of the people to be secure \n     in their papers and effects against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures. The ``Know Your Customer'' concept ignores \n     constitutional protections of personal privacy; and\n       Whereas, There is legislation currently pending in Congress \n     to prohibit ``Know Your Customer'' transaction screening \n     policies. This type of legislation, to protect personal \n     privacy under the Fourth Amendment, is most appropriate. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That without \n     hindering the pursuit of money laundering, drug trafficking, \n     tax evasion, and fraud, we oppose ``Know Your Customer'' \n     banking regulations and policies and memorialize the Congress \n     of the United States to enact legislation to prohibit banking \n     transaction screening practices that threaten personal \n     privacy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the \n     Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, April 29, 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5424-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER, from the Committee on Armed Services, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 1059.

THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n REGARDING THE GUARANTEED COVERAGE OF CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES UNDER THE \n                        MEDICARE+CHOICE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Hatch) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 32\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING GUARANTEED COVERAGE OF \n                   CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICARE+CHOICE \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1972, Congress included chiropractors in the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) through the definition of the term \n     ``physician'' under section 1861(r) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395x(r)), which referred to the ``treatment by means of \n     manual manipulation of the spine (to correct a \n     subluxation)''. Congress crafted this language to identify a \n     specific chiropractic service using terminology that was \n     unique to the chiropractic profession at that time. Such \n     language shows that Congress was aware that patients required \n     direct access to chiropractic care in order to provide this \n     benefit under the medicare program.\n       (2) The traditional fee-for-service medicare program gave \n     beneficiaries direct access to doctors of chiropractic for \n     treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine to \n     correct a subluxation. The sole limitation, shared by all \n     entities and health care providers under the medicare \n     program, is the limitation outlined in section 1862(a)(1) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(1)), which \n     requires that items and services provided to medicare \n     beneficiaries be reasonable and necessary in order for \n     payment to be made for such items and services.\n       (3) Treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine \n     to correct a subluxation is uniquely chiropractic. Doctors of \n     chiropractic are the only health care providers educated and \n     trained to perform such a treatment.\n       (4) In 1982, Congress established provisions for making \n     payments to health maintenance organizations and competitive \n     medical plans under section 1876 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395mm). Such provisions directed all eligible \n     organizations with contracts\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n     under the section to provide all benefits under part B of the \n     medicare program to medicare beneficiaries enrolled with the \n     organization. In promulgating regulations to carry out the \n     section, the Health Care Financing Administration created a \n     regulatory authority for eligible organizations with \n     contracts under such section to specify which health care \n     provider would furnish medicare benefits to an individual \n     under the plan offered by the organization.\n       (5) In 1990, Congress directed the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to study the extent to which eligible \n     organizations under section 1876 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395mm) made chiropractic services available to \n     medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan offered by the \n     organization. Based on the findings of this study, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services was required to make \n     specific legislative and regulatory recommendations necessary \n     to ensure access of medicare beneficiaries to chiropractic \n     services. This study and subsequent recommendations have not \n     been forthcoming.\n       (6) Historically, medicare beneficiaries that are \n     chiropractic patients have encountered nearly total exclusion \n     from chiropractic services once they enter into a plan \n     offered by an eligible organization under section 1876 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395mm).\n       (7) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 instituted part C of \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et seq.), and section 1852(a)(1) of \n     such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(a)(1)) required each \n     Medicare+Choice plan to ``provide those items and services . \n     . .  for which benefits are available under parts A and B''.\n       (8) As a covered service under part B of the medicare \n     program, chiropractic care, which includes treatment by means \n     of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation \n     as performed by a doctor of chiropractic, is a covered \n     service under part C of the medicare program.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine \n     to correct a subluxation is a uniquely chiropractic service \n     that Congress recognized in 1972 as a benefit under the \n     medicare program under part B of title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j et seq.);\n       (2) it is the unequivocal intent of Congress to ensure that \n     every individual enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan under \n     part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-21 et seq.) has access to all covered services under \n     part B of the medicare program; and\n       (3) as a covered service under part B of the medicare \n     program, treatment by means of manual manipulation of the \n     spine to correct a subluxation provided by a doctor of \n     chiropractic is a covered service for individuals enrolled in \n     a Medicare+Choice plan under part C of the medicare program.\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Harkin, Hatch, and Grassley in submitting a concurrent \nresolution that will ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to the \nmedical care they need. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the \nMedicare+Choice program and required that all services covered under \ntraditional Medicare would also be covered in the Medicare+Choice \nprogram. Unfortunately, subsequent Medicare+Choice regulations do not \nensure that beneficiaries participating in Medicare managed care will \nbe eligible for the services provided by a chiropractor.\n  Medicare beneficiaries have access to chiropractic services under \nPart B of Medicare. Chiropractors are uniquely educated and trained to \nperform chiropractic services, such as a manual manipulation to the \nspine to correct a subluxation, a covered service under the traditional \nMedicare program. When the Medicare+Choice program was created, it was \nthe unequivocal intent of Congress to ensure that every beneficiary \nthat chooses to enroll in a Medicare+Choice program would have access \nto all services covered under Medicare Parts A and B--including \nchiropractic services.\n  Under the current Medicare+Choice regulations, managed care plans \nhave incorrectly assumed that they can limit access to chiropractic \ncare by referring patients to other types of providers. As the number \nof beneficiaries enrolling in Medicare HMOs continues to rise we must \nmake sure that beneficiaries have access to the same services that they \nare promised under traditional Medicare--and chiropractic services are \nnow exception.\n  This legislation will clarify the Congressional intent to ensure that \nall chiropractic services covered under traditional, fee-for-Medicare \nare also covered under the Medicare+Choice program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Conrad, Hatch, and Grassley, to submit this \nconcurrent resolution to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can \ncontinue to receive the medical care they need and deserve.\n  Under the traditional Medicare program, chiropractic care is a \ncovered benefit. When the Medicare+Choice program was created in the \nBalance Budget Act of 1997, it was the intent of Congress to ensure \nthat every beneficiary that chooses to enroll in a Medicare+Choice \nprogram would have access to all services covered under Medicare Parts \nA and B--including chiropractic services.\n  In addition, the Balanced Budget Act is explicit in requiring Part C \nplans to assure continuity of benefits for beneficiaries who switch \ninto these plans from the fee-for-service program. The clear intent is \nto ensure that beneficiaries who chose Part C plans have uninterrupted \naccess to the same physician practitioners.\n  Finally, the Part C provisions of the Balanced Budget Act contain \nstrong antidiscrimination language prohibiting Medicare+Choice plans \nfrom discriminating against any provider solely on the basis of his or \nher license or certification.\n  Every Medicare beneficiary ought to have access to the range of \nservices covered under the Medicare fee-for-service program. Therefore, \nas a covered service under Part B of Medicare, chiropractic care should \nbe considered a covered service under Medicare Part C.\n  Mr. President, we were disappointed to learn last year that the \nHealth Care Financing Agency's regulations for this program ignore \nCongressional intent and do not ensure that beneficiaries participating \nin Medicare managed care plans will be eligible for the services \nprovided by a chiropractor. Under their Medicare+Choice regulations, \nmanaged care plans can limit access to chiropractic care by referring \npatients to other types of providers. As seniors continue to enroll in \nMedicare HMOs, we must make sure that they have access to the same \nservices they are promised under traditional Medicare--and chiropractic \nservices are no exception.\n  This legislation will send a strong message to HCFA by clarifying \ncongressional intent to ensure that all chiropractic services covered \nunder traditional, fee-for-service Medicare are also covered under the \nMedicare+Choice program.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nresolution.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues, \nSenators Conrad, Hatch, and Harkin in support of a concurrent \nresolution establishing the Sense of Congress regarding Medicare \nbeneficiaries access to chiropractic services under the Medicare+Choice \nprogram. In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) which \nestablished the Medicare+Choice program. The BBA required that all \nbenefits covered under traditional Medicare be guaranteed under \nMedicare+Choice. However, it has come to our attention that \nchiropractic coverage is not being ensured under the regulations.\n  Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries can go to a chiropractor \nfor manual manipulation to the spine which is a covered benefit under \nPart B. Under the regulations for Medicare+Choice plans, this benefit \nis covered. However, access to chiropractors for this benefit is not \nguaranteed. Unfortunately, some Medicare+Choice plans have interpreted \nthis omission to mean they no longer need to cover chiropractic \nservices for this benefit, which is most commonly provided by \nchiropractors. The result is that beneficiaries enrolled in \nMedicare+Choice are losing access to chiropractic services, a situation \nclearly not intended by Congress.\n  The concurrent resolution I am cosponsoring today would clarify \ncongressional intent regarding guaranteed coverage to chiropractic \nservices under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare beneficiaries \nshould have the same benefits required by law under traditional fee-\nfor-service as they do under Medicare+Choice. If beneficiaries can \nreceive care for manual manipulation by a chiropractor under Part B, \nthen they should have this same right under Medicare+Choice.\n  I urge you to join me and my colleagues in support of this \nresolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5427-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5427-S5434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 356\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 254) to reduce \nviolent juvenile crime, promote accountability by rehabilitation of \njuvenile criminals, punish and deter violent gang crime, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 89, line 18, strike ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 89, line 21, add ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 89, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(H) to provide services to juveniles with serious mental \n     and emotional disturbances (SED) who are in need of mental \n     health services;\n       On page 90, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       ``(4) projects that support State and local programs to \n     prevent juvenile delinquency by providing for--\n       ``(A) assessments by qualified mental health professionals \n     of incarcerated juveniles who are suspected of being in need \n     of mental health services;\n       ``(B) the development of individualized treatment plans for \n     juveniles determined to be in need of mental health services \n     pursuant to assessments under subparagraph (A);\n       ``(C) the inclusion of discharge plans for incarcerated \n     juveniles determined to be in need of mental health services; \n     and\n       ``(D) requirements that all juveniles receiving \n     psychotropic medication be under the care of a licensed \n     mental health professional;\n       On page 90, line 8, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(5)''.\n       On page 90, line 17, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(6)''.\n       On page 91, line 1, strike ``(6)'' and insert ``(7)''.\n       On page 91, line 11, strike ``(7)'' and insert ``(8)''.\n       On page 91, line 17, strike ``(8)'' and insert ``(9)''.\n       On page 91, line 22, strike ``(9)'' and insert ``(10)''.\n       On page 92, line 6, strike ``(10)'' and insert ``(11)''.\n       On page 92, line 16, strike ``(11)'' and insert ``(12)''.\n       On page 92, line 24, strike ``(12)'' and insert ``(13)''.\n       On page 93, line 5, strike ``(13)'' and insert ``(14)''.\n       On page 93, line 13, strike ``(14)'' and insert ``(15)''.\n       On page 93, line 17, strike ``(15)'' and insert ``(16)''.\n       On page 93, line 20, strike ``(16)'' and insert ``(17)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SESSIONS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 357\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Robb) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 254, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 265, between lines 20 and 21 insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 402.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children Who Witness \n     Domestic Violence Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Witnessing domestic violence has a devastating impact \n     on children, placing the children at high risk for anxiety, \n     depression, and, potentially, suicide. Many children who \n     witness domestic violence exhibit more aggressive, \n     antisocial, fearful, and inhibited behaviors.\n       (2) Children exposed to domestic violence have a high risk \n     of experiencing learning difficulties and school failure. \n     Research finds that children residing in domestic violence \n     shelters exhibit significantly lower verbal and quantitative \n     skills when compared to a national sample of children.\n       (3) Domestic violence is strongly correlated with child \n     abuse. Studies have found that between 50 and 70 percent of \n     men who abuse their female partners also abuse their \n     children. In homes in which domestic violence occurs, \n     children are physically abused and neglected at a rate 15 \n     times higher than the national average.\n       (4) Men who witness parental abuse during their childhood \n     have a higher risk of becoming physically aggressive in \n     dating and marital relationships.\n       (5) Exposure to domestic violence is a strong predictor of \n     violent delinquent behavior among adolescents. It is \n     estimated that between 20 percent and 40 percent of \n     chronically violent adolescents have witnessed extreme \n     parental conflict.\n       (6) Women have an increased risk of experiencing battering \n     after separation from an abusive partner. Children also have \n     an increased risk of suffering harm during separation.\n       (7) Child visitation disputes are more frequent when \n     families have histories of domestic violence, and the need \n     for supervised visitation centers far exceeds the number of \n     available programs providing those centers, because courts \n     therefore--\n       (A) order unsupervised visitation and endanger parents and \n     children; or\n       (B) prohibit visitation altogether.\n\n     SEC. ____3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Domestic violence.--The term ``domestic violence'' \n     includes an act or threat of violence, not including an act \n     of self defense, committed by a current or former spouse of \n     the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child \n     in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has \n     cohabited with the victim, by a person who is or has been in \n     a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with \n     the victim, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the \n     victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the \n     jurisdiction of the victim, or by any other person against a \n     victim who is protected from that person's act under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction.\n       (2) Indian tribal government.--The term ``Indian tribal \n     government'' has the meaning given the term ``tribal \n     organization'' in section 102 of the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 3002).\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands.\n       (4) Witness domestic violence.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``witness domestic violence'' \n     means to witness--\n       (i) an act of domestic violence that constitutes actual or \n     attempted physical assault; or\n       (ii) a threat or other action that places the victim in \n     fear of domestic violence.\n       (B) Witness.--In subparagraph (A), the term ``witness'' \n     means to--\n       (i) directly observe an act, threat, or action described in \n     subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, threat, or \n     action; or\n       (ii) be within earshot of an act, threat, or action \n     described in subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, \n     threat, or action.\n\n     SEC. ____4.

It was a difficult time for the workers, and \nfor managers like Ken who struggled to keep his plant efficient while \norders dwindled. Through it all, Ken was dedicated to developing \nsolutions that met the needs of his customers, and on maintaining a \ncommitment to quality that meant that Burlington-made products were \nsecond to none. His commitment to quality earned his business numerous \nawards that are widely recognized across the defense industry.\n  On behalf of his many friends in the Burlington area, I want to \nexpress my thanks to Ken and his family and wish him the very best as \nhe embarks on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/17/senate-section/article/S5435-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO FILE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
