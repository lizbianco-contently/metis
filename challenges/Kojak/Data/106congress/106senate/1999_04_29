Mr. President, it is an honor for me this morning to have in \nthe Senate Chamber both of my ministers--of course, the Chaplain of the \nSenate, Lloyd Ogilvie, and the individual who gave our prayer this \nmorning, who is Thomas Erickson, minister of the Valley Presbyterian \nChurch in Scottsdale, AZ. This is the church in which I am a member in \nmy home State of Arizona. His wife Carol joins him today in the \nNation's Capital, and as I said, it is my honor to be with them today \nand certainly an honor for my church to have its minister deliver the \nopening of the Senate.\n  Valley Presbyterian Church is a dynamic congregation of some 2,400 \nmembers and growing. Reverend Erickson has been with the church now for \nalmost 13 years.\n  Mr. President, you perhaps noticed that as he was delivering the \nmorning prayer, if you closed your eyes just a little bit, it almost \nsounded like our Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie. I frequently do that when I \nam in church here or I am in the Senate Chamber. I close my eyes and I \ncan almost hear the other speaking, because they have the same resonant \nvoice, especially when delivering a prayer.\n  So I am honored, as I said, to be able to present Dr. Erickson to my \nfellow Senators this morning and all of those who observed the morning \nprayer on television.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4405-6", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4405-S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        Y2K ACT--CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  To begin the hour of debate that we have on the Y2K measure, I would \nlike to discuss the agreement entered into late yesterday, the special \neffort that was led by Senator Dodd of Connecticut. Senator Dodd has \nbeen the leader on our side on the Y2K issue. The agreement that was \nentered into last night involved Senator McCain, myself, Chairman \nHatch, Senator Feinstein, Chairman Bennett; a number of colleagues were \ninvolved. It seems to me that this effort, which was led by Senator \nDodd, has directly responded to a number of the concerns outlined by \nthe White House in the statement that was delivered yesterday to the \nSenate. I would like to briefly outline the proposals which are going \nto be offered by the Senator from Connecticut in conjunction with the \ngroup of us that has been working on a bipartisan basis for this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  Under the changes made yesterday, there would be punitive damage caps \nfor small businesses. We ensure that there is fairness to both sides. \nWe would eliminate punitive damage caps for the large businesses, those \nover 50 employees. We would protect municipalities and governmental \nentities from punitive damages. And we would also ensure that State \nevidentiary standards for claims involving fraud were kept in place.\n  The legislation would continue to do the following. There would have \nto be a 30-day notice. The plaintiff would have to submit a 30-day \nnotice to the defendant on the plaintiff's intentions to sue, with a \ndescription of the Y2K problem. If the defendant responded with a plan \nto remediate, then an additional 60 days would be allowed to resolve \nthe problem. If the defendant didn't agree to fix the problem, the \nplaintiff would be in a position to sue on the 31st day. We would \nestablish--and this was of great concern to a number of Members of the \nSenate--liability proportionality. We would ensure that defendants \ndon't pay more than the damage they are responsible for but exceptions \nwould include plaintiffs with a modest net worth who were not able to \ncollect from one or more defendants and defendants who had \nintentionally injured plaintiffs.\n  I think this is especially important because, clearly, if you have a \ndefendant who has engaged in intentionally abusive conduct, you want to \nsend the strongest possible message, and we do establish liability \nproportionality under the agreement led by Senator Dodd.\n  We would also preserve contract rights so as to not interfere with \nparties who have already agreed on Y2K terms and conditions. We would \nalso confirm the duty to mitigate. This is an effort to essentially \nconfirm existing law that plaintiffs have to limit damages and can't \ncollect damages that could have been avoided. This is an opportunity \nfor potential defendants to provide widespread information on Y2K \nsolutions to assist potential plaintiffs.\n  Finally, our proposal would encourage alternative dispute resolution, \nand it also keeps, as a number of Democrats have discussed with us, all \npersonal injury and wrongful death claims with every opportunity to use \nexisting law to ensure protection for the consumer and for injured \nparties.\n  I commend my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. He is the \nDemocratic leader on the Y2K issue. Let me also say that what Senator \nDodd has done, in conjunction with myself and Senator McCain, is he has \nessentially taken a lot of what we have done in the securities \nlitigation area, a lot of what we have done in the earlier Y2K \nlegislation, and used that as a model. So Senator Dodd's proposal, in \nmy view, is very constructive. We now have an agreement that has been \nentered into by Senator Dodd, Chairman McCain, myself, Chairman Hatch, \nwho has been exceptionally helpful on this effort, our colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Bennett, who chairs the Y2K \ncommittee.\n  So I am very pleased about this effort that was entered into late \nyesterday. I say to my colleagues--especially Democrats who were \nconcerned about the statement issued earlier by the White House--this \ncompromise effort that I have outlined--and we also issued a statement \non it--responds directly to a number of the concerns that were outlined \nby the White House, especially the two perhaps most important, which \nare protection for injured parties as it relates to the opportunity to \nseek punitive damages where appropriate, and also to ensure that with \nrespect to evidentiary standards, no one could say that this was now \nraising somehow for all time a change through Federal law. We \nspecifically preserve State evidentiary standards for important claims \ninvolving fraud.\n  But I would say, Mr. President and colleagues, this legislation is \nnot going to be a change for all time in our laws. It is essentially a \nbill, and it has a strong sunset provision that is going to last for 3 \nyears or so. We are trying to make sure, through that sunset provision, \nthat we deal just with those concerns raised by Y2K. Y2K is not a \npartisan issue. It affects every computer system that uses date \ninformation. It was essentially an engineering tradeoff which brought \nus to this predicament; to get more space on a disk and in memory, the \nidea of century indicators was abandoned. It is hard for us to believe \ntoday that disk and memory space at a premium, but it was at one time. \nSo in an effort to try to make sure during those earlier days there \nwere standards by which programs and systems could exchange \ninformation, there was this engineering tradeoff.\n  Now, some say you could just solve the Y2K problem by dumping all the \nold layers of computer code accumulated over the last few decades. That \nis not realistic. So what we ought to be trying to do is to make sure \nthat information technology systems are brought into Y2K compliance as \nsoon as possible. That is what the substitute that Senator McCain and I \nhave offered seeks to do, and I believe that substitute has been vastly \nimproved now by the leadership of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd.\n  I think as this discussion goes forward in the next hour, it is also \nimportant to recognize just how dramatic the implications are for this \nissue. I would like to cite one example which I know a number of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side can identify with very easily. A lot \nof my colleagues, led by Senator Kennedy, have been very concerned \nabout making sure that there is a good prescription drug benefit for \nseniors under Medicare. It is the view of a lot of us that billions of \ndollars are wasted. Billions of dollars are wasted every single year as \na result of seniors not taking prescriptions in a way so as to limit \nsome adverse interaction. We waste billions of dollars and millions of \nseniors suffer as a result of not taking these prescriptions properly. \nAnd the best single antidotes that we have today are some of the new \nonline computer systems which keep track of seniors' prescriptions and \nare in a position to help limit these adverse drug interactions.\n\n  Well, the fact of the matter is, if we have, next January, chaos in \nthe marketplace with our pharmacies and our health care systems and \nprograms that help us limit these problems involving drug interactions, \nwe are going to waste billions of dollars which could be used to get \nsenior citizens decent prescription drug benefits, and we are going to \nhurt older people needlessly.\n  Now, that has been a problem documented by the General Accounting \nOffice. I raise it primarily because there has been a discussion in the \nSenate about how this legislation is just sort of a high-tech bill, and \nmaybe some folks care about it in the State of Oregon where we care \npassionately about technology, or Silicon Valley, or another part of \nthe country. I think we all know that technology is important in every \nState in our Nation. But I think it is very clear that these issues \ndramatically affect our entire Nation. It doesn't just involve a \nhandful of high-tech companies; it involves millions and millions of \nAmericans. The reason I have taken the Senate's time to discuss \nparticularly how this would affect older people with their prescription \ndrugs is that I think this is just a microcosm of this debate. I think \nthis is just one small example of what this discussion is all about.\n  Now, the Congressional Budget Office and other experts have estimated \nthat Y2K-related litigation could cost consumers and businesses twice \nas much as fixing the Y2K problem itself. Now, I think those \npredictions may, in fact, be exaggerated; maybe they are wildly \nexaggerated. But I would much prefer to see the Senate craft \nresponsible legislation now rather than to delay. And should the Senate \nnot act on this legislation in an expeditious way, I believe there is a \nvery real possibility that the Senate could be back here in January \nhaving a special session to deal with this issue.\n  So I am very hopeful that we can go forward on it. I know that the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, has worked very hard to be fair and \nto ensure that there is opportunity for colleagues to raise amendments. \nHe has been working closely with the majority leader, Senator Lott. \nThose procedural issues are still to be resolved.\n  I happen to agree with Senator Kennedy on this matter of raising the \nminimum wage. I think he is absolutely correct that we ought to raise \nthe minimum wage. But I am very hopeful that we will not see these \nissues pitted against each other. It is extremely important to raise \nthe minimum wage. I\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nalso think it is extremely important to deal with this Y2K issue in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  I know there are other Members of the Senate who wish to speak on \nthis issue. They haven't arrived on the floor quite yet. I think I will \njust take an additional couple of minutes, as we await them, to outline \nsome of the changes that have been made since the legislation left the \nCommerce Committee. At that time, regrettably, it was a partisan bill \nand did not yet have the constructive changes made by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, and did not at that point include the eight \nmajor changes that Chairman McCain and I negotiated. I would like to \nwrap up my initial comments by taking a minute or two to talk about \nthose changes that have been made in the legislation. For example, Mr. \nPresident and colleagues, early on none of the bills had a sunset \nprovision in the legislation. There was a great concern that somehow \nsome change in tort law and contract law would be for all time, \nestablishing new Federal standards in this area. It was a feeling on my \npart and upon the part of other colleagues that it was absolutely \ncritical to have a sunset provision to ensure that we were talking just \nabout problems relating to the Y2K and not creating massive changes in \nFederal tort law or contract law that would last for all time.\n\n  None of the original bills contained a sunset date. We now have a 3-\nyear sunset date making it very clear that any Y2K failure must occur \nbefore January 1, 2003, in order to be eligible to be covered by the \nlegislation. Most industry analysts agree that Y2K failures are likely \nto follow a bell curve, a peaking on approximately January 1, 2000, and \ntrailing off in 1 to 3 years. The sunset date that has been added \ntracks the very best professional analysis we have about the problem.\n  I thank Chairman McCain for adding that in our initial negotiations. \nIt is extremely important to me. I felt a lot of the Members of the \nSenate on the Democratic side felt that it was critical that this be a \nset of changes that was limited to a short period of time. That 3-year \nsunset addition, I think, sends a very powerful message that this is \nnot changing tort and contract law for all time. I am very pleased that \nit has been added.\n  Second, in the committee there were some vague, essentially new \nFederal defenses that I and others felt unfairly biased this process in \nfavor of the defendant. Those were removed. Essentially what those \noriginal provisions said was that if defendants engaged in what was \ncalled a ``reasonable effort'' that they would be protected advocates. \nConsumers felt strongly that this language was mushy and vague.\n  I agree completely with them on it. In fact, we originally had it in \ncommittee, and I opposed it at that time. But at the request of the \nconsumer groups, this mushy, vague language that protects defendants \nwho engaged in something called a ``reasonable effort'' was dropped.\n  We also made changes to keep the principle of joint liability. After \nthe legislation left the committee, we thought it was important to make \nsure that for cases involving fraud and egregious conduct we kept the \ntraditional principle of joint and several liability. It was also \nextended to involve insolvent defendants.\n  Senator Dodd has continued to help us in this area to ensure there is \nfairness for injured parties while at the same time making it clear \nthat the defendants don't pay more than the damage for which they are \nresponsible.\n  The legislation continues to have in place what we negotiated after \nthe legislation left the committee. This is incorporated into the \nannouncements we made last night about the important efforts made by \nSenator Dodd.\n  Finally, we thought it was important to make sure contract rights \nwere paramount in this area. This legislation does not involve any \nchanges whatever in personal injury rights. If, for example, an \nindividual is in an elevator and that elevator falls 10 floors to the \nbottom of a building, and that individual is tragically injured, or \ndies, all of the personal injury remedies are kept in place. That is \nnot something that would be affected by this legislation. This \nlegislation involves contractual rights between private business \nparties. I and others felt that it was not adequately laid out in the \ncommittee legislation, that the contract rights were paramount in this \narea. As a result of the negotiations we had after the legislation left \nthe committee, those rights were kept in place. I and others felt that \nwas essential.\n  I see my good friend from the State of Connecticut on the floor. I am \ngoing to yield in just one second. But first I want to take a minute \nand tell him how much I appreciate what he has done. He is, of course, \nthe Democratic leader on the Y2K issue.\n\n  I am essentially still a rookie in the Senate, and the Senator from \nConnecticut has been so helpful as we have tried to take this \nlegislation that passed the committee unfortunately on a partisan vote \nand tried to make it responsive to the many legitimate issues that have \nbeen raised by our colleagues on this side of the aisle. The colleagues \non this side of the aisle have been absolutely right about saying that \nthe original bill was not adequate with respect to punitive damages. It \nwasn't adequate with respect to evidentiary standards. It didn't do \nenough to address the issues that we heard about from the White House \nlate yesterday.\n  As a result of an agreement led by the Senator from Connecticut, we \nhave been responsive to those issues. We have essentially had nine \nmajor changes made after the bill came out of committee. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut has led the bipartisan effort. I discussed that \nbipartisan effort earlier involving Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, \nand Senator Bennett.\n  I want to yield the floor now to the Senator from Connecticut, and \nthank him for all he has done to make this a bill that I believe can \nget the support of a significant number of Democrats, because it \nresponds to what we heard from the White House. I thank him as well \npersonally for all of the good counsel and help that he has given me. \nHe is the leader on this issue. He is the one who navigated the \nsecurities litigation legislation. I pointed out how he took much of \nwhat the Senate learned on the securities litigation in the earlier Y2K \nbill and made that part of his compromise. I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I look forward to hearing from the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Let me begin by thanking our colleague from Oregon. He is very \neffusive and gracious in his compliments. He describes himself as a \nrookie. But he is anything than a rookie when it comes to the \nlegislative process. He served with great distinction in the other \nbody, and has been here now several years proving the value of his \nexperience as a seasoned legislator in the Senate.\n  Let me just say I am very hopeful. I was very pleased yesterday that \nwe were able to reach an agreement on three proposals that I felt, and \nmany others felt, were essential if this Y2K litigation legislation was \ngoing to succeed. One of these proposals was to deal with the punitive \ndamages cap issue with the exception of municipalities, government \nentities, and smaller businesses, which are described as businesses \nthat employ 50 people or less. This number is more than the 25 \nemployees which usually defines a small business. I realize that one \nmight make a very strong case that even more than 50 employees would \nstill constitute a small business. But with a country that is growing \nall the time, I think most of us would agree that a small business \ntoday would still be one that employed 50 people or less.\n  We also eliminated the caps on the director and officer liability \nbecause under the disclosure bill passed last year we crafted a safe \nharbor for forward-looking statements by directors and officers and \nmanagers. We felt that this safe harbor would suffice, along with the \nnormal business judgment rule which protects managers to some degree. \nAs a result, we didn't think a cap on director and officer liability \nwas necessary.\n  I am pleased that Senator McCain and Senator Hatch, as well as my \ngood colleague and friend, Senator Bennett--who really has been the \nleader on the Y2K issue for so many years--agreed with both of those \nprovisions, as well as with the state of mind provisions. It gets \nrather arcane when you\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nstart talking about some of these legal terms, but they are important \nmatters.\n  What we are doing with the claims involving state of mind is leaving \nthe status quo with respect to the evidentiary standard. That is, each \nState determines what that standard is, instead of having a national \nstandard. There was some effort to have clear and convincing evidence \nbe used as the evidentiary standard you would have to reach, but 34 \nStates already have that standard. Many other States do not have that \nstandard, so we thought the best result on a compromise was to leave it \nto the States to decide what that standard ought to be, rather than \nincorporating it in this bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator McCain, Senator Hatch, Senator Bennett, and \nothers who have agreed to and supported these changes.\n  As I understand it, there are other outstanding issues. The Senator \nfrom Oregon is absolutely correct. There are colleagues who have other \namendments. They would not support this bill even with these additions. \nI know Senator Kerry of Massachusetts has a strong interest in \nproportional liability issues. I am confident that Senator Hollings and \nSenator Edwards have some suggestions they might want to make to this \nbill.\n  My hope is that our leaders can work this out. I know Senator Daschle \nis more than prepared to sit down and work with our distinguished \nmajority leader to allow for a series of amendments to be considered, \nas we normally do here, on this bill and to allow them to come up, to \ndebate them, to vote on them, and to try and get this bill completed. I \nthink we could complete it by this weekend, by tomorrow, if we began to \nwork.\n  I do not know what the schedule is. There may be other matters that \nare more pressing in the minds of the leadership. But it seems to me \nnow that agreeing on a package of amendments that can be offered is the \nway to go. We are going to have a cloture vote here shortly. I am going \nto oppose invoking cloture because we have not yet agreed on a process \nand I do not want to deny an opportunity to any of my colleagues. I \nknow there may be some on the majority side who do not yet agree with \nthis bill. There are several who have strong reservations about this \nbill even with the additions we have made to it by this agreement, and \nthey may have some amendments they may want to offer. That is how we do \nbusiness in the Senate. The Presiding Officer knows of what I speak. We \nboth served in the other body, the House of Representatives, where you \nhave strict rules and whoever is in the majority controls this exactly, \ndetermining if any amendments are to be considered.\n  In the Senate we are a different institution. Here we allow the free \nflow of debate and we do not deny Members the opportunity to bring up \nissues that they believe are critically important, even issues that are \nnot germane to the matter before us. Although we do not encourage that \nin every instance, that can be done here. That is what makes the Senate \nof the United States different from the Chamber down the hall. We are, \nin a sense, counterweights to each other. In the House of \nRepresentatives the rule of the majority prevails, as it should. In a \nsense, in the Senate we protect the rights of a minority to be heard.\n  That is what we are hoping the leaders will allow to happen today. We \nhope an agreement is reached on a series of amendments that will allow \nthem to be debated and discussed and voted on. If that is the case, I \nam very confident that we will be able to pass this important piece of \nlegislation and send it to the House, where they are considering \nsimilar legislation. I am also very confident that we can secure a \nsignature from the President, who I know cares very much about this \nissue, as does the Vice President, and we can accomplish what many have \nsought here--to protect against the dangers of massive litigation over \nthis year 2000 computer bug which is looming on the horizon.\n\n  Two hundred and forty days from now, when the millenium clock turns, \nI do not think that any of us here wants to be looking back and saying \nwe lost an opportunity here in April to try to at least limit the kind \nof financial hardship and economic disruption that could occur if we do \nnot address the threat of a Y2K litigation explosion. So I am very \nhopeful that we can come together, as we have already come so far.\n  Again, I express my thanks to the chairman of the committee who has \nthe thankless job of trying to move a complicated bill along. Senator \nHatch has also been tremendously helpful and supportive on this. Again, \nSenator Bennett of Utah, with whom I work on the Y2K committee, has \ndone just an astounding job, I think, of bringing to the attention of \nall of us here, as well as to the people across this country, the \nimportance of this issue. And, of course, the efforts of the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon and Senator Feinstein of California. \nMy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, who cares very much \nabout litigation reform issues generally, has also been very helpful on \nthis. I fear I am leaving some people out here. I hope I am not. But at \nthis juncture I know these are people who have been involved in this \nissue and care about it. Again, my plea to the majority leader, and I \nknow Senator Daschle cares about this, too, is to see if we can now \ncome to some agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The time of the proponents has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I do.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be brief. I concur completely with what the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has said. I want to ask him one question about the \nvery helpful punitive damages agreement he negotiated with us last \nnight.\n  My understanding is, this agreement tracks very closely with what the \nClinton administration has agreed to in the past with respect to \nproduct liability. In fact, our agreement seems to be more generous to \nplaintiffs than what the administration has agreed to in the past.\n  In the past, they seemed to have said we ought to look at something \nthat would have two times compensatory damages. This legislation has \nthree times the damages, to make sure there is a fair shake for the \nconsumer. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Connecticut? I \nask because he has been involved in this issue involving punitive \ndamage questions for quite some time. I think he has been very fair to \nplaintiffs in this area. It seems to me, actually, the Senator has gone \nbeyond what has been talked about in various other discussions that we \nhad.\n  In just this minute I would like to take one more moment to hear the \nSenator's opinion on that issue which is a key issue for Democrats.\n  Mr. DODD. I think I ought to ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague--and I thank him for raising \nthe issue--I do not claim great expertise in the product liability \narea. We have done some work, and I appreciate his comments, on the \nsecurities bill, the standards reform bill, and here on the Y2K area. \nSo going back and revisiting this, while I do not recall the point the \nSenator raises, I do not question what he has said. I presume, in fact, \nthat he is correct. I simply do not bring any personal recollection of \nhow we crafted that.\n  I know the administration cares about the Y2K issue. I negotiated \nwith the White House on securities litigation, and there were some \ndifficult issues to resolve. The Senator may recall that in that case \nthe President vetoed the bill and the Congress overrode the veto. That \nis how that piece of legislation became law.\n\n  On uniform standards, President Clinton and Vice President Gore were \ntremendously helpful and supportive, and I suspect they will be here as \nwell. I want to be careful. I think it is fine to go back and use \nprevious examples on punitive damages and on director and officer \nliability and on state of mind issues. However, there are differences \nin the application of law when you are dealing with bodily injury and \nother questions where product liability issues can come in, and even \nmore differences when contract law comes into play. Contract law is \nbasically what we are talking about here.\n  Let me just say this, because the Senator has raised a very important \npoint. I know there are going to be\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nMembers--there always are--who think that we are going too far in the \npunitive damage area and with director and officer liability, and who \nthink we are giving away too much. I think there are people who care \nabout the trial bar and think we have not done enough in this area and \nthat there is too much here against the trial bar.\n  This bill really does provide a balance at this point. We have not \nadopted this amendment, but on the assumption it is adopted, we have \nremoved the caps on punitive damages in most instances, removed the \ncaps on director and officer liability, and kept the status quo on \nstate of mind issues. Those are issues the trial bar said were very \nimportant to them.\n  Is it everything they want? No. Does it give away more than some who \ncare about these issues want? It does. But traditionally, when you are \ntrying to craft a piece of legislation with as many different points of \nview as 100 Senators can bring to the debate, clearly no side is going \nto prevail with everything it would like. What we have done here, I \nthink, is struck a sound, good balance that is a good bill and one I \nhope will attract the broad support of Republicans and Democrats, and \nto move on.\n  I see the chairman of the committee has arrived on the floor here. In \nhis absence I was praising him. I would do so in his presence as well, \nbut I realize he may want to go on to other matters here. I have \nalready been taking advantage of the Presiding Officer's presence here \nby extending the time by unanimous consent, and I do not want to abuse \nthe graciousness he has already demonstrated to me any more than that, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, I thank him for all of his efforts. We have engaged in \nintensive and sometimes emotional negotiation, and we have had a long \nrelationship for many years. His contribution, no matter how this \ncloture vote comes out today, has been critical in moving this process \nforward. It has given me optimism that we will be able to resolve this \nissue. Without his involvement, we would not have the opportunities \nthat I believe we will have in the future.\n  In my prepared statement, which I will make in just a minute, this \nissue is too important to just go away. I think the Senator from \nConnecticut knows that and the Senator from Oregon, who has played such \na critical role, along with Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, and \nothers on this issue, know that. It is not going to go away.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut has done and the Senator from \nOregon has done is move this process forward to where I believe we will \nbe able to get it done, because it is too important for us to just say \nwe cannot agree on it. I thank both my colleagues for all their \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, we are now at a critical time if we are to pass this \nbill. We have been attempting to debate and act on this matter for a \nweek. We are about to have our second cloture vote as we crawl through \nthe morass of Senate procedure. We have endured hours of quorum calls \nwaiting for substantive discussion. We have heard at length the views \nof the ranking member, Senator Hollings, in opposition to this bill. We \nhave detoured from the bill to hear the minority's complaints about \nscheduling unrelated matters of interest to them. But now, Mr. \nPresident, we are about to have a critical vote.\n  This is a vote to allow us to complete action on this critical bill. \nThis is a vote to cast aside the partisan procedural games and get on \nwith the business of the nation. Important business, as the thousands \nof CEO's and business people from all segments of industry: high tech, \naccounting, insurance, retail, wholesale, large and small, who are \nactively supporting this bill will attest. The Y2K problem is not going \naway, nor is it going to be postponed by petty, partisan procedural \nwrangling.\n  The cost of solving the Y2K problem is staggering. Experts have \nestimated that the businesses in the United States alone will spend $50 \nbillion in fixing affected computers, products and systems. But experts \nhave also predicted that the potential litigation costs could reach $1 \ntrillion--more than the legal costs associated with asbestos, breast \nimplants, tobacco, and Superfund litigation combined--more than three \ntimes the total annual estimated cost of all civil litigation in the \nUnited States. This is not just my opinion, but are facts supported by \na panel of experts on an American Bar Association panel last August. \nThese costs represent resources and energy that will not be directed \ntoward innovation, new technology, or new productivity for our nation's \neconomy. This litigation could overwhelm and paralyze the industries \ndriving the best economy in our history.\n  The Y2K phenomenon, while anticipated for years, presents \nnevertheless, a one-time, unique problem. Our legal system is neither \ndesigned, nor adequately equipped, to handle the flood of litigation \nwhich we can expect when law firms across the country are laying in \nwait, in eager anticipation of a golden opportunity. More to the point, \nthe vast majority of our Nation's citizens do not want to sue. They \nwant their computers, their equipment, their systems to work. They want \nsolutions to problems, and a healthy economy, not a trial lawyers' full \nemployment act.\n\n  S. 96 presents a solution, a reasonable practical, balanced, and most \nimportant, bi-partisan solution. Since it passed out of committee, with \nthe help of my colleagues especially Senator Wyden, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Feinstein, and others it has been improved, narrowed, and more \ncarefully crafted to ensure a fair and practical result to the Y2K \nsituation.\n  The Public Policy Institute of the Democratic Leadership Council \npublished a Y2K background paper in March which has been widely \ncirculated and quoted on the Senate floor in the past several days. The \nauthors state:\n\n       In order to diminish the threat of burdensome and \n     unwarranted litigation, it is essential that any legislation \n     addressing Y2K liability:\n       Encourage remediation over litigation and the assignment of \n     blame;\n       Enact fair rules that reassure businesses that honest \n     efforts at remediation will be rewarded by limiting \n     liability, while enforcing contracts and punishing \n     negligence;\n       Promote Alternative Dispute Resolution; and\n       Discourage frivolous lawsuits while protecting avenues of \n     redress for parties that suffer real injuries.\n\n  S. 96 does all of those things.\n  It provides time for plaintiffs and defendants to resolve Y2K \nproblems without litigation;\n  It reiterates the plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages, and \nhighlights the defendant's opportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing \nthat by providing information and resources;\n  It provides for proportional liability in most cases, with exceptions \nfor fraudulent or intentional conduct, or where the plaintiff has \nlimited assets;\n  It protects governmental entities including municipalities, school, \nfire, water and sanitation districts from punitive damages;\n  It eliminates punitive damage limits for egregious conduct, while \nproviding some protection against runaway punitive damage awards; and\n  It provides protection for those not directly involved in a Y2K \nfailure;\n  It is a temporary measure. It sunsets January 1, 2003;\n  And it does not deny the right of anyone to redress their legitimate \ngrievances in court.\n  I have spent hours working with several of my colleagues, including \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, to resolve \nspecific concerns. We have arrived at an agreement to further modify \nthe substitute amendment my friend Mr. Wyden and I earlier agreed upon. \nThere may still be others, such as Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, with \nideas, suggestions, or a different perspective on solving the problem.\n  I welcome hearing other ideas. My colleagues may want to offer \namendments. I am willing to enter into consent agreements to allow the \nopportunity for debate on other ideas. We can then vote and the best \nidea will win. That is the way of the Senate. But, that cannot take \nplace unless we vote yes now on cloture.\n  The clock is ticking. Mr. President, 246 days plus a few hours remain \nuntil\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nJanuary 1. This bill cannot wait. Its purpose is to provide incentives \nfor proaction--to encourage remediation and solution and to prevent Y2K \nproblems from occurring. It will not serve its purpose unless it passes \nnow.\n  This vote is a simple vote. It is a critical vote. This is a vote as \nto whether we want to solve and prevent the Y2K litigation problem, \nwhich has already begun, or whether we will let partisan ``politics as \nusual'' be an obstacle to our nation's well-being. It is a vote to \neither help the American economy or to show your willingness to do the \nbidding of the Trial Lawyers Association. Make no mistake, I hope \ncompanies across America are paying attention. Senators will vote to \nhelp protect small and large business, the high tech industry, and \nothers, or they will choose to protect the trial lawyers' stream of \nincome. That is the choice. I ask my colleagues to consider carefully \nthe message they send with their vote today. Are you part of the \nsolution? Or part of the problem?\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time for the vote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 22 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have a cloture vote set at a specific \ntime; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion vote was scheduled to occur \nat the end of 1 hour of debate. We have had unanimous consent \nagreements extending the time. There are 22 minutes remaining in the \ndebate. This time is under the control of the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield whatever time the Senator needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will address the question of the Y2K for \njust a moment, if I may, and then I was going to ask unanimous consent \njust to make a couple comments as in morning business for the purpose \nof introducing a bill.\n  Prior to doing that--do I understand the Senator from Arizona would \nobject to that taking place at this point?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would object to going to morning business at this time. \nThe Senator from South Carolina has 22 minutes left, and I am glad to \nlisten on that time, but it is getting time for us to vote on cloture.\n  Mr. KERRY. All right.\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few words on the issue of the Y2K. I \nhave been working quietly with a number of colleagues in order to try \nto see if we cannot come to some sort of compromise.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona assert that the principal reason \nthat we are where we are right now is because the revenue stream for \nlawyers, for trial counsel, might be somehow impacted, and that is the \nsort of overbearing consideration that has brought us to this point of \nimpasse. Let me just say as directly and as forcefully as I possibly \ncan that there really are public policy considerations that extend \nbeyond that.\n  I have tried cases previously as a trial attorney. I understand the \nmotivations and needs to certainly have a client base which allows you \nto survive. I have seen some ugly practices out there, and I have \njoined in condemning them as a Member of the Senate and also as a \nmember of the bar.\n  I do not think any of us who are members of the bar take pride in the \npractices of some attorneys who have obviously given the profession a \nbad name at times and have abused what ought to be a more respected and \nsacrosanct relationship in the country.\n\n  But at the same time, just as with any business--whether it is Wall \nStreet and brokers or businesspeople who are manufacturers who somehow \nput a product on the marketplace that cost lives--there are always \nexceptions to fundamental rules. There are also a lot of lawyers out \nthere who work for nothing, who do pro bono work, who give their \nenergies to fighting for the environment or for civil rights or a whole \nlot of other things. I think it is a mistake to sweep everybody into \none basket and suggest that that is all this issue is about.\n  We have some time-honored traditions in this country about access to \nour court system. We have some deep-rooted principles which allow \nvictims of certain kinds of abuses, and sometimes even arrogance, to be \nable to get redress for that. That is one of the beauties of the \nAmerican judicial system. And I could show--and I do not have time \nnow--countless examples of life being made better for millions of \nAmericans because some lawyer took a case to court and was willing to \nfight for a particular principle.\n  I happened to bump into Ralph Nader a little while ago going into a \nBanking hearing related to an issue on privacy on the House side. I \nrecall, obviously, his landmark efforts with respect to automobiles and \nsafety, and millions of American lives have been saved because of those \nkinds of challenges.\n  Sometimes the pendulum sweeps too far, and I well recognize that. In \nfact, there is a great tendency within the Congress for us to react to \na particular problem, and, kaboom, we wind up with unintended \nconsequences, and then we sort of have to pull the pendulum back. I \nhave done that.\n  I have joined with colleagues here to change the law on liability \nwith respect to aircraft manufacturing because we found that there was \na particular problem for small, light plane manufacturing in the \ncountry. We also changed the law with respect to securities reform, and \nI joined in that effort. And I joined in overriding the veto of a \nPresident with respect to those things because I thought the reform was \nimportant and legitimate. No one here ought to condone the capacity of \nindividual lawyers to simply trigger a lawsuit with the hopes of \nwalking into a company and then holding them up for settlement because \nit is too expensive to litigate.\n  I believe that in the compromise we have on the table, as well as in \nother efforts that have been offered, there are legitimate restraints \non the capacity of lawyers to abuse the system. There are increased \nspecificity requirements with respect to the pleadings so that you \ncannot just go in on a fishing expedition. There is a 90-day period for \ncure; i.e., once a company is noticed that they are in fact in a \nparticular possible breach with respect to the contract that extends \nfor the sale of a particular computer or software program, they are \ngiven 90 days within which time they can cure the problem and there is \nno lawsuit. In addition to that, there are a series of other restraints \nwhich I think are entirely appropriate, and I would vote for those.\n  Let's say somebody's mother or father is at home and you have a bank \naccount and a bank loses your entire bank account, for whatever reason, \nor there is some doctor's appointment that is lost by somebody that was \ncritical to the provision of some serum or antibiotic. Who knows what \nmight be occurring that has been computerized and expected on a \nparticular schedule that might be affected. There is a requirement in \ntheir legislation, the legislation currently about to be voted on, \nwhich would deny any consumer access to remedy for 90 days.\n\n  You get a 90-day stay period. What is the rationale for that? That \nwas supposed to apply to the companies, not to individuals. But we \ndon't have a legitimate carve-out for consumers, for the average \nconsumer, for Joe ``Six-Pack'' who might be affected by this. They are \nsomehow going to be plunked into a basket with all of the other \ncompanies.\n  In addition to that, there is a legitimate problem with respect to \naccess to the system. If you have a company that does business abroad, \ndoes not have a home base here, you have no capacity to reach them with \nrespect to service of process. We are going to say that we are going to \ndeny somebody the capacity to have full redress or remedy, and they are \ngoing to have to go chase that other person somehow, no matter what the \nlevel of that person's responsibility is. To do that is effectively to \nsay to people, Sorry, folks. No lawyer in the country is going to take \nthat case. We're effectively stripping you of the rights to be able to \nhave access to the court system.\n  I am for a fair balance here. I have a lot of companies in \nMassachusetts that are high-tech companies, a lot of companies that are \nimpacted by this. I know a lot of people in the industry whom I respect \nenormously who deserve to be protected against greedy, voracious sorts \nof wrongful, totally\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\npredatory efforts to try to hold them up in the system. I am for \nstopping that.\n  I would, in our effort, put restraints on the capacity to bring class \nactions wrongly. And I think we have an increased standard with respect \nto materiality that would make it much tougher for people to put a \nclass together without a showing of injury.\n  So the real issue here before us in the Senate is, What is really \ntrying to be achieved here? If we are trying to simply achieve a \nbalanced, fair approach to protecting companies from unfair lawsuits \nand being balanced about the average citizen's approach to the court \nsystem there is a way to do that. But if what we are doing is a larger \ntort reform agenda, because of the bad name that lawyers in general \nhave, and some lawyers in particular have earned for them, if that is \nthe effort, in order to seek some broader change in the legal system \nthat denies people access to the courts, then I think we have a \ndifferent kind of problem.\n  There are many people in this Chamber who have practiced law before, \nsome on the other side of the fence, on the Republican side, who do not \nbelieve any legislation is necessary, that this is a one-time problem, \nthat the greatest incentive you can have to avoid a problem is for \npeople to fix it ahead of time, and the greatest way in which you will \nget the best and biggest and fastest fix ahead of time is to have \npeople required to be open to the possibilities of redress if they did \nnot do that.\n  But if we limit people's potential liability, there is a great \nlikelihood that a lot of people will say, Well, I'm not going to fix \nthis. I'm not liable. I don't need to do anything about it. They can't \nbring suit against me. And you may, in fact, have taken away the very \nincentive you are trying to create.\n  Mr. President, there are very real and legitimate substantive \narguments: Access to our court system. What is the best incentive? How \ndo you approach this fairly? How are you going to wind up with a system \nthat is balanced? All of those issues are really at stake in this. I \nhope colleagues will remember that as they approach the question of \nwhat is the best compromise here which would give us the kind of \nbalance that we need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts. He has summed it up.\n  I will only point out again this morning's news, the Wall Street \nJournal. I quote from page B4:\n\n       [By now] the year 2000 bug was supposed to have played \n     havoc with corporate computer spending, with companies \n     supposedly too worried about their mainframes to think of \n     anything else. A cautious attitude about the issue was the \n     theme in comments by big technology companies that released \n     first-quarter results in the past few weeks.\n       But with one notable exception, the technology industry has \n     so far escaped any broad year 2000 slowdown.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \neditorial from this morning's Washington Post about Y2K liability.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 29, 1999]\n\n                             Y2K Liability\n\n       The Senate is considering a bill to limit litigation \n     stemming from the Year 2000 computer problem. The current \n     version, a compromise reached by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \n     and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), would cap punitive damages for Y2K-\n     related lawsuits and require that they be preceded by a \n     period during which defendants could fix the problems that \n     otherwise would give rise to the litigation. Cutting down on \n     frivolous lawsuits is certainly a worthy goal, and we are \n     sympathetic to litigation reform proposals. But this bill, \n     though better than earlier versions, still has fundamental \n     flaws. Specifically, it removes a key incentive for companies \n     to fix problems before the turn of the year, and it also \n     responds to a problem whose scope is at this stage unknown.\n       Nobody knows just how bad the Y2K problem is going to be or \n     how many suits it will provoke. Also unclear is to what \n     extent these suits will be merely high-tech ambulance chasing \n     or, conversely, how many will respond to serious failures by \n     businesses to ensure their own readiness. In light of all \n     this uncertainty, it seems premature to give relief to \n     potential defendants.\n       The bill is partly intended to prevent resources that \n     should be used to cure Y2K problems from being diverted to \n     litigation. But giving companies prospective relief could end \n     up discouraging them from fixing those problems. The fear of \n     significant liability is a powerful incentive for companies \n     to make sure that their products are Y2K compliant and that \n     they can meet the terms of the contracts they have entered. \n     To cap damages in this one area would encourage risk-taking, \n     rather than costly remedial work, buy companies that might or \n     might not be vulnerable to suits. The better approach would \n     be to wait until the implications of the problem for the \n     legal system are better understood. Liability legislation for \n     the Y2K problem can await the Y2K.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  ``Liability legislation for the Y2K problem can await the Y2K.'' What \nwe are talking about is an instrument, a computer. The average cost for \na small business and otherwise is $2,000. They are not going to buy a \n$2,000 instrument in 1999 that is not going to last past January 1.\n  It is quite obvious that it is not the poor, but it is the \neconomically advantaged, the small businesses, and the doctors in \nAmerica that use this instrument now. And all they have to do is go \ninto Circuit City and say: Now, put it up, let me see that it works, \nthat it is Y2K compliant.\n  Why do away with the entire law system, the 10th amendment to the \nConstitution, the habitual and constitutional control of torts at the \nState level under article 10 over the 200 years of history? Do you know \nwhy? Because they put in this amendment to amendment to amendment. When \nthey put in the first one, even chambers of commerce objected to it. \nWhat you had in the McCain bill was still a bad bill. The McCain-Wyden \nbill is still a bad bill. The McCain-Wyden amendment to the McCain-\nWyden amendment is still bad, as evidenced by this editorial here this \nmorning.\n  Again, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Kaiser Permanente Executive Offices, dated April \n27.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Kaiser Permanente,\n\n                                      Oakland, CA, April 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of Kaiser Permanente, we \n     would like to address a number of serious concerns regarding \n     S. 96, a bill introduced by Senator John McCain, which \n     addresses disputes arising out of year 2000 computer based \n     problems (Y2K).\n       In brief, S. 96 as currently drafted:\n       Threatens the ability of the health care industry to \n     maintain rates;\n       Severely limits the rights of small businesses, consumers \n     and non-profit organizations like ours to recover the often \n     excessive costs of Y2K fixes, purchases and upgrades;\n       Unfairly prejudices (or completely bars) the ability of the \n     health care community to recover the costs associated with \n     any potential personal injury or wrongful death award from \n     the entity primarily at fault for the defect that caused the \n     injury. S. 96 permits the manufacturers, vendors and sellers \n     of non-compliant Y2K equipment and products to profit at the \n     expense of their customers and leaves the health care \n     industry (and ultimately our employer groups and patients) \n     responsible to bear the costs of their negligence.\n       The four provisions in S. 96 that cause us the most concern \n     are as follows:\n       The Act would not prohibit a patient injured in a hospital \n     by a Y2K defective product from suing the hospital or health \n     plan providing the medical service in which the defect arose. \n     The Act would, however, limit or bar a claim brought by the \n     hospital or health plan against the manufacturer or vendor of \n     the defective product, leaving the health care providers \n     solely responsible for the damages.\n       The 90 day waiting period requirement will impair the \n     ability of the health care industry to complete its Y2K \n     compliance efforts. The health care providers must remedy \n     their Y2K problems quickly to be compliant with internal and \n     external (including state and federal regulatory) timeliness. \n     For a considerable length of time, Kaiser Permanente has been \n     diligently identifying, mediating, validating, and testing \n     equipment and software with respect to Y2K issues. A key \n     component of this process has been demanding information, \n     assistance, and corrective action from manufacturers and \n     vendors, who often have control of the source codes and \n     other information that is necessary to achieve compliance. \n     Vendors who at this late date have still not adequately \n     addressed their Y2K defects in their products, despite \n     repeated requests by us, should not be afforded a 90 day \n     period in which to respond to such requests. Such a delay \n     in pursuing legal remedies could prejudice our ability to \n     complete our Y2K efforts by the year 2000.\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\n       While the Act limits the liability of manufacturers and \n     sellers of defective equipment and software, it does not \n     require that they fix the problems that they created for a \n     reasonable price. Some manufacturers and vendors sold Y2K \n     defective products in recent years knowing that their \n     products would not be usable past the year 2000. Yet S.96 \n     would allow such tortfeasors to charge exorbitant rates for \n     fixes which should be provided at a discounted or nominal \n     fee. In other words, the Act allows tortfeasors to increase \n     their ill-gained profits at the health care purchaser's \n     expense.\n       The Act does not carefully limit the use of the powerful \n     defenses it creates. Rather, it permits a defendant to assert \n     defenses in any action related ``directly or indirectly to an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure''. Manufacturers and vendors \n     will find it useful to assert that there are Y2K issues in \n     cases where a Y2K problem is not alleged, lengthening and \n     confusing litigation and potentially barring claims for other \n     defects.\n       The above provisions in S.96 are of the greatest concern to \n     us. However, there are other unfair provisions in the Act \n     which inequitably limit liability, including the abrogation \n     of joint liability, the mandate of proportionate liability, \n     the limitation to economic loss, the increase in the standard \n     of proof for the plaintiff, and the addition of new defenses \n     for the defendant. Please carefully review S.96 again in \n     light of our concerns. We would be happy to discuss this with \n     you further, please do not hesitate to call Wendy Weil at \n     510-271-2630 or Laird Burnett at 202-296-1314.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Mary Ann Thode,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                          Chief Operating Officer.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Quoting from the letter:\n\n       In brief, S. 96 [as currently drafted] threatens the \n     ability of the health care industry to maintain rates; \n     severely limits the rights of small businesses, consumers and \n     non-profit organizations like ours to recover the often \n     excessive costs of Y2K fixes, purchases and upgrades; \n     unfairly prejudices (or completely bars) the ability of the \n     health care community to recover the costs associated with \n     any personal injury or wrongful death award from the entity \n     primarily at fault for the defect that caused the injury. S. \n     96 permits the manufacturers, vendors and sellers of non-\n     compliant Y2K equipment and products to profit at the expense \n     of their customers and leaves the health care industry (and \n     ultimately our employer groups and patients) responsible to \n     bear the costs of their negligence.\n\n  Mr. President, I could read on and on, but when different \nindustries--the automobile industry, the grocer industry, and \notherwise--come to the attention of this 36-page document to change \naround the 200-year experience of the enforcement of torts, the Uniform \nCommercial Code nationally, and do away with it and the so-called \nprivilege it required. To come in here and cap punitive damages, \ndescribe a small business as any 50 or less--I notice in this most \nrecent amendment, Mr. President, on page 2, a defendant is described as \nan unincorporated business, a partnership, corporation, association, or \norganization with fewer than 50 full-time employees. It used to be \nsmaller, 25. But they are going in the wrong direction, all with this \nso reasonable, so bipartisan, so studied, so compromising, so \ninterested--come on. Give me a break.\n  Look at the next sentence: ``No cap with injury specifically \nintended.'' Paragraph 1 does not apply if the plaintiff establishes by \nclear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific \nintent to injure the plaintiff. So there go the class actions. Each \nplaintiff has got to come in and prove by clear and convincing, not by \nthe greater weight of the preponderance of evidence, but by clear and \nconvincing, that it is specifically intended for that particular \nplaintiff to be injured.\n  Mr. President, what we really have is a fixed jury. We could talk \nsense, but I notice in the morning paper that Kenneth Starr, the \nindependent prosecutor, is asking the judge down there in Arkansas to \ngo and interview the jurors after the verdict. He ought to come to \nWashington where they interview the jurors before the verdict.\n  That is my problem on the floor of the Senate here this morning; I \ncan tell you that right now. They run around this Chamber, the Chamber \nof Commerce is in here, the Business Roundtable, this conference board, \nget all those organizations going. I am tending to my business down \nhome. And you are for tort reform. You know this Y2K liability, $1 \ntrillion for the trial lawyers and all that.\n  Yes, I am against that. I am against a trillion dollars for the trial \nlawyers. Everybody says that, running for office. Sure, the idea of \ntort reform.\n  So they have Kosovo, they have the balanced budget, and the lockbox \ncharade going on, and right in the middle of this they come with all \nthe fixed votes, the jurors, before we even get to debate and show that \nthere is a nonproblem.\n  I am getting there. I can see the Parliamentarian blinking his eyes, \nso I am running out of time here. We are going to have to vote. But \nhere is the biggest fix I have ever seen. We had a difficult time \ntrying to get the truth around to our colleagues about S. 96 here this \nmorning, but I hope we can withhold and get some time to vote against \nthis cloture motion so we will have time to really show what is going \non.\n  We have problems in this country, but I can tell Senators, it is not \nthe tort system. It is not how the tort system affects business. \nBusiness is going through the roof financially in New York. Everybody \nis making money, particularly in the computer business. Of all the \npeople to ask for special legislation here in the Congress as well as \nspecial protections and the revision of all the tort practices, is the \ncomputer industry, the richest in the entire world.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to add my strong support \nto the bill we are currently considering, the Y2K Act. Although I plan \nto join my colleagues on this side of the aisle in voting against \ncloture, I don't want anyone to construe that vote as an indication \nthat I have any doubts about the need for, and the wisdom of, this \nlegislation.\n  Congress needs to act to address the probable explosion of litigation \nover the Y2K problem, and it needs to act now. We are all familiar with \nthe problem caused by the Y2K bug. Although no one can predict with \ncertainty what will happen next year, there is little doubt that there \nwill be computer program failures, possibly on a large scale, and that \nthose failures could bring both minor inconveniences and significant \ndisruptions in our lives. This could pose a serious challenge to our \neconomy, and if there are wide spread failures, American businesses \nwill need to focus on how they can continue providing the goods and \nservices we all rely on in the face of disruptions.\n  Just as importantly, the Y2K problem will present a unique challenge \nto our court system--unique because of the likely massive volume of \nlitigation that will result and because of the fact that that \nlitigation will commence within a span of a few months, potentially \nflooding the courts with cases and inundating American companies with \nlawsuits at the precise time they need to devote their resources to \nfixing the problem. I think it is appropriate for Congress to act now \nto ensure that our legal system is prepared to deal efficiently, fairly \nand effectively with the Y2K problem--to make sure that those problems \nthat can be solved short of litigation will be, to make sure that \ncompanies that should be held liable for their actions will be held \nliable, but to also make sure that the Y2K problem does not just become \nan opportunity for a few enterprising individuals to profit from \nfrivolous litigation, unfairly wasting the resources of companies that \nhave done nothing wrong or diverting the resources of companies that \nshould be devoting themselves to fixing the problem.\n  To that end, I have worked extensively with the sponsors of this \nlegislation--with Senators McCain, Gorton, Wyden, Dodd, Hatch, \nFeinstein and others--to try to craft targeted legislation that will \naddress the Y2K problem. Like many others here, I was uncomfortable \nwith the breadth of the initial draft of this legislation. I took those \nconcerns to the bill's sponsors, and together, we worked out my \nconcerns. I thank them for that. With the addition of the amendment \njust agreed to by Senators Dodd, McCain and others, I think we have a \npackage of which we all can be proud, one which will help us fairly \nmanage Y2K litigation. Provisions like the one requiring notice before \nfiling a lawsuit will help save the resources of our court system while \ngiving parties the opportunity to work out their problems before \nincurring the cost of litigation and the hardening of positions the \nfiling of a lawsuit often brings. The requirement that defects be \nmaterial for a class action to be brought will allow recovery for those\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\ndefects that are of consequence while keeping those with no real injury \nfrom using the court system to extort settlements out of companies that \nhave done them no real harm. And the provision keeping plaintiffs with \ncontractual relationships with defendants from seeking through tort \nactions damages that their contracts don't allow them to get will make \nsure that settled business expectations are honored and that plaintiffs \nget precisely--but not more than--the damages they are entitled to.\n  I think it is critical for everyone to recognize that the bill we \nhave before us today is not the bill that Senator McCain first \nintroduced or that was reported out of the Commerce Committee. Because \nof the efforts of the many of us interested in seeing legislation move, \nthe bill has been significantly narrowed. For example, a number of the \nprovisions changing substantive state tort law have been dropped. \nProvisions offering a new ``reasonable efforts'' defense have been \ndropped. The punitive damages section has been altered. And, instead of \na complete elimination of joint liability, we now have a bill that \nholds those who committed intentional fraud fully jointly liable, that \noffers full compensation to plaintiffs with small net worths and that \nallows partial joint liability against a defendant when its co-\ndefendants are judgment proof--precisely what most of us voted for in \nthe context of securities litigation reform.\n  I understand that there are those who still have concerns about some \nof the remaining provisions in the bill. To them and to the bill's \nsupporters, I offer what has become a cliche around here, but has done \nso because it is truly a wise piece of advice: let us not make the \nperfect the enemy of the good. Y2K liability reform is necessary--in \nfact critical--legislation that we must enact. Those of us supporting \nthe legislation must be open to reasonable changes necessary to make \nthe bill move, and those with legitimate concerns about the bill need \nto work with us to help address them. I hope we can all work together \nto get this done.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.

The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4413-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4413-S4417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of S. 96, and the last amendment pending to S. 96 \nbe modified with the changes proposed by Senators Dodd, Wyden, Hatch, \nFeinstein, Bennett, and Senator McCain which I now send to the desk. \nAnd I send a cloture motion to the desk to the compromise amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Most respectfully, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ncloture vote would have occurred, if consent had been granted, on \nMonday on the so-called compromise worked out among the chairman and \nSenator Dodd, Senator Feinstein, and others as mentioned above.\n  Let me say, I appreciate the effort of the chairman. I appreciate the \neffort, the work, and the willingness to try to find an adequate \nsolution by Senator Wyden. And Senator Feinstein has been involved, and \na number of others, Senator Dodd, obviously.\n  But in light of this objection, I do not intend to bring this bill \nback before the Senate until consent can be granted by the Democrats. \nAnd if it is predicated on agreement that we open this up for every \namendment in the kitchen, then it is over. Or until we get a commitment \nthat we are going to get the votes for cloture and get a reasonable \nsolution to this problem, I think it would be unreasonable for me to \nwaste the Senate's time with any further debate or action on this \namendment.\n  We need to do this. We can do it. But I am prepared now--if everybody \nis ready, we will just say it is over, the trial lawyers won, and we \nwill move on to the next bill. But I am willing to be supportive of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who, acting in good faith, want to \nget this done.\n  We should do it. This is a reasonable approach. There is no reason we \nshould use the Y2K computer glitch as an opportunity for a litigation \nbonanza. I am a lawyer, and everybody in this Chamber knows I have \nrelatives who would be very interested in this. But I am interested in \nwhat is fair and what is right. We need to do this. The negotiations \nhave happened. Concessions have been made. But, frankly, I am ready to \nmove on to something else, unless we can get this done. So I do not \nintend to do anything else until we hear some solution to this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am disappointed with the announcement \njust made by the majority leader. I think, as others have already \nindicated, that we have made extraordinary progress in the last couple \nof days. That would not have happened without Senator Dodd, Senator \nWyden, Senator Kerry, Senator McCain, and a number of other Senators \nwho have been very involved in bringing us to this point.\n  I am disappointed, as well, that there was an objection to returning \nto the Y2K bill, because we were making real progress toward improving \nthe bill. I believe that negotiations have delivered progress, even \nthough more improvements will be needed. I support proceeding back to \nthe Y2K bill. I support keeping the negotiations going. I want a bill. \nI think we will get a bill. I think it is important we get a bill.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  I also think, however, that there were unfortunate decisions made by \nthe majority about how we consider legislation on the floor. We are \nnegotiating all of this off the floor. I would much prefer to have a \ngood debate and offer amendments. The amendment tree is filled. We are \nnot able to offer a Democratic amendment--relevant or not relevant. So \nwe are relegated to negotiating off the floor. And we are making \nprogress even in that context. I only wish we would recognize in this \nChamber all the rich tradition of debate in the Senate and we would \nhave the opportunity to offer amendments and debate them, dispose of \nthem, and move on.\n  Senator McCain has suggested that. So I am not necessarily accusing \nthe manager of any effort to keep us from having those amendments. But \nI will say this. We will not be gagged when it comes to our ability to \noffer amendments. It is religion. And it ought to be religion on both \nsides. It is a fundamental question about fairness, about rights, and \nabout any one Senator's opportunity to participate fully in the debate \nand consideration of any important legislation.\n  So I am frustrated that the tree is full. I am frustrated that we are \nnot able to move this process forward in the normal, open process under \nwhich we should consider any bill, especially this one. But I am also \nhopeful that we will come to some resolution. I am hopeful that we will \nfind compromise. I know we will pass this legislation before long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McCain is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I first say, before Senator Daschle \nleaves the floor, that having been in the minority for the first 7 \nyears or 8 years I was here, I certainly have sympathy with his \nfrustration. The great strength of the Senate is that not only does \nevery Senator have the right to be heard but the minority does also. \nBut I also think Senator Daschle realizes that if we allow any \namendment on any subject with extended debate, then the body does not \nmove forward.\n  I have not seen a better relationship than the one that exists \nbetween Senator Daschle and Senator Lott. It is one of friendship and \nit is one of cooperation. I think the legislative accomplishments which \nhave been achieved during Senator Lott's and Senator Daschle's \nstewardship have been incredibly impressive, really.\n  I think perhaps it would be best for us to recognize that there is \nvirtue on both sides of the argument, especially in light of, for \nexample, yes, the tree is filled, but I did state, and the majority \nleader stated, we would be glad to vitiate one of those parts of the \ntree so that we could take up relevant amendments. I think that was \nmade clear. So with the tree filled, there was the opportunity to \ndebate relevant amendments.\n  I also comment that, as Senator Daschle pointed out, it is not really \nbest to have all of this progress done off the floor in negotiations. I \ncan't express a deep enough appreciation to Senator Dodd, Senator \nWyden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, and Senator Bennett for their \nefforts, and others, and those of Senator Kerry of Massachusetts. From \na personal standpoint, I express my sympathy for Senator Daschle's \nfrustration. But at the same time, I do believe we could have moved \nforward with debate and votes on this issue.\n\n  I really appreciate his comments about his commitment to seeing this \nbill pass, because we really do have to pass this legislation. We will \nengage in further negotiations. But between now and early next week, \nwhat I would sincerely hope is that all of us--the majority leader and \nSenator Daschle would urge all of our colleagues to get together, come \nup with a set of amendments, as we usually do when this process comes \nto an end, come up with a set of relevant amendments, a time period \nassociated with it, and get this thing done so we do not have to have \nanother cloture vote and not have this very vital issue addressed.\n  Again, I also say that these amendments are important. I know the \nSenator from South Carolina feels very strongly about many of them. But \nit is time, really, that we started going through that process, even \nthough we are bringing the bill down today.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to Senator Feinstein, Senator Wyden, \nand Senator Dodd on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just want to ask unanimous consent that \na list of amendments in the 103rd Congress--the last Congress, of \ncourse, that the Democrats were in the majority was the 103rd Congress. \nI would be remiss if I did not submit for the Record right now a list \nof amendments that were not relevant that were offered by Republicans \nto legislation during the 103rd Congress. There were at least 19 \nnonrelevant amendments offered, and this may not be the complete list. \nWe may update this as time goes on.\n  This issue of relevancy is interesting because it was never an issue \nin the 103rd Congress. Nonrelevant amendments were added. That list \ndetails a number of things. In fact, the manager of the bill today, \nSenator McCain, had a nonrelevant amendment on the motor voter bill \nthat would have allowed certain rescission authority on the part of the \nPresident. The Senator from Arizona also offered a nonrelevant \namendment to the unemployment compensation bill in December, 1993. The \namendment was to eliminate the Social Security earnings test.\n  The ability to offer nonrelevant amendments has been part of the \nconsideration and deliberation of legislation here in the Senate for \nevery Congress, including the 103rd Congress when we were in the \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               GOP NON-RELEVANT AMENDMENTS--103RD CONGRESS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Vote  No.           Date\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n9                          2/4/93  Family and Medical Leave (H.R. 1,\n                                    P.L. 103-3)--Mitchell motion to\n                                    table Dole, et al., perfecting\n                                    amendment to Dole, et al., amendment\n                                    (as amended by Mitchell amendment--\n                                    Vote No. 8): Directs Congress to\n                                    conduct thorough review of all\n                                    executive orders, DOD directives,\n                                    and regulations of military\n                                    departments concerning appointment,\n                                    enlistment, and retention of\n                                    homosexuals in armed services before\n                                    July 15, 1993; specifies that all\n                                    such orders, directives or\n                                    regulations in effect on January 1,\n                                    1993, shall remain in effect until\n                                    review is completed, unless changed\n                                    by law; requires President to submit\n                                    any change to this policy to\n                                    Congress as bill; and sets forth\n                                    expedited procedures for Senate and\n                                    House floor consideration.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Texas seeking recognition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader \nalluded to the fact that he had relatives that were trial lawyers. That \nputs me in the position of qualifying to even speak. Let me first say \nthat I am proud to be a trial lawyer. No trial lawyer has called me or \ntalked to me about this bill. They don't need to. They know and \nunderstand.\n  Now, what happens is, when you grow up in a small town, you get a \nvaried experience. I am also known as a good business and corporate \nlawyer. I represented a grocery chain that had 125 Piggly Wiggly stores \nall over, and we were sued for antitrust. I won that going all the way \nto the Supreme Court.\n  I know about frivolous suits. I represented the local transit \ncompany, the South Carolina Electric and Gas. Every November, somehow \neverybody slipped down on the bus. They got their arm caught in the \ndoor. They tripped up on the floor. They were small cases, but the \nattorneys who preceded me handling them didn't want to try them. It is \nChristmastime, New Year's.\n  I backed them all up. We tried them all. We won them all. I saved \nthat corporation millions of dollars. I am the first southern Governor \nto get a AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's and Moody's. I know \nabout business responsibility.\n  Now, we trial lawyers have had the fortune to represent people who \nhave been dying of asbestosis, and then we have the young ladies who \nhad the breast implants, and then moved to the tobacco. But here now \nfor a change it is trial lawyers. We are beginning to get credibility. \nWe are representing small businesses, with $20,000 in their pockets or \nmore. You don't go down and buy a computer for $20. And small business \npeople are buying that instrument. I wish they would read Business \nWeek. I wish they would listen to Kaiser Permanente in California, how \nthey are absolutely opposed to this particular bill, and that it would \nhurt the health industry. I wish they would read the record whereby the \nindividual doctor came from New Jersey. He said he had--I can't \nremember the exact name so I don't want to refer to it incorrectly--a \nsupplier. He bought the computer in 1996, and the salesman bragged \nabout how it was going to be Y2K compliant. It would last for over 10 \nyears and on and on.\n  And then he found out last year that it wasn't compliant. You see, \nyou don't have to wait until January 1. This is an important point for \nthe Senate to understand. You don't have to wait for January 1.\n  This is all political applesauce. You don't have to wait until \nJanuary 1, when you go in and buy a computer, and everybody who reads \nthe newspaper and anybody with $20,000 in their pocket knows now the \nY2K problem.\n  He asked that it be fixed, and they did not even answer when he \ncalled a couple of times. Then he wrote a letter. And after a couple of \nmonths passed, he decided that he had to get a lawyer. He was told that \nit would be $25,000. Now, mind you me, he only paid $16,000 for the \ncomputer, but it would be $25,000 to make it Y2K compliant.\n  So as a result, they brought the suit, and somehow it got on the \nInternet. The next thing you know, this particular supplier had 17,000 \ndoctors similarly situated. And immediately the supplier said, oh, yes, \nwe will fix it for free and even pay the lawyers' fees to get out of \nthis thing. But that is the cost/benefit of some of these businesses.\n  We have been into this tort thing. We have the Uniform Commercial \nCode. We have the States. No State attorney general is running around \nsaying we need a national approach and to do away with 200 years of \nhistory of the Constitution under the 10th amendment, and tort law and \nall the trial codes of America. The State of Colorado has a good bill, \nnot like this incidentally, which brings me to the real point about \nnegotiating.\n\n  The crowd that says this is nonnegotiable has been running around \ntrying to pick up votes. That is what the negotiation has been about. I \njust read the amendment to the amendment to the amendment. When it \nfirst started, even chambers of commerce said, this is too violating \nand we are not going to get away with this. They actually opposed the \nbill when it was first introduced. Then they got this McCain bill. Then \nthey got the McCain-Wyden bill. Then they got the amendment, and now we \nhave the amendment to the amendment. It showed how objectionable it \nwas.\n  It is tricky. They are still plying downtown. Tom Donahue has been \nout in the hall saying what we will go with.\n  This is a political exercise. There is not a national need for Y2K \nlegislation, as the Washington Post just this morning said. The \ncommunities know and understand. This is certainly not a conservative \nnewspaper. I have introduced it. ``Liability legislation for the Y2K \nproblem can await the Y2K.''\n  But it is a political problem, if you can identify with Silicon \nValley and get their money and get their votes. They collected 14 \nmillion last night and they have to perform. The rich expect a fight, \nand you have to show you are fighting. You don't care about Y2K and the \nperson buying a computer and everything else of that kind. It is taken \ncare of; it is a nonproblem.\n  Read Business Week, March 1 issue. All the blue chip corporations of \nAmerica have notified their suppliers to be compliant by the end of \nApril, this year, 7, 8 months ahead of time.\n  So we are talking about a problem that is a nonproblem. It is \ncertainly not a Federal problem, but it is a national political problem \nbetween the parties.\n  Yes, some on this side think they can get in bed with the Silicon \nValley boys who want a capital gains tax cut. They want estate tax \ncuts. We have heard it. The bills are running all around. That is the \ncrowd that is shoving them. If we can just give them a little bit, I \ncan go out and get a fund-raiser. That is what is going on.\n  When you refer to the trial lawyers, we trial lawyers are finally \ngetting a little credibility. We are representing good, responsible, \nfinancially solvent\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nclients, not an injured party who is hurt from smoking or from a breast \nimplant or dying from asbestosis and doesn't have any money, and can \nhardly pay the doctor, much less the lawyer. How are they going to get \ninto court? Like I am committing some civic offense by representing \nthem--Mr. President, I do not get a dime unless I win. What does \nwinning mean? Winning means drawing the pleadings and negotiating, \nbecause I know you don't make money in court. But, by gosh, you might \nhave to go to court.\n  And then you have to get the jurors. Then they will think of other \nthings to get up on appeal. And I have to go all the way and pay all \nthe expenses--investigation, court expenses, and everything else. That \nis the contingent fee process, so the indigent poor in this America can \nget their day in court. It has worked for 200 years.\n  It is not the crowd where we have former Senators still indebted, \nhaving been investigated, $450 an hour, sitting down with the mahogany \nwalls and the blooming Oriental rugs. I want a continuance. I want a \ncontinuance. No trial lawyer is frivolous. He doesn't want a \ncontinuance. He has to move it along. Like Senator McCain says, ``Let's \nmove it along.'' The trial lawyers are a move-along crowd. But when \nthey see a fixed jury, then they say, wait, lets stop, look, and \nlisten.\n\n  I earlier remarked on something here. Kenneth Starr is in the morning \nnews trying to interview the jury after the verdict. We understand, \nfrom this particular charade, that you have to interview the jury \nbefore the verdict, because we are the jury and they are running around \nwith all of these entities. I can't do it. The Chamber of Commerce, the \nBusiness Roundtable, NFIB--they are all running around--are you for \ntort reform? I am for tort reform. We have had it in South Carolina. It \nis a good bill. It practices there. I get in all the industries, and no \nbusinessman in my backyard is complaining. I have the best of the best. \nGive me the blue chips. I have GE, Westinghouse, BMW, Hoffman-LaRoche. \nGive me the best of the best.\n  I went out to Bosch not long ago. They make the antilock brakes for \nMercedes and Toyota, and they have a contract for all GM. I asked the \ngentleman who was briefing us, ``What about product liability on \ndefective antilock brakes?'' He said, ``No, every one of these is \nnumbered. We would know immediately where it went wrong.'' That is what \ntrial lawyers have caused. They have caused the utmost care in \nproduction. You have quality care and you ought to be proud of it. That \nis how you get productive --not on a State tax cut or a capital gains \ntax cut.\n  Let the trial lawyers show you the way for quality production. We get \non them when they give you a bad article. That is what we argued about \nhere when they referred to the trial lawyers as if there is something \nwrong with them. I am proud that we can be able to represent people \nwith money for a change. So I am ready to stay here and object.\n  If there were some negotiations, it would be better while we move on \nsome other legislation. They need to get a reasonable bill that doesn't \nchange all the tort law or joint and several and these other things \nthey have in there, where you just sue them and they say, ``That part \nwas made in India, so go out to New Delhi and see if you can find \nthem''--come on. No small businessman or doctor has the wherewithal to \ndo that. They have no recourse. They are trying to take away individual \nrights on a political bum's rush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is a lot I would like to say in \nresponse to Senator Daschle's remarks and Senator Hollings' remarks. \nSome of it would probably be better left unsaid, but I must comment.\n  Regarding amendments, I reiterate what Senator McCain, the manager of \nthe legislation, said. Amendments that are relevant to this bill, \ngermane to this bill, we ought to do that. That is why I left a window \nin the parliamentary procedure yesterday so we could do that. \nUnfortunately, the Senator from Massachusetts showed up and stuck in a \ntotally irrelevant amendment, and I felt that that was an abuse of my \ngood-faith effort. But we can still do that. If Senator Dodd, Senator \nRobb, or some other Senator has an amendment with regard to Y2K, OK, \nthat is the way you legislate. But the idea that we are going to have a \npolitical legislative agenda dumped off on this bill, which is a very \nthinly veiled effort to kill the bill--that is really what is at stake \nhere--any majority leader would be certainly unwilling to agree to \nthat.\n\n  I offer this to Senators again: If we have relevant amendments, we \nwill be glad to do that.\n  Let me talk for a moment about what this bill does. It seems to be a \nlittle bit clouded by the debate. It provides time for plaintiffs and \ndefendants to resolve the Y2K computer problems without litigation--\nwithout litigation. That sounds like a good idea to me. Those who think \nthe solution to the problem in America is more lawsuits, I don't think \nthey have been talking to the real world. I am a lawyer. But the idea \nthat we ought to just have more opportunities to file lawsuits--I \nunderstand lawyers are calling the families of the poor victims in \nColorado and saying, ``Can we sue somebody for you?'' That makes me \nsick to my stomach, that in this moment of grief, members of my \nprofession would call and say, ``Let me sue somebody for you.''\n  No, the answer is not more lawsuits in America. The answer is \nsolutions, opportunities for resolution, sanity, for Heaven's sake. So \nwe would like to have a process here where we don't always have to \nresort to litigation. Wonderful lawsuits. Great. I don't believe the \nAmerican people want that.\n  This bill reiterates the plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages and \nhighlights the defendant's opportunity to assist plaintiffs in doing \nthat by providing information and resources. Does that make sense? Why, \nsure. It is giving them help to solve the problem. This is a unique \nproblem, one we have never had before. Shall we rush to the courts? No. \nShould we try to find a way to resolve the problem for all concerned? \nYes.\n  The bill provides for proportional liability in most cases, with \nexceptions for fraudulent or intentional conduct, or where the \nplaintiff has limited assets.\n  Are there legitimate causes for court actions? Yes. I don't have the \nextensive practice background that the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina has, but I practiced a little law and I did some corporate \nwork and some public defender work, and I filed some lawsuits because I \nthought they were necessary. I can remember a medical malpractice case \nthat I thought was justified. Yes, there are cases, but they should be \nonly after other avenues have been pursued where there is fraud or \nintentional misconduct.\n  This bill protects governmental entities, including municipalities, \nschools, fire, water sanitation districts from punitive damages. Should \nthere be some general protection for the school districts from being \nsued? Sure.\n  The bill eliminates punitive damage limits for egregious conduct \nwhile providing some protection against runaway punitive damage awards. \nDo we need some protection here? You see lawsuits out here in some \nStates for $40 million, and it is totally inexplicable and, in my \nopinion, indefensible.\n  It provides protection for those not directly involved in a Y2K \nfailure. And it is a temporary measure. We are not trying to have \nproduct liability reform on this bill or tort reform--although we ought \nto have both, in my opinion, and the sooner the better. I can't wait \nuntil we can get it done. But this is a temporary measure to deal with \na temporary, one-time problem. It sunsets January 1, 2002.\n  I want to emphasize that it does not deny the right of anyone to \nredress their legitimate grievances in court.\n  What is at stake here? What is going on here? Some people don't want \nthis bill at all, pure and simple. To the credit of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, I don't think he has denied that. His goal is to defeat \nthis bill. For every name of people out here in the hall on the \nbusiness side, I can assure you there is somebody on the other side. \nBut the idea that we are going to resort to the courts to solve all of \nthe problems in America, and the insinuation that this bill is some \nsinister plot to block legitimate legal action, I just find that wrong.\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\n  I think it is a good effort. I hope we get it done. But I am willing \nto stand on this line right here. Those who just voted against cloture \ncan live with it, as far as I am concerned, and they can explain it to \ntheir constituents--big businesses, small businesses, farmers, people \nwho are going to get sued if we don't do this, when it is not even \nnecessary.\n  So if this bill dies on this line, it is OK with me, because I think \nthe blame is clear. But I am not going to be a part of shenanigans \nhere, to have an agenda dumped on this bill that would result in \nkilling it. We are not going to keep spinning our wheels. We are going \nto come up with a legitimate compromise solution, and we are going to \nvote and move or not--either way. If anybody in this Chamber thinks the \nsolution to the Y2K problem is more lawsuits, I don't believe they have \ntalked to the people in America.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Hollings pertaining \nto the introduction of S. 912 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas. She is right on target. We have graduated over 2,000 agents \nfrom the finest school down there for Border Patrol agents. Two who \ntrained there have already been killed.\n  I have visited from time to time. The matter of pay is the issue. We \nadvertise and we solicit in the local area over the entire State--and \nnationally--and it is a pay problem.\n  I hope we can confront it.\n  Mr. President, I will say a word about the majority leader's \nrejoinder relative to this legislation.\n  He points out specifically that without litigation, we have time; it \ngives an avenue, gives 90 days in time, to fix the problem.\n  Mr. President, this Senator knows, rather than fixing the problem, \nthey are trying to fix the defendants and see if, on a cost-benefit \nbasis, they can move the problem out to India or some other supplier \nthat is indigent or bankrupt or otherwise; that is what they do during \nthe 90 days.\n  We do not need in law a 90-day waiting period before you can file. \nNobody is filing immediately. Nobody wants to get to court. These \nbusinesspeople don't run down and get a lawyer. They do as the doctor \ndid in his testimony before the Commerce Committee: He called and \ncalled, and he wasn't called back; then he wrote the letter; he spent \n$16,000 for a computer, and in a year's time he had to pay $25,000 just \nto be Y2K compliant.\n  We live in the real world. Why is this gimmick on all legal \nproceedings all of a sudden given a 90-day extension for fixing the \nproblem? For an individual running a little corner grocery store with a \ncomputer that goes down, if they call the company and don't have the \nmoney to make it Y2K compliant, in 90 days they are out of business. \nThey are still waiting around while they are maneuvering with their \nlawyers.\n  These manufacturers who are sued have lawyers on retainer sitting up \non the 32nd floor wondering when they can get off to play another golf \ngame or when they can get another continuance. They think about how to \nstay out of the courtroom and how to get the clock running. It is a bad \nprovision.\n  Let me agree with the distinguished majority leader and say I agree \nthat no bill is needed. We find out after all of the debate, here comes \nthe Washington Post that says, wait a minute, the market is fixing it \nnow. On January 1, if there is a real problem that the States can't \nhandle, there are courts in all the States, and if they can't handle \nit, we have a national problem, fine. But don't use Y2K as an \ninstrument to distort the tort system and get through what they haven't \nbeen able to get through for the past 20 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4417-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GUIDANCE FOR THE DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCIES AS A PART OF THE BUDGET \n                                PROCESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an American hero. We could use some heroes today, of all \ndays, considering the last few days we have had in America. But I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to retired Col. Theodore Wilson Guy, United States \nAir Force, from Missouri. Ted Guy, nicknamed the ``Hawk'' by those who \nknew him best, was a genuine American hero. He was best known for \nhaving sacrificed his freedom for his country as a U.S. POW during the \nVietnam war. But aside from being a hero, perhaps more importantly, Ted \nwould say he was a husband, a father, a brother, and a friend to many, \nincluding myself. Last Friday, April 23, 1999, Ted passed away only 6 \nmonths after discovering symptoms associated with leukemia.\n  I will always remember Ted Guy for the encouraging faxes and e-mails \nhe used to send to my office, especially during the investigation \nconducted by the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, which I \ncochaired in the early 1990s. I gained a lot of strength from those \ninspiring messages from this hero. Ted will never know, but I want his \nfamily to know how much those messages meant to me.\n  Ted felt strongly that our Government needed to do more to account \nfor his missing comrades from the Vietnam war. He traveled at his own \nexpense to Washington, DC, to the Halls of Congress, to make this \npoint.\n  Ted was right to be concerned about our Government's handling of the \nissue of POWs and MIAs, and with his support, and the support of his \nfellow veterans and family members of POWs and MIAs, we have made \nsignificant progress in opening the books, declassifying the records, \nand pressing foreign governments for answers over the last decade.\n  However, as Ted continued to maintain up until his last days with us, \nthere is still much work to be done with our accounting effort, and I, \nfor one, am committed to seeing this issue through, in part because of \npeople like Ted.\n  I commit to you, Ted, we will keep working. We owe it to you.\n  I say to the youth of America, if you want a role model to aspire to \nand to inspire you, they do not come any better than men like Ted Guy. \nWhen looking for a hero, oftentimes young people\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nlook to professional athletes or others. You want to remember that a \nhero is not only somebody you care for, but if they are a real hero, \nthat person will care about you, too.\n  Ted joined the Air Force in 1947. He served his country as an Air \nForce fighter pilot for the next 26 years. He served in both the Korean \nand Vietnam wars flying the F-84 in the Korean theater and the F-4 in \nthe Vietnam theater. On March 22, 1968, while attacking an automatic \nweapons position near the Vietnamese-Laotian border during the battle \nof Khe Sanh, Ted's plane was shot down and he was captured by the \nCommunist forces.\n  Ted Guy was subsequently marched up the Ho Chi Minh Trail and then \nheld in several POW camps in the Hanoi area, to include the infamous \nHanoi Hilton. He was brutally tortured by the North Vietnamese to the \npoint where he would pass out from severe beatings. He also was forced \nto spend nearly 4 years in solitary confinement.\n  He was one tough guy--Ted Guy. He did not talk about it much, though. \nYou could not get him to talk about it. He was not looking for \nsympathy.\n  When he was finally removed from solitary confinement, he was put in \na prison with more than 100 other U.S. military and civilian prisoners. \nHe became the senior officer among them and was responsible for \nmaintaining order, the chain of command, and the code of conduct among \nhis fellow POWs.\n  His leadership and guidance helped his fellow POWs survive their \nordeal. Many have said just that. Many referred to themselves as \n``Hawks' Heroes'' in honor of Ted Guy.\n  To the code of conduct, Ted added his own personal code that \nconsisted of two points. The first point was to resist until unable to \nresist any longer before doing anything to embarrass his family or his \ncountry. The second point was to accept death before losing his honor.\n  Ted once said:\n\n       Honor is something that once you lose it, you become like \n     an insect in the jungle. You prey upon others and others prey \n     upon you until there is nothing left. Once you lose your \n     honor, all the gold in the world is useless in your attempt \n     to regain it.\n\n  Mr. President, Ted Guy never, never lost his honor. What an \ninspiration he was to all Americans. I wish more Americans could have \nknown him personally. I wish more Americans knew more about Ted Guy. He \nleaves behind his wife Linda of 26 years, four sons and two \nstepdaughters. He touched a lot of people--so many people.\n  However, his unselfish and patriotic sacrifices for America and his \nheartfelt concerns about efforts to account for his missing comrades \nfrom the Vietnam war who never made it home were huge accomplishments. \nI was proud to call him a friend, and I already miss him.\n  As with other POWs, Ted used a tap code in Hanoi to communicate \nthrough the walls with other POWs. It was an alphabet matrix--five \nlines across, five lines down. Ted used to end his messages by tapping \nthe code ``GBU,'' or ``God bless you,'' and ``CUL'' for ``See you \nlater.''\n  I end my tribute with the same message to Ted: ``GBU CUL, Ted.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the tributes to Ted Guy \nfrom his son, his POW-MIA supporters, and his dear friend and fellow \nPOW, ``Swede'' Larson, and also a copy of the tapping code, as Ted Guy \nused it, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          A Tribute to Ted Guy, Sr. From His Son, Ted Guy, Jr.\n\n       On Friday, April 23rd, my dad passed away. Col. Ted Guy was \n     a man of tremendous conviction, determination and patriotism. \n     As his son, I would like to share with you a picture of my \n     Dad you might not have been aware of. Please read this as a \n     tribute from a son to his Dad.\n       It was a little over six months ago that Linda alerted me \n     to the fact that Dad was not feeling well and he would be \n     undergoing some tests. The test showed the seriousness of \n     Dad's illness. I knew Dad would do everything he could to \n     fight the cancer, as his five year experience in POW camp had \n     provided a glimpse of his determination. However, my concern \n     became that he would finish well. To finish well would be to \n     be right with God. To be right with God would be to \n     understand and accept God's word, the Bible. To accept God's \n     word would be to receive Jesus Christ as one's savior.\n       When I visited with Dad shortly after Christmas, I gave him \n     a copy of the book ``Mere Christianity'' by C.S. Lewis. On \n     the cover of the book I had written, ``Dad, I desire more \n     than anything in life that you would spend eternity with me \n     in heaven. I ask you to read this book with an open mind as \n     it is written by a `wanna be' fighter jock, C.S. Lewis.''\n       Prior to giving this book to Dad, we had had discussions \n     about Jesus Christ, but Dad felt he was pretty much a self \n     made man and could make it on his own. But when your Dad is \n     dying, you tend to again go the extra mile as my greatest \n     concern was where would he spend eternity.\n       I am so pleased to report that Dad read the book. As he was \n     fighting the cancer, his loving wife, Linda, would read from \n     ``Mere Christianity'' to Dad every night before he went to \n     bed. In addition, I gave Dad an audio cassette about the \n     ``proof of Christ.'' About two months ago, Dad called me and \n     said he had listened to the tape and ``it made a lot of \n     sense.'' He also told me not to worry as he and God were \n     going to be O.K.\n       Throughout these past four months, I have had the great \n     privilege of seeing Dad do everything he could to beat the \n     cancer. I believe he received outstanding care. I also \n     believe the love and care shown Dad by Linda in helping him \n     fight the cancer is a real example of loving and serving at \n     its very best.\n       I have also seen Dad's heart towards God change. This \n     change was reflected not only in what he said to people about \n     the things of God, but this change was also reflected in the \n     warmth and love he expressed to so many in his last days. He \n     understood the love of Christ and the beauty of Christ's gift \n     on the cross. But more than understanding, he accepted the \n     gift of God through his Son Jesus Christ.\n       My wife, Rita, and my sons, David and Jeremy, will miss \n     Dad. David and Jeremy will miss fishing with Granddad as well \n     as being the only two people on the planet that could humble \n     him. (A 4 and 5 year old have that amazing ability.) We are \n     so proud of the great American he was, the lives he touched \n     and the causes he fought. His legacy of patriotism and \n     determination will live on, we promise.\n       While we are proud, we are also very thankful. We are \n     thankful Dad received Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. \n     Perhaps, the Lord has placed dad in a place of great need in \n     having cancer. A place where dad could completely understand \n     his need for Jesus Christ. If I could say one thing to my \n     dad, it would be: ``Dad, you served, you fought, but most of \n     all, you finished well. I am proud to be Ted Guy, Jr.''\n       Knowing my Dad, he would have wanted you to know he died \n     with peace in his heart. He knew he was loved and cared for; \n     but more than anything, he would want you to know he knew the \n     love of God.\n\n                POW-MIA Internetwork Tribute to Ted Guy\n\n     Re Colonel Ted 'Hawk' Guy Passes.\n     Date: April 25, 1999.\n\n       From the flight lines of Korea and Vietnam, to a cell in \n     the Hanoi Hilton, to the hallowed halls of Congress . . . Ted \n     Guy never failed to speak his mind, do his job and command \n     respect, awe and admiration from all who crossed his path.\n       And now he has passed on to a final freedom and peace.\n       After duty in Korea and stateside, he was transferred to \n     Vietnam where he bailed out over Laos after one of his bombs \n     prematurely exploded and was captured by the North \n     Vietnamese. From the jungles of Laos, Ted was marched to \n     Hanoi, repeatedly exposed along the way to Agent Orange. Upon \n     reaching the Hanoi Hilton, he spent 3 years in solitary \n     confinement and upon release to the general population, \n     assumed his role as Senior POW Officer (SRO).\n       He was badly beaten, tortured and as a result of extreme \n     mistreatment during captivity, he was retired shortly after \n     his release during Operation Homecoming.\n       Ted rallied family members, activists and Ex-POWs the same \n     way he rallied his men . . . With compassion, strength and \n     passion. He openly spoke of his confinement, the politics of \n     POWs and was a resounding voice of reason in an unreasonable \n     issue and world.\n       The continued saturation of Agent Orange took its final \n     toll . . . Ted was diagnosed with Leukemia as a result of AO \n     exposure and within a scant 6 months, passed from this world.\n       There are no words to express how much he is respected and \n     how much he will be missed. His voice may have been silenced, \n     but his message will endure.\n       In closing he always signed his letters and e-mails to us \n     with the POW tap code, GBU and CUL, and we were and we did . \n     . . and we will, one day.\n       May your flight be swift and the winds carry you high Ted.\n       GBU-CUL\n                                  ____\n\n\n        National Alliance of POW/MIA Families Tribute to Ted Guy\n\n       It is with deep sadness that we inform you of the passing, \n     on April 23rd, 1999 of Korean and Vietnam War Vet and former \n     Vietnam Prisoner of War--Col. Ted Guy. For those unaware, \n     Col. Guy was with us, from the very beginning of the \n     Alliance. He spoke at our first forum back in July 1990. When \n     our website started (www.nationalalliance.org), he agreed to \n     write the foreward for our Vietnam Pages.\n       Col. Guy was a strong supporter of the Live POW issue. He \n     was never afraid to speak his mind and he stood by his \n     convictions.\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n       All of us in the POW/MIA issue will miss him. We have lost \n     a dear friend and our POW's have lost a strong advocate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     A Message From Col ``Swede'' Larson, Former POW--Hanoi Vietnam\n\n       It is with deep regret, that I inform you of the death of \n     Col. Ted Guy. He passed away today, 23 April 1999, from \n     complications associated with Leukemia. He only lived 6 \n     months from the time of his first symptoms. He is survived by \n     his wife Linda, two step daughters, four son's, and a \n     brother.\n       Since most of you did not know Ted, and a few misunderstood \n     him, I am going to ask your indulgence, and tell you a little \n     about him, since I was his very close friend for 44 years.\n       We first met at Luke Air Force base in 1955 as young \n     Captains instructing fighter gunnery. He had previously \n     completed a combat tour in Korea, flying F-84's. He and I had \n     three things in common. We both loved to fly, party, and \n     fish. Over the years we stayed in close touch, and after his \n     retirement, we fished together many times.\n       He was assigned to South Vietnam in F-4's while I was in \n     Thailand flying out-country missions, in F-105's. When he \n     showed up in Hanoi, I couldn't fathom how he had gotten \n     there. After we were released, I learned that he was shot \n     down during the battle at Khe Sanh, bailed out and captured \n     in Laos by the North Vietnamese (they were never in Laos! -\n     yah, right!). On the second day of his capture while he was \n     starting his walk to Hanoi, he was heavily sprayed with Agent \n     Orange. In the ensuing days, he walked through many areas \n     that had been previously defoliated.\n       As he was captured in Laos, he was kept away from the rest \n     of us and spent his first 3 years in solitary confinement. He \n     was then put in with the 100 plus, Army and civilian \n     prisoners and was the Senior Officer. He had his hands full \n     with a group of very young, non-motivated and rebellious \n     enlisted men. Unlike our group, (after the death of HO), he \n     was badly treated by his captors, almost up to our release. \n     He was badly beaten during this time for acting as SRO and on \n     one occasion, suffered severe head injuries, which several \n     years later resulted in his being medically discharged from \n     the service. He had been on the ``fast track'' prior to shoot \n     down, and had been promoted to Lt. Col. below the zone. To my \n     knowledge, he was the only POW promoted (to 06) below the \n     zone while a POW. Those concussions he suffered forced his \n     early retirement.\n       He was not an active member of our group, primarily because \n     he did not know or serve with any of us in Hanoi. He also \n     felt that even though our group elected to be non-political, \n     we should have made an exception and taken a prominent stand \n     as a potential powerful lobby group, to demand a full \n     accounting of the MIA's. He was an individual of deep \n     loyalties, and a boundless love of his country and flag. He \n     stood up tall against those he felt were in the wrong.\n       His medical specialists felt that his Leukemia was a direct \n     result of his repeated heavy exposures to Agent Orange.

Mr. President, I rise to address the body today on \nanother aspect of our culture. I have spoken several times this week \nabout different aspects of our culture in areas that I think need \ndesperate reform, which certainly has been highlighted by what took \nplace in Colorado.\n  Today, I want to speak of video games. I have examples to show people \nin this body and I hope around the country of what is being marketed to \nour children, what is being put out there, what they are receiving.\n  I have kids who are in this age range. My oldest daughter is 12, my \nson is 11, and my youngest daughter is 9. They have some exposure to \nsome of these notions. I rise to address one aspect of our society that \nI think demands attention, particularly in the wake of these tragic \nevents.\n  Yesterday, I addressed the rise in popularity of music with \nhyperviolent, often misogynistic lyrics. More and more kids are tuning \nin to music which glorifies and glamorizes violence and viciousness. As \nthe popularity and profitability of music depicting murder, torture, \nand rape grows, the music industry is making a killing off our kids.\n  The problem is not unique to the music industry. It is found in many \nentertainment fields. This coming Tuesday, we will hold a hearing in \nthe Commerce Committee to examine marketing violence.\n  Today, I will talk about another equally troubling trend in pop \nentertainment, the rising popularity of gory, graphic video games. The \nvideo game industry has received far less attention than television or \nmovies but is among the fastest growing entertainment media in the \ncountry.\n  Last year, the video game industry was worth more than $6 billion. \nIts profitability is climbing steadily and rapidly. The rise in \nprofitability is fueled by the rise in popularity of these games. Video \ngames are being played more often by more people and particularly more \nkids.\n  Even industry executives acknowledge that video games are a growing \npart of the cultural landscape. I want to put this in the context of \nthe cultural landscape. One executive of the industry went so far as to \nassert in a recent Wall Street Journal article that:\n\n       Games are a primary vehicle for popular culture.\n\n  These games are.\n  As a father with a young son who plays a lot of video games, I can \ntell you, they get to spend more time with him a lot of times than \nanybody else does, as he plays the video games.\n  Although many video games are nonviolent, a growing number of \ncompanies are producing and promoting unimaginable gory, interactive \nvideo games. They are gory and they are interactive.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n  Consider these few examples. ``Carmaggedon'' is a highly popular \nvideo game put out by Interplay, which debuted a little over a year \nago. The purpose of the game is for the player, who controls a race \ncar, to mow down as many pedestrians as he possibly can. That is the \npurpose of the game, ``Carmaggedon.'' You are in the car mowing down \npeople. Points are awarded for each pedestrian killed, and the more \ngruesome, the better.\n\n  Unlike some games where the player aims to kill villains, such as \nmonsters or aliens, the targets in this game are innocent people. The \ngame player is no longer cast in the role of vigilante but simply a \ncold-blooded killer.\n  The video game ``Quake,'' put out by Midway Games and ID Software, \nthe same companies as producers of ``Doom,'' consists of a lone gunman \nconfronting a variety of monsters. For every kill, he gets points. As \nhe advances in the game, the weapons he uses grow more powerful and \nmore gory. He trades in a shotgun for an automatic, and later he gets \nto use a chain saw on his enemies. The more skilled the player, the \ngorier the weapons he gets to use. Bloodshed is his reward. ``Quake'' \nsold more than 1.7 million copies its first year out.\n  Here are some other examples of popular games. I want to show you \nsome of these ads, because I think they are particularly troubling in \nthe advertisement that they use. These are ads that were all taken from \na recent gaming magazine, again, aimed at a teenage audience. These are \ngenerally aimed at people under the age of 18. And I can see some of \nour interns and pages up front. I rather imagine they will recognize \nsome of this advertising that I am going to show.\n  But I want you to look at some. Here is ``Quake.'' Just look how this \nis advertised, if you would, Mr. President.\n\n       Blowing your friends to pieces with a rocket launcher is \n     only the beginning . . . .\n\n  Sound familiar?\n\n       Whether you are in search of the ultimate online frag-fest \n     or looking for the latest Quake news, information player \n     ranks, or skins--the Imagine Games Network has it all.\n\n  It talks about ``[b]lowing your friends to pieces with a rocket \nlauncher is only the beginning. . ..'' Unfortunately, does that sound \nlike a news headline?\n  Let's look at the next one we have up here. And I want to point out, \nbefore I get to the real graphics of it, it is rated 14. So there is \nactually a rating system on video games. So this one is supposed to be \npurchased by people under the age of 18. It is rated to do so.\n  Listen to the title of this one. Look at how this one is advertised \nat the very top. ``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free'' is the advertising. \n``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free.''\n\n       If you consider yourself a fighter kind of surg, Guilty \n     Gear comes highly recommended. No true fan can be--\n\n  This is online here. What else do we have of this one? ``Fighting \ngames.'' You can see the rest of it, and the gory details. It is rated \nfor teens. This is rated for kids under the age of 18.\n  ``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free.'' Does that sound horrible?\n  This is an actual game screen, really. This is of a very popular \ngame.\n\n       It is built on the revolutionary Quake II engine kingpin. \n     Life of crime. Includes a multiple player gang bang \n     deathmatch for up to 16 thugs.\n\n  I think you can see the blood splattering here at the side in which \ndifferent people are blown away.\n  One other point I want to make about this is that we will have people \ntestify at our hearing about the desensitization that this does to \npeople to allow and even empower them to do things to people that are \nnot even imaginable, but after you spend so much time looking at and \nstudying the screen and shooting at and blowing up people, the \ndesensitization process happens.\n  We will have an expert witness testifying that that allows you to do \nthings that you would otherwise have an internal mechanism in you \nsaying, no, you cannot do that; no, you do not do that. But after hour \nafter hour of the blood and guts, it has a desensitization to it.\n  These are advertisements.\n  Look at this one. Look at this one: ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax \nover a cold one.''\n  ``Deploy. Destroy.'' And ``[t]hen relax over a cold one.''\n  On this one you can see the little teen label. This is marketed and \nthis is for teens to purchase. They actually are for teens to purchase.\n  Can you really sit there and say that the consumption of this on and \non and on does not have some impact on a young mind, on a young soul?\n  ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax over a cold one.''\n  Look at this one. This one goes further than even death.\n\n       Destroying your enemies isn't enough. * * * You must devour \n     their souls [in this one]. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. As a \n     result, stalk the shadows of Nosgoth, hunting your vampire \n     brethren. Impale them with spears, incite them with torches, \n     down them in water. No matter how you must destroy them, you \n     must feed on their souls to sustain your quest, the ruin of \n     your creator, Kain.\n       [Y]ou must feed on their souls to sustain your quest, the \n     ruin of your creator, Kain. Dark Gothic story, shift real \n     time between material and special planes. Morph.\n\n  Those are being marketed to our kids.\n  The video game industry has not only deemed some of these acceptable \nfor teens and parental consent unnecessary, but they market them to \nteens as well.\n  This may seem over the top, but they are among the more popular games \naround. One survey of 900 fourth to eighth graders found that almost \nhalf of the children said their favorite electronic games involved \nviolence.\n  Columnist John Leo put it this way:\n\n       We are now a society in which the chief form of play for \n     millions of youngsters is making large numbers of people die. \n     Hurting and maiming others is the central fun activity in \n     video games played so addictively by the young. Can it be \n     that all this constant training in make-believe killing has \n     no social effects?\n\n  One would think that some of these games are so violent that they are \nout on the fringe somewhere snubbed by respectable companies, cringing \nsomewhere in the electronic redlight district. Not so. They are backed \nand distributed by some of the biggest names in the business.\n  GT Interactive distributes ``Quake.'' Sony Corporation is developing \nthe ``Doom'' game, which so inspired the two young killers in \nLittleton, into a movie. They are making this into a movie and are in \nthe process of negotiating with its own game division's ``Twisted \nMetal'' car game, where the object is to mow down innocent pedestrians.\n  In these games, the goal is death. Success is determined by the body \ncount. Others' pain is your gain.\n  Moreover, almost all of these games are sold in toy stores. Reports \nindicate that they are typically arranged in alphabetical order, not by \nrating or age level.\n  It seems pretty apparent to me that toy stores are designed to appeal \nto children. Children are the targeted audience. Parents do not enter \ntoy stores to buy toys for themselves. But right there on the shelves \nare products that are supposedly unsuitable for children.\n  Defenders of these games say they are mere fantasy and harmless role-\nplaying. But is it really the best thing for our children to play the \nrole of murderous psychopaths? Is it truly harmless to fantasize about \nmass murder? Is it?\n  We need to do better than this. I am not saying that companies do not \nhave a right to peddle this, but it is not right to make a killing off \npeddling violence to our children.\n  Raising children is a precious duty and a precarious task. It \nrequires nurturing, sacrifice, and lots of love. But even the most \ndevoted parents may find it impossible to shield their child from these \nimages and messages that surround them at school, at the mall, at a \nfriend's house, through music, TV, movies, and video games. We can no \nmore shield our children from a polluted culture than we can shield \nthem from polluted air.\n  Just as a polluted physical ecosystem is poisoned by several sources, \nso our cultural ecosystem has many points of source pollution. And this \nis one. We all need to do our part in cleaning up our cultural \necosystem--or else we shall all be poisoned by it.\n  Mr. President, I am willing to share these graphics with other \noffices for them to look at as well. I simply ask them to look and to \nexamine and to think as we start to explore more in this area of \ncultural renewal and the need for renewal of what we are actually \ndealing with today--how do we\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nmove forward to get to a better and a brighter day, so our children can \nlive in a culture of life rather than a culture of violence and a \nculture of death? What are they receiving today versus what we want \nthem to receive tomorrow? Can we really sit here and say that these \nhave no impact on our children? I don't think we can.\n\n  I think we need to examine and push, each of us individually, and \nstart down this line of saying, what is it that is being received? What \nsort of cultural pollution is getting to our children, and how do we \nimprove that ecosystem? How do we get it renewed?\n  We can, and we have to start about this task, not by a series of \ncensorship but first by knowledge and, by that, spreading and getting \naway from a culture of doom and death to a culture of life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there have been a lot of interesting things \nin the news this week. One is a story about the Supreme Court's ruling \non Tuesday. It confirms the view that many of us have held for some \ntime. Special Prosecutor Donald Smaltz was overreaching, at the very \nleast, in indicting and trying former Secretary of Agriculture Mike \nEspy. Mr. Smaltz spent over 4 years and about $17 million of our \ntaxpayers' money to run out of office this distinguished public \nservant.\n  Last December, a jury said ``no'' to Special Prosecutor Smaltz and \nacquitted Mr. Espy of the charges against him. In fact, the jury said \n``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no,'' I \nbelieve, over 30 times. Now the Supreme Court has said a resounding \n``no'' also. They rejected the broad reading urged by Mr. Smaltz of the \ncriminal laws he has used to bring down a Cabinet Secretary. The \nSupreme Court, Tuesday, concluded that the conviction of a trade \nassociation for giving Mr. Espy gifts was correctly thrown out by a \nlower court.\n  According to the Supreme Court, if Mr. Smaltz's reading of the \nFederal gratuity statute were correct--a reading that out-of-control \nspecial prosecutors seem to have--``it would criminalize, for example, \ntoken gifts to the President based on his official position and not \nlinked to any identifiable act--such as the replica jerseys given by \nchampionship sports teams each year during ceremonial White House \nvisits . . . [or] a high school principal's gift of a school baseball \ncap to the Secretary of Education, by reason of his office, on the \noccasion of the latter's visit to the school.''\n  The Supreme Court wisely rejected these absurd results.\n  Secretary Espy began his tenure as Agriculture Secretary facing \nchallenges to the safety of our food supply, and he dealt with those \nchallenges with enormous energy, compassion, and effectiveness. Just \nbefore he was sworn as Secretary, several children died because they \nate contaminated hamburgers in Washington State.\n  I remember this very well. I remember Secretary Espy immediately \nflying to Washington State to be with the families, because he cares \nabout people. I remember talking to him about that, because I was at \nthat time chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. I know that \nwhen he flew back to Washington, he devoted himself to preventing these \nneedless deaths. He started putting into effect policies which will \nsave thousands of lives in our country. He fought the industry itself--\na very powerful, well-heeled industry--to do the right thing.\n  History will record his tenure as a turning point in updating and \nmodernizing our food safety standards--a tradition continued by \nSecretary Glickman and President Clinton.\n  But his ``trial by fire'' began at the hand of a special prosecutor \nrun amuck. The unanimous jury verdict acquitting him underscores what I \nhave been concerned about for some time--unaccountable prosecutors with \nunlimited budgets who can and will bring charges that no other \nprosecutor in the world would bring.\n  This special prosecutor is one who is extremely frustrating. If I \nthought that what he did was out of sheer stupidity, that would be one \nthing. It would be enough if we thought that this was a man who was \njust not bright enough to know his job. But along with his total lack \nof judgment, his total stupidity, came a man whose overwhelming ego was \nsuch that he cared less about anybody he was after. The taxpayers were \npaying his bill. He cared only about preening before the cameras \nhimself.\n  He was particularly interested in promoting himself and patting \nhimself on the back. He was among the first of the special prosecutors \nto establish his own Internet web page. It is like an advertisement for \nhimself on this web page. Mr. Smaltz posted his reaction to the jury \nverdict and downplayed the acquittal since an ``indictment of a public \nofficial may, in fact, be as great a deterrent as a conviction of that \nofficial.'' That was the most flagrant admission of abuse of a \nprosecutor's power that I have ever seen--I was a prosecutor for nearly \n9 years--and it remains posted on his web page today.\n  What he is saying is, it doesn't make any difference if the person is \nguilty or not. It doesn't make any difference if the jury acquitted \nover and over again, and the person is not guilty. All the prosecutor \nhas to do is bring an indictment; that will teach them. This is no way \nto restore faith in the criminal justice system. This is an example of \na prosecutor who indicts somebody for something that no jury would ever \nconvict the person for, but says, ``I will show them because I am the \nprosecutor,'' or, ``I can do that because, after all, it is going to \ncost you hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of dollars to prove \nyour innocence. And, besides, the taxpayers are paying my bill. So why \nshould I care about you?''\n  What ego, what stupidity, what arrogant abuse of power. I really \ncannot think of words strong enough to condemn such actions.\n  No prosecutor should bring an indictment simply as a deterrent and \nwithout a good-faith belief that the case can be proved beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Prosecutors should not bring these charges simply to \nharass somebody, simply to cost them money. A prosecutor has a sworn \nduty not to bring a charge unless he or she thinks there is at least a \nreasonable chance they can prove the charge and the person is guilty. \nCommon decency, saying nothing about the canons of ethics, would \nrequire that. Frankly, no prosecutor who has to answer to anybody would \ndo that. Only a prosecutor who doesn't have to answer to anyone, only a \nprosecutor who has the taxpayers paying their unlimited bills, would do \nthat.\n\n  Putting aside the harm to reputation and cost to the defendant and \nwitnesses of bringing unwarranted charges, indictments based on flimsy \nfacts can be dangerous. The Government is barred under our \nConstitution's double jeopardy clause from bringing a case twice. So a \nprosecutor has a responsibility to ensure that the Government can prove \nits case the first time around. There is no opportunity for a second \n``bite at the apple.''\n  One item that Special Prosecutor Smaltz did not put up on his web \npage was, I thought, one of the most disgusting things I have seen any \nprosecutor do. It was so bad that apparently, even with his unbridled \nego and his lack of intellectual honesty, he did not feel he could \nbring himself to put it on the web page. That item was: he \ncongratulated his team of well paid prosecutors with gifts of \nwristwatches. According to the press reports, these watches ``look \ngood, with Smaltz' name around an eagle in the center of the \nindependent counsel seal and the case name, `In re Espy.' ''\n  It is like he was on some big game hunt and these were the trophies. \nStupidity one might excuse, and stupidity\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nwas evident here. But this kind of arrogant, egotistical abuse of a \npublic trust nobody can forgive. In fact, I have wondered whether the \ncost of those gratuities exceeded the costs of the gifts that Mr. Espy \nwas charged with receiving. Watch gifts may not be criminal; I find \nthem certainly offensive.\n  Mr. President, as we go into the debate we will have this year on \nwhether we renew the Office of Independent Counsel--something, I \npredict, will not be done--let us not aim all our fire at the excesses \nof Kenneth Starr, or his tactics, or his misstatements of the facts to \nthe Attorney General, or even some of the lies that came out of his \noffice. Let us not focus just on that. Let's look at people like Donald \nSmaltz, a man who showed what happens when somebody of limited talent, \nof questionable ethics, of no integrity, how they can act when they are \ngiven unbelievable power, unlimited budget; and we in the Congress \nshould ask ourselves whether we want to continue this.\n  The Office of Independent Counsel, when filled with good men and \nwomen--and there have been some very good men and women of both parties \nwho have been there--who follow the restraints that prosecutors would \nnormally expect to have, have done a good job. But when it is filled by \npeople who would serve with a sense of self-aggrandizement, it hurts \nthe whole Nation. It hurts an awful lot of innocent people--people \nfound innocent by juries, people found innocent by appellate courts, \npeople whose reputations are besmirched and their bankrolls exhausted \nby the actions of unconscionable, incompetent, out-of-control persons \nlike this man.\n  Mr. President, I may speak more on this. I have tried to restrain \nmyself in my comments about him today and to give him the benefit of \nthe doubt. I have probably given him the benefit of the doubt more than \nhe deserves.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one else seeking the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a \nsituation that grows more dim with each passing day. My colleagues and \nI came to the floor before the Easter recess and addressed this very \nissue.\n  The Farm Service Agency has depleted many of its accounts, and quick \npassage of the supplemental appropriations bill is absolutely vital to \nreplenish these funds and to get our farmers back into the fields.\n  I was very pleased with USDA's emergency action on March 26 to keep \nloan money available and to keep temporary employees on staff. However, \nthat funding has run out in many areas, and Congress has yet to \ncomplete action on the bill.\n  The billions of dollars in agricultural credit authority contained in \nthe bill is literally the only hope of staying on the farm for hundreds \nof Arkansas producers and many farm families.\n  In Arkansas, we need an additional $41 million for FSA's loan \nprograms. We are experiencing the largest USDA credit demand since the \nmid-1980s. As of April 23, our State FSA offices had delivered more \nthan $179 million in credit assistance.\n\n  Due to bad weather, low prices and poor outlooks, the need for \nGovernment-guaranteed credit has increased substantially this year. Our \nagricultural industry is on a deadline with Mother Nature, and it \ncannot wait any longer.\n  The timeliness of this legislation cannot be overemphasized. For \nthose of us in Southern States, our planting time has already come and \nis just about gone. We are in dire straits. All farmers across this \nNation are in dire straits. It is so very important for us to act in \nthis body in a timely fashion in recognizing this problem.\n  In addition, I take this opportunity to express to my colleagues that \nagriculture is vitally important to all of us across this Nation and to \nthe rest of this world. It seems that every time I turn on the \ntelevision, there is another story applauding the unbelievable success \nof our Nation's economy.\n  Unfortunately, not every segment of our society is sharing in this \nperiod of economic bliss. The agricultural community nationwide is \nsuffering.\n  USDA economic projections for 1999 do not offer much hope for relief \nin the immediate future, and it will fall upon our shoulders to explore \nthe short-term, as well as the long-term, policy resolutions to farm \nrevenue problems.\n  It may not be the most popular issue of the day, but every one of us \nenjoys the safest, most abundant and most affordable food supply in the \nworld today produced by American agricultural growers.\n  This safe and abundant food supply will not be there for this Nation \nor for the world if we do not support our family farmers at this \ncritical time. Once those family farms are gone, they will no longer be \nback in production.\n  I certainly thank the President for allowing me to talk about this \nand to reiterate to my colleagues how absolutely important it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4422-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4422-S4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to do something that I know \nmy fellow colleagues in the Senate will be very interested in, and that \nis to pay tribute to one of the Senate's esteemed graduates and a role \nmodel for all Americans, former Senator David Pryor.\n  As a young woman and a former Congresswoman from Arkansas, I have \nalways looked up to Senator David Pryor for his intelligence, his \ndedication, his tenacity and his compassion for his fellow man.\n  Now, I have found a new reason to admire my former colleague and \nlong-time friend. For those of you who don't know, last week David \nPryor left his current post at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n  No, he didn't take a job at Yale or even an Ambassadorship. He has \ngone to Kosovo. Not as a diplomat or as a U.S. official, not even as a \nHarvard professor, but as a hands-on volunteer who is helping care for \nKosovo refugees in Albania.\n  I am sure that many of you who served with David Pryor and already \nknow him as a great humanitarian are not in the least bit surprised by \nthis.\n  Senator Pryor recently signed on with the International Rescue \nMission, a New York based group which was started by Albert Einstein to \nhelp those suffering under Hitler's regime. The organization is \ncurrently building shelters and assembling sanitation systems to \nimprove living conditions for thousands of displaced Albanians.\n  Senator Pryor loaded up his suitcase with gifts for the refugee \nchildren--candy bars and crayons. And he told the International Rescue \nMission that he was going there to work for 30 to 60 days.\n  Some may ask what prompted David Pryor to take this step. By all \naccounts, he has had a remarkable career--serving as a Senator and the \nGovernor of my home state and the state legislature as one of its \nyoungest members.\n  He has been able to continue his love of politics by teaching young \npeople at\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nHarvard's esteemed school of Government. And he has a wonderful family, \nwho he enjoys immensely and who loves him dearly. It all sounds like a \npretty full life.\n  When asked by a friend why he made the decision to go to Kosovo, \nPryor responded that he was too young to fight in World War II and he \nwas too involved in his own career during the civil rights struggle to \ncontribute much in that event.\n  Now, later in life he was struck by the reports and pictures coming \nout of the Yugoslav region. He was concerned for the thousands of \nchildren and families who were in need and who he wanted to do \nsomething for. So, after a week of deliberating within himself, he woke \nhis wife in the middle of the night and said, ``Honey, we've got to \ntalk.'' A week later, off he went.\n  Since he has been in Albania, Senator Pryor has reported once back to \nhis family and sent a fascinating letter to friends, family and former \nstaff. He works in a camp digging latrines and assisting the Red Cross \nefforts to secure supplies. Last Saturday he bought 5,000 bars of soap \nand diapers for 1,000 babies.\n  ``Being here a week makes me wonder about our world and how people \ncan do such unthinkable, brutal things to other humans,'' Senator Pryor \nwrote. ``It is a world of unreality.''\n  He says of the men ``All their incentive and pride has been stripped \nfrom them and they having nothing left.''\n  About half of the dislocated refugees in the camp where Senator Pryor \nworks are children. They are scared. They are tired. They are hungry. \nAnd above all, they are devastatingly sad. They mourn lost loved ones \nand ache to return to their homeland.\n  Senator Pryor also shared with his family the stories of two women, \none whose daughter had been raped at the hands of a Serb police \nofficer; the other a young mother has been separated from her three \nchildren, all under the age of 5, for more than a month. She was forced \nto flee her home, abandon her life and possessions in Yugoslavia, and \nnow continues to desperately search for her family, her small children.\n  These are just some of the images Senator David Pryor is seeing on \nhis trip. They are even more heart wrenching than any of us could \nimagine.\n  Whether or not you support U.S. involvement in the Kosovo region, \nnone of us can imagine or ignore the human tragedy that is unfolding \nalong its borders. Every day our televisions and newspapers carry new \nimages of the suffering--new reports of atrocities by Yugoslav troops.\n  I, for one, feel better about the humanitarian conditions and the \nthousands who are suffering, knowing that David Pryor is lending a hand \nand leading with his heart.\n  My generation has yet to see the kind of nationwide mobilization and \nspirit of volunteerism that swept our country during World War II and \nthe Korean War. My mother has often told me of rationing gas and \npreserving food. She told me of joining together with friends and \nfamily to plant a victory garden and to make morale-boosting gifts to \nsend to our troops overseas.\n  I have such enormous respect for the efforts of all Americans during \nthat time and I hope we as a nation can join together in support of our \ntroops and the humanitarian efforts to help the Kosovo refugees now.\n  I commend Senator David Pryor's efforts, wish him well, and urge all \nof us to take note of his selfless example.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4423-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

That could \ninvolve other votes or other resolutions. For now, we are working on \nexactly when the McCain resolution would come up. I hope the Senate can \nreach consideration on this matter in early May.

The St. Pius \nstudents just finished in 7th place at the national academic decathlon \nfinals in California. That's the best finish New Mexico young people \nhave ever scored at the decathlon nationals.\n  One of the St. Pius team members said it best about the contest. He \nsaid its the only competitive event in high school where your best \nchance of winning involves going home and reading a book.\n  These outstanding young people were tested based on their knowledge \nand scholastic skills in fine art, music, history, economics, \nmathematics and literature.\n  It is with great pride that I salute the St. Pius decathlon team and \ntheir accomplishments.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my fellow \nSenators\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\nan extraordinary exchange that occurred last week in the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee when they were conducting a hearing under \nyour chairmanship regarding the year 2000 budget for the Department of \nInterior.\n  As some of you here may know, Secretary Babbitt and I, while both \nbeing from adjacent Western States, have not agreed on a lot of land \nmanagement, water, and endangered species issues affecting the West. \nHowever, last Thursday a most unusual and enlightening thing took \nplace. We both agreed that, regarding the impact of the Endangered \nSpecies Act on desert States like New Mexico, the current \nimplementation of the law does not work.\n  I ask unanimous consent Secretary Babbitt's testimony be printed in \nthe Record. It is not yet an official record because the entire \ntranscript has not been completed, but it is a literal translation of \nwhat he said that day.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR \n                            FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1999\n\n         U.S. Senate, Subcommittee of the Committee on \n           Appropriations,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       The subcommittee met at 9:33 a.m., in room SD-124, the \n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Slade Gorton (chairman \n     of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senators Gorton, \n     Stevens, Cochran, Domenici, Burns, Campbell and Byrd.\n\n\n                      UNEDITED PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT\n\n       Senator Gorton. Senator Campbell?\n       Senator Campbell. Mr. Chairman, Senator Domenici has to--he \n     has another very tight commitment.\n       Did you want to ask a question before I go?\n       Senator Domenici. I would really ask if I could ask two \n     questions. I have to preside at a committee hearing at 10:00 \n     o'clock, and I will be a little late to that.\n       Senator Gorton. Fine, fine. Go ahead.\n       Senator Domenici. Thank you.\n       Mr. Secretary, I am going to submit some questions to you \n     with reference to the drought in the State of New Mexico, \n     which will essentially be asking you if you can make sure \n     there is a coordination of all of the federal agencies, some \n     under you, as to what might be done.\n       We are--we are clearly--I do not know if you know this, but \n     we are destined this year to have the worst drought we have \n     ever had. Our rivers are going to run dry, and a lot of \n     things are going to happen that are very, very bad. And I \n     will ask you about that in detail.\n       But now I wanT to raise an issue that is related to the \n     drought and share it with you with reference to the \n     Endangered Species Law, and I think you are aware of this.\n       Mr. Secretary, New Mexico, like Arizona, is a very arid \n     state. Folks here in the Beltway are primarily unaware of the \n     critical needs for water out there in the West. We are very \n     grateful that you come from out there and you know about \n     these needs.\n       With the lack of snow pack and precipitation in New Mexico, \n     we are going to have a drought. In fact, parts of the Rio \n     Grande River which you are familiar with, which historically \n     has gone dry at various times, may dry up as early as this \n     week, believe it or not.\n       The traditional stresses of water users are only made more \n     difficult by litigation regarding the needs for the silver \n     minnow endangered species. A recent notice of intent to sue \n     by the Forest Guardians and others--that is an entity in New \n     Mexico--threatened to force the release of stored water in \n     any of Heron, El Vado, Abiquiu, and Cochiti Reservoirs to \n     maintain--quote, ``to maintain the riparian habitat \n     necessarily for the survival,'' of the silver minnow and the \n     willow flycatcher.\n       I am concerned about water necessary for the survival of \n     New Mexico, our cities which use that water, our irrigators \n     which have--as you know, under our water system, they have \n     primacy as per the time they applied it to the ground, and \n     they own much of that water.\n       In the lawsuit which sought to force immediate critical \n     habitat designation, you, as the Secretary of Interior, in \n     the lawsuit which I will make available to you, you argued \n     that the Department did not have the data necessary to \n     determine water amounts needed for the fish.\n       Fish and Wildlife Service Director Rappaport-Clark stated \n     in an affidavit that: The Service must comply with NEPA \n     requirements and perform an economical analysis of the \n     impacts. The EIS would likely be needed which would require \n     more time for the habitat designation. The Environmental--the \n     ESA requires that the Service, when designating critical \n     habitat, take into consideration the economic impacts of \n     specifying any particular area as critical.\n       I wonder if you would share with the committee, as soon as \n     you can, answers to the following questions, and if you could \n     answer them right now, it would be very helpful.\n       Secretary Babbitt. I would be happy to. I would be happy \n     to.\n       Senator Domenici. Without scientific data available for the \n     minnow, water needs, nor reliable economic analysis, will not \n     the Department need additional time to follow through and \n     find out what the needs are? You have stated that in the \n     lawsuit, but would you tell the committee if that is the \n     case?\n       Secretary Babbit. Well, Senator, if I may----\n       Senator Domenici. Please.\n       Secretary Babbitt. I would like to step back and frame this \n     issue and then specifically answer your question.\n       Senator Domenici. Sure.\n       Secretary Babbitt. Senator, I do not think it is any secret \n     that we have not had much luck in our relationship in finding \n     common ground in New Mexico.\n       Senator Domenici. No.\n       Secretary Babbitt. But this is another tough problem being \n     served up, and let me just say that notwithstanding our \n     failures in the past, I intend to do everything I can to see \n     if we can work our way through this.\n       Now, let me say this also: I believe that our failure to \n     work out a reasonable relationship is in some ways due to the \n     underlying fact that in New Mexico, more than any other \n     western state, including Alaska, Colorado, Montana and \n     Washington, these issues are characterized by intransigence \n     on both sides.\n       I have never worked in an environment in which the natural \n     resource users have been so rigid and inflexible; and I would \n     say exactly the same thing of the environmental groups. Now, \n     it is in that context that we must deal with this problem.\n       I have voiced my concerns about the way that we are \n     mandated to use the designation of critical habitat under the \n     Endangered Species Act. It does not work. It does not produce \n     good results. It should be modified, because the Courts are \n     driving us to front-end determinations which, more properly, \n     should be incorporated in recovery plans at the back end when \n     we, in fact, have the information.\n       Now, the Courts have laid out a set of case decisions here \n     that have put us in a straitjacket. They are not going to \n     give us the kind of time we need because the Act does not \n     allow it. So that is just the bottom line.\n       Doe we need more time? Yes. But the Endangered Species Act \n     does not give it to us. The Courts do not give it to us. And \n     we are going to proceed with declaring critical habitat. I \n     would prefer not to. It is a--it is not productive. It is \n     incendiary, and it will be in this case.\n       Now, finally, let me say, and then I will back off, that I \n     believe that there are solutions available here. It is going \n     to take some movement by those middle ground irrigation \n     districts. They do not have a reputation for water use \n     efficiency. And there are many ways, I believe, that we \n     could work something out. They have not shown the \n     flexibility that we have found in other places, like in \n     Eastern Washington, in Colorado, and elsewhere.\n       The environmentalists may, in fact, be making--not ``may, \n     in fact,'' but are, in fact, making some unreasonable demands \n     about their version of what the hydrology of the Rio Grande \n     Valley ought to be like.\n       I would like to continue attempting the work. I have talked \n     with the Bureau of Reclamation. I believe we have some water \n     resources that are going to allow us to stagger through this \n     season, with a little bit of flexibility.\n       Senator Domenici. Thank you very much.\n       I know I used a lot of the Committee's time.\n       But I compliment you on your statement, and--while I do not \n     necessarily agree with you characterization of my fellow New \n     Mexicans as being intransigent and the worst in America, as \n     you have just phrased it, but--but I do believe that \n     something is terribly bad in the way the Courts are handling \n     this situation because you have to close down a river to \n     users without knowing what the habitat--what the water is \n     needed for the--what water is needed for the endangered \n     species.\n       It is an impossibility. Maybe we could fix that here. It \n     probably would bring the world down on our necks, even if we \n     tried to do what he suggested. But we ought to think about \n     that.\n       Let me make sure that everybody understands the seriousness \n     of this problem. I grew up within eight blocks of this river. \n     And for many years of my younger days, I used to walk to this \n     river, and many times it was dry.\n       So for those who are used to rivers in your state or in \n     Alaska that run all year long and were having arguments about \n     salmon fish habitat, we do not have that. We have a river \n     that, for much of the time, does not have any water in it.\n       On the other hand, we built storage places that make it \n     better now. We do have more water, and we have a different \n     water system than most of you. Our water system is based \n     upon: The first one to use it and apply it to a beneficial \n     use owns it, and they own it as of the date they did it. And \n     they are valuable; you can sell those rights.\n       Now, the problem we have is that the endangered species \n     comes along with litigants who know how to use the Courts, \n     and they say, regardless of those water rights, you have to \n     save the fish, the minnow.\n       Now, the minnows have survived, I believe, during eras that \n     I have told you about. When there is no water running in the \n     river, they\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\n     have survived in some other place in the river where there is \n     water.\n       And now what we have is a drought and rivers that do not \n     always run wet, and we have at the worst possible time a \n     lawsuit against him and his Department saying, ``Create an \n     endangered species, Mr. Judge,'' and now ordering them to try \n     to get water out of the reclamation projects, even if they \n     have to dump our lakes that are there for irrigation purposes \n     and other things, to save the minnow.\n       Now, that is a very frustrating position for a state to be \n     in, and for a Senator, when the Endangered Species Act is a \n     national law. And I do not know whether we want them to go to \n     court and see if they really have water rights under the \n     Endangered Species Law.\n       That is a nice question. And everybody has been kind of \n     dancing around it, except for a couple of courts--you could \n     guess where--from California, California Circuit. They have \n     kind of ruled that they have water rights even though they \n     are not part of New Mexico's water ambiance at all.\n       The Secretary is indicating that perhaps people have been \n     intransigent regarding their water rights. I can tell you \n     they may have been. But if you were under the gun all of the \n     time about whether you are going to have enough water even \n     though you own it, you would be kind of nervous about sharing \n     it with anybody.\n       And I think that is kind of what happened, and then put on \n     the 800,000-population city which gets its water from an \n     underground aquifer that is fed by this river, and they own a \n     lot of water in order for their future, and you have a real \n     tough situation. So I may need the Senators' assistance.\n       But I will tell you for now, Mr. Secretary, I hope you are \n     not alluding, in terms of intransigence, to your and my \n     difficulties earlier in your Secretarial term. They are \n     there, and they are acknowledged, and they will kind of be \n     wounds for a long time on both of us.\n       But this is a new ball game with a new problem, and I \n     clearly intend to work with you if you will work with me to \n     see if we can find a way to get through this on a temporary \n     basis until we can fix it up in some permanent manner.\n       Thank you very much.\n       Senator Stevens. Senator, would you yield just for one \n     minute?\n       Senator Domenici. I am finished. Thank you.\n       Senator Stevens. My friend, I think that is the most \n     enlightened statement about the Endangered Species Act that I \n     have heard from any Administration official since that act \n     was passed, and I was here when it passed. And I am going to \n     get a copy of that, and I do believe that we can work on that \n     basis.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Secretary Babbitt's testimony could open the door to \nsome changes in the Endangered Species Act and may permit all parties \nto work together. I am submitting, as I indicated, this unedited \ntranscript from the hearing for the Record. The Secretary's remarks are \nvery significant because they acknowledge that this law, however well \nintentioned, is not working as it should. I hope we can begin serious \nwork on improving the Endangered Species Act, certainly as it applies \nto dry States where water is very much in demand and where we have an \nimposition on those waters by the Endangered Species Act as it is \ncurrently being implemented.\n  Just last month I indicated that people and people's needs should \ncome before the minnow, which is an endangered species in this \nparticular Rio Grande river valley. I wrote a letter to editors of \npapers in our State, which appeared in multiple newspapers around New \nMexico, saying it is now time to face the devastating impacts of laws \nsuch as the Endangered Species Act on people in a desert State like New \nMexico, particularly in the area of water.\n  I got some real arguments and some flak for writing that letter, but \nI also got some very enlightened commentary on the problems facing an \narid State, and I am pleasantly surprised to find that Secretary \nBabbitt has contributed to the debate in a very constructive way.\n  New Mexico, my home State, is very dry. I have found that people \nwithin the beltway and in eastern America are unaware of the critical \nneed for water in the West. With the lack of snow pack and \nprecipitation in our State this year, we are facing a severe drought \nthis summer. In fact, parts of the Rio Grande River, the largest river \nin our State, which runs from north to south and through the city of \nAlbuquerque and many other communities, which has historically gone dry \nat times--this river is already drying up, even this early in the \nseason.\n  My discussion with Secretary Babbitt was extremely timely, since my \noffice received a call this past weekend from the Fish and Wildlife \nrepresentatives saying they were out trying to find out what was \nhappening to the endangered silvery minnow in the dry stretches of the \nriver.\n  You see, the traditional tension among water users is not only \nexacerbated by litigation regarding the needs of the endangered silvery \nminnow, but also obviously exacerbated by all conflicting water needs \nwhen you are in a drought period.\n  In a lawsuit filed by the Forest Guardians and Defenders of Wildlife, \na recent 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision ordered an immediate \ncritical habitat designation for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The \npractical effect of this determination is the fish may get too much of \nthe limited water in the river and some human users may not get any.\n  A Federal district judge in New Mexico allowed a few more months for \nthe designation, but the lawsuit only dramatizes the growing conflict \nbetween the Federal Endangered Species Act and water for Rio Grande \nusers. Secretary Babbitt agreed.\n  I asked the Secretary whether the Interior Department had sufficient \ndata to determine the true water needs to sustain the silvery minnow in \nthe Rio Grande River in New Mexico or to make an accurate economic and \nsocial assessment of the critical habitat designation on existing water \nrights owners.\n  In States like New Mexico, people actually own a proportionate share \nof the water in a river basin. All of those owners and their rights are \npredicated upon State law, which says if you put water to a beneficial \nuse and continue to use it over time, you own the water rights that you \nhave moved off the river and used. From the time you first applied \nwater to beneficial use, you become a priority owner of the water as of \nthat time.\n  Secretary Babbitt replied that his Department does not have \nsufficient information, but it has no choice but to act because of \nFederal court orders.\n  Secretary Babbitt stated that the Endangered Species Act does not \nwork. He hoped that it could be modified to prevent court-ordered, \nunscientific, premature determinations. The courts need to give the \nInterior Department time to gather the data to develop a workable plan \nfor habitat designation.\n  He does not have that data necessary to make a valid, critical \nhabitat designation, and the courts, in trying to follow the act, are \nnot giving him the necessary time. He will be forced to proceed, \nperhaps, with declaring a habitat. He also said he felt that it will \nnot be productive and will be very inflammatory.\n  Litigation has only inflamed passions on both sides of this debate. \nIn addition to the critical habitat litigation, a recent notice of \nintent to sue by the Forest Guardians and others threatens to force the \nrelease of stored water in any of four New Mexico reservoirs to \n``maintain the riparian habitat necessary for the survival'' of two \nendangered species.\n  I am concerned about water necessary for the survival of New \nMexicans, their well-being and way of life. I can only hope that the \npotential needs of this silvery minnow will not drain reservoirs which \nAlbuquerque, Santa Fe, and many others depend on for their water.\n  I do believe that something is terribly wrong when people who own \nrights to water have to forego usage or face penalties for ``taking'' \nof a species without knowing what amount of water is needed for that \nendangered species.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, I grew up in Albuquerque, and I lived \nwithin about eight city blocks of this Rio Grande River. I can tell \nyou, as anyone who has lived in New Mexico for very long can assert, \nthat river ran dry plenty of times. Historical data collected before \nthe irrigation projects or large population increases along the river \nshowed it dried up consistently in certain places. I am no biologist, \nbut that minnow survived.\n  I can assure you that the river water did not run down the entire \nlength of the river from north to south, which is what some say we must \ndo now for the survival of the silvery minnow.\n  Mr. President, it really is upsetting when I understand that some \ndata available indicates that the minnow ``needs'' more water than the \nRio Grande can provide, even without consideration of the needs of \nhuman users.\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\n How can critical habitat be designated without the consideration of \nall users and their needs along the river, especially if they have \nproperty rights and own the water?\n  Some irrigators may have to take their toothbrushes to work because \nthey might be thrown in jail due to a ``take'' of fish that they have \nshared the wet and dry times with for many years.\n  I care about including the silvery minnow. I care about making sure \nwe try our best to save the silvery minnow. I support the intent of the \nEndangered Species Act. I actually was here to vote in favor of it, and \nI did. Today, I agree with Secretary Babbitt that it is broken and does \nnot work. I do not think the problem is necessarily what we designed in \nthe legislation, but I think the court interpretations have made it \nunworkable.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I know the mention of \nmodifying the Endangered Species Act brings howls and scowls from some \nquarters, but I say to you today that it can and it must be improved. I \nam willing to work with my fellow Senators and the administration and \nthose surrounding this issue on all sides to try to find some solutions \nto this problem, both nationally and for my State of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4426-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4426-S4427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MICROSOFT CORPORATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of \ngreat importance to Washington State and our country. I know it is an \nissue the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Washington, shares \nconcern with me. There has been a lot of talk in recent months in the \nmedia and on the Senate floor about Microsoft and the Department of \nJustice. I want to take a few minutes today on the Senate floor and \nshare a few of my thoughts on Microsoft.\n  Recently, Microsoft's competitors and critics have portrayed \nMicrosoft as a serious threat to the technology sector. I can speak \nfrom experience about Microsoft. The Microsoft I know is far different \nthan the ruthless company that has been described in newspaper \narticles. My own professional and political career covers the 20-year \nperiod of Microsoft's growth from the first personal computers to \ntoday's innovative software programs which have spurred consumers and \neducators and students and the business community to the reinvention of \ntheir daily lives.\n  Almost everyone is familiar with Microsoft and its products. Bill \nGates and Paul Allen, the company's founders, had one vision in mind--\nthat one day every home and family would have a PC. It was an ambitious \ngoal but one that seems more attainable every day. Through the years, \nthe company has developed tremendous innovations in the technology \nindustry, but Microsoft is more than the product it makes. I want to \ntake some time today to talk about the things Microsoft does to make \nthe lives of everyone in our country better.\n  I have spent most of my career as an advocate for education. I have \ntraveled all across my State visiting schools and talking to students, \nparents, teachers, and local business leaders. I have worked hard to \nput computers into schools and train teachers in the use of technology \nand make sure that all children, no matter who they are or where they \ncome from, has access to technology and the opportunities such skills \nand knowledge bring.\n  If there is one thing I have learned, it is that providing a good \neducation, if we want to do it, takes the involvement of everyone, and \nthat is particularly true of businesses. Microsoft believes one of its \nmost important goals is to build technology to empower teachers and \nfamilies to make lifelong learning more dynamic, more powerful, and \nmore accessible. To this end, Microsoft contributes more than a half \nbillion dollars annually for education, workforce training, and access \nto technology programs.\n  Microsoft is a leader in education technology. Through its connected \nlearning community effort, they help students and educators and parents \naccess technology, and through its ``Working Connections'' program, \nMicrosoft supports technology training for underserved populations \nthrough the Nation's community college system. If we want our young \npeople to compete for high paying technology jobs, we need to make sure \nthey have the right skills.\n  Microsoft is also a leader in addressing the technological gap in \nmany communities across our country. The Gates Library Foundation \ngrants provide public access to the Internet in underserved areas in \nboth rural and urban settings. Their ongoing financial commitment to \nthis effort is making a real difference for underserved populations and \nareas.\n  I tell you these things today because I know firsthand of all the \ngreat things Microsoft and its employees are doing to bring new \ninventions and opportunities to American consumers.\n  When a grandfather learns how to e-mail his grandchild and play a \nlarger role in that child's life, I appreciate Microsoft's efforts on \nbehalf of families. When a Washington State family finds work in the \ntechnology sector, I appreciate Microsoft's contribution to my State's \neconomy. When a child discovers the Internet as an educational tool for \nthe first time, I see a child filled with excitement, for learning and \nhope for the future, and I thank Microsoft for helping to make that \npossible. That is the Microsoft I see and that is the Microsoft I \nrepresent in the Senate.\n\n  Now, we all know that high technology, and particularly the software \nbusiness, is immensely competitive. Certainly, Microsoft, and all the \nother Washington high-tech firms, compete vigorously. That is the \nnature of these industries. Washington State has become a high-tech \nleader through hard work, a dedicated and creative workforce, and an \nunmatched quality of life.\n  Microsoft has enjoyed immense success over the years and continues to \ngrow at an impressive rate. This success has been hard fought, however, \nand has recently drawn the oversight of the Department of Justice.\n  The Department of Justice has alleged consumer harm, but I have to \nask: Where are the consumers who have been hurt? There is no consumer \nuproar over Microsoft or its business practices. Microsoft's business \nmodel--high volume, product sales at low prices--is both successful and \nproconsumer.\n  Microsoft's consumer benefits are well understood by the American \npublic. A recent nationwide poll conducted by Hart-Teeter found that 73 \npercent of those polled believe Microsoft has benefited consumers, and \n69 percent of those individuals have a favorable impression of \nMicrosoft.\n  While those results do not surprise me, I was surprised to learn that \n66 percent of those polled believe that the Government should not be \npursuing this case against Microsoft, and more than half of the \nrespondents believe that this case represents a poor use of tax \ndollars.\n  I have read the complaint filed by the Justice Department and I have \nfollowed the court proceedings in this case. I have seen how easy it \nmight be to conclude, based on press reports, that Microsoft is faring \npoorly in the courtroom. The vigorous courtroom presentations during \nthe trial have led to an aggressive public relations effort outside the \ncourtroom. I think it is time for the parties in this case to move to a \nmore productive dialogue.\n  The judge in this trial has implored both sides to seek a settlement. \nAnd I agree. Microsoft and the Justice Department should do all they \ncan to meet the judge's request. Both sides should be free to pursue a \nsettlement in private and free from the influence of the public and \ntheir competitors. Settlement of this case will mean that consumers \nwill continue to benefit from Microsoft's innovative products and the \nantitrust claims will be put to rest.\n  At issue here is more than just the fate of Microsoft. The resolution \nof this trial will have broad implications on the software industry as \na whole. Microsoft employs more than 30,000 people, including 15,000 \nfrom my home\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nState. The U.S. software industry employs more than 600,000 people and \nenjoys an annual growth rate of 10 percent.\n  The industry paid more than $36 billion in wages to U.S. employees in \n1996. Software and high-tech companies have been the driving force \nbehind the economic expansion that we continue to experience here in \nthe United States, and much of our economic future lies in these \nknowledge-based industries. We have to be cautious and thoughtful about \nGovernment intervention so that we do not stifle the economic promise \nthat software and high-tech companies offer.\n  Of course, we should not protect companies or guarantee profits and \nmarket share. But we--as legislators and as the Federal Government--\nmust be careful to correctly interpret the state of competition. My own \nview is competition is alive in this industry. Any tech company that \nrests on its current product line or stock price risks a quick and \ndecisive downfall.\n  While Microsoft is headquartered in Redmond, WA, my remarks are more \nthan a defense of a constituent company. My concerns should be felt by \nevery Senator on this floor.\n  A recent piece in the Wall Street Journal offered the following \npassage:\n\n       Dominant firms are the norm in high tech. TV ads boast that \n     virtually all internet traffic travels on Cisco systems. \n     Quicken has 80 percent of the financial-software market. \n     Netscape once boasted of having 90 percent of the browser \n     business. Intel still has 76 percent of the microprocessor \n     business. America Online, Lotus Notes and Oracle all dominate \n     their respective markets. Executives who work in such glass \n     offices should think twice before encouraging zealous \n     prosecutors and gullible reporters to define monopoly as a \n     large share of an artificially tiny market.\n\n  The high-tech industry employs 4.5 million workers across this \ncountry. According to the American Electronics Association, 47 of the \n50 States added high-tech workers between 1994 and 1996. It is not just \nStates such as Washington and California and Texas that are booming as \na result of technology jobs. Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina, Oregon, \nIllinois, Virginia, Florida, and Utah are States that are experiencing \nphenomenal job growth in the tech sector.\n  To maintain this impressive nationwide job growth in the technology \nsector, the Congress and the Federal Government must be careful. Let's \nnot forget that most of this phenomenal growth occurred over the last \ndecade when technology was not on either the Federal or congressional \nradar screen.\n  Before yielding, let me reiterate the points that brought me to the \nfloor today. I hope each of my colleagues will give serious \nconsideration to these issues.\n  Microsoft is a true Washington State and American success story that \nis still unfolding for the benefit of consumers, business and the \ngeneral public. Microsoft has a particularly impressive record of \ncommunity activism, and I am especially proud of the company's efforts \nin the area of education.\n  The ongoing court case is of utmost interest and importance to me in \nthe work I do in the Senate. I implore all parties to give the legal \nsystem an opportunity to work. Judge Jackson has urged both parties to \nseek a settlement, and I strongly encourage them to heed the judge's \nadvice.\n  Finally, the outcome of the Microsoft case will have long-term \nramifications on our Nation's economy. Technology is growing rapidly, \nand we all know many technology jobs are high-paying, family-wage jobs. \nThe United States is a technology superpower. The Federal Government \nmust use its immense powers with care and caution in monitoring the \ntechnology sector. When the Federal Government interjects itself in \nthis intensely competitive sector of our economy, it must ensure that \nit does not do serious damage to our economy.\n  Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to pay attention to the \nMicrosoft case. I look forward to discussing this issue with my \ncolleagues again on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4427-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4427-S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EDUCATION AND CLASS SIZE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I want to turn \nquickly to a different topic, and that is on the issue of education and \nclass size.\n  I know my colleagues have watched me come to the floor and talk \nnumerous times about how important it is that we reduce class sizes in \nthe grades of 1 through 3. I have talked about the research in this \ncountry which has shown that reducing class size makes a difference for \nour students.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report from \nTennessee that has just come out. It is called the Star Report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Project STAR News]\n\n            Benefits of Small Classes Pay Off at Graduation\n\n\n   project star finds small classes in K-3 linked to greater student \n  achievement, better grades, lower dropout rates, and higher college \n                              aspirations\n\n       Washington, D.C.--A ground-breaking Tennessee-based class \n     size study has found that public school students placed in \n     small classes in grades K-3 continue to outperform students \n     in larger classes right through high school graduation.\n       Researchers for Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement \n     Ratio)--whose earlier findings helped form the basis for \n     class size reduction in some 20 states--today reported that \n     students placed in small class sizes in grades K-3 have \n     better high school graduation rates, higher grade point \n     averages, and are more inclined to pursue higher education.\n       ``This research adds to the evidence we have compiled over \n     the past 14 years,'' said Dr. Helen Pate-Bain, who convinced \n     the Tennessee state legislature to provide funding for the \n     initial STAR research. ``The project's findings indicate that \n     students placed in small classes in grades K-3 continue to \n     benefit from that experience in grades 4-12.''\n       The original STAR research tracked the progress of an \n     average of 6,500 students each year in 79 schools between \n     1985 and 1989 (and 11,600 students overall). It found that \n     children who attended small classes (13-17 pupils per \n     teacher) in kindergarten through grade 3 outperformed \n     students in larger classes (22-25 pupils) in both reading and \n     math on the Stanford Achievement Test for elementary \n     students. The second phase of the STAR research found that \n     even after returning to larger classes in grade 4, STAR's \n     small class students continued to outperform their peers who \n     had been in larger class sizes.\n       At a news conference held today at the National Press Club, \n     STAR researchers released a new wave of findings:\n       Students in small classes are more likely to pursue \n     college: STAR students who attended small classes--and black \n     students in that group in particular--were more likely to \n     take the ACT or SAT college entrance exams, according to \n     Princeton University economist Dr. Alan B. Krueger, who \n     researched test data linked to the Project STAR database. \n     ``Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-\n     white gap in the probability of taking college-entrance exam \n     by more than half,'' Krueger said.\n       Small classes lead to higher graduation rates: Preliminary \n     data from participating STAR school districts in Tennessee \n     show that students in small classes were more likely to \n     graduate on schedule; they were less likely to drop out of \n     high school; and they were more likely to graduate in the top \n     25% of their classes, according to Dr. Jayne Boyd-Zaharias, a \n     STAR researcher since 1986. In addition. Boyd-Zaharias found \n     that small class students graduated with higher grade point \n     averages (GPAs) than regular class size students.\n       Students in small classes achieve at higher levels: Three \n     other reearchers--Dr. Jeremy D. Finn, professor of education \n     at SUNY Buffalo, Susan B. Gerber of SUNY Buffalo, and Charles \n     M. Achilles, Ed.D., of Eastern Michigan University, together \n     with Boyd-Zaharias--released new findings showing that STAR \n     students who attended small classes in grades K-3 were \n     between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular-class peers in \n     math, reading, and science in each of grades 4, 6, and 8. \n     ``Our analyses show that at least three years in a small \n     class are necessary in order for the benefits to be sustained \n     through later grades,'' wrote the researchers. ``Further, the \n     benefits of having been in a small class in the primary years \n     generally increase from grade to grade.''\n       Class size is different from pupil/teacher ratio: Achilles, \n     one of the original STAR researchers, explained the \n     difference between class size (the number of students \n     assigned to a teacher) and pupil/teacher ratio (the total \n     number of students divided by the total number of educators \n     in a school). Many ``class size'' studies, he noted, have \n     relied on pupil/teacher ratios to make their case. The STAR \n     research is able to track students based on specific class \n     size. Achilles noted that some 20 states--including Michigan, \n     California, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Utah, Illinois, Indiana, \n     New York, Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, Massachusetts, South \n     Carolina, and Wisconsin--have initiated or considered STAR-\n     like class size reduction efforts.\n       Teachers who taught small classes in Project STAR support \n     the program strongly.\n       ``All educators instinctively know that the smaller the \n     class size, the more individual attention a teacher can \n     provide a student,'' said Sandy Heinrich, a teacher at \n     Granbery Elementary School in Davidson County, Tenn., who \n     taught first grade in the STAR program in 1986. ``The more \n     individual attention per student, the more learning and \n     personal growth each student can enjoy. I was\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n     fortunate enough to witness this notion first-hand.''\n       The STAR research is the only large-scale, long-term class \n     size research of its kind. Dr. Frederick Mosteller, a \n     professor of mathematical statistics at Harvard University, \n     said this about STAR in 1995: ``Because a controlled \n     education experiment (as distinct from a sample survey) of \n     this quality, magnitude, and duration is a rarity, it is \n     important that both educators and policymakers have access to \n     its statistical information and understand its \n     implications.''\n       In fact, the STAR research provided support for federal \n     legislation that proposes to reduce class sizes by hiring \n     100,000 new teachers in grades K-3 nationwide.\n       Last fall, Congress appropriated $1.2 billion in the FY \n     1999 federal budget as a ``down-payment'' on that \n     legislation, enough to hire approximately 30,000 teachers for \n     one year. Future funding will require congressional \n     authorization and additional annual appropriations. Pate-Bain \n     was scheduled to share the new STAR findings with a number of \n     education policy experts and Members of Congress later in the \n     day.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This is a report about a study that researchers in \nTennessee began many years ago in relation to reduced class size in the \nfirst through third grades. They followed those young people all the \nway through to the point where they are now graduating this year.\n  It is a very impressive study. It shows exactly what I have been \ndebating on the floor of the Senate; and that is that students who are \nin smaller class sizes in the first through third grades are more \nlikely to pursue college, have higher graduation rates, they achieve at \nhigher levels, and it makes a difference in discipline.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that we have to get back to this issue. \nI urge all of my colleagues to take a second look and recognize that we \ncan make a difference by continuing our support of class size reduction \nand teacher training here in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 23 Senators on the list that I send \nto the desk be added as cosponsors to my bill, S. 564, the Class Size \nReduction and Teacher Quality Act of 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, more than 15 years ago, Congress directed \nthe Department of Energy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal \nof nuclear waste created by commercial nuclear power plants and our \nnation's defense programs. Today, there are more than 100,000 tons of \nspent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with. Over a year has now passed \nsince the DOE was absolutely obligated under the NWPA of 1982 to begin \naccepting spent nuclear fuel from utility sites. Today DOE is no closer \nin coming up with a solution. This is unacceptable. This is in fact \nwrong--so say the Federal Courts. The law is clear, and DOE must meet \nits obligation. If the Department of Energy does not live up to its \nresponsibility, Congress will act.\n  I am encouraged that Congressmen Bliley, Barton, Upton, and the rest \nof the House of Representatives have begun to address this issue. It is \ngood to see a bipartisan effort for a safe, practical and workable \nsolution for America's spent fuel storage needs. The proper storage of \nspent fuel is not a partisan issue --it is a safety issue. The solution \nbeing advanced is certainly more responsible than just leaving waste at \n105 separate power plants in 34 states all across the nation. There are \n29 sites which will reach their storage capacity by the end of this \nyear.\n  Where is DOE? Where is the solution? All of America's experience in \nwaste management over the last twenty-five years of improving \nenvironmental protection has taught Congress that safe, effective waste \nhandling practices entail using centralized, permitted, and controlled \nfacilities to gather and manage accumulated waste.\n  Mr. President, the management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize \non this knowledge and experience. Nearly 100 communities have spent \nfuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and it needs to be gathered and \naccumulated. This lack of a central storage capacity could very \npossibly cause the closing of several nuclear power plants. These \naffected plants produce nearly 20% of America's electricity. Closing \nthese plants just does not make sense.\n  Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future, and \nmust remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to \nmaintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity. \nNuclear power, at the same time, allows the nation to directly and \neffectively address increasingly stringent air quality requirements.\n  Both the House and the Senate passed a bill in the 105th Congress to \nrequire the DOE to build this interim storage site in Nevada, but \nunfortunately this bill didn't complete the legislative process because \nof time constraints. We ran out of time. I challenge my colleagues in \nboth chambers of the 106th Congress to get this environmental bill \ndone. The citizens, in some 100 communities where fuel is stored today, \nchallenge the Congress to act and get this bill done. The nuclear \nindustry has already committed to the federal government about $15 \nbillion toward building the facility. In fact, the nuclear industry \ncontinues to pay about $650 million a year in fees for storage of spent \nfuel. It is time for the federal government to honor its commitment to \nthe American people and the power community. It is time for the federal \ngovernment to protect those 100 committees.\n  To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states \nand electricity consumers, the 106th Congress must mandate completion \nof this program--a program that includes temporary storage, a site for \npermanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move \nused fuel from plants to the storage facility.\n  Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and \nunacceptable. Clearly, the only remedy to stopping these continued \ndelays is timely action in the 106th Congress on this legislation. By \nmoving this process, which must also include the work of the Senate, \nthe House's work can be improved. Let's move forward and get this bill \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4428-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4428-S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING ABHISHEK GUPTA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npraise the outstanding accomplishments of a distinguished young man \nfrom Florida. At the age of 17, Abhishek Gupta has succeeded in making \na greater contribution towards the alleviation of pain and suffering on \na global scale than most people can boast of in a lifetime. Last \nNovember, Abhishek organized 9 other students and initiated a project \ndesigned to provide humanitarian relief to underprivileged citizens in \nhis Southern Florida community and throughout the world.\n  In a rare exemplification of compassion and determination, Abhishek, \na junior at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, created a non-\nprofit organization called ``Clothes, Food and Education for the Poor \nand Needy.'' Drawing on Abhishek's inspiration, this group worked \ntoward the goal of raising $50,000 to provide crucial relief for \nnumerous families about whom Abhishek had read in several local \nnewspaper articles.\n  Abhishek went to work lobbying corporate sponsors to pay for \noperational expenses, and entreating members of his community to help \nhim meet his goal. Ultimately, he exceeded his own expectations by \nraising $60,000 in a matter of weeks. He channeled this money toward \nhelping impoverished children in Southern Florida and victims of \nHurricane Mitch in Central America.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that the most effective way to \ngive charity is to give time--money comes second. I want to stress that \nAbhishek did not only formulate the infrastructure for raising such a \nlofty sum, he also spent part of his Christmas vacation accompanying a \nmedical team to Honduras and Nicaragua in order to contribute \npersonally. During his week in Central America, Abhishek helped \nadminister food, clothing and medical supplies to the disaster victims, \nand\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\nprovided direct medical aid to nearly 600 patients who were in dire \nneed of treatment.\n  ``Clothes, Food and Education for the Poor and Needy'' is continuing \nto collect donations for relief of the downtrodden, and I commend \nAbhishek Gupta for his dedication to such a worthy cause. It is rare \nthat so young a citizen can play such a direct role in both reducing \nhuman pain and suffering, and providing inspiration to old and young \nalike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4429-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, our former colleague in the Senate from \nArkansas, David Pryor, has a new mission, and I believe that all of us \nwill be greatly inspired by his commitment and dedication.\n  During the spring term this year, Senator Pryor has been a fellow at \nthe Institute of Politics in the Kennedy School of Government at \nHarvard University. Last week, touched by the tragic plight of the \nhundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo, he left for Tirana, \nAlbania to be a volunteer with the International Rescue Committee, \nwhich is dedicated to easing the plight of the refugees.\n  I commend our former colleague for the inspiring example he is \nsetting of service to those most in need. His action clearly and deeply \nimpressed his students at Harvard. An article in the Harvard Crimson \nlast week reported his decision and his departure for Albania. I \nbelieve the article will be of interest to all of us in the Senate, and \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Harvard Crimson, Apr. 21, 1999]\n\nIOP Fellow Pryor Heads to Balkan States--Former Senator To Aid Kosovar \n                                Refugees\n\n                          (By Alysson R. Ford)\n\n       Since the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia began almost a month \n     ago, members of the Harvard community have expressed concern \n     about the plight of Kosovar refugees in peace vigils, panels, \n     and class discussions on Kosovo.\n       But David Pryor--a spring term fellow at the Institute of \n     Politics (IOP) and a former U.S. senator and governor of \n     Arkansas--has taken his desire to help ease the refugee \n     crisis a few steps further.\n       After notifying colleagues and students of his decision \n     Monday, Pryor departed yesterday for the Albanian capital of \n     Tirana as volunteer for the International Rescue Committee \n     (IRC).\n       In a letter to Director of the IOP Alan K. Simpson, Pryor \n     expressed that he wanted to do something concrete for those \n     devastated by the conflict.\n       Pryor wrote that he did not know exactly how he would help \n     the Kosovar refugees but added that he felt it was important \n     to offer his assistance.\n       ``What I am doing is something I must do. I don't know \n     exactly where I will be, nor do I know what my assignment \n     will be, I just hope I can make a contribution--even though \n     small,'' Pryor wrote. ``I was too young for Hitler, too self-\n     preoccupied for [the civil rights struggle in] Selma, and \n     this time I've got to do something.''\n       Pryor estimated in his letter that he would be gone 30 to \n     60 days with the IRC, an organization created in 1933 to \n     assist victims who were fleeing from Nazi Germany. The group \n     has been in the Balkans since 1991, according to Edward P. \n     Bligh, IRC vice president of communications.\n       Most recently, the IRC has sent volunteers and aid to \n     Albania and Macedonia to help the refugees who have been \n     streaming out of Kosovo. The group is helping to shelter \n     refugees and develop water supplies and sanitary facilities. \n     It also provides medical services and has special programs \n     for children, Bligh said.\n       Pryor also wrote in his letter that the IRC volunteers had \n     inspired him.\n       ``To be able to watch and know these gallant, and yes, \n     believing, young men and women who want to serve restores \n     faith and binds our hopes together,'' Pryor wrote.\n       But those who know Pryor said he is the one providing \n     inspiration to others.\n       ``Here's a man that has dedicated his life to serving the \n     people of Arkansas [and] the people of the U.S.,'' said IOP \n     fellow and former South Carolina governor David Beasley. ``He \n     makes us proud to be American, and he inspires us all.''\n       Simpson spoke of the positive example that Pryor is \n     setting, particularly to the often-cynical students he sees \n     on campus.\n       ``When [students] look around cynically at politicians and \n     those looking only to serve themselves, they'll remember \n     David Pryor [as a positive example],'' Simpson said.\n       Pryor taught a study group at the IOP this semester called \n     ``Everything (Well Almost) You Ever Wanted To Know About \n     Winning and Holding Public Office But Were Afraid to Ask.''\n       Students who know Pryor said they were impressed by his \n     commitment to helping others.\n       ``For this 65-plus-year-old, former U.S. senator to just \n     decide to go off to Albania . . . I think it really \n     exemplifies the kind of person he is and the kind of senator \n     he was,'' said Eugene Krupitsky '02, one of Pryor's study \n     group liaisons.\n       ``It was just amazing to think of this individual just \n     leaving the IOP early to go do community action. It's \n     exemplary that he is bridging the gap between politics and \n     community service,'' he added.\n       In his letter, Pryor wrote of a friend from his home state \n     who has a sign painted on the side of his truck that says, \n     ``When you wake up, get up, and when you get up, do \n     something.''\n       ``That's what I intend to do,'' Pryor wrote. ``I'm going to \n     go over and do something.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4429-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4429-S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW CONTROL AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Smith-Snowe \nCombined Sewer Overflow Control and Partnership Act of 1999. If \nenacted, this bill will eliminate or appropriately control combined \nsewer overflow (CSO) discharges in this country by the year 2010. This \nlegislation will also help ratepayers in at least 53 communities \nthroughout the state of Maine and over 1,000 other communities around \nthe country. Presently, over 43 million people in the U.S. are \nincurring the high costs of trying to overcome the problem of combined \nsewer overflows because of the lack of federal statute and funding to \nmeet federal sewage treatment mandates for these CSO communities.\n  Mr. President, CSOs are by far the single largest public works \nproject in the history of almost every CSO community. When the Maine \nMunicipal Association members met with me last month, they informed me \nof communities where people are facing paying more in sewer rates than \nthey will owe in property taxes. This, to me, is unacceptable.\n  Most, but not all, of the combined sewer systems are located \nprimarily in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas where sewer lines and \nstormwater collection systems were first constructed in the 1800s and \nearly 1900s. Typically, sewer lines designated to carry raw sewage from \nurban residential areas and business were laid first. These were \nfollowed by stormwater drainage systems designed to collect rainwater \nduring storms to reduce or eliminate urban flooding. In many cases, \nsewer lines and stormwater conduits were connected into a combined \nsewer, which served as a single collection system to transport both \nsewage and stormwater. Eleven states in the two geographic areas of New \nEngland and the Great Lakes account for 85 percent of the water-quality \nproblems attributed to CSOs nationwide.\n  Sewer overflow problems arise mainly during wet weather, causing an \noverload of the systems, and the untreated or partially treated waste \nwater discharges through combined sewer overflow outfalls into \nreceiving waters such as rivers, lakes, estuaries and bays. The CSOs \nare the last remaining discharges from a point, or known, source\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nof untreated or partially treated sewage into the nation's waters.\n  The federal government has been long on regulation and short on \nfinancial assistance. The CSO problem was first addressed when Congress \nrevisited the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, better known as the \nClean Water Act, almost three decades ago. The subsequent Clean Water \nAct Amendments of 1972 established the fundamental principles and \nobjectives of a national wastewater management policy. To implement \nthese goals, a national program was created to regulate the discharge \nof pollutant into surface waters, the National Pollutant Discharge \nElimination System, or NPDES. This system required outfalls for \nindustrial process waste and sewage from municipal treatment plants. \nIndividual states were allowed to assume responsibility for the \nadministration of NPDES once their permitting processes were approved \nby the EPA.\n  Maine and 37 other states operate EPA-approved NPDES permitting \nprograms. The law requires that state water-quality standards be \nconsistent with federal policy, but, if necessary to achieve the act's \nobjectives, states are allowed to impose water-quality standards more \nstringent than those required by federal regulations.\n  Section 10(a)(4) of the CWA Amendments of 1972 explicitly linked the \nachievement of national water-quality goals to federal financial \nassistance for municipalities affected by the new mandate by creating \nthe Construction Grants Program (CGP) that provided subsidies for the \nconstruction of publicly owned treatment works. In Section 516(b), the \nEPA was charged with administering the program, and was required to \ndevelop biennial estimates of the cost of construction of all needed \npublicly owned treatment works in each of the States.\n  In the past, federal funds have paid for as much as 75 percent of the \nconstruction costs for water treatment and sewage facilities. In recent \nyears, federal contributions have been limited to low interest loans \nrather than grants, through a revolving loan fund (SRF), and local \nratepayers and taxpayers bear the burden of rehabilitating, upgrading \nand for operating costs. It is clear that more federal funding \nassistance is needed so that CSO communities can be given policy and \nfinancial tools with which to handle their ongoing CSO problem of sewer \noverflows into our rivers and bays.\n  The Smith-Snowe CSO bill amends the Clean Water Act and addresses the \nproblems faced by such CSO cities and towns, 45 in my state alone. The \npurpose of the bill is to move forward with technology-based controls \nthat are the most cost effective and to make sure communities do not \nput in controls that are not actually needed. The bill seeks to codify \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's rational approach to CSO control, \nits ``CSO Policy of April, 1994''. Codification is necessary since the \nimplementation of EPA's CSO policy has been inadequate to date.\n  The bill also provides congressional approval of the inclusion of \nrealistic water quality standards compliance schedules for CSO control \nin permits and other enforceable documents issued as called for in the \n1994 EPA Control Policy.\n  Initiation of the water quality standards/designated use review and \nrevision process called for in EPA's Control Policy must also occur \nbefore requiring long-term CSO control plan implementation. The \nguidelines that the EPA is currently developing to assist communities \nfor implementing measures for the control of CSOs are only just that, \nguidelines, and could potentially be changed after a community has \nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars following them. CSO communities \nneed certainty, not changing guidelines after costly measures have \nalready been taken.\n  The bill also authorizes federal grant funding assistance for CSO \ncommunities to implement long term CSO controls.\n  The problem of CSOs has been a long standing issue Mr. President, for \nwhich I cosponsored similar legislation in the House in the 102nd \nCongress. The CSO problem is not going to go away, but only become a \nbigger financial burden for our CSO communities.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have agreed to cosponsor the Smith-\nSnowe CSO bill and urge those not yet cosponsoring to join us in \nsupport of this much needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, Mr. Hanrahan, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1569.

A bill to provide for the review and classification of \nphysician assistant positions in the Federal Government, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                     physician assistant equity act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Nickles, Rockefeller, Inouye, and Harkin to introduce \nlegislation that directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to \ndevelop a classification standard appropriate to the occupation of \nphysician assistant.\n  Physician assistants are a part of a growing field of health care \nprofessionals that make quality health care available and affordable in \nunderserved areas throughout our country. Because the physician \nassistant profession was very young when OPM first developed employment \ncriteria in 1970, the agency adapted the nursing classification system \nfor physician assistants. Today, this is no longer appropriate. \nPhysician assistants have different education and training requirements \nthan nurses and they are licensed and evaluated according to different \ncriteria.\n  The inaccurate classification of physician assistants had led to \nrecruitment and retention problems of physician assistants in federal \nagencies, usually caused by low starting salaries and low salary caps. \nBecause it is recognized that physician assistants provide cost-\neffective health care, this is an important problem to resolve.\n  This legislation mandates that OPM review this classification in \nconsultation with physician assistants and the organizations that \nrepresent physician assistants. The bill specifically states that OPM \nshould consider the educational and practice qualifications of the \nposition as well as the treatment of physician assistants in the \nprivate sector in this review.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will make an important \ncorrection that will help federal agencies make better use of these \nproviders of cost-effective, high quality health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 910.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Noxious Weed Coordination and Plant Protection Act of 1999''--a \ncomprehensive bill which will focus the effort of federal agencies in \nfighting noxious weeds and other plant pests.\n  In January I introduced the Plant Protection Act, S. 321. This bill \ngenerated a lot of discussion and several suggestions for improvement, \nmuch of which is reflected in the bill I am introducing today. The \nNoxious Weed Coordination and Plant Protection Act of 1999 retains most \nof S. 321 but includes a section on federal coordination of noxious \nweed removal.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill and a section-by-section analysis \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the detection, control, eradication, suppression, \n     prevention, and retardation of the spread of plant pests and \n     noxious weeds is necessary for the protection of the \n     agriculture, environment, and economy of the United States;\n       (2) biological control--\n       (A) is often a desirable, low-risk means of ridding crops \n     and other plants of plant pests and noxious weeds; and\n       (B) should be facilitated by the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     Federal agencies, and States, whenever feasible;\n       (3) the smooth movement of enterable plants, plant \n     products, certain biological control organisms, or other \n     articles into, out of, or within the United States is vital \n     to the economy of the United States and should be facilitated \n     to the extent practicable;\n       (4) markets could be severely impacted by the introduction \n     or spread of plant pests or noxious weeds into or within the \n     United States;\n       (5) the unregulated movement of plants, plant products, \n     biological control organisms, plant pests, noxious weeds, and \n     articles capable of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds \n     would present an unacceptable risk of introducing or \n     spreading plant pests or noxious weeds;\n       (6) the existence on any premises in the United States of a \n     plant pest or noxious weed new to or not known to be widely \n     prevalent in or distributed within and throughout the United \n     States could threaten crops, other plants, and plant products \n     of the United States and burden interstate commerce or \n     foreign commerce; and\n       (7) all plants, plant products, biological control \n     organisms, plant pests, noxious weeds, or articles capable of \n     harboring plant pests or noxious weeds regulated under this \n     Act are in or affect interstate commerce or foreign commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

TRANSFER AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority To Transfer Certain Funds.--In connection \n     with an emergency in which a plant pest or noxious weed \n     threatens a segment of the agricultural production of the \n     United States, the Secretary may transfer from other \n     appropriations or funds available to the agencies or \n     corporations of the Department of Agriculture such amounts as \n     the Secretary considers necessary to be available in the \n     emergency for the arrest, control, eradication, and \n     prevention of the dissemination of the plant pest or noxious \n     weed and for related expenses.\n       (b) Availability.--Any funds transferred under this section \n     shall remain available for such purposes until expended.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--The first section of Public Law \n     97-46 (7 U.S.C. 147b) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``plant pests or''; and\n       (2) by striking ``section 102 of the Act of September 21, \n     1944, as amended (7 U.S.C. 147a), and''.\n                                  ____\n\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of the Noxious Weed Coordination and Plant \n                             Protection Act\n\n       Sections 1, 2, and 3--The first three sections of the bill \n     serve as a ``road map'' to the rest of the legislation. \n     Section 1 consists entirely of the title and table of \n     contents. Section 2 outlines certain findings as to why the \n     legislation is necessary. Section 3 provides the definitions \n     used throughout the rest of the bill.\n\n\n                      title one--plant protection\n\n       Section 101--Outlaws the importation or interstate movement \n     of a plant pest (defined in Section 3 as anything that has \n     the potential to directly or indirectly injure or cause \n     damage to or disease in a plant product) without a permit \n     from the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       Section 102--Grants USDA the authority to block or regulate \n     the importation or movement of a noxious weed, or other \n     plant, if the Secretary determines that such a prohibition is \n     necessary to prevent the weed's introduction into a new area. \n     In addition, USDA is required to publish a list of noxious \n     weeds that are prohibited from entering the country or whose \n     interstate movement is restricted and allows a procedure to \n     have weeds added to or removed from the list. USDA would also \n     publish a list of control agents which may be transported \n     without restriction.\n       Section 103--Requires the Secretary of the Treasury (who \n     oversees the Customs Service) to notify USDA of the arrival \n     of any plant or noxious weed upon its arrival at a port of \n     entry and to hold it at the border until it can be inspected \n     and authorized for entry.\n       Section 104--Authorizes USDA to hold, seize, quarantine, \n     treat, or destroy any noxious weed or plant pest that it \n     finds in violation of this law.\n       Section 105--Authorizes USDA to declare ``extraordinary \n     emergencies'' when necessary to confront the importation or \n     to\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n     fight the spread of a noxious weed. In addition, the bill \n     outlines what actions are authorized during such an \n     emergency.\n       Section 106--Allows a plant owner to seek compensation from \n     USDA if the owner ``establishes that the destruction or \n     disposal'' of this plant or other property ``was not \n     authorized under this Act'' if he does so within one year of \n     the action.\n       Section 107--Makes USDA the federal department in charge of \n     the fight against grasshoppers and Mormon Crickets on all \n     federal lands. In addition to the authority, funds to carry \n     out the program would be transferred from other federal \n     agencies and departments to USDA. It also establishes a cost \n     sharing program in which the federal govenrmetn will assume \n     the entire cost of fighting grasshoppers and Mormon Crickets \n     on federally owned land, one-half of the cost on state owned \n     land, and one-third the cost on private land.\n       Section 108--Allows the USDA to develop a means by which it \n     can certify plants to be free of pests or noxious weeds.\n\n\n                 title two--inspection and enforcement\n\n       Section 201--Allows USDA inspectors to stop and inspect \n     persons and items entering the country or moving from one \n     state to another in search of noxious weeds or plant pests. \n     In addition, USDA is authorized to seek a warrant to search \n     private premises for weeds and pests.\n       Section 202--Allows USDA to ``gather and compile \n     information'' needed to carry out its investigations.\n       Section 203--Authorizes and restricts how USDA may issue a \n     subpoena in its investigations.\n       Section 204--Establishes criminal and civil penalties for \n     anyone who ``knowingly violates this Act,'' forges or \n     counterfeits a permit, or uses a permit unlawfully. Such a \n     violation would be a misdemeanor punishable with a maximum \n     penalty of 1 year in prison and/or a fine of up to $250,000 \n     (limits are set in the case that the action is taken by an \n     individual [$50,000] or done without the intention of \n     monetary gain [$1,000]).\n       Section 205--Authorizes the Attorney General to enforce the \n     Act.\n       Section 206--Locates enforcement at a federal court where \n     the violation occurs or where the defendant lives.\n\n\n                 title three--miscellaneous provisions\n\n       Sections 301, 302, and 303--Authorizes USDA to seek \n     cooperation with other agencies, states, associations, and \n     individuals in fulfilling its responsibilities.\n       Section 304--Stipulates that the regulations against \n     mailing a plant pest or noxious weed included in the bill \n     will not interfere with an employee of the U.S. Postal \n     Service and his responsibility in handling the mail.\n       Section 305--Authorizes USDA to issue regulations and \n     orders needed to carry out the Act.\n       Section 306--Repeals federal laws which have been \n     superseded or replaced by the Act.\n\n\n                    title four--federal coordination\n\n       Section 401--Provides the definitions used throughout the \n     rest of the title.\n       Section 402--Establishes a multi-agency Invasive Species \n     Council and outlines the duties of the Council.\n       Section 403--Directs the Secretary of the Interior to \n     establish an advisory committee to provide information and \n     advice to the Council.\n       Secton 404--Gives the Council nine months to develop a \n     National Invasive Species Action Plan with public \n     participation and coordination with State plans concerning \n     invasive species.\n\n\n              title five--authorization for appropriations\n\n       Secton 501--Authorizes Congress to appropriate the funds \n     necessary to carry out the Act.\n       Section 502--Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     transfer other USDA funds to the programs authorized by the \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Abraham, and \n        Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 912. A bill to modify the rate of basic pay and the classification \nof positions for certain United States Border Patrol agents, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          border patrol recruitment and retention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison to introduce the Border Patrol Recruitment and Retention Act \nof 1999.\n  In 1996, the Congress passed unanimously, and the President signed, \nmy amendment to the Immigration Reform Act requiring that 1,000 Border \nPatrol agents be hired each year between the years 1997 and 20001. Last \nyear, Congress provided the Immigration and Naturalization Service with \n$93 million to hire, train, and deploy 1,000 agents during 1999.\n  We have now learned that the INS will not come close to hiring the \nrequired 1,000 agents during this year; and, in fact, may only hire 200 \nto 400. As a result, states that need the increased personnel the most \nwill not receive them. Arizona, which itself was slated to receive 400 \nnew agents, will now receive only 100 to 150 new agents. That's not \nnearly enough. Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector apprehended \n60,537 illegal immigrants last month and seized over 28,000 pounds of \nmarijuana, an all-time record in both areas. Project that annually and \nthen factor in the estimate that 3 times as many illegal aliens \nsuccessfully cross the border than are apprehended. The situation is so \nout of control in Arizona that recently, 600 people attempted to cross \nthe border en masse in broad daylight. Some Arizonans are growing so \nanxious about the upsurge of illegal activity in their community that \nthey have attempted to take matters into their own hands. Unless \nArizona is given more federal personnel and resources to get things \nunder control, many are worried about how this situation will develop.\n  What the INS says is that it is having recruitment and retention \nproblems, and so it cannot take on the added personnel at this time. \nCouldn't the INS foresee some of these recruitment issues more than two \nmonths before now? And couldn't INS do something to correct the problem \nof recruitment?\n  We concluded Congress would have to initiate some solutions. \nTherefore, Senator Hutchison and I introduce this bill today to try to \nbegin to address some of the Border Patrol's recruitment and retention \nproblems. It is not a panacea, and we need to continue to explore \nadditional ways of improving recruitment and retention; but it will \nopen the debate and will provide for a much-needed increase in salary \nlevels for the Border Patrol.\n  Currently Border Patrol agents are, for the most part, capped at a \nGS-9 level (currently, only about 20 percent of agents, namely those \nwho perform special duties, are raised to the GS-11 level). The Border \nPatrol Retention and Recruitment Enhancement Act would allow all agents \nwith a successful year's experience at a GS-9 level to move up to a GS-\n11 level. This would enable agents to move from an approximate $34,000 \nannually salary to an approximate $41,000 annually salary. And that's \nfair. These agents have a tough time in their assignments. They must \nspeak two languages. They deserve a raise.\n  The bill would also establish the Office of Border Patrol Recruitment \nand Retention, which would allow the Border Patrol to be more involved \nin recruiting and hiring and will direct the Border Patrol to make \npolicy suggestions about ways to improve recruitment and retention. \nCurrently, the INS and the Office of Personnel Management are \nresponsible for all such activity. We have heard testimony from Border \nPatrol chiefs who say that the Border Patrol has unique and specific \nknowledge about how to enhance these efforts.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not solve all of the Border Patrol's \nrecruiting and retention problems, but it will be a responsible start \ntoward increasing the numbers of agents who will so honorably protect \nour nation's borders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Kyl for his \nleadership on this bill that we have just introduced.\n  Senator Kyl and I, along with Senators Domenici, Gramm, McCain, and \nBingaman, have been very concerned about the Border Patrol issue that \nfaces our border States. In fact, we were stunned this week to learn \nthat though Congress has authorized and authorized funding for 1,000 \nnew Border Patrol agents that in fact only 200 to 400 are coming on \nline this year.\n  Mr. President, that is stunning. That is stunning when you consider \nthat last year the Border Patrol apprehended 1.5 million persons \nillegally crossing the border, and fully half of those were at my State \nof Texas. In fact, the McAllen Border Patrol sector, which includes \nBrownsville, Harlingen and McAllen, had the largest number of drug \nseizures of all Border Patrol Sectors in the United States--1,610 drug \nseizures just in that one sector. The drugs apprehended have a value of \nover $410 million. Two Border Patrol agents in the McAllen sector lost \ntheir lives last year in a raid of a drug trafficker's hideout. It was \nthe first time Border Patrol agents had been killed during such a raid.\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\n  Senator Abraham held a hearing this week, and the Chief of the Border \nPatrol told us that he has not been able to recruit and retain and, in \nfact, is losing 10 percent of the agents. For every one that we are \nbringing on, we are losing two, because our Border Patrol agents are \ncapped at a journeymen-9 level. That translates to roughly $34,000 a \nyear for an agent that has several years of experience. For an agent, \nthat is certainly a job of law enforcement at its toughest.\n  Under the bill that we have just introduced, the agents would be \neligible to be paid at a journeymen-11 level, which is approximately a \n$7,000 increase.\n  This pay raise is also consistent with the pay of other law \nenforcement agencies that work along the border. One significant \nproblem for the Border Patrol has been that many agents go to work for \nthe Customs Service, or the DEA when they reach the cap. So they get to \ntheir cap, their experience, and they go over to another Federal agency \nthat pays better.\n  We must solve this discrepancy among Federal agencies in the same \nplace that are doing similar kinds of tough duty work for hazardous \npay. Yet, the Border Patrol is $7,000 less than Customs and DEA agents. \nWe must correct this discrepancy if we are going to get control of our \nborders, which are a sieve right now with drugs moving through at an \nalarming rate.\n  This is not just a Texas-Arizona-New Mexico-California problem. The \ndrugs that come in from our borders go right up into Ohio, Michigan, \nNew Hampshire, Oregon--all over our country, because we don't have the \nproper control of our border.\n  Mr. President, there is not a higher priority for the Federal \nGovernment than to have the sovereign borders of the United States safe \nfrom illegal drugs coming into our country, and most certainly illegal \nimmigrants that have not gone through the proper procedures so that we \nknow who is coming into our country and what their record is so that we \nhave the control that any sovereign nation would have.\n  Mr. President, this is an emergency. It is why Senator Kyl and I have \nintroduced this legislation today, because we are in a crisis. This is \na war. It is a war on drugs, and we are losing. We are losing our young \npeople in this country. Part of the problem is that we are not putting \nthe resources into law enforcement.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, that I am disappointed to the maximum \nthat our INS has money from Congress and authorization from Congress to \nhire 1,000 agents and they have only been able to come up with 200 to \n400 agents this year. That means we are 600 to 800 short, as we speak, \nfrom what was allocated this year, and which was given priority by \nCongress. I think the INS needs to make this a priority. We are going \nto give them the pay increases with the bill that we have just \nintroduced today.\n  Senator Gregg, who has been a strong supporter of our efforts to beef \nup the border, has said he will work with us to reprogram money from \nthis year's budget for these pay increases so that we will hopefully be \nable to do this on an expedited basis by October 1 of this year.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to retain agents knowing that this pay \nraise is in the pipeline. But, Mr. President, it also takes an effort \nby the INS to make it a priority to fill these slots, because if they \ndon't look at a little more creative approach to recruiting, the $7,000 \nincrease is not going to be enough.\n  I am at my wit's end. Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Bingaman are at their wit's end, and \ncertainly Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer are at their wit's end \nwith promises made and not fulfilled by the Border Patrol to keep the \nillegal drugs out of our country that are preying on our young people.\n  This is a priority. It is an emergency. It is a war that we are \nlosing, and we are going to try to fix it. But we must have the support \nof the INS to do it. We are going to give them pay raises. We are going \nto create another office in the Border Patrol for recruitment and \nretention to tell us what else we need to do, and we are going to fix \nthis problem if we can have a hand-to-hand relationship with the INS \nand the Border Patrol.\n  It is inexcusable that they did not come to us earlier to tell us \nthey were this far behind. We are going to fix this problem. We are not \ngoing to sit back and let the children of our country be absorbed in \ndrugs that are illegally crossing the border and made available to \nyoung people who are not yet mature enough to know what to do when they \nare approached.\n  Mr. President, we are trying to do our part. I call on the INS and \nthe Border Patrol and this administration to do their part, because we \nare not going to take it anymore. We are going to solve this problem. \nWe are going to put the resources in it. If the INS will put those \nresources to work and be creative and innovative and dogged in their \ndetermination, we will make a difference, but we can't do it without \ntheir commitment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for the introduction. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be pleased to add Mr. Hollings as an original \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to say a word about this particular \nproblem.\n  Is the Senator yielding the floor?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, because he \nhas provided leadership and support in our committee and because he has \nthe training agency that is sitting empty right now in his State. They \ndo a great job training our agents. He knows what a problem this is. I \nlook forward to his remarks. I appreciate his support, and I appreciate \nhis leadership in the past on trying to help us recruit. I think this \nis something that is in the interest of all of us to solve so that \nevery school in America will be drug free.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas. She is right on target. We have graduated over 2,000 agents \nfrom the finest school down there for Border Patrol agents. Two who \ntrained there have already been killed.\n  I have visited from time to time. The matter of pay is the issue. We \nadvertise and we solicit in the local area over the entire State--and \nnationally--and it is a pay problem.\n  I hope we can confront it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Kyl and the other co-\nsponsors in introducing legislation that I hope will significantly \nimprove the Border Patrol's ability to recruit and retain the talented \nindividuals we need to guard our nation's borders against illegal \nimmigration and illicit drugs. This legislation is timely and \nimportant. I hope we can act on it promptly.\n  As my colleagues know, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 mandated the addition of 1,000 new Border \nPatrol agents annually through 2001 as a means of providing better \nenforcement against illegal immigration, particularly along the \nsouthwest border. Unfortunately, this Administration has seen fit to \nrequest full funding for those authorized agents in only one year since \nwe passed that law.\n  Moreover, problems in recruiting and retaining Border Patrol agents \nhave resulted in a net increase of only several hundred new agents \nannually. Thus, during the current fiscal year, for which we did in \nfact appropriate funds for 1,000 new agents, the recruiting and \nretention problems are such that the Border Patrol will see a net \nincrease in its ranks of only several hundred agents. Indeed, Border \nPatrol Chief Gus de la Vina testified before the Senate Immigration \nSubcommittee only yesterday that, despite the Congressional mandate to \nadd 1,000 new agents this year, the Border Patrol only anticipates \nhiring between 200 and 400 agents. Arizona, which had anticipated \nreceiving about 400 of the 1,000 new agents slated for FY 1999, will \nnow receive fewer than 150. We can and must do better than that.\n  The Border Patrol's Tucson sector last month recorded a record 60,537 \nillegal immigrant detentions, raising this year's total to more than \n200,000. And the Tucson sector does not even cover the entire Arizona \nborder with Mexico. The immigration problem in my state is getting \nworse, not better, as the President's decision to request funding for \nno new agents in FY 2000 implies.\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nThe Border Patrol's inability to hire the required number of new agents \neven as towns like Douglas, Arizona face a rising tide of illegal \nimmigrants does not inspire confidence in its ability to properly carry \nout its mission.\n  Our legislation would promote all Border Patrol agents who have \ncompleted at least one year at the GS-9 level, and who are rated as \nfully successful or higher, to the GS-11 rank, placing them on a \nprofessional level commensurate with their peers in other Federal law \nenforcement agencies. Our bill would also create an Office of Border \nPatrol Recruitment and Retention to develop outreach programs for \nprospective Border Patrol agents, develop programs to provide retention \nincentives, and make recommendations about Border Patrol salaries and \nbenefits. It is our hope that this legislation will help reverse the \noutflow of skilled agents from the Border Patrol, as well as make such \nservice more appealing to the talented men and women it relies on.\n  America's Border Patrol agents perform critical work but have been \nunderappreciated for years. It's time we changed that. The premise of \nour legislation is the Border Patrol agents, whose duties involve \nconsiderable risks and require unique abilities, perform work as \nimportant as many of our other Federal law enforcement agents and \nshould be compensated accordingly. Similarly, the Border Patrol should \ndevelop personnel policies to attract more of our best and brightest. \nAt a time when we are having trouble hiring and retaining new agents, \nand as pressure from illegal immigration intensifies in some areas, \nespecially southern Arizona, we cannot afford not to take better care \nof the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol. Our legislation makes \nmeaningful progress toward that end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 913. A bill to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to distribute funds available for grants under title IV of \nthe Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to help ensure that \neach State received not less than 0.5 percent of such funds for certain \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            THE HOMELESSNESS ASSISTANCE FUNDING FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nHomelessness Assistance Funding Fairness Act. I introduce this bill in \nconjunction with my House colleague, Congressman John Baldacci, who is \nsponsoring a companion bill in the House. Congressman Baldacci and I \nhave been working on issues involving the homeless for some time, in \nour attempt to devise an approach that will distribute federal funds \nmore equitably and effectively.\n  Congress has taken important steps to begin to address the root \ncauses of homelessness in America. Some of the most important are the \nContinuum of Care programs which provide grants that link neighborhood \npartnerships and community services with shelter. The goal of Continuum \nof Care programs is self-sufficiency for people who are homeless, an \napproach that goes well-beyond the ``band aid'' solutions of yesteryear \nwhich provided the homeless only a bed for the night. Continuum of Care \nprograms support treatment and counseling programs in conjunction with \nshelter, recognizing the hard reality that many homeless people must \novercome serious substance abuse, addiction, and mental health problems \nbefore a life of permanent housing and stability is possible.\n  Under the leadership of VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman \nBond, Congress has recognized the great importance of Continuum of Care \nprograms, and has risen to the challenge to provide this broad spectrum \nof care by appropriating $975 million last year for homeless assistance \ngrants, a large portion of which are Continuum of Care grants.\n  Although the strategy behind the Continuum of Care grant programs has \nbeen saluted for its logic, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's administration of the competitive award process that \nallocates this funding has not been similarly celebrated.\n  The unfortunate experience of the State of Maine last year is \nillustrative of the problems in the distribution of funding. Maine \nsubmitted two Continuum of Care grant applications in 1998, one to \naddress the needs of the City of Portland, and another to serve the \nneeds of much of the remainder of the state.\n  In December 1998, HUD announced the Continuum of Care grant \nrecipients and Maine was shocked to learn the State would receive no \nfunding through the grant process. After some investigation, my office \ndetermined that the scores for both the Maine applications were within \ntwo points of a passing grade. Nevertheless, Continuum of Care HUD \nhomeless assistance funding distributed to Maine went from $3.7 million \nto zero, despite the fact that in 1998 Secretary Cuomo had awarded \nprograms which received funding through the Continuum of Care program \nthe ``best practices'' award of excellence.\n  Following a vigorous public campaign by Maine residents, and the \nrepeated intervention of Maine's congressional delegation, HUD provided \na small portion of the original request to the City of Portland outside \nthe competitive process. The money, though welcomed, was far from \nenough to allow Portland to meet the needs of its homeless population.\n  The human cost of this bureaucratic determination is immense. In \nlight of the ongoing needs of the homeless in Maine, as well the often \nharsh weather conditions in our region of the country, HUD's decision \nwas particularly troubling.\n  The experience of the state of Maine has convinced me not only of the \ncritical need for funding of these projects, but also of the need to \nre-evaluate the process for distributing these funds. No state should \nbe wholly shut out of the funding award process, because it is an \nunfortunate reality that all states have homeless people with \nsignificant needs.\n  In response to the unfortunate experience of the State of Maine last \nyear, the legislation I am proposing specifically directs the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to provide a minimum \npercentage of Continuum of Care competitive grant funding to each \nstate. This will create a safety net for the homeless of each state, \nwithout ending the competitive process that recognizes programs of \nspecial merit or need. My legislation also directs HUD to distribute \nthis funding to a state's priority programs should the state only \nreceive this mandatory minimum.\n  This legislation is not only driven by basic questions of fairness to \nall states, but by the significant and often forgotten needs of \nhomeless people living in rural America.\n  The problem of homelessness is often mischaracterized as an exclusive \nproblem of urban areas. However, homelessness in Maine, and in many \nrural communities across our country, is a large and growing problem. \nFrom 1993 to 1996, Maine experienced an increase in its homeless \npopulation of almost 20%--it is estimated that more than 14,000 people \nare homeless in my home state today. In a state of only 1.2 million \npeople, this is a troubling percentage of the population.\n\n  A recent article in the Christian Science Monitor perhaps said it \nbest: ``If the urban homeless are faceless and nameless. . . then the \nrural homeless are practically invisible.'' However, Mr. President, \nthat does not mean they do not exist. Unlike homeless individuals in \nurban areas who are seen on busy streets everyday, rural individuals \nliving in poverty often subsist in relative isolation.\n  The 27,000 Maine households with incomes of less than $6,000 annually \nteeter on a shadowy brink where income cannot guarantee shelter. When \nfortune turns sour, it is these families who find themselves without \ndecent shelter. When substance abuse or mental illness afflicts the \nparents, the likelihood of homelessness escalates. Indeed, in Maine, 24 \npercent of visitors to Maine homeless shelters are families with \nchildren.\n  The problem of providing services to homeless people is compounded by \nmany challenges. In some areas of Maine, geographic isolation is the \nmost critical obstacle to receipt of services; in others, rising \nhousing costs makes obtaining housing exceedingly difficult for the \nmarginally employed. Both these circumstances are compounded by the \nsignificant substance abuse and mental health problems prevalent among \nthe homeless population in Maine as in all areas of the country.\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  I am proud to say that the people of Maine have developed many \ninnovative programs to assist our homeless population. Through programs \nlike the Bangor Area Homeless Shelter, which fills the immediate needs \nof outreach, shelter and counseling to area homeless, and more long \nterm programs like Shalom House, which provides services and shelter \nfor the mentally ill, the Preble Street Resource Center, which provides \njob training, social services and medical care among its many services, \nand the YWCA, which provides programs to assist teen age moms, Mainers \nhave worked hard to reach out and assist those in need and to provide \neffective care and outreach for Maine's homeless people.\n  I recently had the opportunity to visit with the staff and clients of \na shelter in Alfred, Maine, that is making a real difference in the \nlives of homeless men and women. As one man who has battled both severe \nalcoholism and mental illness told me, ``The people at this shelter \nsaved my life. Without their help, I'd be dead on the street. But now, \nI can see a future for myself.'' Significantly, 90 percent of the \nhomeless people served by this York County Shelter face serious \nproblems with substance abuse or mental illness.\n  These programs, and others like them, depend on federal funding, and \nits unexpected loss last year has left my state scrambling to make up \nfor this serious shortfall. I hope you will join me in supporting this \nlegislation that will prevent other states from facing this same \nmisfortune. All states deserve at least a minimum percentage of \nhomeless funding available through the Continuum of Care grants, \nbecause no state has yet solved the problems faced by its homeless men, \nwomen and children.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation being \nintroduced by my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, the Homeless \nAssistance Funding Fairness Act.\n  This bill will set a minimum allocation for state homeless funding by \nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an effort \nto prevent future repeats of a situation that Maine faced this year \nwhen HUD denied applications for homeless funding from the Maine State \nHousing Authority and the city of Portland, Maine's largest city.\n  Maine was one of just four states denied funding this year under HUD \nhomeless programs--and that is a situation that no state should have to \nendure. HUD took steps to partially rectify this situation since the \noriginal announcement, but this legislation will assure minimum funding \nfor every state and assure a fairer allocation of funding in the \nfuture. The legislation requires HUD to provide a minimum of 0.5 \npercent of funding to each state under Title IV of the Stewart B. \nMcKinney Homeless Assistance Act.\n  Mr. President, it may interest my colleagues to learn a little more \nabout the problem that inspired this legislation. In January, HUD \nissued grant announcements for its Continuum of Care program--which \nprovides rental assistance for those who are or were recently \nhomeless--but denied applications by the Maine State Housing Authority \nand by the city of Portland, leaving the state one of only four not to \nreceive funds.\n  The Maine congressional delegation immediately protested the decision \nto HUD Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, and I wrote and spoke repeatedly with \nSecretary Cuomo about the decision--to encourage HUD to work with Maine \nhomeless providers to find an acceptable solution. I also contacted the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs and Housing and \nUrban Development and asked committee members to examine the issue as \nwell.\n  HUD officials restored about $1 million in funding to the city of \nPortland, but refused to restore State homeless funding. In 1998, Maine \nhomeless assistance providers received about $3.5 million from the \nContinuum of Care Program, and this year the State had requested $1.2 \nmillion for renewals and $1.27 million to meet additional needs. MSHA, \nwhich coordinates the program, estimates that many individuals with \nmental illness or substance abuse problems who have been receiving rent \nsubsidies will lose those subsidies over the course of the next six \nmonths as a result of HUD's failure to fund Maine programs. This in \nspite of the ``proven track record'' of Maine homeless programs, \nincluding praise by Secretary Cuomo during his visit to Maine in August \n1998.\n  Without this homeless assistance, basic subsidized housing and \nshelter programs suffer, and it is more difficult for the State to \nprovide job training, health care, child care, and other vital services \nto the victims of homelessness, many of whom are children, battered \nwomen, and others in serious need.\n  In 1988, 14,653 people were temporarily housed in Maine's emergency \nhomeless shelters. Alarmingly, young people account for 30 percent of \nthe population staying in Maine's shelters, which is approximately 135 \nhomeless young people every night. Twenty-one percent of these young \npeople are between 5\\1/2\\ with the average age being 13. Meanwhile, \nMaine earmarks more funding per capita for the elderly, disabled, \nmentally ill, and poor for services and support programs then the \nmajority of other states, even though it ranks 36th nationwide in per \ncapita income.\n  In closing, I would simply reiterate that Maine was not the only \nstate that was frozen out of the process this year. Without \ncongressional intervention, what state will be next? This makes it all \nthe more important that changes be made to our homeless policy to \nensure that no state falls through the cracks. As such, I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Collins and myself in a strong show of \nsupport for this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Collins, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 914. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nrequire that discharges from combined storm and sanitary sewers conform \nto the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n      combined sewer overflow control and partnership act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes to introduce important environmental legislation that will have \na significant and positive impact on our nation's waterways. Today, \nalong with my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, and seven other \ncosponsors, I am introducing the Combined Sewer Overflow Control and \nPartnership Act of 1999.\n  While the title of this bill, indeed, the subject matter itself, may \nnot be the most exciting, front-burner policy issue of the day, the \ncontrol of overflows from sewer systems is a serious environmental and \nfinancial concern for hundreds of communities across this country. For \nmy own state of New Hampshire, there are six communities with combined \nsewer overflow, or CSO, problems. The cities of Manchester, Nashua, \nPortsmouth, Exeter, Berlin, and Lebanon are all facing this challenge.\n  I have worked closely with the mayors of these cities over the past \nseveral years and have seen first-hand the environmental problems. This \nlegislation is aimed at helping CSO communities comply with Clean Water \nAct mandates to reduce or eliminate overflows into nearby rivers and \nstreams. CSOs are the last permitted point source discharges of \nuntreated or partially treated sewage into the nation's waters. For \nthose colleagues who don't have CSO communities in their states, I'll \nbriefly explain what they are.\n  Combined sewer systems collect sanitary sewage from homes and office \nbuildings during periods of dry weather for conveyance to wastewater \ntreatment plants for treatment. However, these systems also receive \nstorm water during wet weather, which typically causes a hydraulic \noverload of the system, triggering the discharge of untreated \nwastewater to receiving waters through combined sewer overflow \noutfalls. Not a pleasant sight.\n\n  Most combined systems were installed at the turn of the century when \nthey were state-of-the-art sewer technology, mainly in the Northeast \nand Midwest regions of the country. Controlling or eliminating CSO \ndischarges is an enormously expensive proposition\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nthat often requires communities to completely rebuild their sewer \nsystems. The national cost estimates to complete this job range from \n$50 billion to $100 billion. Compounding the sheer financial magnitude \nof the CSO problem is the fact that the vast majority of the \napproximately 1,000 CSO communities nationwide have less than 10,000 \nresidents, or ratepayers. These ratepayers could pay hundreds of \ndollars more per year on their water bills without this legislation. \nWith these statistics, it is not surprising that a CSO control program \noften poses the single largest public works project in a CSO \ncommunity's history.\n  Although the Federal Clean Water Act does not specifically speak to \nthe issue of combined sewers, it has been interpreted to require the \ncontrol and treatment of CSO discharges. Recognizing the financial \nburden this would pose on small towns, in 1994, the Environmental \nProtection Agency issued the ``Combined Sewer Overflow Policy,'' which \nallowed CSO control programs to be developed in the most cost-\neffective, flexible and site-specific manner possible. This policy was \ndeveloped with the input from many stakeholders, including local \ngovernments, environmental groups, and engineering firms, and was \nviewed as a major step forward in tackling this problem through \ncommonsense means.\n  Unfortunately, this policy is just an administrative policy and lacks \nstatutory authority. So, one of the most important provisions of this \nbill would essentially codify or affirm EPA's CSO Policy. This \nprovision will give CSO communities the legal protection and regulatory \nrelief they so desperately need. A key component of the CSO Policy is \nto ensure that water quality standards are consistent with whatever CSO \ncontrol plans are mandated.\n  The second part of the bill sets up a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and our local governments by authorizing five years of \nfunding assistance for these communities. While there is a State \nrevolving loan fund under the Clean Water Act that provides loan \nassistance to municipalities for water treatment, the SRF cannot \npossibly meet the needs of these CSO communities. The financial burden \nof CSO control programs generally far exceed the capacity of local \nratepayers to assume the full cost.\n  I emphasize that ratepayers cannot assume the full cost of these \nprograms.\n  While this bill does authorize new funding assistance, I do not \nintend for this funding to increase EPA's overall budget. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, numerous earmarks for CSOs or other public works \nprojects are frequently included in appropriations bills. I am hoping \nthat the existence of a CSO assistance program at EPA will discourage \nthe practice of earmarking specific projects and seek competitive \nfunding through this program.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to add that this \nlegislation has been endorsed by the CSO Partnership, a recognized \ncoalition of CSO communities and mayors. I would also like to thank \nSenator Snowe for her support and assistance on this legislation, as \nwell as the other original cosponsors: Senators Warner, Voinovich, \nCollins, Abraham, Robb, Hagel, and Lugar. I am hopeful that we will \nhave an opportunity to consider this legislation in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and the full Senate sometime this year. It is \nboth proenvironment and procommunity and I ask for my colleagues \nsupport and welcome their cosponsorship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Mack, and Mr. \n        Coverdell):\n  S. 915. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand and make permanent the Medicare subvention demonstration project \nfor military retirees and dependents; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  Legislation expanding and making permanent the medicare subvention \n       demonstration project for military retirees and dependents\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nConnie Mack, and Paul Coverdell, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich will expand the opportunities for military retirees to use their \nMedicare coverage to pay for treatment at military medical facilities. \nBy giving our military retirees this option, we fulfill a health care \npromise that America has made to every man and woman who has retired \nfrom our armed forces after a career of exemplary service.\n  Upon retirement after twenty or more years of military service, our \nnation promises to provide military health care to our retirees for the \nrest of their lives. This promise is one of the most important \ncommitments our country makes to its military retirees. Unfortunately, \nfor many military retirees age 65 and over, this promise is being \nbroken. More and more of the 65 and over retirees have found themselves \nunable to receive care on a space-available basis at their local \nmilitary medical facility. For these retirees, America's promise of \nhealth care for life is not being honored.\n  Ironically, many of these military retirees are entitled to Medicare \nin addition to their military health care eligibility. An estimated 1.2 \nmillion Americans fit into this ``dual-eligible'' category, with over \n300,000 of them regularly using military medical treatment facilities \nfor their health care. The result is that the Department of Defense \neffectively subsidizes Medicare at the rate of approximately $1.4 \nbillion per year to treat these dual-eligible beneficiaries.\n  As a first step toward fulfilling America's promise to military \nretirees 65 and over, Congress passed my proposal for a three-year \ndemonstration project as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Under \nthis demonstration project, known as Medicare Subvention, over 28,000 \ndual-eligible military retirees are being treated in military \nfacilities at selected test locations across the country. For these \nretirees, Medicare is reimbursing the Department of Defense up to 95% \nof the amount Medicare would pay Health Maintenance Organizations for \nsimilar care. Unfortunately, the limited scope of the demonstration \nproject means that the majority of dual-eligible retirees are still \nunable to receive the treatment they have earned at the military \nfacilities in their hometowns.\n  The bill we introduce today will keep the health care promise America \nmade to her military retirees 65 and over by expanding the \ndemonstration project and by ultimately making Medicare Subvention \npermanent across the country. Specifically, this bill will expand the \ntest locations for the demonstration project to 16 sites effective \nJanuary 1, 2000. At these 16 sites, the demonstration project will \nbecome permanent. In addition, on October 1, 2002, the bill expands \nMedicare Subvention to any military medical treatment facility approved \nby the secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services.\n  This bill not only fulfills commitments America made in the past, it \ngives meaning and credibility to promises America is making to our \nmilitary service members today. If America does not keep her word to \nthose served during World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the cold war, how \ncan we expect America's best and brightest to dedicate their careers to \nserve this country in the future? We must act now to ensure that \nAmerica's defense in the future will be as strong as it has been in the \npast. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter of support \nfor the bill, signed by the Military Coalition, which is a consortium \nof military and veterans associations, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     military and veterans associations representing more than \n     five million current and former members of the uniformed \n     services, plus their families and survivors, is very grateful \n     for your leadership in developing legislation to expand and \n     make permanent TRICARE Senior Prime (the Medicare Subvention \n     demonstration project for Medicare-eligible uniformed \n     services beneficiaries). TRICARE Senior Prime has been \n     successfully implemented in all of the demonstration sites \n     and, by all accounts, has been very well received by eligible \n     beneficiaries at each site. The Department of Defense has \n     also expressed a strong desire to expand this program to \n     other sites across the country wherever feasible. Your \n     initiatives to expand TRICARE Senior Prime to ten additional \n     locations by January 1, 2001 and\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\n     then across the remaining TRICARE Prime catchment areas not \n     later than October 1, 2002 clearly meets a critical need for \n     our Medicare-eligible beneficiaries.\n       The Military Coalition is particularly pleased that your \n     bill takes the additional step of making TRICARE Senior Prime \n     a permanent program. The Coalition has been concerned that \n     some older retirees have refrained from participating in \n     TRICARE Senior Prime because of their perception that the \n     temporary nature of the demonstration program could place \n     participants at financial risk. Beneficiaries need assurance \n     that this program will not disappear abruptly as so many of \n     their other health care benefits have, especially since \n     TRICARE Senior Prime is an integral part of fulfilling the \n     promise of health care for life for uniformed services \n     beneficiaries. Your bill takes a great step toward providing \n     retirees this assurance.\n       The Military Coalition is also pleased that your \n     legislation would authorize non-enrollees to use TRICARE \n     Senior Prime services on a ``fee-for-service'' basis. The \n     Military Coalition believes this would be particularly useful \n     for the Department of Defense, as well as beneficiaries, \n     especially at some of the smaller facilities with little or \n     no inpatient capabilities where it might be difficult to \n     implement a Medicare HMO program.\n       The Military Coalition wholeheartedly endorses your bill, \n     and will take whatever steps are necessary to encourage other \n     members of the Senate to co-sponsor this bill and have it \n     enacted as soon as the data from the existing test sites \n     validate that Medicare subvention is as valuable to DoD, \n     Medicare and the beneficiaries as we believe it is.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n       (Signatures of Associations enclosed).\n         Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, \n           Army Aviation Assn. of America, Assn. of Military \n           Surgeons of the United States, Assn. of the US Army, \n           Commissioned Officers Assn. of the US Public Health \n           Service, Inc., CWO & WO Assn., US Coast Guard, Enlisted \n           Association of the National Guard of the US, Fleet \n           Reserve Assn., Gold Star Wives of America, Inc., Jewish \n           War Veterans of the USA, Marine Corps Reserve Officers \n           Assn., National Guard Assn. of the US, National \n           Military Family Assn., National Order of Battlefield \n           Commissions, Naval Enlisted Reserve Assn., Naval \n           Reserve Assn., Navy League of the US, Reserve Officers \n           Assn., Society of Medical Consultants to the Armed \n           Forces, The Military Chaplains Assn. of the USA, The \n           Retired Enlisted Assn., The Retired Officers Assn., \n           United Armed Forces Assn., USCG Chief Petty Officers \n           Assn., US Army Warrant Officers Assn., Veterans of \n           Foreign Wars of the US, and Veterans' Widows \n           International Network, Inc.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed \ncolleagues in introducing a bill that will expand and make permanent \nthe Medicare Subvention demonstration program passed as part of the \n1997 Balanced Budget Agreement. I worked with Senator Gramm to pass \nthat measure then and I am pleased to join him again today to move this \nprogram to its next level.\n  Military retirees have had an increasingly difficult time obtaining \nthe lifetime health care they were promised in return for 20 years of \nservice to their country. The problem, largely, has been access. The \nnumber of military hospitals has decreased dramatically since the end \nof the cold war and TRICARE/CHAMPUS, the health care plan created to \nassist military retirees, not only is not available to a military \nretiree who is Medicare eligible, but also when it is available its \nreimbursement rates are so low many private practitioners will not \naccept it, forcing military retirees back into military hospitals on a \n``space available'' basis. Mr. President, you can see the vicious cycle \nthis creates. Simply, put, military retirees are being shut out of the \nmilitary health care system.\n  Congress, in turn, has been looking for solutions to this lack of \naccess. Last year I cosponsored a commonsense measure with Senator \nThurmond. Our simple proposal would have given military retirees the \noption to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the \nsame plan in which you and I and our staffs are enrolled, Mr. \nPresident. Congress acted on this idea by creating an FEHBP \ndemonstration program. While not a total solution, the program has \nmoved us in the right direction.\n  Another commonsense measure, Mr. President, is Medicare Subvention. \nCurrently, Medicare does not reimburse the Defense Department for \nhealth care services. This makes little sense considering that Medicare \nwould reimburse any other private physician or medical care provider. \nIf a Medicare-eligible military retiree lives near a military hospital \nhe cannot use his Medicare and he cannot use TRICARE. He must find \nanother insurance provider to help pay for his medical care. This is \nwhy, Mr. President, we passed a test of the Medicare Subvention in the \n105th Congress.\n  Now we hope to move this concept forward. It is my understanding that \nwhile the program is working, the connotation of the word ``test'' is \ndeterring military retirees who might otherwise enroll in a program \nthey know to be permanent. This bill would solve that problem. Our bill \nalso provides a fee-for-service Medicare option at certain Military \nTreatment Facilities if this would be a more cost effective approach \nfor those facilities.\n  Mr. President, this bill enjoys widespread support. The Military \nCoalition strongly favors an expansion of the Medicare subvention test. \nMy colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm introduced for the Record a \nletter from the Coalition supporting this bill. Further, Congressman \nHefley's bill in the House has already garnered 69 cosponsors. I \nbelieve this is a proposal Congress should move forward.\n  Congress must continue to increase access to health care for our \nnation's military retirees. Medicare subvention is a commonsense \napproach to achieving this end. Thus far, based on the demonstration \nprogram, the parties involved feel that Medicare Subvention has been a \nsuccess. Now we must let our military retirees know that when they \nenter this program the Government will not leave them in the lurch. \nThis bill will do exactly that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Craig, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 916. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nrepeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact provision; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    dairy compact repeal legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Grams, in introducing a measure to repeal the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact was \nincluded in the 1996 farm bill during conference negotiations after it \nhad been struck from the Senate version of the farm bill during floor \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, support of this legislation is especially crucial as \ncompact proponents have recently introduced a measure to make permanent \nand expand the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and establish a \nsouthern dairy compact. In other words, a measure devised to control \nthree percent of the country's milk is now seeking 40% of the country's \nmilk. The cost to consumers, taxpayers, and farmers outside the compact \nregion are enormous.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact bill of 1996 \nestablished a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, \nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--empowered \nto set minimum prices for fluid milk above those established under \nFederal Milk Marketing Orders. This sort or compact was unprecedented \nand unnecessary because the Federal milk marketing order system already \nprovided farmers in the designated compact region with minimum milk \nprices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers \nthroughout the nation. But they wanted more.\n  This compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high \nfluid milk prices for their producers, it also allows those States to \nkeep out lower priced milk from producers in competing States and \nprovides processors within the region with a subsidy to export their \nhigher priced milk to noncompact States.\n  Mr. President, the arguments against this type of price-fixing scheme \nare numerous: It interferes with interstate commerce by erecting \nbarriers around one region of the Nation; It provides preferential \nprice treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers \nnationally and may now extend that privilege to the south; It \nencourages excess milk production in one region without establishing \neffective supply control that drives down milk prices for producers \nthroughout the country; It imposes higher costs on the\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nmillions of consumers in the Compact region; It imposes higher costs to \ntaxpayers who pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the \nnational school lunch programs which provide milk and other dairy \nproducts and as a price-fixing mechanism, the compact it is \nunprecedented in the history of this Nation.\n  Most important to my home State of Wisconsin, Mr. President, is that \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact exacerbates the inequities within the \nFederal milk marketing orders system that already discriminates against \ndairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the upper Midwest. Federal \norders provide higher fluid milk prices to producers the further they \nare located from Eau Claire, WI, for markets east of the Rocky \nMountains.\n  Wisconsin farmers have complained for many years that this inherently \ndiscriminatory system provides other regions, such as the Northeast, \nthe Southeast, and the Southwest with milk prices that encourage excess \nproduction in those regions. Of course, that excess production drives \ndown prices throughout the Nation and results in excessive production \nof cheese, butter, and dry milk.\n  Cheese and other manufactured dairy products constitute the pillar of \nour dairy industry in Wisconsin. Competition for the production and \nsale of these products by other regions spurred on by artificial \nincentives under milk marketing orders has eroded our markets for \ncheese and other products.\n  Mr. President, my State of Wisconsin loses more dairy farms each year \nthan any other state. A recent survey by the National Milk Producers \nFederation revealed that, between 1993 and 1998, Wisconsin lost over \n7000 dairy farms--that's three dairy farms a day! The number of \nmanufacturing plants has declined from 400 in 1985 to less than 230 in \n1996. These losses are due in part, to the systematic discrimination \nand market distortions created by Federal dairy policies that provide \nartificial regional advantages that cannot be justified on any rational \neconomic grounds.\n  Lets look at their arguments: They claim this legislation is \nnecessary to save their small dairy farmers, yet the bill does not \ntarget small operations. One year after the compact began, New England \ndairy farms went out of business at a 41% faster rate than in the prior \ntwo years.\n  They also claim that consumers in their regions are willing to pay a \nhigher price at the grocery store as a result of the compact. However, \nstudies show that higher milk prices at the retail level result in a \ndecline in milk consumption at home. According to economists, a 10% \nincrease in price can lead to as much as an 8% decline in consumption. \nThe spread of dairy compacts to include half of the U.S. population in \nthe Northeast, the South and parts of the Midwest could drive up milk \nprices as much as 20%.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams and I are \non the floor today offering this legislation because the Northeast \nDairy Compact reinforces the outrageous discrimination that has so \nwounded the dairy industry in our States. We have fought to change \nFederal milk marketing orders and we will fight to prevent the \nNortheast Dairy Compact from becoming permanent and expanding, and \nprevent the authorization of a southern compact. We will do all of \nthese things in the name of basic fairness, simple justice and economic \nsanity in the marketplace. Upper Midwest dairy farmers have been bled \nlong enough.\n\n  When prices fall, as they have recently, all farmers feel the stress. \nWhy should one farmer in a region arbitrarily suffer or benefit more \nthan another farmer on a similar operation in another region because of \nthis artificial finger on the scale called the compact. Regional \ninequities are the inherent assumption of compact proponents and a \nbasic economic premise of the compact idea. Shouldn't we be working \ntogether to make conditions better for all dairy producers? Why should \none region, and now multiple regions be treated differently?\n  And yet the Northeast Compact provides price protection for dairy \nfarmers in six States, insulating them from market conditions which \nordinary noncompact farmers have to live with. Compact proponents have \nnever been able to explain how conditions in the Northeast merit \ngreater protection from market price fluctuations than other regions of \nthe country. The fact that there are no compelling arguments made in \nfavor of the compact that justified special treatment for the Northeast \nwas emphasized by a vote in the full Senate to strike the compact from \nthe 1996 farm bill. It was the only recorded vote on approval or \ndisapproval of the Northeast Dairy Compact--and it killed the compact \nin the Senate. The way in which the compact was ultimately included in \nthe 1996 farm bill also illustrates the weak justification for its \napproval. Let me remind my colleagues that the compact was never \nincluded in the House version of the farm bill and yet emerged as part \nof the bill after a closed door Conference negotiation. Legislation \nwhich is patently unfair and difficult to defend must frequently be \nnegotiated behind closed doors rather than in the light of day.\n  Even the Secretary of Agriculture, after approving the compact, was \nunable to come up with an economic justification for the compact. The \nSecretary's finding of `compelling public interest' as a basis for \njustifying his approval of the compact was so weak and unsupported by \nthe public record that a suit was filed by compact opponents in Federal \ncourt charging that the Secretary violated the Administrative \nProcedures Act.\n  Mr. President, authorizing dairy compacts is bad public policy \nbecause it increases costs to taxpayers and consumers and currently \nonly benefits a few in privileged regions. It is bad dairy policy \nbecause it exacerbates regional discrimination of existing Federal milk \nmarketing orders by providing artificial advantages to a small group of \nproducers at the expense of all others. And it is bad economic policy \nbecause it establishes barriers to interstate trade--barriers of the \ntype the United States has been working hard to eliminate in \ninternational markets.\n  Mr. President, Congress should never have provided Secretary Glickman \nwith authority to approve the compact. That in my view, was an improper \nand potentially unconstitutional delegation of our authority and it was \nirresponsible. It is the role of Congress to approve interstate \ncompacts and we irresponsibly abrogated our responsibility in this \nmatter. It is time to make it right.\n  It is incumbent upon Congress to undo the mistake it made in the 1996 \nfarm bill. It's time to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy compact.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 917. A bill to equalize the minimum adjustments to prices for \nfluid milk under milk marketing orders; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                          the dairy reform act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in order to call attention to \none of the most onerous barriers currently facing American agriculture. \nIt is a regional price-fixing cartel, which benefits only those \nproducers within its own boundaries, at the direct expense of \nconsumers. It is a patently unfair, unabashed attempt to distort basic \nprinciples of market forces. It is the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact, which has been in effect in New England States since July \n1997.\n  Today, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and I introduce the Dairy \nFairness Act, which would repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. As many southeastern States are passing enabling legislation \nto lay the groundwork in forming their own compacts, we feel it is \nnecessary to once again review the notorious history of the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, and its negative impact on consumers and on \nall dairy farmers--with the notable exception, of course, of the \nlargest dairy industries within the compact region.\n  The 1996 FAIR Act included significant reforms for diary policy. It \nset the stage for greater market orientation in dairy, including reform \nof the archaic Federal milk marketing orders. Yet despite a strong vote \nby the Senate to strip the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact from its \nversion of the FAIR Act, and the deliberate exclusion of any compact \nlanguage from the House version of the bill, a Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact provision was slipped into the conference report. This\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nlanguage called for the termination of the compact upon the completion \nof the Federal milk marketing order process. That would have been in \nApril of 1999. Well, through last year's appropriations process, the \nimplementation of USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms have been \ndelayed by 6 months. Of course, this was not at the request of the \nUSDA. With the delay came an automatic extension of this compact. This \npolitical maneuvering is outrageous, and it comes with a high price tag \nattached--a high price tag to be paid by milk drinkers, and the rest of \nthe Nation's dairy farmers.\n  The goals of the Northeast Dairy Compact have been clear since its \ninception. That was--to increase the profits of producers within the \ncompact region, but at the expense of everyone outside of the compact. \nAnd by now, the obvious ramifications have been realized--higher milk \nprices within the compact region. This, not surprisingly, has led to a \ndecrease in milk consumption. According to data from the Northeast \nDairy Compact Commission, the compact, since it has been in effect, has \nadded $46.5 million to the cost of milk in New England. As the fluid \nmilk prices which consumers pay rise, the burden falls \ndisproportionately on low-income families, particularly those with \nsmall children. Low-income families spend a greater percentage of their \nincome on food. They are harmed as a direct result of this compact.\n  The compact is having other dramatic effects as well. The increase in \nprices which producers receive for their milk has led to surplus \nproduction, which has had a negative effect on other producers around \nthe country. Conversion of this surplus milk into cheese, butter, and \npowder drives down prices for these products in other non-compact \nregions. Take milk powder, for instance. Some of the compact's excess \nsupply has been converted into nonfat milk powder. Between October 1997 \nand March 1998, New England produced 11 million more pounds of powder, \n60 percent more than it did in the same period of the preceding year. \nDuring that time, nonfat powder production in the U.S. increased by \nonly 2 percent. Furthermore, between October 1, 1997 and March 31, \n1998, the nonfat milk powder glut in the U.S. drove prices so low that \nUSDA had to spend nearly $41 million to buy surplus milk powder from \ndairy processors. Dairy producers outside of the compact region clearly \nare harmed as a direct result of the compact.\n\n  In fact, the only real winners have been the largest industrial \ndairies of the Northeast. It is really no surprise. Just consider it: \nif the compact pays a premium per hundredweight of milk, and large \nindustrial dairies are able to produce, for example, 15 to 20 times \nmore than the ``typical'' traditional dairy farm that the compact was \nsupposedly going to protect, who do you think the big winners are? It \ncertainly isn't the traditional dairy farm. They are also put at a \ncompetitive disadvantage, and thanks again to regional politics. And so \nare dairies outside the compact region.\n  We must keep sight of the fact that a dairy compact, or any sort of \ncompact for that matter, is essentially a price-fixing scheme, which so \nabuses interstate commerce that it requires a special authorization of \nCongress. Otherwise it would violate Federal antitrust laws. We have \ncome to the point where we must ask ourselves, as a nation, in which \ndirection will we proceed concerning dairy policy. USDA has just \npresented its recommendations for Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms. \nIt is not a great step in the way of reform, but at least it represents \na rational attempt to decrease Federal interference in the dairy \nbusiness and to treat producers all over the country a little more \nfairly. A national patchwork of compacts would render the Federal Milk \nMarketing Order reforms meaningless. It would essentially kill any hope \nfor the beginning of real Federal reform. Interstate commerce in the \nmilk industry would be so confusing it would be a confusing maze that \nharms consumers. While dairy was not included in the farm bill, it was \nalways envisioned that a later dairy solution would conform to the free \nmarket concept of that farm bill.\n  We all know that it is difficult in Washington to have the courage to \nbypass any of those quick-fix issues in favor of a long-range view \nwhich would produce better and sound dairy policies. But that is \nexactly what we need today. That is where real leadership comes into \nplay. So let's be advocates for the traditional dairy farmers, not just \nthe mega-dairies. What is required now is a complete overhaul of this \nbackward-looking and just plain unfair compact legislation. Senator \nFeingold and I will continue to fight the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact, and any other dairy compact that may be proposed. And we urge \nour colleagues to give all dairy farmers, in all areas of our country, \nthe ability to compete on a level playing field.\n  To this end, and in order to underscore the need for significant \nreform, Senator Feingold and I today also introduce the Dairy Reform \nAct, which would equalize the minimum adjustments to prices for fluid \nmilk marketing orders at $1.80 per hundredweight of milk. This \nlegislation, again, represents real reform, and a level playing field \nthat will allow farmers to compete fairly and not have the Federal \nGovernment stand on the neck of dairy farmers in one area of the \ncountry while supporting those in others. It would allow producers to \ncompete in a system where efficiencies--efficiencies--would be rewarded \nand they would be important according to market principles. The current \nsystem is so weighted against the Upper Midwest that our dairy farmers \nhave to be twice as good just to be able to break even. The Dairy \nReform Act proposes a marketing system which would truly be fair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Dairy \nReform Act of 1999, introduced by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nRod Grams.\n  The Federal Dairy Program was developed in the 1930's, when the Upper \nMidwest was seen as the primary reserve for additional supplies of \nmilk. The idea was to encourage the development of local supplies of \nfluid milk in areas of the country that had not produced enough to meet \nlocal needs. Six decades ago, the poor condition of the American \ntransportation infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration \ntechnology prevented Upper Midwest producers from shipping fresh fluid \nmilk to other parts of the country. Therefore, the only way to ensure \nconsumers a fresh local supply of fluid milk was to provide dairy \nfarmers in those distant regions with a boost in milk price large \nenough to encourage local production--that higher price referred to as \nthe Class I differential. Mr. President, the system worked well--too \nwell. Wisconsin is no longer this country's largest milk producer. This \nprogram has outlived its necessity and is now working only to \nshortchange the Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy \nfarmers.\n  The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 is very simple. It establishes that the \nminimum Class I price differential will be the same, $1.80/\nhundredweight, for each marketing order. As many of you know, the price \nfor fluid milk increases at a rate of approximately 21 cents per 100 \nmiles from Eau Claire, WI. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are nearly \n$3 higher in Florida than in Wisconsin, more than $2 higher in New \nEngland, and more than $1 higher in Texas. This bill ensures that the \nClass I differentials will no longer vary according to an arbitrary \ngeographic measure--like the distance from Eau Claire Wisconsin. No \nlonger will the system penalize producers in the Upper Midwest with an \narchaic program that outlived its purpose years ago. This legislation \nidentifies one of the most unfair and unjustly punitive provisions in \nthe current system, and corrects it. There is no substantive, equitable \njustification to support non-uniform Class I differentials in present \nday policy.\n  USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reform proposal was recently \npublished. Although the USDA was successful in narrowing Class I \ndifferentials, discrepancies still exist. It is long past the time to \nset aside regional bickering and address the problems faced by dairy \nproducers in all regions. The Dairy Reform Act of 1999 will make a \nchange to USDA's proposed rule which will make the entire package more \npalatable for Wisconsin's producers. It will take USDA's proposal a \nstep further and lead the dairy industry into a more market oriented \nprogram. Also producers will still be able to receive payment for \ntransportation costs and over-order premiums.\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n This measure would finally bring fairness to an unfair system. With \nthis bill we will send a clear message to USDA and to Congress that \nUpper-Midwest dairy farmers will never stop fighting this patently \nunfair federal milk marketing order system. After over 60 years of \nstruggling under this burden of inequality, Wisconsin's dairy industry \ndeserves more; it deserves a fair price.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Robb, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Levin, Mr. Graham, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs Lincoln, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 918. A bill to authorize the Small Business Administration to \nprovide financial and business development assistance to military \nreservists' small business, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business.\n\n\n          MILITARY RESERVIST SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nMilitary Reservist Small Business Relief Act of 1999. I offer it on \nbehalf of myself and 30 other colleagues: Senators Bond, Bingaman, \nLandrieu, Harkin, Lieberman, Wellstone, Kohl, Burns, Robb, Edwards, \nLevin, Graham, Snowe, Akaka, Murray, Cleland, Kennedy, Jeffords, \nCollins, Abraham, Leahy, Baucus, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Grassley, \nMoynihan, Lincoln, Bayh, Chafee, Lautenberg, Cochran, and Daschle. I \nthank these Senators for their support.\n  Mr. President, a number of those colleagues I listed serve on either \nthe Small Business Committee, the Armed Services Committee or on the \nVeterans Affairs Committee. However, all have joined me in a universal \nconcern that I think goes across the aisle for the problems that \nreservists face when they are called suddenly to active duty. This bill \nwill help small businesses whose owner, manager, or key employee is \ncalled to active duty. Most immediately, we are obviously looking at \nthe question of service in Kosovo, but the act also applies to future \ncontingency operations, military conflicts, or national emergencies.\n  Since 1973, we have taken pains as a result of the Vietnam experience \nto build an all-volunteer military. Our reservists are much more than \njust weekend warriors. When they are called, they are an essential \ningredient of any kind of long-term or significant deployment of \nAmerican forces. I think everyone knows the contributions they have \nmade as soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard, serving our \ncountry in extraordinary ways in recent years.\n  The National Guard and the Reservists have become a critical \ncomponent of U.S. force deployment. In the Persian Gulf war they \naccounted for more than 46 percent of our total forces. The Acting \nAssistant Secretary for Defense for Reserve Affairs just Tuesday said \nthat ``Reservists are absolutely vital to our national military \nstrategy.''\n  To support the NATO operations in the Balkans, Secretary of Defense \nCohen has asked for and received the authorization to call up members \nof the Selected Reserve to active duty. President Clinton has \nauthorized deployment of 33,000 reservists, but the initial callup \nincludes only about 2,100 personnel. These first reservists come from \nAlabama, Arizona, California, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania \nand Wisconsin. A total of 1.4 million Americans currently serve in our \nseven Reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  When these folks are called up, even though they know they are in the \nReserves and even though they know at some point in time they might be \ncalled to meet an emergency of our country, the fact is that nothing \nprepares their families or them for the remarkably fast transition that \ntakes place. There are obviously emotional and personal hardships \npeople have to deal with, but in addition to that there are significant \nfinancial realities.\n  I have heard first-hand, talking to a number of vets who suffered \nthis callup process, how difficult it is. One veteran told the ``Boston \nGlobe'' on the 1-year anniversary of the Persian Gulf War:\n\n       The Gulf War is going to wind up having caused a lot of \n     stress for me personally and for my family. It didn't just \n     take a year out of my life. It's going to take a minimum of \n     another two years, because that's how long it's going to take \n     for us to catch up.\n\n  I think it is imperative that we help these families and communities \nto bridge the gap between the moment when the troops leave and when \nthey return. We are talking about people who fill all of the normal, \neveryday positions of commerce that help to keep this country strong--\nbankers, barbers, mechanics, merchants, farmers, doctors, Realtors, \nowners of fast food restaurants--all kinds of positions that reservists \nhold and ultimately leave when they go to active duty.\n  As some veterans of the Persian Gulf War know all too well, they left \ntheir businesses and their companies in good shape. They were earning a \nliving, they were providing a service, they were adding to the tax \nbase, they were creating jobs, and then they returned to hardships that \nrange from bankruptcy to financial ruin; from deserted clients to \nlayoffs.\n  Even if you are not a small business owner, one has to ask what \nhappens to one's family or to one's business or company during a 6- to \n7-month deployment if you or your key employee suddenly has to depart. \nParticularly in rural areas and small towns it can be extremely \ndifficult to find a replacement.\n  Let me share with you just one very quick story from my part of the \ncountry. For privacy purposes I am not going to use any names. However, \nI am going to talk about a physician from Raynham, MA. He was a \nlieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve and was called up for \nOperation Desert Storm as a flight surgeon in January 1991. For 10 \nyears he had been a solo practitioner. After only 6 months of service, \nhe had to file bankruptcy. That bankruptcy affected not only him but \nhis wife, his two employees, and their families. After 1 year on duty, \nhe came home and he found he literally had no business, no clients at \nthat point in time, and no job--no income as a consequence.\n  We do not know for how long reservists will be called away, but \nwhenever they return, we ought to make certain, to the degree we can, \nthat the negative impacts are as minimal as possible. There is a way to \ndo that. The way to do it is through this legislation.\n  What we seek to do is to authorize the SBA, the Small Business \nAdministration, to defer existing loan repayments and to reduce the \ninterest rates on direct loans that may be outstanding to those who are \ncalled up. That would include disaster loans. The deferrals and \nreductions that are authorized by this bill would be available from the \ndate that the individual reservist is called to active duty until 180 \ndays after his or her release from that duty.\n  For microloans and loans guaranteed under the SBA's financial \nassistance programs, such as the 504 program or 7(a) loan programs, the \nbill directs the agency to develop policies that encourage and \nfacilitate ways that SBA lenders can either defer or reduce loan \nrepayments.\n  For example, a microlender's ability to repay its debt to the SBA is \nobviously dependent upon the repayments from its microborrowers. So, \nwith this bill's authority, if a microlender extends or defers loan \nrepayment to a borrower who is a deployed military reservist, in turn \nthe SBA would extend repayment obligations to the microlender.\n  Second, the bill establishes a low-interest, economic injury loan \nprogram to be administered by the SBA through its disaster loan \nprogram. These loans would be specifically available to provide interim \noperating capital to any small business when the departure of a \nmilitary reservist for active duty causes economic injury. Under the \nbill, such harm includes three general cases: No. 1, inability to make \nloan repayments; No. 2, inability to pay ordinary and necessary \noperating expenses; or, No. 3, inability to market, produce or provide \na service or product that it ordinarily provides.\n  Identical to the loan deferral requirements, an eligible small \nbusiness can\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\napply for an economic injury loan from the date that the company's \nmilitary reservist is ordered to active duty, again until 180 days \nafter the release from active duty.\n\n  Finally, the bill directs the SBA, and all of its private sector \npartners, such as the small business development centers, the women's \nbusiness centers, to make positive efforts--proactive efforts--to reach \nout to those businesses affected by the call-up of military reservists \nto active duty, and to offer business counseling and training. Those \nleft behind to run the businesses, whether it is a spouse or a child or \nan employee, while the military reservist is serving overseas, may be \ninexperienced in running the business and need quick access to \nmanagement and marketing counseling. We think it is important to do \nwhat we can to help bring those folks together, to keep the doors of \nthe business open, and to reduce the impact of a military conflict and \nnational emergency on the economy.\n  Some people might argue--I have not heard this argument \nsufficiently--but it is not inconceivable that some people would say: \nWait a minute now, reservists do not deserve this special assistance \nbecause they ought to know the inherent risks of their chosen role and \nthey ought to be prepared for deployment.\n  It is true you may live with those possibilities and those \nprobabilities. It is also true it is very hard to pick up from the \nmoment of notification to the moment of departure in as little as 3 \ndays, pulling all the pieces together sufficiently. During the Persian \nGulf war, one reservist's wife, Mrs. Carolee Ploof of Middlebury, VT, \nreported that her family had 3 days to prepare for her husband's \ndeparture. She said: ``How do you prepare [for that]? I really think \nit's unfair that self-employed people have to lose their shirts to \nprotect their country.'' So, from the moment her husband was mobilized, \nhe reported for duty until 10 p.m. and then went home to try to teach \nhis wife how to run the business--all in 48 hours before he was to \ndepart.\n  I think we should understand we are talking here about loans and \nextensions on loans. We are not talking about forgiveness, and we are \nnot talking about grants. We are talking about a hand up, not a hand-\nout. We are talking about trying to facilitate what is obviously a very \ndifficult process.\n  Finally, let me just say we are the people who designed the policy \nthat made it so our military deployments for significant kinds of \nconflicts are, in fact, so Reserve-dependent. We did that for a lot of \ngood reasons, not the least of which is that we have a great tradition \nin this country of citizen soldiers--a voluntary civilian component of \nour military service. We also know it is a significant way to reduce \nthe costs of a standing army. The costs of carrying a standing army, in \nlieu of having reservists as the important component they are, millions \nof times outweighs the very small, targeted help we are talking about \nin this legislation.\n  I thank my 30 other colleagues who are cosponsors of this bill. I \nhope that this legislation will move very rapidly through the Senate so \nreservists will know, and their families will know, that, should there \nbe a greater deployment in the future, it will not come with the kind \nof loss, or double hit if you will, for the notion of service to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, more than 2,000 reservists were called up \nTuesday to participate in NATO Operation Allied Force. These men and \nwomen who may serve for as long as nine months are making a great \nsacrifice, as are their family members and co-workers who are left \nbehind.\n  It is incumbent upon us to find ways to ease the burden of this \nservice for our reservists, their families and their employers. Two \nweeks ago the Senate passed tax relief for those serving in Operation \nAllied Force. The legislation we are introducing today addresses the \neconomic impact of taking reservists away from small businesses, \nwhether the reservist is the owner, a manager or a key employee.\n  The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act allows small \nbusinessmen and women to defer loan payments on any direct loan from \nthe Small Business Administration (SBA), including disaster loans. The \nbill directs SBA to come up with a policy for payment deferrals for the \nmicroloan program and loans guaranteed under one of SBA's financial \nassistance programs. Deferrals on loan payments would extend 180 days \nafter the reservist's release from active duty.\n  The bill also establishes a low interest economic injury loan program \nto provide interim operating capital to any small business experiencing \neconomic harm because a military reservist has been called to active \nduty. The bill defines economic harm as being unable to provide goods \nor services that the business usually provides. SBA will administer the \nloan program through its disaster loan program.\n  Recognizing the disruptions that may occur as a result of the recent \ncall up, the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act directs SBA \nand its private sector partners to mobilize their resources to offer \nbusiness counseling and training to inexperienced employees or family \nmembers who are left behind to run businesses on their own when a \nreservist is called up.\n  This legislation is modeled on similar legislation adopted during \nOperation Desert Storm. It is a practical response to the real and \noften overlooked impact of calling up military reservists. Wisconsin \nhas some marvelous employers who are tremendously supportive of their \nemployees who serve in the reserves. Several years ago, Schneider Truck \nof Green Bay, WI, was recognized as the Reserves Employer of the year \nby the Defense Department. Companies like Schneider do all they can to \nmake it easier for reservists and their families to manage while the \nservice member is on active duty. It is my hope that this legislation \nwill help smaller companies and encourage them to provide reservists \nand their families with this kind of support.\n  The men and women of the reserves are far more than ``weekend \nwarriors,'' they are the backbone of our military. We are grateful for \ntheir willingness to serve. We thank the men and women of the reserves, \ntheir families, and their employers for their sacrifices and this \nservice.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the President has approved the call-up of \nup to 33,000 Reservists to support NATO operations over Kosovo. Reserve \nforces are playing an ever-increasing role in military operations. With \nthe downsizing of our Active forces and the increased number of \nmissions, our Armed Forces cannot operate successfully without use of \nour Reserve component resources. For example, of the 540,000 service \nmembers deployed to Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield/Desert Storm, \n228,000, or 42%, were reservists. Reservists have also answered the \ncall for service in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, Operation UPHOLD \nDEMOCRACY in Haiti, and Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT GUARD in Bosnia.\n  National Guard and Reserve forces are involved in helping Central \nAmerica recover from the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, and they are \nroutinely called upon to respond to disasters in the United States. As \nthe Reserve components are relied on more and more, even during nornal \ntimes they are called away from their civilian jobs more and more.\n  The absence of these men and women from their families, jobs and \nbusinesses while they are serving their country on active duty will \nclearly present some hardships. We should do everything we can do to \ntry minimize any economic hardships that might arise from their absence \non their businesses and places of employment. That is why I have \ncosponsored the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act that Mr. \nKerry has introduced today to provide financial and business \ndevelopment assistance to military reservists' small businesses.\n  This legislation will help military reservists who are called away \nfrom their jobs and businesses to serve the United States in any \nmilitary operation with respect to Kosovo by allowing them to defer \nexisting government guaranteed small business loans and giving them \naccess to low interest rate government guaranteed loans to bridge any \nfinancial gap that might arise out of their absence. These Reservists \nwill be eligible for assistance if they are an owner, manager or key \nemployee of a small business.\n  This legislation provides more generous loan repayment terms for \nsmall business reservists who have SBA loans. It does this by \nauthorizing a deferral of loan repayments for small business reservists \non any direct loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), \nincluding disaster loans. Interest will not accrue during the time that \nthe loan is deferred. The legislation also directs SBA to develop \npolicies such as extending repayments of its government guaranteed \nloans such as micro loans or 7(a) loans for reservists who are called \nup for active duty. The deferrals will be available from the date the \nreservist is called to active duty until 180 days after his or her \nrelease from active duty.\n  The legislation also establishes a low interest economic injury loan \nprogram to be administered by SBA through its disaster loan program. \nSuch loans would be made available to provide interim operating capital \nto any small business when the departure of a military reservist to \nactive duty causes economic harm.\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\n  The legislation also directs the SBA and its private sector partners \nto make every effort to reach out to those businesses affected by the \nabsence of key employees who are Reservists and provide assistance such \nas businesses counseling and training for how to run the business in \nthe absence of these key employees.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation designed \nto reduce any economic hardship created by the absence of active duty \nreservists from their jobs and businesses and I hope the Senate will \nact on it quickly.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is widely known that our nation can \nno longer commit military force to conflicts, national emergencies and \ncontingency operations without the participation of our National Guard \nand Reserves. This is expressly provided in our national military \nstrategy. It is confirmed by the 300% increase in the pace of \noperations for our National Guard alone since Operation Desert Storm.\n  While I enthusiastically support the full integration of our reserve \ncomponents into a seamless Total Force, I recognize its potential to \nseriously affect our nation's small businesses. In most communities \nacross this nation small businesses sustain the local economy, yet many \nof these businesses rely upon key employees, owners or managers who are \nalso Guard members or Reservists subject to being called away to active \nduty. On Tuesday, the President approved the call-up of 33,102 members \nof the Selected Reserve to active duty in support of NATO operations in \nYugoslavia. We cannot ignore the impact of this on our small \nbusinesses. The challenge is upon us. That is why I am happy to join \nSenator Kerry in introducing the Military Reservists Small Business \nRelief Act.\n  For eligible reservists called to active duty in support of a \ndeclared war, national emergency or contingency operation, the bill \nprovides in part:\n  1. An authorization to defer loan repayments on any direct loan from \nthe Small Business Administration (SBA), including disaster loans, to \nborrowers who are members of the Guard and Reserves called to active \nduty.\n  2. A low interest economic injury loan program, administered by SBA, \nwhich would provide interim operating capital to any small business \nlikely to suffer economic harm caused by the departure of an employee, \nwho is a member of the Guard or Reserves called to active duty.\n  3. Direction to the SBA and all of its private sector partners, such \nas the Small Business Development Centers, to offer business training \nand counseling to small business affected by a loss of an employee who \nis a member of the Guard or Reserves called to active duty.\n  Given that our Guard and Reserve are shouldering an increasing share \nof our worldwide missions, we cannot overlook the effects of these \noperations on our civilian workforce and their civilian employers. This \nlegislation ensures that we keep their interests in mind during periods \nof military conflict.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 919. A bill to amend the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor Act of 1994 to expand the boundaries of the \ncorridor; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   quinebaug and shetucket rivers valley national heritage corridor \n                      reauthorization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Kerry, and Senator Kennedy, to introduce \nlegislation to reauthorize the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor (Corridor). Congressman Gejdenson from \nConnecticut and Congressman Neal from Massachusetts will be introducing \ncompanion legislation today in other body.\n  The 25-town area in eastern Connecticut was originally designated a \nCorridor in 1994, when the U.S. Congress passed and the President \nsigned Public Law 103-449. The purpose of the Corridor is to encourage \ngrassroots efforts to preserve historic and environmental treasures \nwhile promoting economic development. Today's legislation builds upon \nthe success of the Corridor and extends it by including nine towns from \nMassachusetts and one additional town from Connecticut. The towns \naffected include Union, Connecticut, and the following towns in \nMassachusetts--Brimfield, Charlton, Dudley, East Brookfield, Holland, \nOxford, Southbridge, Sturbridge, and Webster.\n  Because this is an established Corridor which has been developing and \nimplementing cultural, economic and environmental programs to preserve \nthis beautiful and historic region of Connecticut, the legislation we \nare introducing increases the Corridor authorization level to $1.5 \nmillion. This level of funding is consistent with recent new Corridor \nauthorization levels of $1 million. Our Corridor has been significantly \nunderfunded each year; I can only imagine the further great works that \ncan be undertaken with adequate funding.\n  Unfortunately, Connecticut ranks near the bottom among States in the \namount of Federal land within its borders, such as National Parks, \nRecreation Areas, and Forests. That is why I joined with Congressman \nGejdenson back in 1993 to introduce the original bill designating the \nQuinebaug and Shetucket Heritage Corridor and why I am advocating an \nincrease in the size and scope of it. Extending through eastern \nConnecticut and soon southeastern Massachusetts, the Corridor is within \na two hour's drive from the major metropolitan areas of Boston, New \nHaven, Hartford and New York.\n  The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley saw a rebirth with the dawn \nof the industrial age. Hundreds of mills were built along the banks of \nthe rivers and this region became a leader in the textile industry. \nToday, the mills are quiet, many of them abandoned, and the valley is a \npicturesque area of rolling hills and beautiful farms. It offers \nlandscapes for hiking and biking, rivers for canoeing and fishing, and \nabandoned mills which offer a glimpse at history. It is the birthplace \nof Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale and the Prudence Crandall School, \nthe site of the first teacher-training school for African-American \nwomen established in 1833. There are also many Native American and \narchaeological sites.\n  The area is rich in history and those groups and individuals involved \nwith the Corridor have developed a management plan to preserve local \nresources, enhance recreational potential and promote appropriate \ndevelopment. By joining forces with the people of Massachusetts, a more \nintegrated system can be undertaken.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Federal Maritime \nCommission for fiscal years 2000 and 2001; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         federal maritime commission authorization act of 1999\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I, with Senator McCain, \nChairman of the Commerce Committee; Senator Hollings, the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee; and Senator Inouye, ranking member of \nthe Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee are \nintroducing a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2000 \nand 2001 for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC).\n  The Federal Maritime Commission is an independent agency composed of \nfive commissioners. The Commission's primary responsibility is \nadministering the Shipping Act of 1984 and enforcing the Foreign \nShipping Practices Act and Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of \n1920. By doing so, the FMC protects shippers and carriers from \nrestrictive or unfair practices of foreign-flag carriers. Currently, \nthe Commission is engaged in the implementation of the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998. The Act, which takes effect on May 1 of this year \nis the first major deregulation of international ocean shipping. This \nbill authorizes funding for the Commission to continue its important \nwork.\n  Specifically, the bill authorizes $15.6 million for the FMC for \nfiscal year 2000 and $16.3 million for fiscal year 2001. The fiscal \nyear 2000 funding is $385,000 above the amount requested by the \nPresident in order to fund the appointment of the fifth commissioner \nand his or her staff.\n  I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my \ncolleagues will join me and the other sponsors in expeditiously moving \nthis authorization through the legislative process.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nHutchison, Chairman of the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee in introducing this bill.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission has done a commendable job in its \nimplementation of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act that takes effect on \nMay 1, 1999. This measure will insure that the Commission can complete \ntheir implementation efforts and continue their other duties, \nadministering the Shipping Act of 1984 and enforcing the Foreign \nShipping Practices Act and Section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act of \n1920.\n  I am pleased that the subcommittee is taking this action today and \nwill join Senator Hutchison and the other sponsors in expeditiously \nmoving this authorization through the legislative process.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Federal \nMaritime Commission Authorization Act of 1999, which would authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) for fiscal \nyears 2000 and 2001. With the recent passage of the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998 (``OSRA'') the Commission's role in overseeing the \nocean transportation industry has changed dramatically and increased in \nimportance. The Commission must have the necessary funding to ensure \nthat Congress' intentions with OSRA are met, and that all segments of \nthe industry are fully protected from potential abuses.\n  I am particularly pleased with the effort made by the Commission to \nadopt regulations to implement OSRA. OSRA, which was signed into law on \nOctober 14, 1998, and will go into effect on May 1, 1999, significantly \naltered the Commission's primary underlying statute--the Shipping Act \nof 1984. Nevertheless, the Commission was only given\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nuntil March 1, 1999, to adopt final regulations to implement the \nchanges made to the Act. The Commission met this deadline while fully \ncomplying with all notice and comment requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The Commission solicited and received \ncomment from the entire industry and, based on those comments, arrived \nat final rules that are fully consistent with the Congressional intent. \nThe Commission should be applauded for accomplishing this difficult \ntask in such a timely and responsive manner.\n  I would also note that under OSRA the Commission will continue to \nexercise its vital role in addressing unfair foreign trade practices \nunder section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 and the Foreign \nShipping Practices Act of 1988. The Commission has proven time and \nagain--most recently with the Japan port controversy and several \nrestrictive practices in Brazil--that it can effectively address such \npractices and, if adequately funded, will be able to continue to do its \nfine job. I am a firm proponent of aggressive policies that promote \nfair and open trades, and I commend the FMC for their role in opening \nmarkets for our ocean carrier and ocean shipper communities.\n  The amounts authorized for the FMC take into account the fact that \nthe Commission will soon be fully staffed with five Commissioners. The \nPresident recently nominated a fifth Commissioner and his nomination is \npending before the Commerce Committee. The Commission needs full \nfunding to bring the agency up to its full complement of members and to \nmeet its new responsibilities under OSRA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 921. A bill to facilitate and promote electronic commerce in \nsecurities transactions involving broker-dealers, transfer agents, and \ninvestment advisers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                 ELECTRONIC SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator McCain and \nSenator Lott to introduce legislation designed to modernize the manner \nin which registered securities broker-dealers, transfer agents, and \ninvestment advisers serve millions of American investors every day.\n  Only a few years ago, a few pioneering brokerage firms, utilizing the \nvast potential of the Internet, began to revolutionize the securities \nindustry by offering individual investors the opportunity to buy and \nsell stocks online. Because of the lower costs of electronic \ntransactions, investors have found they can place trades online at a \nmere fraction of the price they were paying for services at traditional \nbrokerage firms. They have also found that online brokerage firms offer \nthem access to a wide array of information, investing assistance, and \nresearch that previously was available only to institutional investors. \nAlmost overnight, many investors have demonstrated their preference for \nthe savings and the empowerment that online brokerage services give \nthem.\n  For example, today Charles Schwab, which has been at the forefront of \noffering electronic services, reports that it has approximately 2.5 \nmillion active online accounts and that more than 50 percent of its \ncustoemr trades are placed online. Since Schwab offers its customers \nmultiple channels of access to its trading services, the fact that more \nthan half of its customer trades are placed online is a dramatic \nillustration of the investing public's enthusiasm for and acceptance of \nonline services. The dramatic emergence of online-only brokerage firms, \nsuch as E*Trade, Discover and Ameritrade, and the continued migration \nof traditional brokerage firms to the Web is further evidence of this. \nSoon, millions of securities transactions will be conducted \nelectronically every day.\n  Unfortunately, the full potential of online investing has been \nimpeded because of antiquated laws that do not yet take account of \nelectronic commerce. These laws act as barriers to the efficiencies and \ninvestor empowerment opportunities that the online brokerage industry \noffers. Now, once again, it is time for the government to catch up to \nthe market developments spurred by the technology sector. It is time \nfor the government to remove impediments to online investing.\n  Today, when a person wishes to become a customer of an online broker, \nhe can visit the web-sites of various brokerage firms to compare the \nvalue and services those firms offer. He may even provide some \ninformation about himself and the type of account he wishes to \nestablish. However, because of traditional principles of contract law \nand certain recordkeeping requirements, an investor cannot open the \naccount online with any legal certainty. Instead, he must print the \napplication and physically sign and send it by regular mail. The \ntechnology gap demonstrated here must be bridged. Investors who, once \ntheir accounts are opened, may access investment tools and research and \nquickly submit trade orders online, should not have to wait days or \nperhaps even weeks to complete the process for opening an account. This \nsystem can and should be changed.\n  Continuing to require pen-and-ink signatures on account applications \nand other documents, when secure electronic signature technology \nexists, imposes unnecessary costs and inefficiencies on brokerage firms \nand customers alike. Similar costs and inefficiencies have been \nrecognized and removed in other areas of securities regulation, such as \nrecordkeeping and document delivery. Today, brokerage firms can store \ndocuments in electronic rather than paper format and are allowed to \ndeliver many documents, such as prospectuses, to customers \nelectronically. There is no reason why the advantages of technology \ncannot and should not be extended to documents that require a \nsignature.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I introduce today would do just \nthat by facilitating and enabling the use of electronic signatures by \nregistered broker-dealers and others in the securities industry in \ntheir business dealings with customers and other transactional parties. \nThe legislation would make clear that individuals can open a brokerage \naccount and conduct business with a brokerage firm using an electronic \nsignature as proof of identification and intent. It would also give \nboth brokerage firms and their customers the assurance that they can \nrely on electronic signatures in their business dealings and that the \nvalidity of those dealings will not be challenged merely because a pen-\nand-ink signature was not used.\n\n  At this point I think it is important to stress to my colleagues that \nthe online brokerage industry is different from the day-trading \nindustry, which has received a lot of negative attention in the past \nyear. Day-trading firms offer a specialized service that enables their \ncustomers to enter orders and trade directly with the market. And while \nI am sure that most of these businesses are legitimate and sound, in \nrecent months reports of abusive or questionable practices have emerged \nin relation to this type of trading. Anecdotal accounts tell of \ninvestors losing many times the amount of money they originally brought \nto the market.\n  The online investing services provided by brokerage firms are quite \ndifferent from the services provided by day-trading firms. For example, \nbrokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, E*Trade, DLJ Direct, Discover, \namong others, set strict limits on the extent to which investors are \npermitted access to margin and option accounts. These firms empower \ntheir customers and are not the problem, and it is important that my \ncolleagues and the public understand the differences.\n  It is that simple. Frankly, I am surprised that the SEC does not \nrequire the use of electronic signatures, because unless a physical \nsignature is witnessed, electronic signatures are a far more reliable \nmeans of guaranteeing a person is who they say they are. Electronic \nsignatures may result from a variety of technological means that allow \nusers to confirm the authenticity of an electronic documents author, \nlocation or content. These technologies are designed to allow contracts \nto be reviewed and agreed to electronically, to permit individuals and \nbusinesses to safely purchase goods online, and to enable government \nagencies to verify the authenticity of information submitted to them. \nIt is a natural fit for transactions between online brokerage firms and \ninvestors.\n  Despite the changes being made in the investor-brokerage \nrelationship, we recognize that the Securities and Exchange Commission \nmust retain full\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nregulatory authority in this industry. This legislation therefore \nauthorizes the SEC to provide guidance on the use of electronic \nsignatures by broker-dealers and others in the securities industry. The \nSECs active involvement in the move from physical to electronic \nsignatures is important. If the change is to be orderly, the Commission \nmust be familiar with the various types of electronic signatures \navailable. The Commission, as the expert regulator of the securities \nindustry, may determine that some forms of signature are superior to \nothers for certain types of records.\n  Mr. President, the securities industry is experiencing explosive \ngrowth in electronic transactions, and this bill's response is \nnecessary and appropriate. The industry and the investors who utilize \nthis medium need the efficiencies and certainty this bill would \nprovide. I believe that the more efficient transaction procedures that \nwill result from the bill will translate into cost savings for \ncustomers and industry alike. And that should be the ultimate purpose \nof any securities legislation relating to electronic commerce.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator McCain and the majority leader \nfor joining me in introducing this legislation. I hope the Senate \nBanking Committee can move on this legislation in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electronics Securities \n     Transactions Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       1. the growth of electronic commerce and electronic \n     transactions represents a powerful force for econmic growth, \n     consumer choice and creation of wealth;\n       2. inefficient transaction procedures impose unnecessary \n     costs on investors and persons who facilitate transactions on \n     their behalf;\n       3. new techniques in electronic commerce create \n     opportunities for more efficient and safe procedures for \n     effecting securties transactions; and\n       4. because the securities markets are an important national \n     asset which must be preserved and strenghened, it is in the \n     national interest to establish a framework to facilitate the \n     economically efficient execution of securities transactions.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this act are--\n       1. to permit and encourage the continued expansion of \n     electronic commerce in securities transactions; and\n       2. to facilitate and promote electronic commerce in \n     securities transactions by clarifying the legal status of \n     electronic signatures for signed documents and records used \n     in relation to securities transactions involving broker-\n     dealers, transfer agents and investment advisers.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITONS.\n\n       For purposes of this subsection--\n       (1) ``document'' means any record, including without \n     limitation any notification, consent, acknowledgement or \n     written direction, intended, either by law or by custom, to \n     be signed by a person.\n       (2) ``electronic'' means of or relating to technology \n     having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, \n     electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.\n       (3) ``electronic record'' means a record created, stored, \n     generated, received, or communicated by electronic means.\n       (4) ``electronic signature'' means an electronic \n     identifying sound, symbol or process attached to or logically \n     connectd with an electronic record.\n       (5) ``record'' or ``records'' means the same information or \n     documents defined or identified as ``records'' under the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers \n     Act of 1940, respectively.\n       (6) ``transaction'' means an action or set of actions \n     relating to the conduct of business affairs that involve or \n     concern activities conducted pursuant to or regulated under \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Investment \n     Advisers Act of 1940 and occurring between two or more \n     persons.\n       (7) Signature.--The term ``signature'' means any symbol, \n     sound, or process executed or adopted by a person or entity, \n     with intent to authenticate or accept a record.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to prohibit the use of the ``Made in the USA'' label \non products of the Commonwealth of the\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands and to deny such products duty-free and quota-\nfree treatment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the ``made in usa'' label defense act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Hollings in introducing legislation to \ndefend the truth and the integrity of the ``Made in USA'' label.\n  This is the second time, Mr. President, that the Senator from South \nCarolina and I have worked together to defend the ``Made in USA'' \nlabel.\n  Last Congress, when the Federal Trade Commission proposed to dilute \nthe meaning of the ``Made in USA'' label by allowing that label on \nproducts with substantial foreign content, Senator Hollings and I \nintroduced a bipartisan resolution opposing this plan.\n  Our resolution urged the FTC to restore the traditional and honest \nstandard for the use of the ``Made in USA'' label. That standard, which \nhas been in existence for more than 50 years, is that products must be \n``all or virtually all'' made in the U.S.A. in order to earn the label \n``Made in USA.''\n  Mr. President, there was an overwhelming outpouring of grassroots \nsupport from the American people for this straightforward and honest \nstandard and for our Resolution. In just a few months, a total of 256 \nMembers of Congress, including the Majority and Minority Leaders of the \nU.S. Senate, joined us as cosponsors of our Senate Resolution and its \ncompanion bill in the House.\n  We were extremely pleased to see the FTC reverse its decision to \ndilute the ``Made in USA'' label and return to the traditional and \ntime-tested standard for the use of the label. Frankly, this is the \nonly standard that makes sense to the American consumers. If it says \n``Made in USA'' the U.S. consumer has a right to expect that the entire \nproduct and all of its components was made by U.S. citizens.\n  This standard is honest. It is clear. It provides value for all those \nwho look for the label and for those who have earned the use of it.\n  But in order to retain that value, the integrity of the ``Made in \nUSA'' label must be defended. We cannot and will not permit the ``Made \nin USA'' label to be used misleadingly. It belongs to those American \nbusinesses and workers who follow the rules, pay the taxes, and work \nhard--often against the odds presented by unfair foreign competition--\nto continue to manufacture products here in America.\n  These workers are correct to insist that Congress protect this \ncherished symbol of American pride and workmanship from abuse and \nmisuse.\n  That is why Senator Hollings and I recently informed our colleagues \nof our intention to introduce ``The `Made in USA' Label Defense Act of \n1999.''\n  This legislation is necessary to close loopholes that currently allow \nthe ``Made in USA'' label to be misused. These loopholes must be closed \nto prevent the inappropriate and misleading use of this label at the \nexpense of American consumers, taxpayers, and U.S. workers.\n  The particular misuse of the ``Made in USA'' label which we seek to \naddress involves a U.S. territory, the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands, or as it is sometimes referred to, Saipan.\n  To understand how this situation arose, some history is in order.\n  Saipan was the site of an important battle in World War II which cost \nAmerica 15,000 casualties. Following the end of the war, it was \nadministered by the U.S. on behalf of the United Nations as a district \nof the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986. In \n1986, Saipan came under U.S. sovereignty pursuant to a Covenant that \nwas approved by popular vote in Saipan and by the U.S. Congress (Public \nLaw 94-241.) At that point, Saipan, now known as the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands, or CNMI, became an insular possession of \nthe United States.\n  CNMI negotiators for this Covenant sought an exemption from U.S. \nimmigration laws. This exemption was granted, but it came with a clear \nwarning from the Reagan Administration: the exemption was not to be \nused to bring in a permanent alien labor force in order to evade duties \nand quotas on Asian textile products and to provide unfair competition \nto domestic textile industry. The duty free and quota free treatment \nprovided to Headnote 3(a) industries such as textiles was to benefit \nlocal U.S. citizens living and working in the CNMI.\n  In a letter to the Governor of the CNMI in May of 1986, the year in \nwhich the Covenant was adopted, the Assistant Secretary for Territorial \nand International Affairs of Interior Department in the Reagan \nAdministration, Richard R. Montoya, issued the following clear warnings \nto the Government of the CNMI:\n\n       The recent news reports on the tremendous growth in alien \n     labor in the Northern Mariana Islands are extremely \n     disturbing. . . . I would be remiss if I did not speak \n     frankly to you on the possible consequences of the NMI's \n     alien labor policy.\n       As I have often stated, the intent of the Congress in \n     providing the privilege of Headnote 3(a) to the territories \n     is to benefit local and not alien job and business growth. \n     The extensive and permanent use of alien labor in Headnote \n     3(a) industries is an abuse which cannot be tolerated by the \n     [Reagan] Administration.\n       The objectives of the recently negotiated Covenant \n     financial agreement could be derailed as the wholesale \n     transfer of U.S. tax, trade and social benefits to non-U.S. \n     citizens occurs under the CNMI's alien labor promotion \n     policies.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert the full text of \nthis letter, dated May 7, 1986, from then-Assistant Secretary Richard \nMontoya to the then-Governor of the CNMI, Pedro Tenorio, at this point \nin my remarks.\n  At the time of the concerns raised in this letter, the total number \nof aliens in the CNMI was a mere 6,600 people. Today, the number of \nalien workers in the textile industry alone greatly exceeds this \nnumber. The number of non-U.S. citizens in the CNMI now tops 35,000, \nand actually exceeds the number of U.S. citizens in the territory. In \nfact, 91 percent of the entire private sector workforce is composed of \nalien labor.\n  Even more alarming, Mr. President, we are now told by U.S. Government \nofficials and news media investigations that the People's Republic of \nChina itself may actually be involved in running some of these garment \nfactories in Saipan. According to the February 8, 1998 Philadelphia \nInquirer: ``One of the biggest island factories is Marianas Garment \nManufacturing, Inc.--indirectly owned by the China National Textiles \nImport and Export Corp. (Chinatech), a behemoth that handles $1.2 \nbillion in Chinese textile exports to the world, much of it to the \nUnited States.'' If this is true, then companies owned by the communist \nChinese government have succeeded in deceiving U.S. consumers and \nevading U.S. trade laws. Clearly, this is a situation that demands the \nimmediate attention of and a firm response by both parties in the \nCongress.\n  But what concerns Senator Hollings and myself and what directly \nprompted us to introduce this legislation is the direct effect of the \nCNMI situation on American consumers.\n  First, American consumers are deceived by the fact that, due to a \nloophole in U.S. law, the more than $1 billion worth of textile \nproducts that are now shipped each year from the CNMI to the U.S. can \nbe legally labeled as ``Made in USA''--even though they are made with \nnearly all foreign labor and foreign materials.\n  This deceives American consumers, who have a right to expect that \nproducts labeled as ``Made in USA'' are made by U.S. workers with U.S. \nmaterials.\n  Second, American taxpayers are harmed because these foreign goods are \nallowed to be imported into the U.S. duty-free--as if they were made by \nU.S. workers. As the CNMI was so clearly warned by the Reagan \nAdministration, duty free treatment for textiles from the insular \npossessions was designed to help local U.S. citizens in these \nterritories.\n  This abuse of our duty-Free laws is costing American taxpayers an \nestimated $200 million annually. This $200 million could be used to \nfund a tax cut to the American people or could be used to reduce other \nduties.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I am a strong believer in free trade. \nI believe the U.S. and the whole world benefits form the unfettered \nmovement of goods and services.\n  But the fact that foreign garment exports to the U.S are laundered in \nSaipan to escape duties and quotas has\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nnothing to do with free trade and everything to do with a form of \nsubterfuge. We cannot allow those nations whose imports are subject to \nlawful duties and quotas to evade these laws at the expense of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Third, American workers also are being harmed by this situation \nbecause the $200 million which these foreign imports escape paying to \nthe U.S. Treasury acts as a subsidy for these misleadingly labeled \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, in order to address these concerns, I am proud to join \ntoday with my colleague from South Carolina in introducing a tightly \ncrafted and narrowly drawn piece of legislation that will address these \nconcerns.\n  Our bill is designed to protect Americans from the deleterious \neffects of the current situation by closing what we believe our \ncolleagues will agree are two indefensible loopholes in current law:\n  (1) The loophole that allows these factories in the CNMI to use the \n``Made in USA'' label on their products or in any way imply that they \nwere produced or assembled in the United States.\n  (2) The loophole that allows foreign exports from the CNMI to \nmasquerade as U.S.-made products for duty and quota purposes. Further, \nI will work to ensure that the estimated $200 million derived from \neliminating the duty-free treatment of these products is rebated to the \nAmerican taxpayer through tax cuts or tariff reductions.\n  If in the future the CNMI feels that the domestic content of its \nproducts has increased to the extent that a use of the ``Made in USA'' \nlabel on these products would no longer be deceptive to the consumer, \nthen it can petition Congress for a change in the covenant. Given its \nhistory of ignoring warnings from both Republican and Democratic \nAdministrations on this matter, Senator Hollings and I believe that the \nburden should be on the CNMI to prove to Congress and the American \npeople that products coming from the CNMI deserve to be labeled ``Made \nin USA.''\n  At the same time, Mr. President, we are currently engaged in the long \nand arduous process of bringing China into the World Trading \nOrganization. I support China's admission into the WTO as long as they \nmeet the same criteria which all member nations must meet and as long \nas they are truly dedicated to working to reduce and eliminate such \ntrade barriers as quotas and tariffs. Our long-term objective must be \nto create a global trading regime where all nations conduct trade and \ncommerce on a level playing field. However, until countries such as \nChina demonstrate that they are prepared to adhere to such principles, \nwe must continue to take certain steps to protect our own domestic \nindustries and workers from the unfair trade practices utilized by some \nof our trading partners, such as those currently ongoing in the CNMI.\n  This legislation is a bipartisan compromise measure that I hope \navoids the political pitfalls of previous measures. Mindful of Members \nwho wish not to interfere in the domestic laws of the CNMI, our bill \nmerely takes those minimal steps necessary to defend the ``Made in \nUSA'' label from misuse and to enforce U.S. trade laws for the benefit \nof the American taxpayer. It simply prevents the substantive equivalent \nof foreign textile products from evading U.S. trade laws.\n  There will be those who argue that more is necessary, and this may be \ntrue. But Senator Hollings and I are committed to doing that which can \nbe done on a bipartisan basis and achieved in this Congress.\n  We urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equality for Israel at the \n     United Nation Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFORT TO PROMOTE FULL QUALITY AT THE UNITED NATIONS \n                   FOR ISRAEL.\n\n       (a) Congressional Statement.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should help promote an end of the \n     inequity experienced by Israel in the United Nations whereby \n     Israel is the only longstanding member of the organization to \n     be denied acceptance into any of the United Nations region \n     blocs, which serve as the basis for participation in \n     important activities of the United Nations, including \n     rotating membership on the United Nations Security Council; \n     and\n       (2) the United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     should take all steps necessary to ensure Israel's acceptance \n     in the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) regional bloc, \n     whose membership includes the non-European countries of \n     Canada, Australia, and the United States.\n       (b) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act and on a quarterly basis \n     thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report which includes \n     the following information (in classified or unclassified form \n     as appropriate):\n       (1) actions taken by representatives of the United States, \n     including the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, \n     to encourage the nations of the Western Europe and Others \n     Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their regional bloc;\n       (2) efforts undertaken by the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations to secure Israel's full and equal \n     participation in that body;\n       (3) specific responses solicited and received by the \n     Secretary of State from each of the nations of Western Europe \n     and Others Group (WEOG) on their position concerning Israel's \n     acceptance into their organization; and\n       (4) other measures being undertaken, and which will be \n     undertaken, to ensure and promote Israel's full and equal \n     participation in the United Nations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. \n        Brownback):\n  S. 923. A bill to promote full equality at the United Nations for \nIsrael; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   international affairs legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation requiring the Secretary of State to report on actions taken \nby our Ambassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the \nWestern Europe and Others Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their \ngroup.\n  As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member \nstates that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in \na regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key \nUnited Nations bodies such as the Security Council. In order to correct \nthis inequality, I am introducing ``The Equality for Israel at the \nUnited Nations Act of 1999.'' I believe that this legislation will \nprompt our United Nations Representative to make equality for Israel at \nthe United Nations a high priority.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senators Brownback and Thomas as original \nco-sponsors of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since \n1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any \nregional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block \nIsrael's membership in any relevant regional group. The Western Europe \nand Others Group, however, has accepted countries from other \ngeographical areas--the United States and Australia for example.\n  Last year, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that \n``It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the \nUnited Nations * * *. One way to rectify that new chapter would be to \nrectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is \nnot a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no \nchance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security \ncouncil or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be \ncorrected.''\n  I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with \nstrong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my \ncolleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this \ndiscrimination against Israel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Domenici, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 924. A bill entitled the ``Federal Royalty Certainty Act''; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     federal royalty certainty act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nRoyalty Certainty Act. The domestic oil and gas industry is an \nessential element of the United States economy. The Administration \nneeds to acknowledge the critical importance of this industry\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\nand stop hindering it with regulatory obstacles. Right now, our \ndomestic oil and gas procedures are reeling from low oil prices. In \nOklahoma alone, 50,000 jobs are dependent on the oil industry. Last \nyear, we had over 350 producing oil rigs in the country, now we have \nslightly over 100. The industry is in a state of depression, not a \ndecline, and these conditions pose a threat to our national security \nand our economy.\n  The Administration's policies have failed domestic producers. What is \nneeded is a comprehensive plan to maintain the viability of the \ndomestic oil and gas industry. Part of that plan should be to eliminate \nor greatly reduce the administrative costs of the current royalty \nprogram with simple, clear and certain guidelines. We need to eliminate \nrules that are burdensome and excessively costly. The Nation cannot \nafford to allow the devastation of our domestic oil and gas industry to \ncontinue.\n  We should be taking action to encourage growth in the industry. \nInstead, the Administration has advocated policies that undermine it. \nWe must raise our country's awareness and reverse this course of action \nby providing relief from big government and burdensome regulations. We \nmust provide this critical segment of our economy fairness and \nefficiency in their contracts with the federal government.\n  Several years ago, I began taking a closer look at oil and gas \nproduced from federal leases and the Department of the Interior's \nadministration of those lease contracts. I was pleased when Congress \npassed the Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act which I introduced \nand which became law in August of 1996. What that Act accomplished was \nto streamline the accounting processes for federal royalties. While \nthat Act made significant steps forward in simplifying the payment of \nfederal royalties, the heart of the issue is still before us--what \nroyalty does a lessee owe to the government under its lease contract \nfor oil and gas produced from a federal lease? When a person or company \ncontracts with the federal government, it should know exactly what is \nowed under the contract.\n  While this should be a simple question with a simple and unambiguous \nanswer, that is unfortunately not the case today. There appears to be \nmultiple answers, changing answers and a morass of regulatory \ninterpretations that change over time. Such regulatory obstacles \nprevent industry from knowing what they owe and being able to make \nbusiness decisions with that knowledge. It also prevents the collection \nof royalties easily and efficiently. Having a clear understanding of \nthe correct amount due is the central and critical element of any \nsuccessful royalty management program. Without it, the program cannot \noperate fairly, efficiently or cost effectively.\n  In January 1997, MMS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a new \noil valuation rule. The proposed rule was met with a firestorm of \nprotests and thousands of pages of comments have ensued. Despite \nserious problems that have been raised with the proposal, its \nworkability and its fairness, the Department has repeatedly stated that \nit will publish its rule as final. As a result, this Congress has \nimposed two moratoriums on the proposed rule and is in the process of \nimposing another. Congress and Industry have repeatedly attempted to \ninitiate negotiations with DOI/MMS to no avail. The current moratorium \ncontinues until June 1, 1999. Secretary Babbitt has stated that the MMS \nwould publish a final rule on June 1, 1999 and in Congressional \nbriefings the MMS has stated that ``MMS does not believe that further \ndialogue on the rule would be productive.'' DOI Communications Director \nMichael Gaulding stated to Inside Energy that ``we're sticking to the \nposition we've taken. It gives us an issue to demogogue for another \nyear.'' Rather than perpetuate the moratoria I believe Congressional \naction is needed. I am therefore today introducing the ``Federal \nRoyalty Certainty Act.'' This Act addresses and resolves issues related \nto royalties both when they are paid in value and in amount.\n  This bill amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the \nMinerals Lands Leasing Act and provides that when payment of royalties \nis made in value, the royalty due is based on oil or gas production at \nthe lease in marketable condition. When royalty is paid in kind, the \nroyalty due is based on the royalty share of production at the lease. \nIf the payment (in value or kind) is calculated from a point away from \nthe lease, the payment is adjusted for quality and location \ndifferentials, and the lessee is allowed reimbursements at a reasonable \ncommercial rate for transportation, marketing, and processing services \nbeyond the lease through the point of sale, other disposition, or \ndelivery\n  My bill will codify the fundamental, longstanding principle that \nroyalty is due on the value of production at the lease. The Department \nof the Interior recognizes this principle and very recently has said \n``royalty payments [should be] based on no more than the value of \nproduction at the lease'' (News Release, MMS 2/5/98), there should be \nagreement on this codification. This legislation provides proper \nadjustments when sales are made downstream of the lease to arrive at \nvalues that equal the value of production at the lease. In addition, \nthis legislation includes a consistent basis for valuation of royalty \nboth onshore and offshore. Importantly, this legislation also resolves \nmany of the core issues related to the proposed rule on oil valuation \nin a manner that is fair and equitable to the people of the United \nStates and the producers who have entered into contracts with the \nfederal government. These provisions will reduce the costs of a \ncomplicated system that spawns disputes, while preserving the \ntaxpayer's right to a fair return for its resources. As I have said on \nmany occasions, we need to reduce unnecessary, burdensome and \nexcessively costly regulations. We need a little common sense.\n  In summary, all interested parties need to work together to arrive at \na workable, permanent solution--a system whereby the government can \ncollect what is due in a manner that is simple, certain, consistent \nwith lease agreements and fair to all parties involved. The Royalty \nFairness bill was a significant first step to simplify and eliminate \nregulatory obstacles in the Department's accounting procedures. I \nbelieve that the Federal Royalty Certainty Act is an important next \nstep.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Nickles for \ndeveloping this legislation. Simply stated, it stands for the \nproposition that there has never been, is not now, nor ever shall be a \n``duty to market.''\n  If you read a federal oil and gas lease there is no mention of a duty \nto market. It has been Mineral Management Services' (MMS) position that \nthe duty to market is an implied covenant in the lease. And this \nlegislation says that MMS is wrong.\n  Let me back up, and explain the issue and why this legislation is \nneeded.\n  Oil and gas producers doing business on federal leases pay royalites \nto the federal government based on ``fair market value.'' Under the \nClinton Administration, this is easier said than done. One of the long \nstanding disputes between the Congress and the Mineral Management \nService (MMS) has been the development of workable oil royalty \nvaluation regulations that can articulate just exactly what fair market \nvalue is.\n  Cynthia Quarterman, the former director of the MMs, set out the \nInterior Department's position that fair market value includes a ``duty \nto market the lease production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and \nthe lessor,'' but without the federal government paying its share of \nthe costs. Many of these costs are transportation costs and they are \nsignificant. MMS calls it a duty to market, I call it federal \ngovernment mooching.\n  This bill states Congressional intent: No duty to market, no federal \ngovernment mooching. And let me be clear, whether there is a duty to \nmarket is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of Congress. It \nis not the job of lawyers at the MMS to raise the Congressionally set \nroyality rate through the back door.\n  And, the so-called ``duty to market'' is a back door royalty \nincrease--make no mistake about it.\n  The MMS has been unable to develop workable royalty valuation rules \nand Congress has had to impose a moratorium on these regulations. The \ncore issue has been duty to market.\n  For this reason, I hope the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee will act expeditiously on this\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\nlegislation. In this period of hard economic times for the oil and gas \nindustry, the oil royalty valuation issue should be resolved with \ncertainty, fairness and without a hidden royalty rate increase.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 925. A bill to require the Secretary of the military department \nconcerned to reimburse a member of the Armed Forces for expenses of \ntravel in connection with leave canceled to meet an exigency in \nconnection with United States participation in Operation Allied Force; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n          reimbursement for u.s. personnel involved in Kosovo\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to \nreimburse U.S. military personnel for costs incurred due to \ncancellation of travel plans. This bill would authorize DoD to \nreimburse the men and women involved in Kosovo operations in any \ninstance where they are forced to pay a fee to the airlines for changes \nin travel plans or purchased non-refundable tickets.\n  In those instances where military personnel are recalled from leave \nor forced to cancel their leave plans due to the current crisis in \nKosovo, the Defense Department is not authorized to reimburse them for \ncosts incurred to change or cancel their personal travel plans.\n  Military legal offices only pay the claims that Congress has \nauthorized them to pay through legislation. Currently, DoD is only \nauthorized to pay very specific claims. These claims usually involve \ndamage to government property. Personal property is only covered if the \ndamage or loss is related to official duty. There is no statutory \nauthority to reimburse a member who incurs additional costs related to \ntheir leave, even if these costs are a direct result of performing \ntheir duty as members of the U.S. military.\n  I find this situation preposterous. These men and women are being \nasked to cover expenses incurred through no fault of their own. In \nresponse to their commitment to an international security crisis, we \ntell them to foot the bill for any vacation plans they might have had.\n  In light of earlier legislation we passed this year to signal to our \nmilitary personnel that Congress will not short-change them for their \nservice to this country, this measure offers one additional token of \nour appreciation and pride.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 925\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide the people of Cuba with access to food and \nmedicines from the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n            The Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today Senator John Warner and twelve \nof our colleagues in the Senate are introducing a bill to end \nrestrictions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba--the so-called \nCuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999. Our House colleagues Jose \nSerrano and Jim Leach are introducing the House companion bill today as \nwell.\n  Yesterday the Clinton Administration took some long overdue steps to \nend the practice of using food and medicine as foreign policy weapons. \nPresident Clinton has decided to reverse existing U.S. policy of \nprohibiting sales of such items to Iran, Libya, and Sudan. We applaud \nthat decision. Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman said President \nClinton had decided that, ``food should not be used as a tool of \nforeign policy, except under the most compelling circumstances.''\n  In announcing the change in policy yesterday, Under Secretary of \nState Stuart Eizenstat stated that President Clinton had approved the \npolicy after a two-year review concluded that the sale of food and \nmedicine ``doesn't encourage a nation's military capability or its \nability to support terrorism.''\n  I am gratified that the administration has finally recognized what we \ndetermined some time ago, namely that ``sales of food, medicine and \nother human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military \ncapacities or support terrorism.'' On the contrary, funds spent on \nagricultural commodities and products are not available for other, less \ndesirable uses.\n  Regrettably, the Administration did not include Cuba in its announced \npolicy changes. It seems to me terribly inconsistent to say that it is \nwrong to deny the children of Iran, Sudan and Libya access to food and \nmedicine, but it is all right to deny Cuban children, living ninety \nmiles from our shores, similar access. The administration's rationale \nfor not including Cuba was rather confused. The best I can discern from \nthe conflicting rationale for not including Cuba in the announced \npolicy changes was that policy toward Cuba has been established by \nlegislation rather than executive order, and therefore should be \nchanged through legislative action.\n  I disagree with that judgment. However, in order to facilitate the \nlifting of such restrictions on such sales to Cuba, Senator Warner, \nmyself, and twelve of our Senate colleagues have decided to move \nforward with this legislation today.\n  It is our assumption that the Clinton Administration will support \nthis legislation, since it does legislatively for Cuba what it has just \ninstituted by Executive order for Sudan, Libya and Iran.\n\n  What about those who say that it is already possible to sell food and \nmedicine to Cuba? To those people I would say, ``If that is what you \nthink, then you should have no problem supporting this legislation.''\n  However, I must tell you, Mr. President, that the people who say that \nare not members of the U.S. agricultural or pharmaceutical industries. \nAsk any representative of a major drug or grain company about selling \nto Cuba and they will tell you it is virtually impossible.\n  The Administration's own statistics speak for themselves. Department \nof Commerce licensing statistics prove our point:\n  Between 1992 and mid-1997, the Commerce Department approved only 28 \nlicenses for such sales, valued at less than $1 million, for the entire \nperiod. To give you some perspective: prior to the passage of the 1992 \nCuba Democracy Act which shut down U.S. food and medicine exports, Cuba \nwas importing roughly $700 million of such products on an annual basis \nfrom U.S. subsidiaries.\n  Moreover, since Commerce Department officials do no follow up on \nwhether proposed licenses culminate in actual sales, the high water \nmark for the export of U.S. medicines to Cuba over a four and one half \nyear period doesn't even represent roughly 0.1% of the exports of U.S. \nfood and medicines that took place prior to 1992.\n  For these reasons we feel strongly that the complexities of the U.S. \nlicensing process, coupled with on-site verification requirements, \nserve as de facto prohibitions on U.S. pharmaceutical companies doing \nbusiness with Cuba. Food sales are virtually impossible to undertake as \nwell.\n  Let me be clear--I am not defending the Cuban government for its \nhuman rights practices or some of its other\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\npolicy decisions. I believe that we should speak out strongly on such \nmatters as respect for human rights and the treatment of political \ndissidents. But U.S. policy with respect to Cuba goes far beyond that--\nit denies eleven million innocent Cuban men, women and children access \nto U.S. food and medicine.\n  The highly respected human rights organization, Human Rights Watch--a \nsevere critic of the Cuban government's human rights practices--\nrecently concluded, that the ``(U.S.) embargo has not only failed to \nbring about human rights improvements in Cuba,'' it has actually \n``become counterproductive'' to achieving that goal.\n  America is not about denying medicine or food to the people in Sudan, \nin Libya, or in Iran, and it shouldn't be about denying food and \nmedicine to the Cuban people either, certainly not my America.\n  That is why I hope my colleagues will support this legislation when \nit comes to a vote later this year.\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as chief co-sponsor of \nthe Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999. I am pleased to join \nmy good friend and colleague Senator Dodd and many of our colleagues in \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  The goal of this bill is simple--alleviate the suffering of the Cuban \npeople created by the inadequate supplies of food, medicine and medical \nsupplies on that island nation less than 100 miles from our shore. If \nenacted, this legislation would authorize the President to permit the \nsale of food, medicine and medical equipment to the Cuban people.\n  The Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999 also mandates that a \nstudy be carried out on how to promote the consumption of U.S. \nagricultural commodities in Cuba through existing U.S. agricultural \nexport promotion and credit programs and requires a report to Congress \nassessing the impact of the bill six months after its enactment.\n  Yesterday, President Clinton announced an important change in U.S. \neconomic sanctions policy which will enable U.S. firms to sell food and \nmedicine to Iran, Sudan and Libya. In making the announcement, Under \nSecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat stated ``Sales of food, medicine \nand other human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's \nmilitary capabilities or support terrorism. On the contrary, funds \nspent on agricultural commodities and products are not available for \nother, less desirable uses. Our purpose in applying sanctions is to \ninfluence the behavior of regimes, not to deny people their basic \nhumanitarian needs.''\n  This major change in the Administration's sanctions policy, however, \nwill not affect Cuba because restrictions on the sale of food and \nmedicine to that country are statutory. The legislation we are \nintroducing today, however, would remove those restrictions on the sale \nof food and other agricultural products, medicine and medical supplies \nwith regards to Cuba.\n  The time has come to stop using food and medicine as a foreign policy \ntool. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important \nand timely legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 927. A bill to authorize the President to delay, suspend, or \nterminate economic sanctions if it is in the important national \ninterest of the United States to do so; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n               the sanctions rationalization act of 1999\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Hagel, which we hope will bring \ndesperately needed reform to the process by which the United States \nimposes sanctions on other nations.\n  Eighty years ago, President Wilson formally added economic sanctions \nto America's foreign policy arsenal for the first time, saying that \nwith sanctions as a weapon, ``there will be no need for force.'' In the \nintervening decades, we have taken a greater liking to sanctions than \nPresident Wilson ever could have imagined. I doubt very much, however, \nthat he would approve of the way in which we employ that tool today nor \nof the results accomplished by sanctions.\n  When President Wilson described his idea of sanctions as a diplomatic \ntool, he was trying to convince the Senate to ratify American \nmembership in the League of Nations. The sanctions he envisioned were \nbroad, multi-national efforts designed to affect specific results under \nlimited circumstances. He also intended sanctions to serve as one \ncomponent of multi-stage escalation of diplomatic pressure, rather than \na complete response.\n  Our method for imposing sanctions today bears almost no resemblance \nto President Wilson's original concept. Sanctions have become the first \nresponse to actions which are objectionable to the United States. Very \noften, they are also a response in and of themselves, rather than part \nof a coherent escalation of pressure. In addition, the vast majority of \nAmerican sanctions are not the multilateral efforts President Wilson \nenvisioned. Rather, Mr. President, they are unilateral efforts which \nanger our allies, damage our global standing, and hurt our own \nbusinesses and people. And lest we excuse the drawbacks of unilateral \nsanctions with the argument that the benefits for American foreign \npolicy outweigh the harm, let me be very clear: there are very rarely \nsuch benefits.\n  For far too long we have subscribed to the mistaken view that \nsanctions represent concrete steps more powerful than mere condemnation \nand more speedy than diplomacy. Unilateral sanctions, Mr. President may \nmake us feel good by severing access to American know-how, markets, \nideas, and products. They may help us demonstrate that we are willing \nto be tough on governments with unacceptable policies or even allow us \nto appease a particular constituency that has clamored for action \nagainst a particular rogue nation.\n  What unilateral sanctions do not do, however, is work. We are \nblindfolded by our own rhetoric, Mr. President, if we think that \nsanctions are the key to correcting the behavior of targeted nations. A \nrecent study found that perhaps one out of every five unilateral \nsanctions has any desired effect at all. And in those few cases where \nour goal was met, such as a change in the President of Colombia, \nsanctions were only one of many factors.\n  When we mention successes, we all too often ignore the much longer \nlist of countries--including Haiti, Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, China, \nPanama, and North Korea--where sanctions have failed. In fact, \nsanctions may even allow some authoritarian regimes to consolidate \ntheir control by providing them with a convenient scapegoat to blame \nfor their domestic failures.\n  In addition, we must not lose sight of the unintended consequences of \nsanctions. They hurt our economy. They hurt our allies. They hurt our \nability to achieve our foreign policy goals. Perhaps most of all, they \nhurt our own citizens. Mr. President, it is imperative that we move \nexpeditiously to correct the deep flaws in our system for imposing \nsanctions. In recent years, Congress has imposed sanctions intended to \ndiscourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the \nballistic missiles to deliver them, advance human rights and end \ngenocide, end state-supported terrorism, discourage armed aggression, \nthwart drug trafficking, protect the environment and even, in a few \ncases, oust governments that are anathema to the United States.\n\n  Since President Wilson proposed the use of sanctions to realize \nAmerican foreign policy goals, we have imposed them more than 110 \ntimes. Today, however, the situation is growing more acute. In just the \npast six years, Congress passed more than 70 sanctions. That is more \nthan 11 per year. Last year, we had sanctions in place against 26 \ndifferent countries which included more than half of the world's \npopulation.\n  When Congress passes these sanctions, however, it often takes a \nsecond congressional action to repeal them. This onerous process robs \nour nation of the ability to react to changing circumstances, \ninterferes with the President and Secretary of State's mandate to \nnegotiate with foreign governments and leaders and prevents the lifting \nof sanctions which have little chance of success while bringing harm on \nthe United States' national interests. The bill that I am proposing \ntoday will correct these deficiencies by giving the\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nPresident the authority to delay, suspend or terminate any sanction \nthat he determines is not in the United States' national interest.\n  We often think of sanctions as cost-less actions since they require \nno governmental appropriation. As business leaders and workers across \nthe country will tell you, however, that perception is simply \nerroneous. In 1998, the United States had sanctions, of some sort, in \nplace against 26 different nations including China and India, the two \nmost populous nations in the world. Those sanctions covered well over \nhalf of the world's population, cutting American firms off from \nbillions of potential customers. According to the Institute for \nInternational Economics here in Washington, the economic sanctions \ncurrently in effect cost American businesses $20 billion annually in \nlost export sales and cost America's workers 200,000 high-wage jobs.\n  Those figures, however, tell only part of the story. The cost to \nbusinesses does not end when the sanctions are repealed. Rather, the \nabsence of American companies allows foreign competitors to make \ninroads leaving the American businesses to try battle the entrenched \ncompetition, along with any lingering popular resentment toward the \nUnited States, when the barriers fall. Needless to say, our allies \nthink that American unilateral sanctions, while affording them a rather \npleasant competitive advantage, lack a degree of rationality.\n  It would be shortsighted, Mr. President, to consider the cost merely \nin terms of the monetary loss. Rather, our wholesale use of unilateral \nsanctions damages our standing in the world community. Our diplomats \nhave to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort trying to assuage \nthe concerns of our allies who find themselves on the receiving end of \nsome of our secondary sanctions. Meanwhile, when dealing with target \nnations, they are deprived of the ability to offer a carrot in exchange \nfor policy changes. Moreover, the fact that more than half of the \nworld's population is now on the receiving end of American sanctions \nand our willingness to impose sanctions when the rest of the world \nfinds them unnecessary degrades our ability to convince other nations \nto follow our leadership.\n  Congress' current infatuation with sanctions also hampers our \nnation's ability to conduct diplomacy. The Constitution gives Congress \na powerful role in foreign policy, from the power to declare war to the \npower to regulate commerce. Clearly, Congress is within its \nConstitutional mandate when it imposes sanctions on foreign \ngovernments. What Congress cannot do, however, is micro-manage our \nforeign policy on a day to day basis. The power to negotiate with \nforeign governments and leaders rests solely with the President. \nAnything which detracts from his ability to negotiate, including \nsanctions over which he has no control over, damages his ability to \nexact concessions and come to an agreement acceptable to the United \nStates.\n\n  I am not arguing, Mr. President, that sanctions are not a legitimate \nforeign policy tool nor that, if used appropriately, they can be \nefficacious. Nor am I arguing that all sanctions currently in place \nshould be removed. To the contrary, I strongly support sanctions \nagainst countries such as Iraq and Yugoslavia.\n  Sanctions, however, should be part of a comprehensive foreign policy \nwith clear goals. They should be imposed for a finite period of time \nwith an option to extend if the situation warrants continued pressure. \nFinally, sanctions must allow the President and Secretary of State the \nroom they need to maneuver in order to effectively negotiate foreign \ngovernments.\n  It is also essential that we strive for multinational support of our \nsanctions. Board sanctions, either global or at least in concert with \nthe other industrialized countries, not only have a far greater chance \nof affecting the desired result but minimize the threat to our \ninternational leadership, and domestic economy in both the short and \nlong term.\n  Occasionally, other nations take actions so offensive to American \npolicy that the United States must act regardless of foreign \ncooperation. In those cases, we must endeavor to minimize the negative \neffects our sanctions have on third countries and on our own economy. \nWe must also carefully target our sanctions at the offending government \nofficials rather than the general population--people who often have \nlittle or no ability to affect meaningful change.\n  Sanctions deserve a place, even a prominent place, in our foreign \npolicy tool kit. Working with our allies, they can have the power \nPresident Wilson described shortly after witnessing the horrors of \nWorld War I. At the same time, Mr. President, we must not be so \ninfatuated with sanctions as to replace tools which have stood us in \nsuch good stead for more than two centuries, such as diplomacy.\n  The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nmake the sanctions we do impose more powerful and improve the results \nwhile simultaneously reducing the costs to Americans and our allies. In \nfact, Mr. President, these reforms will lead to a stronger American \nforeign policy capable of realizing our foreign policy goals more \nquickly and with less effort. This bill will allow us to finally reach \nthe goal Congress held when it began imposing sanctions at this \nalarming pace. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bipartisan resolution and enacting these overdue \nreforms.\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nDodd in introducing the Sanctions Rationalization Act. This bill would \ngrant broad authority to the President to waive unilateral sanctions \nthat no longer make sense and that he determines harm U.S. national \ninterests.\n  Sanctions must remain a policy tool. But sanctions are only effective \nwhen they are multilateral.\n  This bill will complete the package of three sanctions reform bills \nthat have been introduced this Congress. Senator Dodd and I are \nsponsors or cosponsors of each of these three bills.\n  The first of these three sanctions reform bills is S. 757, the \nSanctions Policy Reform Act. This legislation, introduced by Senator \nLugar would establish a sensible process for the enactment of future \nunilateral economic sanctions by either the President or the Congress. \nAmong its safeguards, the Lugar bill would require a cost/benefit \nanalysis and would require a study on the likelihood that the proposed \nsanctions would achieve their policy goals. It would also sunset all \nunilateral sanctions after two years unless reauthorized by Congress. \nThe Lugar bill does not undo any existing sanctions, with one \nexception. It would make permanent the President's ability to waive the \nGlenn amendment for U.S. national security reasons. The Glenn amendment \nas originally drafted puts permanent unilateral sanctions on any \ncountry that tests a nuclear device.\n  I introduced the second bill, which is S. 327, the Food and Medicine \nSanctions Relief Act. Senator Dodd is the lead cosponsor on that bill. \nFood and medicine are basic humanitarian needs. As a matter of policy, \nfood and medicine should not be included in unilateral sanctions. The \nPresident made a good first step in addressing this issue yesterday \nwhen he removed most, but not all, food and humanitarian goods from \nsanctions on Iran, Sudan and Libya. He did not lift restrictions on \nfinancing for agricultural sales, nor did he lift food and medicine \nsanctions on several other nations. He could not take these two \nadditional steps because he is restricted from doing so by other \nlegislation. My bill, S. 327, would enable him to adopt a comprehensive \npolicy of exempting food and medicine from unilateral sanctions.\n  The bill Senator Dodd and I are introducing today would also grant \nthe President much broader authority to protect U.S. interests by \nwaiving unilateral sanctions.\n  The Sanctions Rationalization Act allows the President, with \nCongressional review, to ``delay, suspend or terminate'' any unilateral \neconomic sanction if he determines that it ``does not serve U.S. \nnational interests.'' A Presidential waiver under the Act cannot go \ninto effect for 30 days. This gives the Congress ample time to consider \nthe Presidential action. The bill establishes expedited procedures to \nensure that Congress would have a chance to disapprove the Presidential \nwaiver if the action is unwise.\n  Finally, the legislation restricts the use of this Presidential \nwaiver authority in specific cases. The President\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\ncannot waive sanctions that are multilateral rather than unilateral. He \nis also restricted from waiving sanctions based on health or safety \nconcerns, treaty obligations, and specific trade laws enacted to remedy \nunfair trade practices or market disruptions.\n  As a nation, we are letting unilateral sanctions isolate ourselves. \nLet me demonstrate why:\n  A CRS report on January 22, 1998 listed a total of 97 unilateral \nsanctions now in place.\n  A study by the National Association of Manufacturers found that from \n1993-1996, the U.S. imposed unilateral sanctions 61 times against 35 \ncountries. These 35 nations make up 42% of world population and 19% of \nworld's $790 billion export market.\n  A study by the International Institute of Economics estimates that in \n1995 alone unilateral sanctions cost Americans $15-20 billion in lost \nexports . . . which resulted in 200,000 lost jobs.\n  The National Foreign Trade Council has identified 41 separate \nlegislative statutes on the books that either require or authorize the \nimposition of unilateral sanctions.\n  Repeated use of sanctions undermines confidence in America as a \nreliable supplier. Even after sanctions are lifted, Americans find it \ndifficult or impossible to regain export markets.\n  Mr. President, each of the three bills I mentioned addresses an \nimportant feature of ending the overuse of unilateral economic \nsanctions. The Lugar bill would create a process for producing more \neffective sanctions policies for the future. The Hagel bill would \nexempt food and medicine from all unilateral economic sanctions. The \nDodd bill is a final, critical reform. It would allow the President, \nwith congressional review, to waive those sanctions laws that have \nbecome outdated and no longer serve U.S. national interests.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague from Connecticut for his \nleadership on this issue. I am pleased to join him in introducing the \nSanctions Rationalization Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Mack, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Voinovich, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 928, A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to ban partial-\nbirth abortions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the partial birth abortion ban act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Partial \nBirth Abortion Ban Act. This bill is identical to the legislation \nendorsed by the American Medical Association (AMA) and vetoed by \nPresident Clinton in October, 1997. This bill is narrowly written to \nprohibit one particularly gruesome, inhumane, and medically unaccepted \nlate term abortion method, except when the procedure is necessary to \nsave the life of the mother.\n  Also known as Intact Dilation Evacuation or Intrauterine Cranial \nDecompression, a partial birth abortion is performed over a three day \nperiod during the second or third trimester. After the cervix is \ndilated over a two-day period, the doctor begins the actual abortion on \nthe third day. Once the doctor turns the baby into the breech position, \nhe delivers all but the head through the birth canal. At this point the \nchild is still alive. Then, the doctor stabs the baby in the base of \nits skull with curved scissors and uses a suction catheter to remove \nthe child's brain. This procedure kills the baby. After the skull \ncollapses, the doctor completes the delivery.\n  Partial birth abortions are performed as outpatient procedures in \nclinics. They are usually done on healthy 20-25 week olds with healthy \nmothers. Estimates suggest as many as 5000 are performed annually in \nthe U.S. We know of 1500 per year in one New Jersey clinic.\n  The American public finds this procedure repugnant. A growing \nconsensus in the medical community considers it unnecessary and even \nunethical. Yet the reason this horrific procedure is still legal in the \nUnited States is because President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation \nthat would have outlawed partial birth abortion, except in cases of \nmaternal life endangerment.\n  The lies propagated by proponents of partial birth abortion have \ntaken on a life of their own. First, we were told--and by we I mean \nCongress--there was no such thing as partial birth abortion. Three \nyears after Dr. Martin Haskell, a pioneer of this technique, described \nit to the National Abortion Federation (NAF), the NAF sent a letter to \nCongress denying its existence. Then Congress was assured the fetus \nfeels no pain during the procedure because anesthesia given to the \nmother induced ``neurological fetal demise.'' Such was the testimony of \nDr. James McMahon, another pioneer of the partial birth abortion, to \nthe House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. After pregnant \nwomen across the country started refusing necessary surgery, Dr. Norig \nEllison, President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee to set the record \nstraight. He told the Committee women would have to be anesthetized to \nthe point where their own health was endangered to achieve \n``neurological demise'' of the fetus. By the way, ``neurological \ndemise'' refers to the ``brain death,'' not literal death. Not to be \ndeterred, proponents of partial birth abortion circulated a third lie--\nanesthesia kills the fetus. Yet we know from Dr. Ellison's testimony \nand Dr. Haskell's own statements that the baby is alive during the \nprocedure. Lie number four asserted partial birth abortions were \n``rare.'' Then, a small newspaper in New Jersey discovered that 1500 of \nthese ``rare'' procedures were performed each year in one clinic. This \none clinic was performing three times the supposed national rate of \npartial birth abortions. Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, suggested as many as 5000 \ncould be performed annually. Another egregious lie asserted this \ntechnique was only used in cases where the mother's life or health were \nat risk, or when the fetus was deformed. Ron Fitzsimmons helped spread \nthis misinformation. He would later admit that he ``lied through my \nteeth.''\n  The last lie, which the President continues citing in defense of this \nprocedure, proports that partial birth abortion is necessary to protect \nwomen's health. A group of more than 600 doctors, most of whom are OB-\nGYNs or perinatologists, call this lie the ``most serious distortion.'' \nIn reality, partial birth is never medically necessary. That is the \nopinion of doctors across this country. The AMA says it is ``not \nmedically indicated,'' ``is not good medicine,'' is ``ethically wrong'' \nand ``is not an accepted `medical practice' ''. Former Surgeon General \nC. Everett Koop, who has 30 years of experience in pediatric surgery, \nhas publicly denounced this procedure. Dr. Warren Hern, who wrote the \nmost widely used textbook on performing abortions admitted he ``* * * \nwould dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' \nThe Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth (PHACT), a group of over 600 \ndoctors, emphatically states that partial birth abortion is never \nmedically necessary and ``should be banned in the interests of women, \ntheir children, and the proper practice of medicine.''\n  There is absolutely no evidence that partial birth abortion is a safe \nprocedure. There are no peer reviewed scientific studies. It is not \nmentioned in medical textbooks or taught in medical schools. The facts, \nas reviewed by doctors, suggest this technique is in fact dangerous for \nwomen. Because of the deliberate breech positioning and the blind \nprocedure of stabbing the baby at the base of its skull, partial birth \nabortion subjects women to risks beyond those normally encountered in \nconventional late term abortions. Furthermore, it could not be used in \nthe two most common life endangering conditions during pregnancy, \ninfection and hemorrhage, because it puts women at greater risk for \nboth.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  Conditions such as hydrocephaly, trisomy, Downs Syndrome, and \ndevelopment of the organs or brain outside the body have been cited as \ninstances in which partial birth abortion was recommended to preserve a \nwoman's life, health, or future fertility. There are tragic situations \nthat require separation of the child from the mother. But it is never \nnecessary to kill the child during that separation to preserve maternal \nhealth.\n  I have met families who were advised to have a partial birth abortion \nafter their child was diagnosed with a disability. These mothers faced \nmany of the same struggles, such as concerns for their other children, \nconcerns about whether they would be able to care for a handicapped \nbaby, and finding a doctor who was willing to deliver the child. As the \nSenate considers the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, I will tell the \nstories of these families and the children.\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues to examine this issue with their \nhearts. We know of two baby girls, one born in Phoenix and the other in \nOhio, who survived this brutal procedure. Baby Phoenix overcame cuts \nand a skull fracture sustained during a partial birth abortion \nprocedure. Today, she lives with her adopted parents in Texas. Baby \nHope lived only three hours and eight minutes. She was born prematurely \nduring the first dilation stage of a partial birth abortion. Her life \nwas short, but she personalized this issue for the hospital staff who \ngently nursed her for those few hours. I ask that my colleagues \nconsider whether these little girls deserved to be subjected to partial \nbirth abortions. I ask them to consider that these children were not \ncatch phrases, slogans, or concepts. These babies, and other candidates \nfor partial birth abortions, are human beings. They are being killed \nwith a procedure that would not be legal for use on animals. I ask my \ncolleagues to do the right thing and vote to outlaw this horrific \nprocedure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Partial \nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Partial-birth abortions...............................1531''.....\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, in introducing this \nlegislation to ban one of the most barbaric practices ever tolerated in \na civilized society. The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is a measure we \nhave already passed twice, only to see it overturned by Presidential \nvetoes. Enactment of this bill into law is long overdue.\n  A recent tragic event in my own home state of Ohio brings home yet \nagain the need for this ban.\n  On April 6, a young woman went into the Dayton Medical Center in \nMontgomery County, Ohio, to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This is a \nprocedure that usually takes place behind closed doors, where it can be \nignored, its moral status left unquestioned.\n  But this particular procedure was different. In this procedure, on \nApril 6, things did not go as planned. Here's what happened.\n  The Dayton abortionist, Dr. Martin Haskell, started a procedure to \ndilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be removed and killed. \nHe applied seaweed to start the procedure. He then sent her home--\nbecause this procedure usually takes two or three days. In fact, the \npatient is supposed to return on the second day for a further \napplication of seaweed--and then come back a third time for the actual \npartial-birth abortion.\n  So the woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton \nand complete the procedure in two or three days. But her cervix dilated \nfar too quickly. Shortly after midnight in the first day, after \nexperiencing severe stomach pains, she was admitted to Bethesda North \nHospital in Cincinnati.\n  The child was born. After three hours and eight minutes, the child \ndied.\n  The cause of death was listed on the death certificate as \n``prematurity secondary to induced abortion.''\n  True enough, Mr. President. But also on the death certificate is a \nspace for ``Method of death.'' And it says, in the case of this child, \nquote, ``Method of death: natural.''\n  Now that, Mr. President, may well be true in the technical sense. But \nif you look at the events that led up to her death, you'll see that \nthere was really nothing natural about them about them at all.\n  The medical technician who held that little girl for the three hours \nand eight minutes of her short life named her Baby Hope. Baby Hope did \nnot die of natural causes. She was the victim of a barbaric procedure \nthat is opposed by the vast majority of the American people. A \nprocedure that has twice been banned by act of Congress--only to see \nthe ban repeatedly overturned by a Presidential veto.\n  The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of \nan abortion clinic. It took place in public--in a hospital dedicated to \nsaving lives, not taking them. It reminds us of the brutal reality and \ntragedy of what partial birth abortion really is.\n  When we voted to ban partial-birth abortions, we talked about this \nprocedure in graphic detail. The public reaction to this disclosure--\nthe disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really is--was loud and \nit was decisive. And there is a very good reason for this. The \nprocedure is barbaric.\n  One of the first questions people ask is ``why?''\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n  ``Why do they do this procedure? Is it really necessary? Why do we \nallow this to happen?''\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop speaks for the consensus of the medical \nprofession when he says this is never a medically necessary procedure. \nEven Martin Haskell--the abortionist in the Baby Hope case--has \nadmitted that at least eighty percent of the partial-birth abortions he \nperforms are elective.\n  The facts are clear. Partial-birth abortion is not that rare a \nprocedure. What is rare is that we--as a society--saw it happen. It \nhappened by surprise, at a regular hospital, where it wasn't supposed \nto.\n  Baby Hope was not supposed to die in the arms of a medical \ntechnician. But she did. And she cannot easily be ignored.\n  This procedure is not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in \ndanger. It's performed on healthy women--and healthy babies--all the \ntime.\n  The goal of a partial birth abortion is not to protect somebody's \nhealth but to kill a child. That is what the doctor wants to do.\n  Dr. Haskell himself has said as much. In an interview with the \nAmerican Medical News, he said--and I quote--``you could dilate further \nand deliver the baby alive but that's really not the point. The point \nis you are attempting to do an abortion. And that's the goal of your \nwork, is to complete an abortion. Not to see how do I manipulate the \nsituation so that I get a live birth instead.'' Unquote.\n  Dr. Haskell admitted it. Why don't we?\n  Again, let's hear Dr. Haskell describe this procedure. Quote: ``I \njust kept on doing D (dilation and extractions) because that was \nwhat I was comfortable with, up until 24 weeks. But they were very \ntough. Sometimes it was a 45-minute operation. I noticed that some of \nthe later D were very, very easy. So I asked myself why can't they \nall happen this way. You see the easy ones would have a foot length \npresentation, you'd reach up and grab the foot of the fetus, pull the \nfetus down and the head would hang up and then you would collapse the \nhead and take it out. It was easy.''\n  It was easy, Mr. President. Easy for him. He doesn't say it was easy \nfor the mother, and I suspect he doesn't care. His goal is to perform \nabortions. Is he the person we're going to trust to decide when \nabortions are necessary? He's got a production line going--and \nnothing's going to stop him from meeting his quota.\n  Dr. Haskell continues: ``At first, I would reach around trying to \nidentify a lower extremity blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd \nget it right about 30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, `Well gee, \nif I just put the ultrasound up there I could see it all and I wouldn't \nhave to feel around for it.' I did that and sure enough, I found it 99 \npercent of the time. Kind of serendipity.'' End of quote.\n  Serendipity, Mr. President.\n  Let me conclude.\n  We need to ask ourselves, what does our toleration of this procedure \nsay about us, as a nation?\n  Where do we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, \n``I don't really like this, but it doesn't really matter to me, so I'll \nput up with it?''\n  At what point do we say, unless we stop this from happening, we \ncannot justly call ourselves a civilized nation?\n  Mr. President, when you come right down to it, America's moral \nanesthetic is wearing off. We know what's going on behind the curtain--\nand we can't wish that knowledge away. We have to face it--and do \nwhat's right.\n  We have to make the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act the law of the \nland. Twice in the last three years, Congress has passed this \nlegislation with strong, bipartisan support, only to see it fall victim \nto a Presidential veto. Once again, I am confident Congress will do the \nright thing and pass this very important bill.\n  But that's not enough, Mr. President. Passing this legislation in \nCongress is not enough. It will not save any lives. For lives to be \nsaved, the bill must become law.\n  If something happens behind the iron curtain of an abortion clinic \nit's easier to pretend that it doesn't happen. But the death of Baby \nHope has torn that curtain, revealing the truth of this barbaric \nprocedure. Let people not ask about us fifty years from now, ``How can \nthey not have known?'' and ``Why didn't they do anything?''\n  Because, Mr. President, the fact is: We do know. And we must take \naction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Abraham, \n        and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 929. A bill to provide for the establishment of a National \nMilitary Museum, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                      national military museum act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, when future generations search for ``lessons \nlearned'' from America's 18th, 19th and 20th century military \nexperiences, they no doubt will be accessible through dusty texts, \ndated documentary videos, or long-forgotten Congressional transcripts.\n  I am concerned, however, that these lessons will not carry forward \ninto the next century as an enduring reminder of the true costs, and \nthe true benefits, of waging wars, on behalf of freedom and democracy.\n  Increasingly, we have seen the gap between the military, and the rest \nof society, widen.\n  Early in the next century, for example, we expect that less than four \npercent of the population will be veterans, down from over 11 percent \nin 1980.\n  This means that fewer and fewer civilians will have a personal \nunderstanding of the military, making it more and more difficult to \npass on to successive generations, one of our most powerful military \nassets--our experience.\n  How then do we ensure that we don't ``repeat'' our past mistakes--and \nthat we build on our past successes?\n  Mr. President, I am joined by Senators Hutchison, of Texas, Kerrey of \nNebraska, Hagel, Reed of Rhode Island, Smith of New Hampshire, Cleland, \nAbraham, and Hutchinson of Arkansas in introducing the National \nMilitary Museum Act.\n  It will teach visitors about each of the major wars in which America \nhas fought.\n  Finally, it will help build pride, in our military, and the nation.\n  The United States, through the fine stewardship of the Smithsonian \nInstitution, operates over a score of excellent national museums--from \nthe National Portrait Gallery, to the National Postal Museum, yet none \nof these are dedicated to the armed forces.\n  In fact, the individual military services have many museums--the Army \nalone, has over 60.\n  We also have military artifacts and battles represented in sections \nof some of the Smithsonian museums.\n  Yet we do not have a single, prestigious, integrated national museum \nto tell America's military story and to honor our armed forces.\n  This is an extraordinary shortcoming in the telling of our national \nheritage.\n  By contrast, many of our key allies have national military museums.\n  The British Imperial War Museum, and the Australian War Memorial, are \ntwo fine examples.\n  The United States is a nation that has influenced world events \ndecisively over the last century and will continue to do so for \ncenturies to come.\n  And it is a military power that has sought not to conquer other \nlands, but to bring freedom, and democracy to the entire world.\n  History shows few if any nations, with such disproportionate means, \nemploying force for such consistently altruistic ends.\n  Yet we have no national place to tell, this extraordinary story.\n  Mr. President, where, would a teenager interested in World War I, \nWorld War II, Korea, or Vietnam, go, to learn more about these wars? \nThere really is no museum displaying artifacts from these wars, in a \ncomprehensive fashion.\n  We do in fact have several fine Civil War museums, but the lack of \nrepresentations of so many other wars is remarkable.\n  The idea of a National Military Museum goes back to the late 1800s.\n  Several attempts to build this museum, (including a concerted effort \nby President Truman) failed, for various reasons: inadequate funding, \npost-war disillusionment, or blueprints that were too ambitious.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\n  Now, as we enter the 21st century, the time is right to display the \nenormous inventories of artifacts, that have been accumulated from this \ncentury--especially from conflicts since World War II.\n  As now envisioned, the National Military Museum would include display \nsections for each of the military services as well as separate sections \nfor each of the country's major wars.\n  A spectacular atrium would house large items, from: missiles to ship \nsections to aircraft.\n  Based on a review of numerous potential sites, this legislation \nauthorizes that the new museum be located on the Navy Annex property \njust west of the Pentagon.\n  Bounded symbolically, by Arlington National Cemetery, to the north, \nand offering a commanding view of the capital area, this location is \nideal, and one of the last available parcels, in the area, suitable for \na museum of this scope and importance.\n  The museum would share a large 55-acre tract of land with an \nexpansion of Arlington National Cemetery and possibly other veterans' \nmemorials.\n  The buildings currently on this land, are slated for demolition \naround 2015.\n  The National Military Museum Act establishes a National Military \nMuseum Foundation, which will be responsible for the design \nconstruction, and operation, of the museum.\n  The Foundation's Board, will consist of 10 members, and their first \naction will be to conduct a study on the siting, design, environmental \nimpact, and governing of the museum.\n  The Foundation may recommend that the museum, become part, of the \nSmithsonian Institution.\n  Assuming no Congressional action, upon receipt of both this study, \nand a General Accounting Office evaluation, the Foundation will proceed \nwith final design preparations, and pursue fundraising.\n  Construction would begin after demolition of the existing Navy Annex \nbuildings.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce this legislative \ncornerstone, for building, one of the most important, and--I would \nanticipate--most visited museums, in the world.\n  Let us honor our nation's military with this long overdue museum.\n  Let us safeguard our past, so that future generations will know what \nhas been done before--and what may have to be done again, in the \nfuture--to push back the forces of tyranny, and to preserve the \nfreedoms, we are so fortunate to enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 930. A bill to provide for the sale of certain public land in the \nIvanpah Valley, Nevada, to the Clark County, Nevada, Department of \nAviation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            ivanpah valley airport public land transfer act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ivanpah Valley \nAirport Public Land Transfer Act. This act authorizes the Secretary of \nInterior to convey, at fair market value, certain lands in the Ivanpah \nValley to the Clark County Department of Aviation. Authorization of \nthis conveyance will allow the Department to proceed with the proposed \ndevelopment of a new airport to serve Southern Nevada.\n  As you are aware, growth in both the general population and the \ntourism industry in Southern Nevada has been and is expected to \ncontinue to be very strong. Statistics show that over half the people \nwho come to Southern Nevada now come by air. From 1985 to 1998, \noperations at McCarran Airport increased at an annual rate of \napproximately five percent. Even if this growth rate slows to two \npercent, activities at McCarran will be at or exceed capacity by the \nyear 2014. At this level, the traveling public will also experience \nsignificant delays. It is obvious we must begin to plan now for the \nfuture.\n  The Department of Aviation has completed an extensive review of \noptions available for meeting the growing needs for air traffic in \nSouthern Nevada. These options included construction of a new runway at \nMcCarran and the building of an entirely new airport at any one of four \ndifferent sites. Analysis of these options shows that for a variety of \ntechnical, safety-related, and economic reasons, the Ivanpah site is \nthe only option that can accommodate the growing air traffic needs of \nthe region.\n  The bill Senator Bryan and I introduce today is based on similar \nlegislation that was introduced in both the House and Senate in the \n105th Congress. However, this bill incorporates changes from the prior \nlegislation to address environmental concerns and issues that were \nraised by the Bureau of Land Management in testimony before the House \nResources Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands last year. \nSome of those concerns were related to endangered species habitat, \npotential conflicts with existing uses, and determination of fair \nmarket value for the lands to be conveyed.\n  Congress should be aware that this is not a giveaway. Clark County \nwill pay fair market value for the land and the airport will be \npublicly owned and operated. The bill also provides that the revenues \ncollected by the government for the sale will be available for other \nuse by the BLM under the terms of the Southern Nevada Public Land \nManagement Act of 1998.\n  The Clark County Department of Aviation is committed to the \npreparation of necessary environmental documentation for airport \nconstruction once Congressional approval for the land sale is granted. \nThe County cannot, however, invest the substantial amounts of time, \ndollars, and resources an environmental study demands without assurance \nthe site will be available for purchase should an airport be deemed to \nhave no significant negative impacts. The bill also provides for return \nof the land to the Department of Interior, should airport development \nprove to be infeasible.\n  I thank my fellow Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, for his support on \nthis issue and urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 930\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

and\n       (B) alternatives have been developed to address each \n     adverse effect identified in the assessment, including \n     alternatives that ensure access to the Las Vegas basin under \n     visual flight rules at a level that is equal to or better \n     than the access in existence as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act;

Res. 23. A joint resolution expressing the sense of the Congress \nregarding the need for a Surgeon General's report on media and \nviolence; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              surgeon general's media violence report act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, an entire nation was stunned this past \nweek with the shocking violence that unfolded in Littleton, Colorado. \nPerhaps, if this had been an isolated incident, we could have written \nit off as two crazed individuals. However, the tragic reality is that \nit was not an isolated incident, but another in an increasing pattern \nof violence in our schools. Even more disturbing is that these \nschoolyard shootings are occurring against the backdrop of ever-\nescalating youth violence, and suicide.\n  This is an extraordinarily complex problem, with many contributing \nfactors. However, what this comes down to is responsibility, and the \nmost basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any culture--\nhas, is raising its children. We are failing that responsibility, and \nthe extent of our failure is being measured in the deaths, and injuries \nof our kids in the schoolyard and on the streets of our neighborhoods \nand communities.\n  Primary responsibility lies with families. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. We are not adequately involving ourselves in \nour children's lives, the friends they hang out with, what they do with \ntheir time, the problems they are struggling with. This is our job, our \nparamount responsibility, and most unfortunately, we are failing. We \nmust get our priorities straight, and that means putting our kids \nfirst.\n  However, parents need help. They need help because our homes and our \nfamilies--our children's minds, are being flooded by a tide of \nviolence. This dehumanizing violence pervades our society: our movies \ndepict graphic violence; our children are taught to kill and maim by \ninteractive video games; the Internet, which holds such tremendous \npotential in so many ways, is tragically used by some to communicate \nunimaginable hatred, images and descriptions of violence, and ``how-\nto'' manuals on everything from bomb construction to drugs. Our culture \nis dominated by media, and our children, more-so than any generation \nbefore them, is vulnerable to the images of violence and hate that, \nunfortunately, are dominant themes in so much of what they see, and \nhear.\n  Thus, today I rise to introduce, calling upon the Surgeon General to \nconduct a comprehensive study of media violence, in all its forms, and \nto issue a report on its effects, and recommendations on how we can \nturn this tragic tide of youth violence.\n  As I have said, this is a complex challenge. Certainly, working with \nthe media industry, we can come to some consensus on immediate measures \nthat can be taken to curb our children's access to the types of \nexcessive and gratuitous violence that is currently flooding our homes \nand families. However, the crisis we are currently facing did not occur \novernight, and we must take time to achieve a comprehensive \nunderstanding of how media violence affects childhood development, and \nwhat children are most at risk to its impact.\n  Again, I urge all Americans to get involved in their kids' lives. Ask \nquestions, listen to their fears and concerns, their hopes and their \ndreams. Children are not simply small adults.\n  Childhood is a time of innocence, a time to teach discipline and \nvalues. Our children are our most precious gift, they are full of \ninnocence and hope. We must work together to preserve the sanctity of \nchildhood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url":

Res. 90\n\n       Whereas many of the nations throughout the world, and \n     especially within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de \n     los Ninos'' on the 30th of April, in recognition and \n     celebration of their country's future--their children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Latinos in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the nation;\n       Whereas one in four Americans is projected to be of \n     Hispanic descent by the year 2050, and there are now 10.5 \n     million Latino children;\n       Whereas traditional Latino family life centers largely on \n     its children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year and hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are more \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the Nation will help affirm for the people of the United \n     States the significance of family, education, and community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition of \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in the \n     support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Latinos and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children;\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its citizens, and citizens should be encouraged to \n     celebrate the gifts of children to society--their curiousity, \n     laughter, faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the 30th of April of \n     2000, as ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans'' \n     and requests that the President issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to join with all children, \n     families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \n     states across the nation to observe the day with appropriate \n     ceremonies, beginning April 30, 2000, that include:\n       (1) Activities that center around children, and are free or \n     minimal in cost so as to encourage and facilitate the \n     participation of all our citizens;\n       (2) Activities that are positive, uplifting, and that help \n     children express their hopes and dreams;\n       (3) Activities that provide opportunities for children of \n     all backgrounds to learn about one another's cultures and \n     share ideas;\n       (4) Activities that include all members of the family, and \n     especially extended and elderly family members, so as to \n     promote greater communication among the generations within a \n     family, enabling children to appreciate and benefit from the \n     experiences and wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (5) Activities that provide opportunities for families \n     within a community to get acquainted; and\n       (6) Activities that provide children with the support they \n     need to develop skills and confidence, and find the inner \n     strength--the will and fire of the human spirit--to make \n     their dreams come true.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce my submission \nof a Senate resolution, together with other members of the U.S. Senate \nRepublican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs and the Senate \nDemocrat Working Group on Hispanic Issues, to designate April 30, 2000, \nas Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans.\n  Last Congress, the resolution to designate April 30, 1999, as a day \nto celebrate young Americans passed with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. As a result, cities and towns throughout the country will host \ncommunity events to celebrate the nation's children throughout this \nweek.\n  In fact, in my home state of Utah a very special celebration is \nplanned. Tomorrow, in Salt Lake City, on Dia de los Ninos: Dia de Los \nLibros [Day of the Children: Day of Books], we will dedicate the first \nAmericas Award Reference and Resource Library to be established at the \nCentro de la Familia Center. This unique library will house over 1,500 \nbooks and will form the central part of a literacy program aimed at \nencouraging children and young adults to explore the written world by \nreading books that authentically and engagingly present the experience \nof individuals in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Latinos in the \nUnited States. These wonderful stories will help children learn to \nread, to expand their universe and dreams, to develop a better \nunderstanding of the history of the Americas, and to enhance their own \nself-esteem.\n  Our children are our greatest promise for the preservation and \nbetterment of this country's healthy and competitive global edge. As \nleaders and purveyors of hope for a better America, we must continue to \nnurture their development and potential through innovative programs and \ndiscussions that encourage and challenge them to become the prime \nmovers and guardians of investments made thus far.\n  Children's days are celebrated in many other nations, including Japan \nand Korea on May 5, Canada on November 20, Turkey on April 23, and \nMexico on April 30. Local coalitions have formed in 17 states to \nrealize Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans as a special day \nfor all children throughout this country.\n  I think it is imperative, especially now given the recent tragedy of \nColumbine, Colorado, that we celebrate, honor, and encourage our youth, \nin much the same way we honor parents during Mother's Day or Father's \nDay. Our purpose is strictly to uplift children.\n\n  There are no easy solutions for the challenges that face our modern \nday society. But I do know that we need to make and take the time to \nlisten, to support, to observe, and to accept responsibility as parents \nfor raising children prepared to meet the challenge of living in a \ncomplex multicultural society--a society that bestows freedom on its \ncitizens predicated on the acceptance of basic moral values. I believe \nthat calling upon the nation to set aside a day for that purpose can be \nan important step in building awareness among adults that our children \nneed parental love, care, and guidance. They need positive role \nmodels--coaches, teachers, employers--as well as from the entertainment \nindustry and professional sports. They need to know there is \nsatisfaction in doing their best, honor in doing the right things, and \nconsequences for doing the wrong thing.\n  A day to reflect on what we are teaching our children and the \ncultural legacy we are leaving them could very well be a turning point \nfor our country. It is my hope that when the sun goes down tomorrow \nevening we will have rededicated ourselves to this most important \npurpose of all--to nurture our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4467-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4467-S4468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  DODD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 298\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted an amendment \nintended to be\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nproposed by him to the bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between and \namong the several States by providing for the orderly resolution of \ndisputes arising out of computer-based problem related to processing \ndata that includes a 2-digit expression of that year's date; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       In section 5, strike subsection (b) and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the evidentiary standard \n     established by subsection (a), punitive damages permitted \n     under applicable law against a defendant described in \n     paragraph (2) in a Y2K action may not exceed the lesser of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for compensatory damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Defendant described.--A defendant described in this \n     paragraph is a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as a individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, or organization with fewer than 50 \n     full-time employees.\n       (3) No Cap If Injury Specifically Intended.--Paragraph (1) \n     does not apply if the plaintiff establishes by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the defendant acted with specific \n     intent to injure the plaintiff.\n       In section 13--\n       (1) in subsection (a), strike ``by clear and convincing \n     evidence'' and inserting ``by the standard of evidence under \n     applicable State law in effect before January 1, 1999'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1), strike ``by clear and convincing \n     evidence'' and inserting ``by the standard of evidence under \n     applicable State law in effect before January 1, 1999''; and\n       (3) at the end add the following:\n       (d) Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness \n     Disclosure Act Apply.--The protections for the exchange of \n     information provided by section 4 of the Year 2000 \n     Information and Readiness Disclosure Act (Public Law 105-271) \n     shall apply to this Act.\n       Strike section 14.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 299\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 96, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of amendment 273 insert the following:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this week's Innovation in Education \nAward recipient is a remarkable school, Liberty Elementary, in \nMarysville, Washington. With help from school staff and led by \nPrincipal Paula Jones, Liberty Elementary's students have made \noutstanding advances in their reading performance.\n  Historically, this school has not shown great success in student \nstandardized test results. To improve those results, the school's staff \nresearched proven ``best practices'' for improving student reading. The \nstaff eventually selected a program called ``Success For All'' that \nfocuses on early intervention and personal attention to promote \nliteracy.\n  Liberty Elementary's parents and staff recognized that in order for \nthis program to succeed, they needed to be closely involved. So the \nparents and staff established ``Family Fun Night'' each month to \neducate families on the importance of reading, the benefits of \neducation reform, and how to feel more comfortable as active partners \nin their children's education. Liberty's staff attends these family \nactivities without extra compensation. The staff has also teamed up \nwith local businesses to help acknowledge outstanding participation and \nachievement by students and parents.\n  Two years ago, Liberty teachers, parents, and students decided to \nrefocus their efforts on reading. Now 80% of the students are reading \nat current grade level and above--a tremendous increase of 58%. \nStudents at Liberty are now proud and successful readers thanks to the \nhard work of the Liberty staff and the support from their devoted \nparents and community.\n  What is noteworthy about Liberty is that the students became better \nreaders because the community became more involved with its children. \nThis Innovation in Education award is another example of how local \ncommunities really do know best. Local educators and parents work with \nour children every day and know what needs improvement. They deserve \nour support and should have more decision-making authority over how \nfederal education dollars are to be spent. Educators from Washington \nstate and from across the country need and deserve more flexibility and \nmore control over their classrooms. Liberty Elementary and schools like \nit are the reasons why I will fight to return that power to our local \nschools where it belongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4469-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MAY 1--GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, communities across America will \nobserve Guillain-Barre Syndrome Awareness Day this Saturday, May 1. \nGuillain-Barre Syndrome, or GBS, is a paralyzing disorder that can \nstrike any person, regardless of age, gender, or background. Victims \noften face months of hospital care and long-term disabilities can \nresult.\n  For many years the GBS Foundation International has been renowned for \nits worldwide leadership in the battle against GBS, and I welcome this \nopportunity to commend the Foundation for all it has done. The \nFoundation, established in 1980, provides an effective support network \nfor patients and their families. It also provides educational \nmaterials, funds medical research, and conducts symposia.\n  GBS Awareness Day is an important part of educating the public about \nthis potentially catastrophic disease. In Massachusetts, for example, \nthe chapter of the Foundation in Boston is coordinating an event for \nthe entire New England area that will include a fund-raising walk \naround the New England Rehabilitation Hospital in Woburn, followed by a \nvideo presentation and seminars on the medical and psychological \naspects of the disease.\n  One of the most disturbing developments in the battle against GBS is \nthe recent scientific research linking this disease to infection by a \ncommon food-borne pathogen known as Campylobacter, which is the most \ncommon bacterial cause of food-borne illness in the United States. \nThese bacteria frequently contaminate raw chicken. Unfortunately, \nCampylobacter is also one of a growing number of bacteria that are \ndeveloping resistance to the antibiotic drugs commonly used to treat \nthe diseases they cause, and these drug-resistant bacteria are now a \nmajor public health threat.\n  The health and safety of the American people is one of our top \npriorities in Congress. Microbial contamination of food is an \nincreasing problem. The association of GBS with Campylobacter infection \ndemonstrates that food-borne illness is a serious national challenge. \nWe need to take more effective action against these threats to families \nand communities. An important priority of this Congress is to act on \nlegislation that will enhance the nation's ability to deal with \ncontaminated food and antimicrobial-resistant organisms.\n  We in Congress also need to do more to support research into all \naspects of the prevention, treatment, and cure of GBS. I welcome GBS \nAwareness Day this year as an opportunity for all of us in Congress and \nacross the country to become more actively involved in meeting this \nimportant public health challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4469-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSOCIATION OF MAPPING SENIORS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nAssociation of Mapping Seniors (AMS) on the 25th Anniversary of their \nfounding.\n  The AMS is a distinguished organization of former employees at \nmapping and imagery agencies like the National Imagery and Mapping \nAgency (NIMA). Their important work has been invaluable to both our \nnational policy makers, and our national security.\n  Mr. President, the data produced by these dedicated Americans has \nbeen key to understanding our world and making it safer. Mapping and \nimagery not only help us support our men and women in uniform, but also \nhelp us develop our cultural understanding of ourselves in terms of \npopulation, growth, religious and economic clusters, and more. I want \nto commend each and every member of the AMS for their indispensable \nservice to our country, our community, and our culture.\n  I am also proud to note that Maryland has been home to many devoted \nmembers of this important organization. As many of my colleagues know, \nI am a strong and unyielding supporter of federal employees, and these \nmen and women are no exception. I want to thank them, Mr. President, \nfor their outstanding service to our country, and to honor them in \ncelebration of the 25th Anniversary of the Association of Mapping \nSeniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4469-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4469-S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF FAMILIES FOR HOME EDUCATION\n\n Mr. BOND.

I join with the Missouri General Assembly in \nrecognizing their commitment not only to excellence in education, but \nalso to the promotion of public policy that strengthens the family.\n  Home educators make tremendous sacrifices to educate our nation's \nyoung people and they are making a difference. Countless studies show \nthat parental involvement positively impacts the education of a child. \nHome-schooled children, in particular, benefit greatly from the \nindividualized, one-on-one training they receive from dedicated parents \nand home educators. They are also afforded unique opportunities to \nparticipate in apprenticeships, and community and civic organizations. \nThese activities serve to strengthen social skills and enrich their \noverall educational experience.\n  In today's challenging society, it is more important than ever that \nour young people receive a quality education if they are to succeed in \nthe expanding global market. Home educators play a vital part in \npreparing children, tomorrow's workforce, to successfully compete and \nprosper in the adult world. I commend these dedicated parents and FHE, \nand wish them continued success in their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4470-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MARIANNE BOND WEBSTER\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nhonor the many accomplishments of Marianne Bond Webster, of Dunwoody, \nGeorgia. By the age of 43, Marianne was a success by most yardsticks: \nhappily married and the mother of two, tennis champion, gourmet cook, \nand a popular caterer. However, several events in Marianne's life \nsparked a midlife change which would cause her to re-examine her life \nand become more involved in our nation's political system. This \nrealization spurred her to a more active role in WAND--the Women's \nAction for New Directions.\n  WAND is a national grassroots peace group emphasizing the role of \nwomen-- activists, legislators and community leaders--on issues related \nto the federal budget, the military, violence, and nuclear disarmament \nand nonproliferation. A nonprofit organization founded in the early \n1980s, WAND has grown into a national organization headquartered in \nBoston, MA, with an advocacy office in Washington, DC, and a field \noffice in Atlanta, GA, with chapters and organizational partners across \nthe country. WAND's educational arm, WAND Education Fund, was started \nin 1982.\n  WAND's mission is to empower women to act politically to reduce \nviolence and militarism and redirect excessive military resources to \nhuman and environmental needs.\n  In 1990, WiLL--the Women Legislators' Lobby, a program of WAND--was \nformed. WiLL is a powerful and unique membership network of progressive \nwomen state legislators. It is the only national multipartisan network \nof women state legislators from all 50 states working to influence \nfederal policies and budget priorities. One out of three women state \nlegislators is a member.\n  During the 1990s, it seemed Marianne Bond Webster was everywhere, \ndoing everything for WAND and WiLL: lobby days, media workshops, a \nsession on nuclear waste for junior high school students, a tour of the \nSavannah River Site, campaigning for Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, \narranging benefit concerts with the Indigo Girls, and leading WAND both \nlocally and nationally.\n  By 1998 Marianne had made two major decisions: to serve as WAND's \nNational president, and to run for an open seat in the Georgia \nlegislature. Caring, smart, honest, brave, and decent, I know she would \nhave made a tremendous difference.\n  But, tragically, on April 17, 1998 she jumped on her bicycle to \ndeliver her campaign leaflets. The bag holding her literature caught in \nthe spokes, and she flew over the handlebars, breaking her neck when \nshe landed. Marianne never regained consciousness. She died on June 11, \n1998.\n  Family, friends, and WAND members maintained a constant vigil by \nMarianne's hospital bed and joined hands with those who could not \nthrough daily e-mail updates. She touched so many with her special \nmagic. Her spirit lives on in all of us. And her work continues through \nMarianne's Fund.\n  Her family and friends developed the idea for a fund shortly after \nMarianne's death. And in 1999 WAND Education Fund established \nMarianne's Fund with the Atlanta Women's Foundation. WiLL and the other \nWAND programs, which had become so central in Marianne's life, will be \nbeneficiaries of the Fund.\n  Marianne believed wholeheartedly that all women, if offered support \nand training, would contribute significantly to the political process. \nShe recruited women state legislators to WiLL enthusiastically, and \nconnected WAND activists with WiLL members nationally, to forge \npowerful alliances. With courage and intelligence, she took on WAND's \ncomplex issues, becoming an expert on the subject of nuclear waste. \nMarianne toured nuclear weapons facilities and test sites. She wrote \npassionately about the legacy of nuclear weapons, alerting her audience \nto the dangers and costs of continued nuclear weapons production.\n  Related programs of peace, justice, and protection of the environment \nidentified by the Webster/Bond family will also be beneficiaries of \nMarianne's Fund. Marianne worked to increase the women's vote, strongly \nsupported affirmative action for women in business and the professions, \ndonated generously to battered women and children's causes, and \ncontributed much to other grassroots organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing and honoring the life of Marianne Bond Webster. Marianne \nwas a wonderful and amazing person who positively touched the lives, \nand bettered the lives, of many Georgians and many Americans. Although \nher life was unfortunately too short, her memory and her work on behalf \nof our country and our political system will last forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4470-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4470-S4471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO HIS HIGHNESS SHAIKH ESSA BIN SALMAN AL-KHALIFA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to His \nHighness Shaikh Essa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the late Amir of the State \nof Bahrain. The people of Bahrain recently commemorated the 40th day of \nmourning for their great leader who passed away on the 6th of March. \nShaikh Essa was known for his kindness and compassion and will be \ndearly missed by both the people of Bahrain and his friends around the \nworld.\n  Shaikh Essa was a visionary leader who helped transform the Bahraini \neconomy from an oil-based economy to an economy of trade, investment, \nbanking, and service. These improvements led to Bahrain achieving one \nof the highest standards of living among the Arab countries.\n  Under Shaikh Essa, Bahrain strengthened its relationship with the \nWest. In 1903, Mason Memorial, the first American hospital in the \nregion, was established. It has since become a landmark. In 1932, when \nBahrain became the first country in the southern Gulf region to \ndiscover oil, American expertise backed the exploration. This year \nBahrain is celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the strong friendship it \nhas with the United States and our Navy. The Bahrani Ambassador to the \nUnited States, His Excellency Mohammad Abdul Ghaffar Abdulla, continues \nto do a wonderful job in keeping this strong friendship alive.\n  My condolences go out to the people of Bahrain and Shaikh Essa's \nfamily. I wish to extend my warmest regards to His Highness Shaikh \nHamad Bin Essa Al-Khalifa, who has succeeded his father as the new Amir \nof Bahrain. I am certain he will follow his father's path and continue \nto keep allied relations between Bahrain and the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Amir's tribute to his father be printed \nin the Record.\n  The tribute follows.\n\n Speech of His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin Essa Al-Khalifa, Amir of the \n                            State of Bahrain\n\n       In The Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\n       Our Dear People, Peace, And God Blessings Be Upon You\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\n       God most high said ``among the believers are men who have \n     been true to their covenant with God, of them some have \n     completed their vow, and some still wait, but they have never \n     changed their determination in the least.'' Trust said God \n     almighty.\n       At this historical circumstances, we share with you the \n     great tragic of the sad demise and great loss of our father, \n     the leader.\n       At the same time we are all united with prospect of \n     confidence to shoulder the responsibility of continuing the \n     pursuance of the path and the course he laid down through his \n     sagacity, devotion and tolerance.\n       In line with this, we need to meet the demands and changes \n     of the future, in a world rift with volatility, by means of \n     Bahrain's potentialities comprising the ability to develop \n     and revitalize since the start of process of modern progress \n     and development.\n       For that, Bahrain has been leading the drive among \n     brotherly states and closely working with them in this vital \n     region, of the Arab nation and the whole world.\n       The Respected Citizens, with the loss of our father, late \n     Shaikh Essa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, we have lost an Amir who \n     was a caring beloved leader, a close friend to every \n     individual of his people and a great man whom the whole world \n     loved and respected.\n       His human legacy shall remain the guide of this nation and \n     over next generations, reflecting the true image of Bahrain \n     in devotion, tolerance and civilization.\n       Prevailed by this great tragic loss, and satisfied by the \n     creed of God almighty, we pray that his mercy and blessing \n     bestow our beloved who granted his country, people and nation \n     all the goodness of action which shall remain the guide we \n     follow in the nation and which will be preserved as a path we \n     pursue enabling us to shoulder and assume the tremendous \n     responsibility, we all are charged with for the sake of the \n     pride, prosperity of Bahrain and for the future of the \n     generations.\n       The great late beloved left for us a well-developed, \n     flourished and secured nation and he turned Bahrain into an \n     oasis of civilization, prosperity and a landmark of knowledge \n     and progress in an Arabian Gulf and the pan Arab nation.\n       We ought to carry the standard, should the responsibility \n     and continue the drive to serve this nation which is \n     characterized by good nature and manner of the people, and by \n     the competence and the civilized standard of the sons of this \n     country.\n       Our dear people, Our great late man shall be recorded by \n     history for his leading role, high status and great decency.\n       From this rich testimony, having great respect for the \n     great late father, and at this adieu position with a forward \n     look towards future, we recall that Essa Bin Salman was for \n     us and his people in Bahrain, the man of national \n     independence, of the constitution and consultation and the \n     man who accomplished the state of institutions, law and \n     order.\n       He was the man of development, pan-progress and national \n     economy.\n       He was the man of Gulf unity and Arab solidarity in most \n     difficult situations and circumstances.\n       He was the man of peace and international cooperation and \n     genuine friendship among the peoples of the world.\n       All these guiding features shall remain before us while we \n     pursue national path, our Gulf unity and our Arab solidarity \n     and in all domains of our regional approach with the \n     neighbors and our global cooperation.\n       We shall remain the solid course at various levels, with \n     all of you in the drive of the national work, with the \n     brothers in the Gulf and the Arab world and with every \n     sincere friend of Bahrain, in this region and in the whole \n     world.\n       With the blessings of God almighty, we shall adhere to the \n     track forged by the great late, we shall share love, brace \n     and cooperation with all who seek goodness for Bahrain, \n     inside and outside, and we shall protect and safeguard \n     Bahrain against any harm through the determination and \n     sacrifices.\n       As we pay tribute to the great late man and accolade his \n     achievements, we ought to applaud with gratitude and for the \n     sake of truth and history, the leading role of his brother \n     and his right hand our uncle His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin \n     Salman Al-Khalifa, the Prime Minister, who and since the \n     beginning till the last minute, spared no effort in serving \n     the nation, developing the country, leading the government \n     through his deep vision, sagacity and hard work resulting in \n     the fruits of wisdom, experience and well organized systems.\n       He was and shall remain a source of richness and a source \n     of vision and inspiration to face the tasks of national work \n     and future challenges.\n       Every thanks and appreciation are extended to His Highness \n     for the honorable and leading stances he played for the sake \n     of this nation and at all stages of development. We have the \n     confidence that through gifted traits of deep perception and \n     solid resolve, His Highness will continue the path of \n     devotion we expect from him and from the generation of the \n     fathers who accompanied him in quest for development and \n     progress.\n       On other respect, witnessing this historical turning point, \n     we call on and urge the young generation of Bahrain to \n     shoulder their responsibilities and prepare for their tasks, \n     starting from our Crown Prince His Highness Shaikh Salman Bin \n     Hamad Al-Khalifa, whom we wish every success in discharging \n     his new constitutional mission.\n       We take this opportunity to express our appreciation for \n     the unanimity and the support we gained from the members of \n     the ruling family, led by our uncle His Highness Shaikh \n     Khalifa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa and our uncle His Highness \n     Shaikh Mohammed Bin Salman Al-Khalifa who commended his \n     appointing as the Crown Prince in accordance with the \n     constitution.\n       Our dear people, It would be necessary to express to all of \n     you every gratitude over the cohesion and sincere loyalty you \n     have demonstrated at this historical situation, representing \n     your sustained allegiance which reflects true unity between \n     the people and their leadership in this cherished country.\n       I would like to say it clearly that as a son of Essa and as \n     an adherent to the duty, I shall raise the standard of his \n     path which does not differentiate between the people of the \n     single nation, regardless of their beliefs and origin, and \n     which only consider the honesty of national association, and \n     which consider the true citizenship which seeks every \n     goodness for Bahrain and her people.\n       On the Gulf, Arab and Islamic domains, we are pleased to \n     express, on your behalf, the deep appreciation for the \n     sentiments of heartfelt condolences and over the stances of \n     sincere support we received from all brothers, leaders and \n     people in the Gulf and Arab states, affirming the reality of \n     unity which binds us all and to whom our late great leader \n     was one of its prominent figures.\n       We are also in the position to convey appreciation and \n     thanks to the Islamic countries which embraced us with truly \n     sincere feelings, and to all friendly states of the world \n     with whom we share the keenness for a stable, secure and \n     prosperous international community.\n       To conclude, witnessing this historical point, and as we \n     consider our assessment of all the institutions, the \n     Consultative Council and various bodies of Bahrain national \n     community for their constructive contribution, we have the \n     pleasure to extend a message of applaud to those who \n     safeguarded the soil of this nation and protected the \n     achievements, and to express, on your behalf, every \n     encouragement and support to the personnel of Bahrain Defense \n     Force, who are shouldering the tremendous responsibilities in \n     protecting the country, safeguarding its territories and \n     securing the security and tranquility of citizens and \n     residents.\n       This is achieved by means of joining forces with exerted \n     efforts of security forces, police and the national guard.\n       At this moment, we recall the saying of our great late \n     leader who addressed the personnel of Bahrain Defense Force \n     and said ``our solid belief of Bahrain Defense Force is an \n     integral part of the forces of Gulf Cooperation Council \n     providing with further confidence and determination to \n     achieve the security and stability of our region. You have \n     presented a true example in accomplishing the mission of \n     honor and duty.''\n       Such belief will remain our solid conviction at all times \n     and circumstances.\n       Our dear people, We pledge to remain with you at every step \n     and stage of our national work, for we are strong through the \n     support of God almighty and your backing.\n       Cohesion and unity will continue to exist between us for \n     the sake of Bahrain image and pride and for the sake of her \n     prosperity.\n       We shall present before you our views and perspective on \n     the future of the national action, and it would be our \n     concern to perceive your expectations and aspirations for the \n     goodness of Bahrain based on the formula of cohesion between \n     the leadership and the citizen.\n       We are greatly confident that our Bahraini civilized \n     society is blessed with many potentials of real progress upon \n     which we can build in the path of political, administrative \n     and economic development.\n       Such path we highly believe in and consider it as a source \n     of richness for our traditions of consultation, and as a \n     pattern for governmental development and for accomplishing \n     the comprehensive progress and diversifying of the national \n     economy in the interest of the people of this nation and \n     every piece of this soil.\n       Finally, we have but to pray for God almighty to bestow our \n     great loss and our leader with the mercy and rest him unto \n     the heaven.\n       We are consoled by the fact that we shall remain adherent \n     to his spirit and keep his path, to protect the soil of this \n     nation, by every means of determination, dedication and \n     resolve.\n       And say work righteousness, soon will God observe your work \n     and his Apostle and the believers.

Mr. President, this weekend, two very special \npeople, Stan and Iris Ovshinsky, will be honored by the Workmen's \nCircle/Arbeter Ring, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving \nJewish heritage and Yiddish culture, and to pursuing social and \neconomic justice.\n  The organization's selection of Stan and Iris is most fitting. Their \nwork on behalf of social causes and their love of Yiddish culture has \nbeen a constant part of their lives. But what makes Stan and Iris so \nspecial is that theirs is also a great love story. Stan and Iris met, \nfell very much in love, married\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nand dedicated themselves to ``Tikkun Olam,'' the Jewish belief in the \nresponsibility to ``repair the world'' and leave it a better place for \nfuture generations. Their steadfast commitment to Tikkun Olam is \nnowhere more evident than in their work together at Energy Conversion \nDevices (ECD), the materials technology company they founded in Troy, \nMichigan in 1960 when they joined their lives together.\n  Stan, a self-taught inventor/scientist who never attended college, \nbegan working in the field of amorphous and disordered materials in \n1955, when the scientific community regarded them as of little \nscientific interest. Iris, who has a PhD in biochemistry, joined him in \nhis work after they met. Stan and Iris proved that these materials were \nof great value scientifically and technologically. Stan's initial paper \ndescribing their properties has become one of the five most cited \npublications in the history of the prestigious Physical Review Letters. \nThat and subsequent papers, some co-authored with Iris, led to a new \nfield of scientific study.\n  From the beginning, Stan and Iris understood the significance of \ntheir discoveries. They saw a future in which new engineered materials \ncould be used to improve people's lives, solve societal problems and \nbuild new industries. They committed themselves and ECD to that vision \nand never wavered from it. Always on the cutting edge, often ahead of \ntheir time, they have stayed the course. Today, ECD holds over 350 \nactive U.S. patents and over 800 corresponding foreign patients. \nAmorphous semiconductors and other engineered amorphous and disordered \nmaterials are now widely used in an array of products, many of which \nhave been developed and commercialized at ECD.\n  Three technologies exemplify the Ovshinskys' ingenuity and commitment \nto their vision:\n  Amorphous Silicon Photovoltaics (PV): The Ovshinskys were determined \nto develop a practical and affordable method of generating electric \npower from the sun, and pioneered the use of amorphous silicon \nmaterials to reduce materials costs and energy used in a highly \ninnovative roll-to-roll solar cell production process. Award winning \nproducts using their technologies are already in the marketplace.\n  Ovonuc Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries: The ``Ovonic'' battery is a \nhigh performing, nontoxic rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMH) \nbattery. NiMH batteries are replacing nickel cadmium batteries used in \nportable electronic devices. Determined to develop products of benefit \nto society, the Ovshinskys led their company into developing the \nbattery for advanced vehicle technologies to ease growing concerns over \nair pollution. NiMH batteries are the advanced electric vehicle battery \nof choice of major auto manufacturers.\n  Computer Information Storage Materials and Devices: The phase change \nerasable semiconductor materials developed by the Ovshinskys have \nbecome the standard in rewritable optical discs. Similar materials \nemploying the same physics show the potential for use in electronic \ndevices that can help the United States recapture its former dominant \nposition in semiconductor memories.\n  The totality of Stan and Iris's achievements is remarkable. They \npioneered a new branch of science and then successfully applied this \nscience to develop new technologies and commercial products having \nsignificant impacts on the energy and information industries. Because \nof their efforts to solve major problems through science and \ntechnology, the world will be a better place. Now in their 70s, their \nwork and their commitment continue unabated, as does their obvious love \nfor and delight in one another.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4472-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WHEN HISTORY ASKS WHO STOOD UP TO EVIL IN KOSOVO, THE ANSWER WILL BE: \n                                  NATO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, sixty years ago, as Europe moved \nincreasingly close to war, a number of philanthropic organizations came \nto the aid of those desperately trying to escape the Holocaust. Today, \nmany of those same organizations have turned their attention to helping \nthe latest victims of genocide. The American Jewish Committee, for \nexample, has raised over $800,000 in humanitarian aide for the Kosovar \nrefugees.\n  As in World War II, these organizations recognize that they cannot \nstop the genocide without support from the world community. In the case \nof Kosovo, that means that NATO has had to bring its military might to \nbear on Slobodan Milosevic. This sentiment was poignantly expressed in \na recent statement by the American Jewish Committee, one of the \norganizations actively worked to alleviate both the European genocide \nof today and that of a generation ago.\n  Mr. President, I therefore ask that their statement in support of \nNATO's ongoing efforts be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n               Statement by the American Jewish Committee\n\n       When history asks who stood up to evil in Kosovo, the \n     answer will be: NATO. The world could see the slaughter \n     coming. Diplomats worked furiously to prevent it--and, for a \n     time, succeeded.\n       But when Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, in the name of a \n     nationalism run amok, set his army and police at the throat \n     of the ethnic Albanian citizens of Kosovo defying appeals to \n     end the terror and withdraw, one international force had the \n     resolve to stand up to Belgrade's policy of barbarism.\n       NATO, the guarantor of European security for half a \n     century, rose to the challenge of defending the Kosovo \n     Albanians. Nineteen countries acted in unison to stop the \n     violence against the Kosovars and seek their safe return \n     under international protection.\n       In this noble mission, NATO must prevail. What is at stake \n     in Kosovo isn't oil or commerce or trading routes. What is at \n     stake are basic principles: human rights, human dignity, the \n     credibility of deterrence, collective security. With \n     determination and courage, NATO weighed the difficult choices \n     and chose to act--because it was right, because the \n     alternative would give tyrants a green light to terrorize \n     civilian populations and destroy the fabric of international \n     order. We recognize the sacrifice made by each NATO member to \n     arrest evil in Kosovo. In this dark century, witness to \n     unspeakable acts of inhumanity, we applaud the alliance for \n     taking a principled stand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4472-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CHIEF THOMAS C. O'REILLY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, throughout my career in the \nSenate I have made the fight against crime one of my top legislative \npriorities. Consequently, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the \ncareer and accomplishments of one of New Jersey's most distinguished \npublic servants, Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly of the Newark Police \nDepartment.\n  For years, the City of Newark has faced many challenges. But I am \nproud to say today Newark is now a city on the rise. There are many \npeople to thank and recognize for the rebirth of New Jersey's largest \ncity. Today, I would like to thank Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly in \nparticular. Chief O'Reilly has devoted more than four decades of his \nlife to serving the city of Newark as a police officer. His service to \nthe city began on December 10, 1956, when he joined the Police \nDepartment. He started as a patrol officer and rose through the ranks \nto Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Inspector, Deputy Chief, \nChief-of-Staff and finally Police Chief.\n  Tonight, April 29, 1999, Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly will be honored by \nthe city of Newark and I am happy to join the many voices who will \nthank him for his career on the front lines of law enforcement. We are \nindebted to him for his service. Those who follow him as Police Chief \nhave a spendid model of leadership to follow. Chief Thomas O'Reilly's \nlevel of commitment and dedication to the safety of Newark's residents \nrepresents our nation's finest traditions of community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/29/senate-section/article/S4472-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4472-S4473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair announces on behalf of the majority \nleader, pursuant to Public Law 105-277, the appointment of Delna Jones \nof Oregon, Representative of Local Government, as a member of the \nAdvisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, vice James Barksdale.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Internet is nearly a ubiquitous aspect \nof American life. It goes without saying ``electronic commerce''--e-\ncommerce--has become a central aspect for buying products and services. \nOnly two years ago five million households shopped for some product on \nthe Internet. Last year that number doubled. Now the forecast for this \nyear is that\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nnearly 15 million households will let their keyboards do the work. This \nis a threefold increase of shoppers in only two years. One can also \nlook at the dollar volume affected, which is predicted to double to \n$31B this year.\n  Mr. President, city, county and state officials are understandably \noverwhelmed by this Internet Tsunami--15 million homes spending $31 \nbillion. I have spent time talking with these public officials. I have \nlistened to their views. They are frightened, and they have legitimate \nconcerns about their sales tax base. However, electronic commerce will \nnot end Main Street as we now know it. I am confident public policy \nwill evolve to deal with the new electronic marketplace in a fair and \nbalanced manner.\n  Although the Internet is currently accessed by almost 40 million \nAmerican homes, less than half are using the Internet for commerce \npurposes. This tells me there are issues that need to be addressed \nbeyond how the sales tax is treated--issues like encryption, privacy \nand digital signatures--all necessary components for vibrant Internet \ncommerce. I hope Congress will examine and act on these issues during \nthe 106th Congress, while the Advisory Commission on Electronic \nCommerce works on the tax implications.\n  The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce must complete its \nreport promptly so the information is available to Congress before the \nmoratorium on new Internet taxes ends. Mr. President, the report date \ndoes not need to be extended. I am very impressed with Governor Jim \nGilmore's leadership of the Commission and his aggressive technology \nagenda. I commend him for his progress thus far, and I know he will \ndeliver on time a fair and balanced report.\n  Mr. President, let me back up and say a few words about the \nCommission. This provision was part of the compromise Representative \nChris Cox worked out with state and local government associations. His \nefforts precipitated the legislative process and culminated in the bill \nbecoming law. I want to thank Representative Cox for proposing and fine \ntuning the Commission. I consulted with him as Congress worked to get \nthis Commission up and running and appreciate his diligence and insight \nthroughout the process.\n  Mr. President, today I also want to commend my friend Jimmy Barksdale \nfor graciously volunteering to step down from the Commission. He and I \nboth agree that the issues surrounding the Internet are too important \nto let individuals and personal agendas get in the way. Jimmy decided \nto step aside so the Commission can get beyond the disruptive law suit. \nLet me say a few words about why I selected Jimmy in the first place--I \nwanted a Mississippian who could bring Southern common sense and wisdom \nto the evolving public policy for the Internet. Jimmy knows what it \ntakes to create a new marketplace and he understands the interplay and \ncontext for each facet of the telecommunications sector, especially \nsince the Telecommunications Act of 1996 empowered many sectors to \ncompete with each other.\n  I have selected Ms. Delna Jones to fill the vacancy. Ms. Jones is a \npublic official who brings the Commission into a balance between public \nand private sector interests. Ms. Jones is a county official from \nWashington County, Oregon, thus ensuring that each layer of local \ngovernment is now represented. Ms. Jones is from a non-sales tax state \nwhich now means all state configurations for income and sales tax \napproaches are present. Ms. Jones also worked for a telecommunications \ncompany and is no stranger to this aspect of the communication world. \nMs. Jones will provide the Commission a voice for the 46% of all \nInternet users who are female. Ms. Jones has been recognized by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business which tells me she is \nsensitive to the needs of small business--a key component of our \neconomy. Her background brings a valuable professional richness to the \nCommission. Senator Gordon Smith both knows and has served with Ms. \nJones in Oregon's state legislature. He believes she has the right mix \nof professional and personal skills to make a meaningful and \nsignificant contribution to the Commission.\n  Mr. President, I want the record to be clear. The Commission's \nimbalance was not created by me, and it is unfortunate that those who \ndid not fulfill the law's mandate were paralyzed and unable to offer a \nreal fix. I have stepped up to the problem and changed one of my \nselections. Evolving Internet public policy is just too important to be \nheld hostage. I want America to have a vibrant electronic communication \nand commerce medium for the 21st Century.\n  I also want to challenge the members of the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce to focus and produce recommendations that will \nassist Congress in making the right public policy for the Internet.\n  Mr. President, today 37 million Americans will click on the Internet \nfor something, perhaps a purchase. They need and deserve the right \npublic policy--a policy this Commission can and will influence. We \nshould not be afraid of this technology shift--the Internet's Tsunami, \ne-commerce--nor should we ignore the consequences of how America's \ncommerce is or should be structured to ensure the prosperity and \nvitality of America's 21st Century electronic economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
