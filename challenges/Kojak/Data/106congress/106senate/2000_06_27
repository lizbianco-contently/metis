The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I had originally planned to come to the \nfloor to voice my opposition to this bill and to offer a point of order \nthat it violates rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. I \nintended to do so because of two serious failings in it.\n  First, this bill cuts the program that Congress passed in the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act to help States provide health insurance to low-\nincome children and could cost up to 2 million of them their health \ninsurance. The State Children's Health Insurance Program, known by its \nacronym as S-CHIP, was designed to make health insurance coverage \navailable, at State option, to lower-income, uninsured children.\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n  More than 2 million children have been enrolled in S-CHIP--children \nwho would otherwise lack access to the health insurance coverage that \nhelps them grow and thrive.\n  When we designed S-CHIP in 1997, States were given specific \nallotments to cover eligible uninsured children. We designed the \nprogram so that those allotments were to be available to individual \nStates for a period of 3 years. This was done to ensure that allotments \ndidn't sit unused. At the end of 3 years, unspent allotments are to be \nreallocated to other States that have spent their full allotments. The \nbasic idea is to effectively direct available S-CHIP dollars to States \nwilling and able to use them to cover uninsured kids.\n  We are now coming up upon the first opportunity to reallocate unspent \nS-CHIP funds. Three years have elapsed since the program was first \nimplemented.\n  But, instead of thinking through the ramifications of reallocation, \ntoday we confront an unexpected and far more fundamental challenge to \nthe future of the S-CHIP program. The appropriations bill before us \nwould cut $1.9 billion in S-CHIP funds from the program, with an \nunenforceable promise to restore the funds in 2003--a promise which is \nitself subject to a Budget Act point of order.\n  This cut represents a dramatic retreat from the commitment the \nFederal Government extended to uninsured children, their families, and \nto the States in 1997. S-CHIP was designed to be a stable, guaranteed \nsource of funding to States to cover lower-income, uninsured children. \nIf States cannot count on the federal government to stand by its \ncommitment, there will inevitably be an erosion of State support for \nparticipation in the program and aggressive enrollment strategies. As a \nresult, fewer children will receive health insurance coverage.\n\n  We have to be very clear that what we are talking about today isn't a \ntechnical accounting gimmick that simply moves funds forward. We are \ntalking about a concrete cut in a very real program upon which millions \nof children depend. The consequences will be no less real. If the \nprovision in the appropriations bill is not removed, the National \nGovernors' Association estimates that as many as 2 million children \nwill be denied access to health insurance coverage.\n  For that reason, the National Governors' Association strongly and \nunambiguously opposes the S-CHIP cut included in this appropriations \nbill.\n  NGA is not alone in its opposition to the appropriations cut. The \ncommunity of advocates who work on behalf of children strongly opposes \nit as well. In fact, all Senators should have received a letter signed \nby over 80 groups opposing the cut, including the Children's Defense \nFund, Families USA, the American Hospital Association, and the American \nMedical Association. In addition, the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica has also written to express its opposition to S-CHIP cuts.\n  Second, this bill cuts three welfare programs by $1.4 billion. The \ntitle XX social services block grant is cut by a whopping 65 percent--\nfrom $1.7 billion in funding to $600 million. This is just a quarter of \nthe level we promised to Governors during welfare reform in 1996.\n  The title XX block grant was enacted in 1981, during the Reagan \nadministration, to provide States with a flexible source of social \nservices funding. Today, title XX funds services to almost 6 million \nAmericans, principally children, people with disabilities, and seniors. \nIn Delaware, we use these funds for a broad range of programs--\nincluding helping abused and neglected children and for people who are \nblind, and for Meals-on-Wheels. These funds go to programs without \nadequate sources of support and to fill the gaps for the neediest \ncitizens.\n  These title XX funds are essential. These funds cannot be easily \nreplaced--by States or local governments, or by private charity.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill would cut these \nsupplemental welfare grants to States by $240 million. In the 1996 \nwelfare reform legislation States took a big, big risk. States \nexchanged an open-ended Federal entitlement--that is, guaranteed \ndollars for each person who qualified for welfare--for a fixed block \ngrant.\n  To provide States with some modest protection, welfare reform \ncontained a provision to provide States with a big population increase \nand high poverty rates with supplemental welfare grants. The Labor-HHS \nbill would cut these grants and break that promise.\n  These welfare program cuts violate the fundamental deal Congress made \nwith the Governors during welfare reform. With these cuts, Congress \nreneges on its word.\n  Next year Congress will begin reauthorization of welfare reform. If \nCongress shows that it is not a dependable partner now, how can we \nexpect States to have confidence in us next year?\n  Altogether this bill cuts a children's health program and welfare \nprograms by $3.3 billion. This is unquestionably a violation of sound \npolicy.\n  In the interest of sound policy, in the interest of uninsured \nchildren, in the interest of welfare recipients, and in the interest of \nthe States who are working with us to serve these vulnerable \nindividuals, I had no choice but to oppose this bill.\n  I am not alone in recognizing these problems, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Grassley, and Senator Graham \nall joined me in a letter to our colleagues warning them against \nsupporting this bill because of its inclusion of the provisions I \noppose and have just outlined. I know that other Senators opposed them \nas well and I thank all of them for their support.\n  However, Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, has assured me that these \ncuts--specifically: (1) The $1.9 billion cut to the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program located in section 217 on pages 53 and 54 of \nthe bill; (2) the $1.1 billion cut to the title XX social services \nblock grant located in title 2, page 40 of the bill; (3) the $240 \nmillion cut to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, \nprogram, located in section 216, pages 52 to 53 of the bill; and (4) \nthe $50 million cut to the Welfare-to-Work performance bonus program, \nlocated in section 104, pages 21 to 23 of the bill--will be eliminated \nin their entirety in this bill when it returns from conference.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair is informed that there is \nsupposed to be a vote at 9:45 on the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote be \npostponed until the completion of my remarks; and I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am surprised at the comments made by \nthe Senator from Delaware to this extent: The 1997 Budget Act puts \nlimits on the amounts that can be appropriated under the pending bill, \nthe Health and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  In order to have a technical offset against the additions that are in \nthis bill over the 1997 limits, we provided these three technical \nprovisions that give us the right to take the Health and Human Services \nbill across the floor to conference. We had no intention at all to ever \nsuggest the Congress would enact those provisions. The Finance \nCommittee knew that. All Members knew that. This is a technical \nsituation where, in order to get the bill across the floor until we \nenact the military construction bill, which contains the waiver of the \n1997 provisions with regard to the ceilings for our committee, we had \nto have this offset.\n  I assure the Senator that the bill will not come out of conference \nwith these provisions in it. They were never intended to be enacted. No \none on our committee supports the elimination of these provisions, and \nSenator Specter was very gracious in allowing us these provisions to \ncomply with the 1997 act.\n  I assure the Finance Committee that this bill will not come out of \ncommittee with these provisions in it. They were never intended to be \nin it, as the Finance Committee knows.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nbased on his assurances of these provisions' removal in conference, I \nwithdraw my opposition to this bill. I believe that this is the best \nway to proceed: We not only protect the programs that I came to the \nfloor to protect, but we also allow this funding bill for many other \nimportant programs to forward as well. I thank the Senator from\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nAlaska for working with me to resolve this impasse.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership \nin this area, and I commend Senator Moynihan as well for his commitment \nto this important program. I believe the understanding we have reached \nis a satisfactory way to protect this program in conference.\n  The rescission of funds for children's health insurance would be a \nserious mistake. It would come at the expense of 12 million uninsured \nchildren in low income families across the nation.\n  It would override the reallocation system established with broad \nbipartisan support in the original law. It would use the funds to pay \nfor other programs in this year's appropriations bill. While it does \npromise to restore in the year 2003 the funds taken away this year, the \ndamage would be done long before 2003 arrives. In fact, more than 80 \nleading organizations have signed a letter urging rejection of this \nmisguided policy.\n  Low-income working families should not be forced to pay the price for \nthe budget pressures facing congress. Those pressures were created by \nthe budget resolution, and its misguided priorities. The committee was \noperating under the budget instructions they were given. I believe they \nhad good intentions. Unfortunately, however, this rescission robs needy \nchildren, and it is unacceptable.\n  Strong bipartisan support in the Senate created the Children's Health \nInsurance Program in 1997. We focused on guaranteeing health insurance \nto children in working families whose income was too high to be \neligible for Medicaid, but too low to be able to afford private \ninsurance. Estimates indicate that more than three-quarters of all \nuninsured children in the nation will be eligible for assistance \nthrough either CHIP or Medicaid in the near future.\n  This rescission would have established a devastating precedent at \nprecisely the wrong time. The Children's Health Insurance Program is \nworking. Every State is now participating.\n  Between 1998 and 1999, enrollment numbers doubled from just under 1 \nmillion children to 2 million. States, advocacy groups and other \nleaders are undertaking and planning impressive outreach efforts in the \nstates. Last year, back-to-school campaigns helped dramatically \nincrease enrollment. A month ago, the Governor of Mississippi announced \na new campaign to cover all children in that State. We have every \nreason to expect that this trend will continue, as the programs become \nmore established and States begin to do all they can to enroll eligible \nchildren.\n  If the rescission were enacted, it would penalize needy children in \nthe States that have most actively sought and enrolled eligible \nchildren. States could be forced to halt enrollment until more funds \nare available. That's wrong.\n  The reallocation mechanism in the original legislation is designed to \nensure that dollars remain targeted to uninsured children, regardless \nof location. Next year is the first year that the reallocation fund \nwould be available. Senators should know that no State loses under \ncurrent law. All States have the right to their allocations for three \nyears. We have encouraged all States to take advantage of their funds. \nBut, it a State cannot spend all its money, the excess dollars should \nbe used by States that can.\n  If the Senate were to adopt this rescission, States would \nbe reluctant to expand their programs or actively enroll more children \nif they feel that future State allotments are unreliable. The National \nGovernors Association has sent us two letters--one just last week--\nexpressing their unified strong opposition for this reason.\n\n  We shouldn't second guess the original policy. It was well designed \nto direct money where it is most clearly needed. The policy was \nstrongly supported when we enacted CHIP, and States have acted in good \nfaith to implement it. It would be wrong for us to change the ground \nrules now, when so much progress is being made.\n  We know that lack of insurance is the seventh leading--and most \npreventable--cause of death in America today. That fact is a national \nscandal.\n  The majority of uninsured children with asthma--and one in three \nuninsured children with recurring ear infections--never see a doctor \nduring the year. That's wrong. No child should have to be hospitalized \nfor an acute asthma attack that could have been avoided. We know that \nuninsured children are 25 percent more likely to miss school. Children \nwho cannot see the blackboard well or hear their teacher clearly miss \nlessons even when they are at school. That's wrong. No child should \nsuffer permanent hearing loss and developmental or educational delays \nbecause of an untreated infection.\n  Every child deserves a healthy start in life, and the health security \nthat comes with insurance. And under CHIP and Medicaid, every child \nwill have a legitimate opportunity for health insurance.\n  Congress should do everything in its power to shore-up these \nprograms, not undermine them. I welcome today's agreement, and I look \nforward to the continuing effective implementation of this worthwhile \nprogram to guarantee good health care for all children.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter to which I \nearlier referred and another related correspondence.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 9, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our opposition to \n     the taking of $1.9 billion of fiscal year 1998 Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funds by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee to help fund the fiscal year 2001 \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations bill. In effect, the Senate committee action \n     takes unspent funds that would be reallocated to states to \n     provide health insurance to uninsured children and instead \n     promises to restore those funds in fiscal year 2003. While we \n     are appreciative of the efforts of the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee efforts to increase funding for important programs \n     in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations bill, the use of CHIP funds for this purpose \n     breaches the integrity of the CHIP program and the commitment \n     it represents to the nation's uninsured children.\n       This taking of CHIP funds is troubling for several reasons. \n     First, the taking of these funds will deprive some states of \n     the funding needed soon to insure children through the \n     program. Second, states have made decisions on how many \n     children they expect to insure through the CHIP program based \n     on the federal funding commitment in the 1997 CHIP \n     legislation. The Senate Appropriations Committee action, if \n     enacted, calls into question the commitment of Congress to \n     this program. Third, states are rapidly increasing enrollment \n     of uninsured children in CHIP but may become reluctant to \n     continue aggressive outreach and enrollment if Congress \n     starts playing budget shell games with the program funds.\n       We urge, in the strongest possible terms, that Congress \n     restore the funds to the CHIP program that were removed by \n     the Senate Appropriations Committee. We believe that Congress \n     should refrain from looking to this program, designed to \n     serve uninsured children, to alleviate the fiscal \n     difficulties faced by the House and Senate Appropriations as \n     they fund critical programs.\n           Sincerely,\n       AIDS Action.\n       Alliance for Children and Families.\n       Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Association of University Affiliated Programs for \n     Persons with Developmental Disabilities.\n       American Association on Mental Retardation.\n       American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians.\n       American Dental Hygienists' Association.\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME).\n       American Friends Service Committee.\n       American Hospital Association.\n       American Medical Association.\n       American Music Therapy Association.\n       American Network of Community Options and Resources.\n       American Occupational Therapy Association.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \n     (ACORN)\n       Association of Jewish Family and Children's Agencies.\n       Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs.\n       Bazelon Center of Mental Health Law.\n       Camp Fire Boys and Girls.\n       Catholic Charities USA.\n       Catholic Health Association of the United States.\n       Center for Budget and Policy Priorities\n       Center for Community Change.\n       Center for Women Policy Studies.\n       Child Welfare League of America.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       Children's Health Fund.\n       Church Women United--Washington Office.\n       Coalition of Labor Union Women.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n       Communications Workers of America.\n       Council of State Governments.\n       Families USA.\n       Family Voices.\n       Friends Committee on National Legislation (Quaker).\n       Generations United.\n       Girl Scouts of the USA\n       Jewish Council for Public Affairs.\n       Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, ELCA.\n       Lutheran Services in America.\n       McAuley Institute.\n       Mennonite Central Committee.\n       National Association for Protection & Advocacy Systems.\n       National Association for the Education of Young Children.\n       National Association of Community Health Centers.\n       National Association of Developmental Disabilities \n     Councils.\n       National Association of People with AIDS.\n       National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems.\n       National Association of Public Hospitals & Health Systems.\n       National Association of School Psychologists.\n       National Association of WIC Directors.\n       National Center of Poverty Law.\n       National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA.\n       National Council of Jewish Women.\n       National Council of La Raza.\n       National Council of Senior Citizens.\n       National Employment Law Project.\n       National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.\n       National Head Start Association.\n       National Health Law Program, Inc.\n       National Immigration Law Center.\n       National Mental Health Association.\n       National Parent Network on Disabilities.\n       National Partnership for Women and Families.\n       National Puerto Rican Coalition.\n       National Therapeutic Recreation Society.\n       National Urban League.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       Neighbor to Neighbor.\n       Network--A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n       Presbyterian Church (USA), Washington Office.\n       Results, Inc.\n       The ARC of the United States.\n       The Episcopal Church.\n       The Salvation Army.\n       The United States Conference of Mayors.\n       Union of American Hebrew Congregations.\n       Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations.\n       United Cerebral Palsy.\n       United Church of Christ Office for Church in Society.\n       United Jewish Communities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd: As you consider the \n     fiscal 2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     appropriations bill, we are writing to emphasize our highest \n     funding priorities. The nation's Governors urge you to meet \n     your commitments to the most critical programs affecting \n     human investments and needs.\n       Specifically, we strongly urge you to meet the commitment \n     to the Title XX/Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and \n     restore the reductions in funding and flexibility for the \n     program to the level that was agreed to in the 1996 welfare \n     reform law. Under the 1996 welfare reform law, SSBG was \n     authorized at $2.38 billion for fiscal 2001 and states were \n     provided the flexibility to transfer up to 10 percent of \n     their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block \n     grant funds into SSBG. Since that time, funding has \n     consistently been cut and flexibility has been restricted. \n     Governors view SSBG as one of the highest priorities among \n     human service programs, and are adamantly opposed to further \n     reductions in funding, such as those approved by the Senate \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee. \n     Such a drastic reduction in the federal commitment to SSBG \n     will cause a dramatic disruption in the delivery of the most \n     critical human services.\n       Additionally, the Governors strongly urge you to reject \n     proposals that would rescind funding from the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). The funding \n     structure of S-CHIP provides long-term stability to the \n     program. Rescinding funds from S-CHIP, as proposed by the \n     subcommittee, will undermine states' continued progress in \n     providing access to much needed health insurance coverage. We \n     urge you to protect this critical program for our nation's \n     children.\n       The nation's Governors also urge you to maintain your \n     commitments to other key state and local programs that \n     provide vital health and human services to vulnerable \n     families and children including Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid. Reductions in the federal \n     commitment to these programs would adversely affect millions \n     of Americans, with the greatest impact on those in the \n     greatest need.\n       Additionally, the Governors urge strong support for \n     education programs. Education is the most important issue \n     facing our states and the nation. Governors oppose any \n     reductions in these critical programs. Governors also ask \n     Congress to meet its commitment to fully fund the federal \n     portion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA).\n       Finally, we urge you to reverse the delays in funding for \n     key state health and human services programs that were \n     enacted as part of the fiscal 2000 omnibus appropriations \n     package last fall. With enactment of that bill, a portion of \n     the funding made available to states for several programs, \n     including SSBG, Children and Families Services, and the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services program, will not \n     be made available until September 29, 2000. The nation's \n     Governors are deeply concerned about the effect this delay \n     will have on the delivery of services to the nation's \n     neediest populations.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views and look \n     forward to working with you as you seek to meet the many \n     needs within the subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Governor Mike Huckabee,\n                              Chairman, Human Resources Committee.\n                                           Governor James B. Hunt,\n                         Vice Chairman, Human Resources Committee.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the colloquy that \njust occurred in which Senator Stevens promised to return the $1.9 \nbillion taken from the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-\nCHIP, to fund the programs in the Labor Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations bill, during conference. I thank Senators \nRoth, Stevens, Moynihan and Byrd for recognizing the importance of S-\nCHIP and the federal promise to the states.\n  I applaud this agreement. This program allows states, like Indiana, \nto continue to enroll and provide services to children in low-income \nfamilies. In Indiana, over 120,000 additional children have been \nenrolled in ``Hoosier Healthwise'' since S-CHIP was implemented in \n1998. The removal of this funding would have had a devastating impact \non Indiana. For every $1 million in federal funding taken from Indiana, \n830 children would not be covered by Hoosier Healthwise. These children \nwould be unlikely to obtain quality health care.\n  This is not an issue that only affects Indiana. Thirty-five Senators \nfrom both political parties joined with me and Senator Voinovich to \nsend a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle urging them to work to \nrestore the $1.9 billion taken from the program. The National \nGovernors' Association stated in a letter to the leadership that ``The \nGovernors are united in their opposition to the proposed cuts in S-\nCHIP. This is not a formula fight; this is a weakening of the state-\nfederal partnership that is so vital to the success of this program. It \nsets a truly disturbing precedent.'' We are grateful to Senators Lott \nand Daschle for recognizing the need for this funding to be restored.\n  The Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill \ncontains worthy programs but funding for those programs should not have \ncome from important efforts such as the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I am pleased that this issue will be resolved in the \nconference.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that letters from Senators, \nGovernors, and 80 advocacy groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Senator Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: It has been brought to our attention \n     that the Senate Appropriations Committee has decided to \n     redirect $1.9 billion from the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) to fund other programs in the \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriation \n     bill. We are concerned that this reduction in funding will \n     threaten SCHIP services in many of our communities in \n     addition to setting a dangerous precedent for the federal \n     government's commitment to this critical state program, and \n     we urge you to reconsider this decision.\n       The States have pursued aggressive enrollment efforts and \n     successfully increased the number of children they serve. \n     Failing to maintain this promise would make it impossible for \n     states to continue aggressive enrollment strategies designed \n     to insure millions of uninsured children. Governors are \n     relying on all of the funding in this program to continue \n     SCHIP services. All states' SCHIP programs could be at risk \n     if the federal government sets this dangerous precedent by \n     failing to uphold its funding commitment to the program. If \n     the federal commitment is not upheld, it is likely fewer \n     children will be covered by the program.\n       Therefore, we urge you to work to restore the SCHIP dollars \n     being used to fund other\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\n     programs in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education Appropriation bill. While many of the programs \n     contained within the bill are worthy, they should not be \n     funded at the expense of SCHIP. We look forward to working \n     with you to address this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Evan Bayh; Lincoln D. Chafee; Carl Levin; George V. \n           Voinovich; Richard H.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader and Senator Daschle: I am writing to make \n     clear the strong opposition of the nation's Governors to cuts \n     in funding for key state health and human services programs \n     as contained in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education appropriations bill for fiscal 2001. By proposing \n     cuts in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-\n     CHIP), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) and Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Congress is breaking \n     commitments made to the states, and the nation's Governors \n     urge you to restore funds to these vital programs.\n       The Governors' are united in their opposition to the \n     proposed cuts in S-CHIP. This is not a formula fight; this is \n     a weakening of the state-federal partnership that is so vital \n     to the success of this program. It sets a truly disturbing \n     precedent. It is already causing some states to reevaluate \n     the speed of their efforts to expand their programs to reach \n     more children.\n       The proposed cuts in S-CHIP, SSBG and TANF will cause a \n     disruption in crucial services to the most vulnerable \n     citizens throughout the country--from assistance for \n     individuals moving from welfare to work, to health care for \n     uninsured children, to protective services for children and \n     the elderly. In all three of these programs, Congress has \n     made a commitment to Governors that they can rely on \n     guaranteed, mandatory federal funding. In order to continue \n     with the positive progress made in recent years in moving \n     individuals from welfare to work, increasing the number of \n     children placed in adoptive homes from foster care, and \n     insuring more children in need, Governors must be able to \n     rely on their federal partners.\n       The nation's Governors strongly urge you to reject these \n     cuts and uphold the historic state-federal partnership for \n     serving individuals in need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O.

Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bayh: During the last several weeks, a great \n     deal of national attention has been focused on Indiana's \n     Hoosier Healthwise program, our statewide initiative that has \n     received funding from the State's Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (SCHIP) since 1998. I was delighted when Kathy \n     Gifford, the State's Medicaid Director, testified last \n     Tuesday before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human \n     Resources on Indiana's success in insuring low-income \n     children--some 120,000 new enrollees since July 1998.\n       In her testimony, Ms. Gifford also raised two issues of \n     serious concern to me and of great importance to Indiana's \n     children. First, she described how Indiana faces a decrease \n     in its fiscal year (FY) 2000 SCHIP allotment that will impede \n     the State's ability to continue insuring low-income children. \n     She also voiced concern that the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee voted last week to redirect funds from the SCHIP \n     account to fund other programs in the Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriations Bill for FY 2001.\n       From its inception, the SCHIP program has put Indiana at a \n     funding disadvantage. State allocations are based on \n     unreliable Current Population Survey (CPS) data that \n     underestimates the number of eligible Hoosier children. My \n     administration is now undertaking its own survey of 10,000 \n     Hoosier families to produce more accurate data on the number \n     uninsured persons in our state.\n       After 18 months of implementation, Indiana's Hoosier \n     Healthwise enrollment already exceeded the CPS-derived \n     estimate for the number of uninsured children below the age \n     of 18 living in families up to 150 percent of the federal \n     poverty level. In January 2000, eligibility was expanded to \n     cover children in families at up to 200 percent of poverty, \n     which will greatly add to the current total enrollment of \n     330,000 young Hoosiers.\n       Indiana's success has placed it among a handful of states \n     that will have spent all of their first-year SCHIP allotment \n     (FY 1998) by the end of this fiscal year (FY 2000). However, \n     due to the faulty allotment calculations, Indiana stands to \n     lose 10 percent of its current SCHIP funding this year. In \n     fact, Indiana is one of just two states that will have spent \n     their entire 1998 program allotments and experience a cut in \n     funds. Most other states that will have fully expended their \n     allotments will receive an increase of at least 12 percent. \n     So long as the data on which the allocations are based \n     remains out of line with the true need for children's health \n     insurance in Indiana, Hoosier Healthwise could continue to \n     lose funding even as we enroll more kids.\n       Indiana has demonstrated its commitment to implement SCHIP, \n     but is losing federal funds. Other states that have not shown \n     the same enrollment success are slated to get increased \n     allotments. This inequity fails to maximize the funds \n     available to provide coverage for America's children. I also \n     note Indiana's commitment of $47 million of its tobacco \n     settlement over two years to Hoosier Healthwise as evidence \n     of our resolve to help children lead heathlier and happier \n     lives. However, any decrease in federal SCHIP funding at this \n     time threatens the great strides we have made to improve the \n     health and lives of the children of our state.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee's decision to \n     ``borrow'' any unspent 1998 SCHIP program dollars to pay for \n     other programs in the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill \n     will make matters worse. These unspent dollars (estimated by \n     the Health Care Financing Administration to be $1.9 billion), \n     would otherwise be required under the SCHIP law to be \n     redistributed to states, like Indiana, that had fully \n     expended their entire FY 1998 SCHIP allocations. The effort \n     to redirect money away from our nation's children now, to pay \n     it back in 2003, after the current SCHIP program expires the \n     previous year, defies common sense. SCHIP is not a \n     permanently authorized program; if Congress cuts these funds, \n     health coverage for thousands of children in Indiana and \n     millions across the country may be jeopardized.\n       I implore you to work with other members of the Indiana \n     Congressional Delegation to protect Indiana's health care \n     gains and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. With \n     your help, we are hoping to at least avoid any reduction of \n     federal SCHIP support below the FY 1999 level of $70.2 \n     million.\n       Thank you for any consideration you may give to our request \n     for assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Frank O'Bannon.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as our distinguished colleague from \nDelaware has so eloquently said, the cuts which\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nthis Labor/HHS appropriations bill imposes upon several of our most \nimportant social programs are simply unacceptable.\n  In 1996, I stood with Chairman Roth as the Senate Finance Committee \njoined the House Ways and Means Committee in authorizing the social \nservices block grant at $2.38 billion through 2003. This authorization \nwas a part of our commitment to the states in the welfare reform laws.\n  The social service block grant allocates important funds to our \nstates, enabling them to provide valuable services to our most needy \ncitizens.\n  Because of this block grant, senior citizens receive Meals on Wheels. \nNeglected children receive foster care and adoption services. Working \nparents receive day care for their children and adult day care for \ntheir aging parents. Those being abused receive protective help.\n  These services have become an integral part of our communities, \nexpanding and enriching the lives of our young and old, our poor and \nvulnerable.\n  If the social services block grant is cut to the draconian level \nappropriated by this bill . . . well, the future of these vital \nservices is in grave danger.\n  We have already reneged once on this commitment--in 1998, when in an \n11th hour budgetary slight-of-hand, we used title XX funds to finance \nour road and highway spending.\n  We revisited this topic again last year when, despite a vote of 59-37 \nin favor of restoring title XX to its authorized level of $2.38 \nbillion, the social services block grant was again the victim of an \nend-game mugging, leaving only $1.7 billion of available funds.\n  The $1.1 billion cut to SSBG in the Senate Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education bill would have forced our states to operate \nwith a budget that has been cut by 65%.\n  We return to the Floor time and time again on this issue because \nCongress continues to break the commitments it has made to our states.\n  We slash these important programs under the guise of fiscal prudence \nand we perpetuate the illusion that we are not ``breaking the budget \ncaps.''\n  But, what we are really doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  And, that means that we are not only breaking our promise to the \nstates, we are reneging on the commitment that we made to our most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  It is imperative that these monies be restored, and that the funding \nof the social services block grant be restored to the authorized level \nof $1.7 billion.\n  I, along with Senators Grassley, Jeffords, Rockefeller, Voinovich, \nMoynihan, Wellstone, and Kennedy, was prepared to offer an amendment to \nrestore funding to the social services block grant.\n  I am pleased that the Senator from Alaska has alleviated that need.\n  I appreciate the leadership Senator Stevens is showing today by \npledging to restore these funds to our important SSBG, S-CHIP and TANF \nprograms.\n  I hope that this act represents the end of the long string of broken \npromises that we have made to states, localities, and most of all, our \ncitizens in need.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to \nexpress my extreme pleasure with the agreement reached by the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, restoring funding for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  I am delighted that an agreement has been reached by the two chairmen \non restoring funding--not only for the CHIP program--but also for the \nSocial Services Block Grant program.\n  These two important programs affect the lives of millions of \nAmericans daily and are critically important in my home state of Utah.\n  As the original sponsor of the child health program, I was \nparticularly concerned about the committee provision and--not only its \npotential impact on children already enrolled in CHIP--but especially \non those children who are eligible but not yet enrolled.\n  This is why I wanted to come to the floor and personally thank the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee for agreeing to \nrestore the $1.9 billion in federal spending for CHIP as well as the \n$1.1 billion reduction in the Social Services Block Grant.\n  Moreover, I understand that the Chairman has also agreed to restore \n$240 million in funding for the Temporary Aid for Needy Families \nprogram. This is also an important improvement to the committee bill.\n  I want to commend Senator Stevens for working with us on the Finance \nCommittee in resolving this very difficult funding issue.\n  Moreover, I want to commend our chairman, Senator Roth, for his \nsteadfast leadership in leading the charge at preserving the underlying \nfunding for these critically important programs.\n  I can appreciate the difficult work that the Chairman and all the \nMembers on the Appropriations Committee have faced in crafting a bill \nthat addresses the needs of the American people while complying with \nthe fiscal constraints necessary to balance the federal budget.\n  It is not an easy task recognizing the numerous demands placed on the \ncommittee by many worthy programs and causes.\n\n  As one of the original sponsors of the CHIP legislation, I am \nparticularly concerned about any mid-course changes to this important \nprogram that could undermine our ability to enroll eligible children.\n  In my state of Utah, nearly 18,000 kids have benefitted from CHIP.\n  Had the committee provision been enacted, the Utah CHIP program would \nhave seen a $1.7 million reduction in its fiscal year 1998 allocation.\n  And, as we now know, one of the critical problems facing the program \nhas been the outreach effort to enroll eligible children.\n  Clearly, we do not want to undermine the success we have had to date \nin which there are now more than two million children enrolled \nnationwide.\n  As with any new initiative, it takes time to get these programs up \nand running. This is especially true in view of the fact that CHIP is \nadministered at the state level and, therefore, it takes more time to \nget these programs fully operational.\n  I have heard from many constituents who are concerned about these \nproposed funding cuts.\n  They point out to me that there is a substantial lead time required \nto establish the outreach necessary to sign up new enrollees. That work \nis underway.\n  I am very proud of the job Utah is doing under the leadership of our \nGovernor Mike Leavitt and with the help of many, many community \norganizations doing such excellent work in the field--but we are not \nthere yet.\n  That is why the proposed cuts could have been so harmful.\n  Mr. President, the CHIP program has been a resounding success across \nthe country with all fifty states providing some form of CHIP services \nto eligible children.\n  It has truly been remarkable the level of support we have seen from \nmany groups across the country opposed to the proposed CHIP funding \nreductions.\n  Not only has there been strong, bipartisan support in the Senate \nagainst the reductions, but we also have heard from the National \nGovernors Association and scores of other advocacy organizations \nincluding the American Hospital Association, the Children's Defense \nFund, and the Girl Scouts of the USA expressing strong opposition to \nany reductions in CHIP funding.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Roth for this \nagreement as it sends a clear signal that CHIP is, indeed, fulfilling \nits mission to America's youth.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in \nopposition to two key provisions which should not have been included in \nthis appropriations bill. I commend my colleagues, particularly \nChairman Stevens and Chairman Roth, for reaching an understanding that \nthe funds taken by these provisions will be entirely restored in the \nconference report on the Labor/HHS appropriations bill.\n  The first provision relates to the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP) we created in 1997. Put simply, it will prevent \nuninsured, low-income children from receiving health care services they \nneed and may even jeopardize the future of this critically\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\nimportant children's health program. Enrollment in SCHIP has been \nincreasing--doubling from just under 1 million to 2 million children \nbetween 1998 and 1999. But the SCHIP funding cut included in the Labor-\nHHS bill will undermine this progress and discourage State efforts to \nincrease enrollment. If the precedent is set for using these funds as \noffsets, States could not rely on the future availability of their \nSCHIP allotments.\n  The second provision is a massive unwarranted cut in funds for the \nSocial Services Block Grant, from $1.7 billion to $600 million. SSBG is \na most flexible source of social services funding. The States and local \ncommunities decide, within broad parameters, which needs to address. \nAmong many things, SSBG supports:\n  Help for the home-bound elderly;\n  Assistance for adoptive families;\n  Elder abuse prevention; and\n  Foster care for abused children.\n  In my own State of New York, we use most of our SSBG funds to provide \nchild protective services and for day care. There is no reason to, in \nthe words of the President, ``bankrupt'' SSBG.\n  I recognize that the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee faced very \ndifficult decisions in light of the unreasonably low allocation it \nreceived. These problems were created by the FY 2001 Budget Resolution \nwhich underfunded this and other appropriations measures while \nproviding for a large tax cut. This tax cut, if merited, should not be \npaid for by limiting insurance coverage for low-income children and \nreducing help to the aged and disabled.\n  With the Congressional Budget Office expected to increase its \nestimate of the on-budget surplus, there is no good reason for these \ntwo provisions.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3625\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Cochran and \nSenator Frist, in supporting this important amendment that will provide \n$25 million for CDC's programs on antimicrobial resistance. Deadly \nmicrobes are becoming increasingly resistant to the antibiotics that we \nhave relied on to fight infections for more than half a century. \nAlready, drug-resistant infections claim the lives of 14,000 Americans \nevery year--meaning that every hour of every day, a family suffers the \ntragedy of losing a loved one to an infection that not long ago could \nhave been cured with a pill. At a time when scientists are making \namazing new discoveries in genetic medicine, it is a tragic irony that \nwe are losing our battle against some of humanity's most ancient \ndisease foes.\n  The amendment that we have introduced will strengthen the nation's \ndefenses against disease-causing microbes that are becoming resistant \nto existing medications. The new resources will be used for research \ninto the best ways to control the spread of resistant infections. The \namendment will also fund education programs to make certain that \ndoctors know when to prescribe antibiotics--and when not to. In \naddition, the extra funds provided by the amendment will help hospitals \nand clinics establish disease control programs to halt the spread of \nresistant infections in patients. Finally, new resources will \nstrengthen the nation's public health agencies, which are the front \nline in the fight against disease. By fortifying these defenses, we can \nprovide the country with increased protection against disease outbreaks \nof all types, including deliberate bioterrorist attack. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3625. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the \nSenator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from New York (Mr. \nMoynihan) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Well?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Chair call for order in the Well?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators in the Well will please remove \ntheir conversations from the Well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't believe all the Senators heard the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will all Senators in the Well please remove \ntheir conversations. Senators desiring to speak should clear the Well.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3628 To Amendment No. 3610\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit funds for the purchase of fetal tissue)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree \namendment to the pending amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3628 to amendment No. 3610.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . PURCHASE OF FETAL TISSUE.\n\n       ``None of the funds made available in this Act may be used \n     to pay, reimburse, or otherwise compensate, directly or \n     indirectly, any abortion provider, fetal tissue procurement \n     contractor, or tissue resource source, for fetal tissue, or \n     the cost of collecting, transferring, or otherwise processing \n     fetal tissue, if such fetal tissue is obtained from induced \n     abortions.''.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Harkin is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I ask all Senators who \nhave an interest in offering amendments to come to the floor so we can \nproceed to move this bill forward. At the moment, we have three \namendments which are pending, which are up for consideration. We have \nthe amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, \nMr. Smith, and he is prepared to withdraw his amendment in the nature \nof a second-degree amendment to Senator McCain's amendment on a consent \nagreement that his amendment will not be second degreed.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has an interest in \ndebating his amendment only for a few\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nminutes later but having it listed for a vote later today.\n  Senator McCain is prepared to debate his amendment briefly now and \nthen when Senator Leahy is available to debate his amendment at greater \nlength.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be no second-degree amendment to \nthe Smith amendment--the distinguished Senator from Iowa says there \ncannot be an agreement on the pending Smith amendment. Until we clarify \nthat, my suggestion is that we proceed with debate on Senator Smith's \namendment at this time for however long that takes and then proceed to \ndebate Senator McCain's amendment for however long that takes. We will \ntry to get the procedures worked out.\n  In the interim, we will be considering the amendment by Senator Kerry \nfrom Massachusetts. Again, I ask anybody who has an amendment to offer \nto come to the floor as promptly as possible.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and Senator Specter were here \nyesterday. There was relatively no business conducted because there \nwere no amendments offered. It is now Tuesday, and we are going to get \ntremendous pressure from the two leaders to move this bill along.\n  Tomorrow will be Wednesday. On Thursday, people will be talking about \nleaving here. I think everyone should be put on notice that there may \nnot be an opportunity to offer all these amendments that people want to \noffer on this very important piece of legislation unless they start \ncoming down today. We need people to offer amendments on this \nlegislation.\n  Is that fair to say, I ask the Chairman?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. In the \nabsence of a vote on Monday, it was hard to find business; we could not \nfind it yesterday. We have had a vote. Senators are in town and on \ncampus. When the Senator from Nevada talks about finishing the bill \nthis week, the majority leader told me last week that this bill would \nbe finished, if we had to work through Saturday. That is specifically \nwhat Senator Lott said. That is when he anticipated starting the bill \nabout Wednesday of this week.\n  The majority leader would like to finish this bill no later than \ntomorrow so that he could start on other business, perhaps the Interior \nbill on Thursday. So I say that what the Senator from Nevada has \nannounced is exactly right, that if Senators want their amendments to \nbe considered, now is the time.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to the Senator, the two managers of the bill are \ngoing to try to have a time for setting forth what amendments people \nwant to offer--not that it would be a filing deadline--so we have a \nfinite list of amendments we can look at. We hope the two managers can \nagree on some time later that we can do that.\n  I also ask permission--Senator Hollings has been here all morning. He \nhas 7 minutes he wishes to use as in morning business. I hope, after \nSenator Smith speaks and Senator McCain speaks, that Senator Hollings \nmay be recognized to introduce a bill for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield, on the first point, we have \nsought to get a list of amendments. We will hopefully seek a unanimous \nconsent agreement by the end of the day as to the amendments which are \ngoing to be offered. And we will accommodate the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, although I have never heard Senator Hollings speak \nfor as little as 7 minutes. I am looking forward to that speech myself.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we proceed now with Senator Smith, Senator \nMcCain, and then Senator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3628\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment I have \noffered is a very simple one. It says that none of the funds made \navailable in this act may be used to pay--either directly or \nindirectly--reimburse, or otherwise compensate any abortion provider, \nfetal tissue procurement contractor, or tissue resource source for \nfetal tissue or the cost of collecting, transferring, or otherwise \nprocessing fetal tissue if that tissue is obtained from induced \nabortions.\n  So this amendment is not going to shut down any research using fetal \ntissue. Some will say that, but that is not the case. It will not do \nthat.\n  I believe it is morally wrong to take the life of an innocent child, \nan unborn child, in order to advance the health needs of another human \nbeing because that child has given no consent for that. So, to be \nperfectly honest, it would be fine with me if fetal tissue research, \nusing elective abortions, were abolished, but that is not what this \namendment is about.\n  I am absolutely in favor of using fetal tissue obtained from \nspontaneous abortions or miscarriages. There is a difference between a \nmiscarriage and an induced abortion. The difference is that one \ninnocent human life was not deliberately destroyed for the sake of \nanother. In fact, Georgetown Hospital currently conducts research using \nonly spontaneous abortions--very successfully I might add.\n  So this is a reasonable amendment. I am hoping I will be able to work \nwith the other side on this issue to come to some conclusion so it will \nnot be a huge controversy on this bill. We have been working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania on that.\n  But I want to make it clear I am not prohibiting the use of aborted \nfetuses for research. I am only advocating that Federal taxpayer funds \nshould not be used to pay an abortion clinic or middleman who acts as a \nfetal tissue procurement contractor for such tissue.\n  Let me repeat this important point. My amendment allows the Federal \nGovernment to use fetal tissue from induced abortions, but they cannot \npay an abortion provider or a middleman for that tissue, which includes \nhis costs associated with preservation, storage, processing, and so on, \nbecause, according to the NIH, there does not seem to be a necessity \nfor a middleman.\n  So the amendment I am offering is really quite simple: No purchasing \nof fetal tissue from induced abortions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3610\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have pending, following \nthe disposition of the Smith amendment, requires that the schools and \nlibraries that are taking advantage of universal service subsidies for \nInternet connection deploy blocking or filtering software to screen out \nobscene material and child pornography for children and child \npornography on all computers. The decisions would be made by the local \nschool boards and library boards.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, has asked to speak on this issue \nand requests that we begin that sometime around noon.\n  So if it is agreeable to the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Iowa, perhaps we could have an hour equally divided \nbetween myself and Senator Leahy. I think that would be--actually, we \nwill ask Senator Leahy's staff if that is agreeable to him and then ask \nfor a UC on that.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond, Senator Harkin didn't get the \ninformation, I was just told. Senator Leahy has notified us he may want \nto second degree the McCain amendment, so we cannot agree to a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is fine. So I will not ask for a unanimous consent \nagreement on time, but the way I understand it, we now have a Smith \namendment to be disposed of first.\n  I want to make it clear that I do not wish to impede the progress of \nthis bill. I paid attention to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I am \nvery much in favor of a reasonable time agreement on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am confident that when Senator Leahy can devote his full \nattention to the matter, something can be worked out. He is ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, and I believe they are in executive \nsession, or if not executive session, something very important, and he \nhad to leave the floor. He said he will be able to be back here in \napproximately an hour to work on this. So we will protect him until \nthen and see what happens when he arrives.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see my dear friend from South Carolina \nwaiting to illuminate all of us, so I will yield the floor at this time \nand pursue debate on this amendment at such time as Senator Leahy is \navailable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Arizona could not \nask for the yeas and nays because his amendment is not pending. Is that \ntrue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is pending with an \namendment pending also in the second degree. Therefore, he can ask for \nthe yeas and nays only by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Chair's help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  (The remarks of Mr. HOLLINGS pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2793 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Wyden is on his way to offer an \namendment. We are renewing our call for Members who have amendments to \noffer to come to the floor. We have an extensive list of proposed \namendments. Again, I emphasize the urgency of this request at this \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have two amendments here that are ready to \nbe offered. Will the manager tell me why I can't offer these at this \ntime?\n  Mr. SPECTER. By all means, we look forward to them being offered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3629\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning needlestick \n                           injury prevention)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3629.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n       sense of the senate on prevention of needlestick injuries\n\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     that American health care workers report 600,000-800,000 \n     needlestick and sharps injuries each year;\n       (2) the occurrence of needlestick injuries is believed to \n     be widely under-reported;\n       (3) needlestick and sharps injuries result in at least \n     1,000 new cases of health care workers with HIV, hepatitis C \n     or hepatitis B every year; and\n       (4) more than 80 percent of needlestick injuries can be \n     prevented through the use of safer devices.\n       (5) OSHA's November 1999 Compliance Directive has helped \n     clarify the duty of employers to use safer needle devices to \n     protect their workers. However, millions of State and local \n     government employees are not covered by OSHA's bloodborne \n     pathogen standard and are not protected against the hazards \n     of needlesticks.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should pass legislation that would eliminate \n     or minimize the significant risk of needlestick injury to \n     health care workers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3630\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the establishment of a clearinghouse on safe \n                           needle technology)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3630.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In General.--There is appropriated $10,000,000 \n     that may be used by the Director of the National Institute \n     for Occupational Safety and Health to--\n       (1) establish and maintain a national database on existing \n     needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections;\n       (2) develop a set of evaluation criteria for use by \n     employers, employees, and other persons when they are \n     evaluating and selecting needleless systems and sharps with \n     engineered sharps injury protections;\n       (3) develop a model training curriculum to train employers, \n     employees, and other persons on the process of evaluating \n     needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury \n     protections and to the extent feasible to provide technical \n     assistance to persons who request such assistance; and\n       (4) establish a national system to collect comprehensive \n     data on needlestick injuries to health care workers, \n     including data on mechanisms to analyze and evaluate \n     prevention interventions in relation to needlestick injury \n     occurrence.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Employer.--The term ``employer'' means each employer \n     having an employee with occupational exposure to human blood \n     or other material potentially containing bloodborne \n     pathogens.\n       (2) Engineered sharps injury protections.--The term \n     ``engineered sharps injury protections'' means--\n       (A) a physical attribute built into a needle device used \n     for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or \n     administering medications or other fluids, that effectively \n     reduces the risk of an exposure incident by a mechanism such \n     as barrier creation, blunting, encapsulation, withdrawal, \n     retraction, destruction, or other effective mechanisms; or\n       (B) a physical attribute built into any other type of \n     needle device, or into a nonneedle sharp, which effectively \n     reduces the risk of an exposure incident.\n       (3) Needleless system.--The term ``needleless system'' \n     means a device that does not use needles for--\n       (A) the withdrawal of body fluids after initial venous or \n     arterial access is established;\n       (B) the administration of medication or fluids; and\n       (C) any other procedure involving the potential for an \n     exposure incident.\n       (4) Sharp.--The term ``sharp'' means any object used or \n     encountered in a health care setting that can be reasonably \n     anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the \n     body, and to result in an exposure incident, including, but \n     not limited to, needle devices, scalpels, lancets, broken \n     glass, broken capillary tubes, exposed ends of dental wires \n     and dental knives, drills, and burs.\n       (5) Sharps injury.--The term ``sharps injury'' means any \n     injury caused by a sharp, including cuts, abrasions, or \n     needlesticks.\n       (c) Offset.--Amounts made available under this Act for the \n     travel, consulting, and printing services for the Department \n     of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and \n     the Department of Education shall be reduced on a pro rata \n     basis by $10,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke about these two amendments at some \nlength yesterday. I will abbreviate what I said yesterday. Every year, \n600,000 injuries occur as a result of nurses and other health care \nprofessionals being stuck accidentally by needles. It is not because of \nany negligence on their part. It is because of the dangerousness of \ntheir work.\n  Approximately every 35 seconds, someone--usually a nurse--is stuck \nwith a needle. It is estimated that the number of reported cases is \nunderestimated. It is probably every 15 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days \na week, that these individuals are injured. So we have at least 20 \ndiseases that are transmitted very easily by being stuck with needles.\n  I gave the account yesterday of two nurses. We could have given \nhundreds of thousands of different examples, but we gave two people--\none was a woman from Reno, NV, and the other a woman from \nMassachusetts--whose lives were dramatically altered as a result of \nbeing stuck with needles while being nurses. One of them takes 21 pills \na day; the other takes 22 pills a day. They are very, very ill--HIV and \nhepatitis C.\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n  The purpose of these amendments is to have there be a standard \nestablished so that this, in fact, will not take place in the future. \nThere are already needle-less instruments that can be used, which work \njust as well. The only problem is they are a little bit more expensive, \nand the health care system wants to save every penny, so they don't use \nthem. In the short term and in the long term, money would be saved if, \nin fact, we used these new devices.\n  The lost time from individuals being stuck with these needles is very \nsignificant. People become disabled very quickly. So we need to stop \nthis practice and have the Federal Government join with the private \nsector, in effect, to do away with needles as we now know them.\n  I would be happy to answer any questions Senators may have. This is \nsomething that has been debated in the past. It should become effective \nimmediately.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the first amendment by \nthe Senator from Nevada, a sense of the Senate respecting legislation \nto eliminate or minimize the significant risk of needlestick injury to \nhealth care workers, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nNevada has such legislation which is pending, and it is obviously a \nvery worthwhile objective. It is my view that we ought to move such \nlegislation as promptly as possible. There is a serious problem and, to \nthe extent it can be eliminated or minimized, I am all for it. We would \naccept this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the managers accepting this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. I look forward to working with the Senators on the \nunderlying legislation pending in this regard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3629) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the second amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada to add $10 million to the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health that would come from administrative \ncosts, is what we think a worthwhile objective. We are candid to say \nthat the charges to administration are now very heavy.\n  So it would be my intention to accept this amendment, subject to the \nunderstanding that we are going to have to work out in conference where \nthe funding will come from. After a while, the administrative costs \ndeduction is so overburdened that it becomes intolerable, but subject \nto that limitation, we will be prepared to accept the amendment on this \nside.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, coming back to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Nevada for $10 million to be added to the National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health out of administrative \ncosts, we are prepared to take it at this time. Again, this is subject \nto the understanding that there is quite a bit of money taken out of \nadministrative costs, and this is something we will have to work out in \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 3630 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3630) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3626, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are some other amendments that I have \nin relation to this subject. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment 3626 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3632\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very shortly I will be sending to the desk \nan amendment to deal with an issue of extraordinary importance; that \nis, the question of pharmaceuticals that get to the market to a great \nextent through taxpayer-funded research.\n  From the very beginning of this debate on prescription drugs, I \nteamed up with Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine on this issue. I believe \nthis prescription drug issue is so extraordinarily important that it \nhas to be pursued in a bipartisan fashion.\n  We have seen that there is an enormous interest in this country on \nthe question of prescription drugs, and it has become a heated and \ncontentious debate. In an effort to try to ensure this discussion was \nbipartisan at every level, in developing the amendment I will very \nshortly offer, I consulted at some length with the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, as well as Senator \nHarkin, the ranking minority member.\n  Because he is on the floor, at this time I would especially like to \nthank Chairman Specter and his staff for all the efforts to work with \nus on this matter. Chairman Specter has been very gracious as well as \nhis staff--I see Bettilou Taylor here--in making time to work with us \non an amendment that I believe will be acceptable to both the majority \nand the minority when I send it to the desk.\n  In this discussion of the question of pharmaceuticals that get to \nmarket largely through taxpayer funds, I think it was said very clearly \nby Congressman Bill Thomas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Health, and a member of the Republican leadership: \n``When taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought to be a return on \nthat investment.''\n  I am going to repeat that because I think it says it very well. \nCongressman Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee \nsubcommittee said: ``When taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought \nto be a return on that investment.''\n  I think what is critical at this point is that taxpayers and citizens \nof this country understand just how extensive the Federal investment in \nthese pharmaceuticals is.\n  We all understand that the development of prescription medicine in \nthis country is a risky business. You are going to have some successful \ninvestments. You also are going to have some dry holes. That is the \nnature of the free enterprise system. That is what entrepreneurship is \nall about. It is about risk taking, and it is about focusing on bright, \ncreative ideas in the private marketplace. Particularly in the \npharmaceutical sector, this approach has lead to nothing less than a \nrevolution. So many of the medicines of today are central to keeping \npeople well, and keeping folks healthy. They help to hold down blood \npressure and cholesterol. As a result of those medicines, we end up \nvery often seeing massive savings that would otherwise be incurred by \nwhat is called Part A of the Medicare program--the hospital portion of \nthe program.\n  This exciting revolution in the pharmaceutical sector is one that we \nall appreciate. However, today we want to take special note of the fact \nthat the taxpayers have contributed in a very significant way to that \nrevolution.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, Federal research was \ninstrumental in the development of 15 of the 21 drugs considered to \nhave the highest therapeutic impact on society which were introduced \nbetween 1965 and 1992. Of those 15 pharmaceuticals, 7 have specific \nties to the National Institutes of Health. Of those seven \npharmaceuticals with direct connections to\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nthe National Institutes of Health, three had more than $1 billion in \nsales in 1994, and in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3632:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds made available under this Act may \n     be made available to any entity under the Public Health \n     Service Act after September 1, 2001, unless the Director of \n     NIH has provided to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions a \n     proposal to require a reasonable rate of return on both \n     intramural and extramural research by March 31, 2001.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment is very specific in that it \ndirects the National Institutes of Health to bring to the Senate by \nMarch 31, 2001, a specific proposal for ensuring that research funded \nby the taxpayer be recognized in the development of pharmaceuticals, \nand that the companies that benefit from that research pay reasonable \nrates of return on the investment by the taxpayer.\n  I believe it is fair to all parties--to entrepreneurs, to \nresearchers, to those in the pharmaceutical sector--and to all sides \nbecause it recognizes that this is a difficult issue.\n  There are some technical questions with respect to how this is done. \nIn particular, the nature of the pharmaceutical discovery is one that \nhas to be thought through very carefully. But at the same time \nacceptance of this amendment would bring a sense of urgency to this \nissue.\n  The Congress has a long history on this question. But the fact is \nthat for some years there has not been adequate recognition of the fact \nthat the taxpayer has done much of the heavy lifting in getting these \npharmaceuticals to market. With this amendment we will ensure when the \ntaxpayers play a significant role in a blockbuster drug that ends up \nproducing very significant profits for an individual company that the \ntaxpayers' investment will be recognized.\n\n  I am just going to take a few minutes on this matter and use an \nexample with which I think we are familiar in the Congress but which \nhas special ramifications for folks in my part of the United States, \nand that is the drug Taxol.\n  Before I do, I will ask unanimous consent to make a modest change, \nbut a very important one, that also includes the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3632, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I send the modification to my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3632), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II insert the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be made available to any entity under the Public Health \n     Service Act after September 1, 2001, unless the Director of \n     NIH has provided to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations and on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions a proposal to require a reasonable rate \n     of return on both intramural and extramural research by March \n     31, 2001.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to cite one example of a blockbuster \ndrug that makes the case for why this amendment is so important. That \ndrug is Taxol, a breakthrough drug used to fight cancer in women. It \nwas originally made from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree. The National \nInstitutes of Health developed this drug which last year produced $1.5 \nbillion in sales for the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.\n  Let me repeat that. This was a drug that was developed by the \nNational Institutes of Health. This was not a drug that came about \nthrough the genius of the private sector. It was a drug developed at \nthe National Institutes of Health by dedicated scientists who worked \nhard and were pushing with every ounce of their strength to come up \nwith new products to help women.\n  I want to outline specifically what they did in this case because it \nis a very clear illustration of why this amendment is needed. With \nrespect to Taxol, the National Institutes of Health did the initial \ncollection and re-collection of the bark of the Pacific Yew, which is \nthe material from which the drug came. The National Institutes of \nHealth performed all biological screening in both cell culture and \nanimal tumor systems. The NIH did the chemical purification, isolation, \nand structure identification. The National Institutes of Health did \nlarge-scale production from bark collection through the preparation of \nmaterial for human use. NIH developed and produced suitable intravenous \ndrug formulations. They did the preclinical toxicology, they filed the \nInvestigational New Drug Application, and they sponsored all the \nactivities, including the efforts directed towards total and partial \nsynthesis of the drug.\n  By the end of the fiscal year of 1992, NIH had invested $32 million. \nNIH could not manufacture the drug for commercial purposes, so it \ncompetitively bid to find a company to manufacture the drug. The \nBristol-Myers Squibb Company was able to get exclusive rights to go \nforward with this pharmaceutical in the marketplace.\n  Frankly, at hearings I held in 1993, the company really could not \nspecify what they had done at all, other than the preclinical work and \nresearch into alternatives.\n  So I come back to the fundamental proposition: Why is it that a \npharmaceutical that was developed by the National Institutes of Health \nand resulted in $1.5 billion in sales in 1999 for Bristol-Myers Squibb \nresulted in no return on investment to the American taxpayer? This drug \nproduced an enormous gain for an individual pharmaceutical company, yet \nthe American taxpayer did not share in that gain. We are responsible to \nthe taxpayer to be good financial stewards of their assets--in a sense \nthe taxpayer saw their research walk out the door without adequate \ncompensation for that massive taxpayer investment.\n  There are other examples of NIH research leading to block buster \ndrugs.\n  One of those drugs found using NIH research and with more than $1 \nbillion in sales is Prozac. The basic research in the development of \nProzac was performed in the 1950s and 1960s by external researchers \nfunded by NIH and researchers in NIH labs. Eli Lilly and Company \ndeveloped Prozac based on this research.\n  In 1998, Prozac was third on the list of the top 200 brand-name \nprescription drugs in terms of units sold. Other drugs that relied on \npublicly-funded research were also on that list including Imitrex, \nMevacor, and Zovirax.\n  Cisplatin is an anti-cancer drug discovered by a biophysicist at \nMichigan State University. National Cancer Institute scientists \ncompleted the pharmacology, toxicology, formulation, production and \nclinical trials. Michigan State University then licensed its patent to \nBristol-Myers Squibb and the drug is used today to treat several types \nof cancer.\n  All of my colleagues have met with constituents suffering from \ndiseases that we are so close to finding cures for. Diabetes and \nParkinson's are just two areas that come to mind.\n  In this day of biomedical breakthroughs, it is important that the \ntaxpayer not only see results of the research, but share in the gain \nthat the multi-national drug companies also receive.\n  I have come to the floor, I think, now on more than 30 occasions to \nfocus on the need for bipartisanship on this issue. Senator Daschle, in \nmy view, has done yeoman's work, trying to bring people together. I \nhope we can, as we are seeking to do in this amendment, address these \nissues in a bipartisan fashion and particularly look to those areas \nwith respect to prescription medicine that are going to be key for the \nfuture.\n  We know that absolutely vital to the health of this country is the \nresearch done at the National Institutes of Health. We have had many \nsupporters in this body who have championed the cause of additional \nfunding for NIH. I am especially appreciative of the work done by \nSenator Mack, for example, Senator Harkin, and Senator Specter. They \nhave been a bipartisan juggernaut, working for additional funding for \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health.\n  We also ought to recognize that when blockbuster drugs get to market \nas a result of that taxpayer-funded research, we have responsibilities \nto the taxpayers. We are stewards of their funds. It does not pass the \nsmell test at\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\na townhall meeting to say that if the taxpayers spend vast sums for \nfederally funded research and a company then makes huge profits in the \nprivate sector, the taxpayers get no return on that investment.\n  What we are making clear in this amendment is that Federal research \nshould not be let go cheaply. It is important that taxpayers have a \nright to receive reimbursement when a blockbuster drug gets to market \nlargely with their funds.\n  What this does is ensure, in a timely way, that the National \nInstitutes of Health get to the Senate and the relevant committees a \nspecific proposal to ensure, as Congressman Bill Thomas, chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said recently:\n\n       Where taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought to be a \n     return on that investment.\n\n  That is what this amendment does. Because of the Government's \nincreased role in pharmaceutical development, with so many of the \nbreakthrough drugs, particularly the cancer drugs, coming about because \nthe taxpayer has paid for medically significant research, this \namendment, in my view, addresses one of the important issues in the \nhealth care arena.\n  I want to wrap up by expressing my appreciation to Senator Specter \nand Senator Harkin. If this amendment is adopted, I believe early next \nyear we will have a specific game plan, a roadmap to ensure that \ntaxpayers' interests are protected when they have done the heavy \nlifting in pharmaceutical development while, at the same time, having \nbeen fair to the entrepreneurs and pharmaceutical firms and others that \nwork in this area.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted by the majority and the \nminority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oregon for \nthis amendment. I think it is a good amendment and it puts the finger \non a source of potential funding which would be fair and just. The \nNational Institutes of Health have engaged in extraordinary research \nand have had phenomenal results. To the extent that research has \nresulted in profits to private companies, it is a fair request; it is \nfair to ask that the Federal Government share in those proceeds.\n  During the course of the past several years, our subcommittee has \ntaken the lead on substantially increasing the funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Four years ago, we raised the funding by almost \n$1 billion; 3 years ago, by $2 billion; last year, by $2.2 billion; and \nthis year, $2.7 billion. We seek to bring the total funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health to $20.5 billion.\n  Where we can find that private industry has benefited and made a \nprofit, a fair return ought to be given to the NIH. It is preeminently \nreasonable to have that sort of provision in law, to ask the Director \nof the National Institutes of Health to make that report to the \nappropriate committees.\n  We are also considering the funding in terms of how much is spent for \nadministrative costs. In the subcommittee, we are going to be directing \ninquiries to the recipients of NIH funds as to how much is being \nallocated for overhead and administrative costs. This is an effort to \nincrease the moneys which may be available for research.\n  Phenomenal results have been achieved on a variety of ailments. \nParkinson's is now perhaps as close to 5 years from being solved. There \nhave been significant advances on Alzheimer's and heart disease. I \nprinted the whole list in the Record during my opening statement.\n  I am glad to accept the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. REID. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3632, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3632), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3633\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for Impact Aid basic support payments and \n                         to provide an offset)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself, Mr. \n     Murkowski, and Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3633.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IMPACT AID.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act--\n       (1) the total amount appropriated under this title to carry \n     out title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 shall be $1,108,200,000;\n       (2) the total amount appropriated under this title for \n     basic support payments under section 8003(b) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be \n     $896,200,000; and\n       (3) amounts made available for the administrative and \n     related expenses of the Departments of Labor, Health and \n     Human Services, and Education shall be further reduced on a \n     pro rata basis by $78,200,000.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a subject with \nwhich we are all very familiar. In the early fifties, we put together a \nvery good and effective Federal program to reimburse the States for \nrevenue that was lost because of Federal activities--whether it was a \nmilitary base or Indian reservation--anytime those properties were \ntaken off the tax rolls. Yet that particular type of activity brought \nin additional students. It was set up to reimburse the local school \ndistricts.\n  It is called impact aid. It is one of the oldest Federal education \nprograms dating back to the fifties. The rationale for compensation is \nFederal activity deprives local school districts of the ability to \ncollect sufficient property and sales tax, even though the school \ndistrict is obligated to provide free public education.\n  Since the early eighties, impact aid has not been fully funded \ndespite the obligation of the Federal Government to make local school \ndistricts whole. We introduced some time ago a resolution that would do \nthat very thing. It has the support of quite a number of Members of the \nSenate. In fact, I have a letter signed by a large number of Senators. \nI ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2000.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies \n         Subcommittee.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Ranking Member, Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies \n         Subcommittee.\n       Dear Senators Specter and Harkin: We recognize and \n     appreciate the support you have shown in the past for the \n     Impact Aid program. As you know, this vital funding source \n     for local school districts began experiencing a shortfall in \n     the early 1980's due to budget constraints. As a result, \n     critical needs have been and continue to be unmet.\n       We also recognize that although the budget is in balance \n     and there are now surpluses as opposed to deficits, funds are \n     not unlimited. However, we would remind you that the Impact \n     Aid program is an obligation of the Federal Government to \n     make local school districts whole for federal activities \n     which preclude them from collecting the necessary revenues to \n     adequately fund their schools. Thus, we would like to propose \n     annual increases in Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid program \n     of 12% until it is fully funded in FY 2004. Specifically, we \n     would propose funding the program at 64% in FY 2001, 76% in \n     FY 2002; 88% in FY 2003; and 100% in FY 2004.\n       A 12% increase in Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid program \n     in FY 2001, which constitutes the largest portion of Impact \n     Aid dollars, would not only provide needed dollars to our \n     local school districts, but would send a strong signal that \n     the Federal Government is committed to fully funding this \n     important education program. In some cases, every one dollar \n     of Federal Impact Aid frees up one local dollar to purchase \n     buses, do building maintenance or hire additional staff to \n     lower pupil teacher ratios. However, there\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n     are school districts that do not have the ability to make up \n     the Impact Aid deficit because either they cannot afford it \n     or there are restrictions on the local taxing authority which \n     prevent them from increasing sales or property taxes to \n     compensate for the lack of federal contribution. In these \n     cases, needed infrastructure repairs, replacement of buses \n     and textbooks or additional personnel just do not happen \n     because there is no money. Continued under funding of this \n     program puts a unreasonable and unfair burden on our schools. \n     This inequity must be resolved.\n       We believe a phased-in full funding schedule is not only \n     doable but is fiscally responsible. Thus, we would \n     respectfully ask that you fund Section 8003(b) of the Impact \n     Air program at a minimum of 64%. Listed below, are proposed \n     funding levels for those sections of the Impact Aid program \n     that are of most concern to our states.\n\n                              [In millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    FY 2000    Proposed\n                                                    actual      FY 0000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBasic Support--8003(b)..........................      $737.2      $896.2\nFederal prop--8002..............................        32.0        35.0\nSpecial Ed--8003(d).............................        50.0        53.0\nConstruction--8007..............................        10.1        10.1\nHeavily Impacted--8007(f).......................        72.2        82.0\nFacilities Maint--8008..........................         5.0         5.0\n                                                 -----------------------\n    Totals......................................       906.5    \\1\\ 1.08\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Billion.\n\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely.\n         Jim Inhofe; George V.

Moynihan; Thad \n           Cochran; Susan Collins.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my language would actually fully fund \nimpact aid to all school districts in the country by fiscal year 2004. \nThe effect it would have this year would be approximately $78.2 \nmillion. In discussing this with both the majority and the minority, I \nrealized the offset we are suggesting; that is, to take it out of \nadministrative overhead, is something that has already been done. I \nrecognize that once they get to conference, they are going to have to \nshuffle these things around and see what actually can be done.\n  While I recognize that in the House and Senate bills there is an \nincrease in impact aid, it does not have anything in the future that \nwill reach full funding. I have a list here. Not one of the 50 States \nis 100 percent. Yet these are funds taken from the States due to \nFederal activities.\n  What I would like, perhaps with the understanding and the agreement \nof the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, is to go ahead \nand adopt this amendment which says, in the 4-year period, impact aid \nwill be fully funded; however, there is to be an understanding it has \nto go into conference along with some other requests to see what \nactually can be worked out.\n  I want to have a colloquy with the chairman of the committee so we \ncan have this understanding. The State of Pennsylvania is actually at \n11 percent of being fully funded, which is not nearly as well as \nOklahoma, which is at 37 percent. This is something that is an equity \nissue. It is not a distinction of 50 percent or 60 percent of full \nimpact aid funding or 10 percent. It is an equity issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nOklahoma for offering this amendment because there is no doubt that the \nappropriations for impact aid are very important. As a basic matter of \nfairness to the States, this obligation ought to be undertaken by the \nFederal Government. It is candidly like many obligations the Federal \nGovernment ought to undertake which the Federal Government has not \nundertaken. One of the most notable examples is special education.\n  I have discussed this matter with my colleague from Oklahoma and \nthink it worth putting into the Record the advances which the \nsubcommittee, and now the full committee, have made on this important \nsubject.\n  Last year, the total impact aid was $906.4 million. The request by \nthe administration, according to information provided to me, is only \n$770 million. The House of Representatives in its bill has allocated \n$985 million. So the Senate is some $45 million higher now than is the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I do recognize, as I said privately to the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nimportance of this account and the desirability of increasing the \nfunding.\n  We are prepared to accept the amendment on the understanding, as I \ndiscussed privately with Senator Inhofe and now state publicly for the \nrecord, that the funding comes out of administrative costs, and that is \nan item which has already been hit very hard.\n  A few moments ago, when the Senator from Nevada offered an amendment \nto add $10 million for NIOSH, we accepted the amendment, stating \ncandidly, openly, that we would do our best in conference. That is the \nsame thing I have told the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma: That we \nrecognize the importance, the validity of the purpose, and we will do \nour best, but we are going to have to work out a great many complicated \nmatters. On that state of the record, we are prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. While I support improving impact aid around the country, \nwe are getting to the point where we accepted a $10 million cut in \nadministrative costs, and we accepted some more before that, did we \nnot?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We did.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now we are going to accept $78 million in administrative \ncosts, which we know we can't do?\n  I know I have some people on this side of the aisle who want to come \nover and offer amendments that will cut administrative costs.\n  I just ask my friend, the chairman, are we just going to accept them \nthen? Are we going to accept every amendment that comes over that cuts \nadministrative costs to increase education or whatever it might be? If \nwe are going to do that, then I have no objection to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. But if we are going to pick and choose, \nwell, then, maybe we ought to think about which amendments and how we \nare going to balance these off between maybe amendments on that side \nand amendments on this side.\n  Are we going to have a $100 million cutoff or a $150 million cutoff \non administrative costs and say we will take the first ones out of the \nblock up to that point? Where do we draw the line?\n  We are going to have Senators on this side of the aisle come over \nhere and offer amendments of the same magnitude, and they are going to \ntake it out of administrative costs. I ask, will we just accept them?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond to my distinguished \ncomanager, my view is, we will take a look at each one of them on an \nindividual basis. We will assess the validity of the items, and we will \naccept them if they are valid. I do not know exactly what the cutoff \nfigure is. I discussed candidly with the Senator from Oklahoma the \ndifficulties of looking at $78 million.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is a big item.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is a very big item. The Senator from Oklahoma knows \nwe will do our best.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me reclaim the floor, if I may, and respond to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  For the first 30 years of this program, it was fully funded. I do not \nbelieve the Senator was in the Chamber when I first started talking \nabout it. This is a reimbursement back to the States of money they have \nbeen deprived of as a result of Federal activity. That is a distinction \nbetween this and other programs.\n  For the Senator's State of Iowa, for example, you are getting 20 \npercent of what you would get if it were fully funded. It is an equity \nissue. Certainly, I have the understanding from the chairman--and I \ntalked to the Senator from Nevada--and I recognize that when this gets \ninto conference, there is going to be a problem weaving and sorting. \nBut I cannot imagine any other program that would have a higher \npriority than this, to ultimately say it is our intent to get this \nfully funded back to where it was prior to the 1980s.\n  For that reason, I believe it has merit above some of the other \nprograms that are coming. This is a reimbursement we agreed to back in \nthe 1950s.\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3633, As Modified\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send my amendment back to the desk as \nmodified and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. IMPACT AID.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act--\n       (1) the total amount appropriated under this title to carry \n     out title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 shall be $1,065,000,000;\n       (2) the total amount appropriated under this title for \n     basic support payments under section 8003(b) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be \n     $853,000,000; and\n       (3) amounts made available for the administrative and \n     related expenses of the Departments of Labor, Health and \n     Human Services, and Education shall be further reduced on a \n     pro rata basis by $78,200,000.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, even though I believe we need to have a \nspecific time in the future when Impact Aid is fully funded, I \nrecognize there will have to be some kind of discipline in the number \nof amendments that are coming up to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. \nFor that reason, I have modified the amount down so that in the first \nyear it will be $35 million as opposed to $78.2 million. I believe this \nhas been agreed to on both sides.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, to \nincrease funds for the Impact Aid program. I have been a long time \nsupporter of this vital program.\n  The Impact Aid program helps compensate states, like Utah, which are \nadversely affected by a federal presence. This program allocates funds \nto school districts where there are substantial concentrations of \nchildren whose parents both live and work on federally connected \nproperty and kids who parents either live or work on federally \nconnected property. This is an extremely important program in Utah, \nespecially in the southern part of my state.\n  Some may ask why this program is needed. The answer is simple. When \nthe federal government owns or controls property, that property is lost \nto the tax base of state and local governments. The Impact Aid program \nwas established for the purpose of compensating school districts for \nthe tax revenue they lose given a federal presence.\n  I note with dismay and frustration that the Clinton Administration \nroutinely eliminates portions of the Impact Aid program in its annual \nbudget recommendations. Fortunately, however, this important program \nhas been maintained and consistently funded. For that, I want to \nrecognize the assistance of Senator Specter, Senator Stevens, and the \nother members of the Appropriations Committee. Congress has kept this \nprogram viable.\n  Impact Aid is a vital program for Utah for many reasons. Utah needs \nevery dollar it can get for our schools. Utah is a ``worst case \nscenario'' when it comes to the issue of school finance. We have the \nlargest percentage of school age population in the country and the \nlowest percentage of working age adults. Because of this we have the \nlowest per-pupil expenditure in the country, despite the fact that our \nstate allocates an extraordinary percentage of its tax revenue to \neducation. Moreover, the adverse impact of a low per-pupil expenditure \nis felt over and over again because per pupil expenditure has become a \nfactor in the funding formulas for a number of federal education \nprograms.\n  To make matters worse, about 70 percent of Utah's land is federally \nconnected. We have military bases, parks, forests, wilderness, BLM \nland, reservations, and, of course, a relatively new 1.7 million acre \nnational monument.\n  If the Federal Government is going to own or control this much land \nin Utah, we need a fully funded Impact Aid program to offset the tax \nrevenue losses to our schools. The federal government cannot improve \neducation if they give with one hand and take away with the other. That \nis what the Clinton administration seems to be doing--advocating \neducation funds only for those initiatives it has proposed, but \nfinancially starving federal education programs that send money \ndirectly to Utah school districts.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the Impact Aid \nprogram. I urge senators to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3633, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3633), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3610\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I will speak \non my amendment and the time of the vote will be decided by the \nmanagers of the bill. I will speak on my amendment at this time and \nthen probably will not need additional time, depending on the desires \nof the managers of the bill.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to protect America's children from \nexposure to obscene material, child pornography, or other material \ndeemed inappropriate for minors while accessing the Internet from a \nschool or library receiving federal Universal Service assistance by \nrequiring such schools and libraries to deploy blocking or filtering \ntechnology on computers used by minors, and to block general access to \nobscene material, and child pornography on all computers. The amendment \nfurther requires that schools and libraries block child pornography on \nall computers.\n  The last few years have seen a dramatic expansion in Internet \nconnections. The Internet connects more than 29 million host computers \nin more than 250 countries. Currently, the Internet is growing at a \nrate of approximately 40 percent to 50 percent annually. Some estimates \nof the number of U.S. Internet users are as high as 62 million.\n  Section 254 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 added a new subsidy \nto the traditional Universal Service program, commonly referred to as \nthe Schools and Libraries Discount, or e-rate. As implemented by the \nFCC, the e-rate is a $2.25 billion annual subsidy aimed at connecting \nschools and libraries to the Internet. This subsidy is funded through \nhigher phone bills to customers.\n  There are approximately 86,000 public schools in the United States. \nIn the first program year of the e-rate, 68,220 public schools \nparticipated in the program. That is approximately 68 percent of all \npublic schools. Participation increased by 15 percent in the second \nyear, from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, with 78,722 public schools \nlisted on funded applications. That is approximately 82 percent of all \npublic schools. Simply put, the e-rate program helped connect one \nmillion classrooms to the Internet. Private school participation in the \nprogram has resulted in more than 80,000 additional American classrooms \nwired to the Internet. Statistics on libraries participating in the \nprogram mirror these dramatic numbers.\n  I lay out these statistics because they represent both the tremendous\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\npromise and the exponential danger that wiring America's children to \nthe Internet poses. Certainly, the Internet represents previously \nunimaginable education and information opportunities for our Nation's \nschool children. However, there are also some very real risks. \nPornography, including obscene material, child pornography, and \nindecent material is widely available on the Internet. This material \nmay be accessed directly, or may turn up as the product of a general \nInternet search. Seemingly innocuous keyword searches like ``Barbie \ndoll,'' ``playground,'' ``boy'' and ``girl'' can turn up some of the \nmost offensive and shocking pornography imaginable. Though, due to the \namorphous nature of the Internet, it is difficult to precisely \nestablish the amount of pornography available on the Internet. \nAccording to US News & World Report, there are ``at least 40,000 sex-\noriented sites on the Web.'' This number does not include Usenet \nnewsgroups, and pornographic spam.\n  Many who oppose efforts to protect children from exposure to \npornography over the Internet dismiss such efforts as moralizing, as if \nit isn't enough to argue for the protection of innocence. Mr. \nPresident, I am content to make my stand on the vital importance of \nsheltering the purity of our children's moral innocence. However, the \nneed to protect our children exceeds the basic moral argument. Natural \nsexual development occurs gradually, throughout childhood. Exposure of \nchildren to pornography distorts this natural development. As Dr. Mary \nAnne Layden, Director of Education at the University of Pennsylvania \nSchool of Cognitive Learning testified before the Commerce Committee, \nchildren's exposure to pornography accelerates and warps normal sexual \ndevelopment by shaping sexual perspective through exposure to sexual \ninformation and imagery. Dr. Layden stated: ``The result is a set of \ndistorted beliefs about human sexuality. These shared distorted beliefs \ninclude: pathological behavior is normal, is common, hurts no one, and \nis socially acceptable, the female body is for male entertainment, sex \nis not about intimacy and sex is the basis of self-esteem.''\n\n  Alarmingly, the threat to children posed by unrestricted Internet \naccess is not limited to exposure to simple pornography. As we have \nseen through an increasing flurry of shocking media reports, the \nInternet has become the tool of choice for pedophiles who utilize the \nInternet to lure and seduce children into illegal and abusive sexual \nactivity. Pedophiles are using this technology to trade in child \npornography, and to lure and seduce our children. In many cases, such \nactivity is the product of individuals, taking advantage of the \nanonymity provided by the Internet to stalk children through chat-\nrooms, and by e-mail. However, an increasingly disturbing trend is that \nof highly organized, and technologically sophisticated groups of \npedophiles who utilize advanced technology to trade in child \npornography, and to sexually exploit and abuse children.\n  In 1996, the country was shocked by a tragic story of the sexual \nexploitation of a young child in California. The San Francisco \nChronicle reported an international ring of pedophiles operating \nthrough an on-line chat room known as the ``Orchid Club.'' Sadly, this \ncase was an ominous precursor of underscoring both the technological \nsophistication of on-line predators, and the unique challenge of \nprotecting children in an environment of a global communications \nmedium. The Chronicle reported that: ``The case appears to be the first \nincident where pornography on the Internet has been linked to an \nincident of child molestation that was transmitted on-line . . . \nProsecutors said members produced and traded child pornography \ninvolving victims as young as five years old, swapped stories of having \nsex with minors and in one instance chatted online while two suspects \nmolested a 10-year-old girl.'' Sixteen men were indicted, including \nindividuals from across the United States, Australia, Canada, and \nFinland.\n  In 1998, the U.S Customs Service, in coordination with law \nenforcement officials from 13 other countries, conducted a raid on the \n``Wonderland Club.'' The price of membership in the Wonderland Club was \nhigh. In order to ``join'' the Wonderland Club of low-lifes, \nprospective members had to provide 10,000 images of child pornography, \nwhich were then digitally cross-referenced against the club's data base \nof more than 500,000 images of children to ensure their originality. \nAccording to Time Magazine:\n\n       The images depict everything from sexual abuse to actual \n     rape of children--some as young as 18 months old. ``Some club \n     members in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia . . . owned \n     production facilities and transmitted live child-sex shows \n     over the Web. Club members directed the sex acts by sending \n     instruction to the producers via Wondernet chat rooms. ``They \n     had standards,'' said a law enforcement official involved in \n     the case. ``The only thing they banned was snuff pictures, \n     the actual killing of somebody.''\n\n  As we wire America's children to the Internet, we are inviting these \nlow lifes to prey upon our children in every classroom and library in \nAmerica.\n  If this isn't enough, the Internet has now become the tool of choice \nfor disseminating information and propaganda promoting racism, anti-\nSemitism, extremism, and how-to manuals on everything from drugs to \nbombs.\n\n  Rapid Internet growth has provided an opportunity for those promoting \nhate to reach a much wider and broader audience. Children are uniquely \nsusceptible to these messages of hate, and make no mistake about it, \nthey are the targets of these messages. Through Internet access, our \nschools and libraries, places where we intend our children to develop \ntheir social skills, tolerance, where they should be learning to \nappreciate the wonder and beauty of diversity, instead they can be \nexposed to extremely hateful and dangerous information, and material \nthey may otherwise go through their entire lives without being exposed \nto. According to the New York Times: ``They (hate groups) peddle hatred \nto children, with brightly colored Web pages featuring a coloring book \nof white supremacist symbols and a crossword puzzle full of racist \nclues.''\n  Media propaganda has always been used as a means for spreading the \ntoxic message of hate. Magazines, pamphlets, movies, music and other \nmeans have been their traditional tools for those seeking to feed the \ndarker side of our human nature. However, the Internet has changed the \nrules and the nature of this sinister game. With the growth of the \nWorld Wide Web, these evil groups are able to deliver a multimedia hate \nmessage through every computer, and into the minds of every child, in \nevery classroom, and library in America. Images of burning crosses, \nNeo-Nazi propaganda, every imaginable message of division and hatred \nare just one click away from our children. The Seattle Post-\nIntelligencer reported in an article entitled ``Nazism on the \nInternet'':\n\n       Many sites operated by neo-nazis, skinhead, Ku Klux Klan \n     members and followers of radical religious sects are growing \n     more sophisticated, offering inviting Web environments that \n     are designed to be attractive to children and young adults.\n\n  The software filtering industry estimates that about 180 new hate or \ndiscrimination pages, 2,500 to 7,500 adult sites, 400 sites dedicated \nto violence, 1,250 dedicated to weapons, and 50 are murder-suicide \nsites are added to the Web every week.\n  Manuals on bomb-making, weapons purchases, drug making and \npurchasing, are widespread on the Internet. Simple word searches using \n``marijuana,'' enables kids to access Web sites instructing them on how \nto cultivate, buy, and consume drugs. During the Commerce Committee \nhearing on my bill, the Children's Internet Protection Act, a \nrepresentative of the BATF stated: ``The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms recently ran a simple Internet query of pipe bomb, using \nseveral commonly used search engines. This query produced nearly three \nmillion ``hits'' of Web sites containing information on pipe bombs.'' \nLiterature such as the ``Terrorist's Handbook'' is easily available on-\nline, and provides readers with instruction on everything from how to \nbuild guns and bombs, to lists of suppliers for the chemicals, and \nother ingredients necessary to construct such devices. Web sites such \nas (www.overthrow.comldrugznbombz.html) offers the ``School Stopper's \nTextbook,'' touted as ``A Guide to Disruptive Revolutionary Tactics for \nHigh-Schoolers.''\n  There are now approximately ninety different blocking, or filtering \nsoftware solutions that parents and educators may choose from to \naddress just about\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nevery different value or need relating to child safety on the Internet.\n  Due to the sheer size of the Internet, and the place at which it \nchanges, some have argued that it is impossible to keep blocking lists \ncurrent and comprehensive. Others have argued filtering systems are too \narbitrary, that filtering by keyword may result in blocking both \nharmful sites, as well as useful sites. There was a time when there was \nsome legitimacy to these claims. However, that time has passed.\n  According to Peter Nickerson, CEO of Net Nanny Software:\n\n       A general perception exists that Internet filtering is \n     seriously flawed and in many situations unusable. It is also \n     perceived that schools and libraries don't want filtering. \n     These notions are naive and based largely on problems \n     associated with earlier versions of client-based software \n     that are admittedly crude and ineffective. Though some poor \n     filtering products still exist, filtering has gone through an \n     extensive evolution and is not only good at protecting \n     children but also well-received and in high demand.\n\n  When a school or library accepts federal dollars through the \nUniversal Service fund, they become a partner with the federal \ngovernment in pursuing the compelling interest of protecting children. \nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that schools have the authority to \nremove inappropriate books from school libraries. The Internet is \nsimply another method for making information available in a school or \nlibrary. It is no more than a technological extension of the book \nstack. As such, the same principles affirmed by the Court apply to \nrestricting children's access to material, over the Internet, in a \nschool.\n  At its core, this amendment to a spending bill, amending 254(h) of \nthe Communications Act of 1934 to require, as a contingency for receipt \nof a federal subsidy, certain measures to restrict children's access to \nchild pornography, obscene material, and other harmful material via \nschool and library computers, and that all users be restricted from \naccessing child pornography. Local officials are granted the authority \nto determine what technology is used to achieve this end, and policies \nfor determining how such technology is used. There is ample precedent \nfor conditioning receipt of federal assistance.\n  Libraries place many restrictions on what patrons may do while on the \npremises. The simplest example of this are the strict rules implemented \nby libraries to maintain a quiet atmosphere for reading and study. \nPatrons are not permitted to give speeches, make public statements, \nsing, speak loudly, etc. Further, it is the exclusive authority of the \nlibrary to make affirmative decisions regarding what books, magazines, \nor other material is placed on library shelves, or otherwise made \navailable to patrons. According to Jay Sekulow, of the American Center \nfor Law and Justice:\n\n       Libraries impose many restrictions on the use of their \n     systems which demonstrate that the library is not available \n     to the general public. Additionally, an open forum by \n     government designation becomes, `open' because it allows the \n     general public into its facility for First Amendment \n     activities. Like in the National Endowment for the Arts v. \n     Finley, decision, the government purchase of books (like \n     buying art) does not create a public forum.\n\n  Mr. President, currently, roughly 30 percent of U.S. households are \nwired to the Internet, with some smaller number of those households \nwired with children in the home. With full implementation of the E-rate \nprogram, there will be an explosion of children going on-line. This is \nan unprecedented egalitarian opportunity for access to educational and \ninformational resources by America's children. Equally, this reality \nrepresents an unprecedented risk to the safety and innocence of our \nnation's most precious resources, the sanctity of childhood.\n  The first line of defense is parents. Parents must be involved in \ntheir children's lives. They must make it a point to know what their \nkids are doing on-line, the games they are playing, the web sites and \nchat rooms they are visiting, whom they are talking to.\n  But parents need help. Currently, for most children, their Internet \nactivities will occur outside the home. Parents, taxpayers, deserve to \nhave a realistic faith that, when they entrust their children to our \nnation's schools and libraries, that this trust will not betrayed.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Carl Jung, in 1913, spoke of the importance of \nchildhood in shaping values, and the implications for future \ngenerations. Jung said: ``The little world of childhood with its \nfamiliar surroundings is a model of the greater world. The more \nintensively the family has stamped its character upon the child, the \nmore it will tend to feel and see its earlier miniature world again in \nthe bigger world of adulthood.''\n  As I look upon the landscape of America today, of our children, \ngrowing up in a culture of darkness, of a mass media that floods their \ninnocent minds with images of gratuitous sex and senseless violence, as \nI contemplate the likes of predators who stalk our children through \nthis new technology, of pornographers and hate mongers who seek to \ninvade the sanctity of the innocence of childhood to stamp their dark \nvalues on our children, I wonder what the future world of adulthood \nwill look like if we do not act swiftly and decisively to build an \ninviolable wall around our precious children.\n  This bill was passed last year by voice vote. I hope we can dispense \nwith it, and I also hope Members of this body understand that what is \nhappening in schools and libraries all over America, in many cases, is \nan unacceptable situation.\n  We are not trying to impose any standards from the Federal Government \nor from this body. We are asking the schools and libraries to impose \nstandards according to community standards, according to what the local \nlibrary board and school board thinks is appropriate, just as those \ndecisions are made about printed material in schools and libraries. I \nthink this is an important issue. The testimony before the Commerce \nCommittee was alarming and very disturbing.\n  Obviously, we do not intend to invade the sanctity of the home nor \ntell parents what they should and should not do regarding their \nchildren. But I believe when taxpayer dollars are involved, the Federal \nGovernment then has a role to play.\n  As a proud conservative, I hope we will pass this legislation \nquickly, and that it will be enacted into law. The sooner the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew my request for our colleagues who \nhave amendments to offer them. I was informed about an hour ago that \none of our colleagues was on his way to offer an amendment. We are very \nanxious to have Senators come to the floor.\n  In the absence of any Senator who seeks recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Iowa whether or not I should lay down my amendment, \nand then set it aside when other Members come out. I am pleased to come \ninto play here, if that would help.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we would be \ndelighted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for that response.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for part A of title I of the Elementary \n                  and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Wellstone), for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Reed of Rhode \n     Island, proposes an amendment numbered 3631.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PART A OF TITLE I.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount appropriated under this Act to carry out part A of \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     shall be $10,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator about what \nthe amendment relates?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment increases the \nappropriations of title I, part A, to $10 billion. Actually, the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously voted to \nauthorize this to the $15 billion level. I think right now we are at \n$8.36 billion. This is an amendment to get us at least part way there.\n  I come to the floor today to speak on the agreement that has been \nreached regarding some of the spending cuts in the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill. It is my understanding that Senator Stevens has \nagreed to drop certain provisions of this bill in conference; in \nparticular, I understand that the 1.9 billion dollar S-CHIP cut, the \n240 million dollar TANF cut, the 50 million dollar welfare-to-work \nperformance bonus, and the 1.1 billion dollar cut to the Social Service \nBlock Grant (SSBG) will all now be restored in conference.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Stevens, \nSenator Roth, and Senator Graham, for ensuring that the funding for \nthese critical programs is restored. However, I also feel that it is \nimportant to stand up today and remind all of my colleagues that it \nnever should have come to this--none of these programs should have ever \nseen their funding streams reduced in the first place. In particular, \nthe proposed 1.1 billion dollar cut to the SSBG, a cut that would have \nreduced the block grant to just 600,000 dollars, should never have made \nit into this bill.\n  I have to say how disappointed I was to learn that the FY 2001 Labor-\nHHS Appropriations bill contained such enormous funding cuts to the \nSocial Services Block Grant, cuts of more than 1 billion dollars. And \nwhile I find it deeply disturbing that such cuts would be proposed \nunder any circumstances, I find it even more deeply disturbing that \nthese cuts were proposed as part of the FY 2001 Labor-HHS \nAppropriations since we had this exact debate last year. In the FY 2000 \nLabor-HHS Appropriations, the SSBG faced cuts of just over 1 billion \ndollars. At that time, Senator Graham of Florida and I offered an \namendment to restore SSBG funding, and in my mind, the question was \nsettled. When asked, ``Should we reduce funding to the SSBG?'' the \noverwhelming response was, no, absolutely not. At that time, fifty-\nseven Senators said that the services their states provide using SSBG \nfunds--services like Meals on Wheels, congregate dining, assisted \nliving for the elderly and the disabled, foster care services, and \nchild care services, to name only a few--are important to the people in \ntheir communities and that they did not want to see these funds cut.\n  I ask you, why then did the SSBG face such enormous cuts again this \nyear? This program is simply too important, and it is critical that we \nset a new standard by which the SSBG is always funded first, not last, \nnever as an afterthought, never as the result of intensive last-minute \nlobbying and negotiation, and by which the SSBG is always funded to the \nfull statutory amount.\n  As many of my colleagues already know, the SSBG is a flexible funding \nstream that states use to pay for a wide variety of services and \nprograms for many of their most vulnerable citizens. The states have a \ntremendous amount of leeway in how they use their SSBG funds, and this \nis one funding stream they are able to use to try to develop innovative \nand creative programs to help the poor and needy. SSBG funds can be \nspent to serve people with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal \npoverty level, and the money need only be used to help people achieve \nand maintain economic self-support and self-sufficiency, and to \nprevent, reduce, or eliminate dependency. SSBG funds may be used for \nservices that prevent or remedy neglect and abuse, and to prevent or \nreduce unnecessary institutional care by providing community-based or \nhome-based non-institutional care. States use this money to care for \npeople who would otherwise slip through the cracks; these funds are \ncritical for the well-being of the most vulnerable people among us--the \nvery old and the very young, the poor, and the disabled. These are \npeople who most need our help, and we should not be slashing the very \nmoney that is most likely to serve them.\n  Title XX (20) of the Social Security Act specifies that 1.7 billion \ndollars is to be provided to the States through the SSBG for FY 2001. \nHowever, in spite of its status as a mandatory program, the SSBG has \nbeen raided repeatedly over the years to fund other priorities. \nBeginning in 1996, as part of the welfare ``reform'' law, the SSBG was \ncut by 15 percent, from 2.8 billion dollars to 2.38 billion dollars, \nfor fiscal years 1997 through 2002, after which point its funding was \nsupposed to go back to 2.8 billion dollars. The states reluctantly \naccepted these cuts, and only after they obtained a commitment from \nCongress that we would provide stable funding for the block grant in \nthe future.\n  As it turns out, the lifespan on that particular Congressional \ncommitment was only two years, because by 1998, we were back to raid \nthe SSBG again when the highway bill cut funding for the block grant \nfurther, to 1.7 billion dollars for fiscal year 2001 and each year \nafter that. And now here we are again, with our hand in the cookie jar, \ntrying to raid the SSBG one more time. The FY 2001 Senate Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill that came out of committee proposed slashing \nfunding for this block grant yet again, this time to only 600 million \ndollars, a cut of more than one billion dollars. If this proposed cut \nwere enacted, funding for the SSBG will be almost 80 percent lower in \n2001 than it was in 1995. Mr. President, I feel certain that by no \nstretch of anyone's imagination does an 80 percent cut qualify as the \nstable funding we promised the states in 1996.\n  And what kind of a message do we send to the States when we talk \nabout cutting block grant funds? Congress sold welfare reform to the \nstates on the promise that they would have the flexibility to \nadminister their own social service programs. But as the National \nConference of State Legislatures point out, ``these cuts [to the SSBG] \nwould set the precedent that the federal government is reticent to \nstand by its decision to grant flexibility to states in administering \nsocial programs.'' Couple this with the nearly 2 billion dollars the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations bill proposed cutting from S-CHIP, another \nblock grant critical to the states' ability to provide services for \nvulnerable citizens, and I think the states could take only one message \naway from this bill as it came to the Senate floor: Don't make long-\nterm investments in these social service programs, because you simply \ncan't count on the federal government to keep up their end of the \nbargain.\n\n  SSBG funds are used by the states to provide services for needy \nindividuals and families not eligible for TANF, and to reduce federal \nMedicaid payments by helping vulnerable elderly and disabled live in \ntheir homes rather than in institutions. States also use SSBG funds for \nchild care services and other supports for families moving from welfare \nto work. When Congress proposed slashing these funds, we sent a clear, \nand I believe extremely damaging, message to the states. I think we \ntold them not to invest in these kinds of social support programs, \nbecause they just can't count on the money being there.\n  But let's just say for a minute that we were to go back on our word \nand break our commitment to the states--so what? What exactly does SSBG \nfund? Anything important?\n  Only if you think adoption services, congregate meals, counseling \nservices, child abuse and neglect services, day care, education and \ntraining services, employment services, family planning services, \nfoster care services, home delivered meals, housing services, \nindependent and transitional living services, legal services, pregnancy \nand parenting services, residential treatment services, services for \nat-risk youth and families, special services for the disabled, and \ntransportation services are important. All of these programs are \nfunded, in part at least, through the SSBG.\n  Each year, SSBG funds are used by the states to provide critical \nsupport\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\nservices to millions of vulnerable people. In 1998, for example, \naccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, roughly 10 \npercent of SSBG funds were spent on programs that provided child care \nfor low- and moderate-income families, while another 18 percent of SSBG \nfunds were spent on services to protect children from abuse and to \nprovide foster care to children.\n  Other SSBG funds were used to provide services to low- and moderate-\nincome elderly, truly some of our most vulnerable community members. \nServices provided to this population through the SSBG include home-\nbased care and assisted living services intended to help many elderly \npeople stay out of institutions, so that they can continue to live with \ndignity in their own homes, where they feel safe and comfortable. In \nmany cases, the costs the federal government would incur if SSBG funded \nservices were withdrawn and these individuals forced into nursing homes \ninstead would far exceed the savings generated by slashing this \nimportant block grant. In some states, SSBG funds are also used to pay \nfor protective services to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation of \nvulnerable seniors. No other program provides significant funding for \nthose services.\n  Additionally, the SSBG helps to fund support services for nearly half \na million people with mental retardation and other physical and mental \ndisabilities. The services provided with SSBG funds include \ntransportation assistance, adult day care programs, early intervention, \ncrisis intervention, respite care, and employment and independent \nliving services. Again, these are services that help keep vulnerable \npeople in their own homes and out of costly institutionalized settings, \nallowing them to live their lives with dignity and respect.\n  In my own state of Minnesota, SSBG funds are used to provide an \nenormous range of important services. For example, some counties use \nSSBG to augment child care for low-income single women and families. \nYet even with these additional funds, there are currently huge waiting \nlists for subsidized day care in most counties. If we further cut SSBG \nfunds, these county level programs are going to have to reduce or \neliminate services that they provide. And when a single mom who's just \ngotten off welfare and is trying to make ends meet while she starts \nworking at her new job, when she loses the subsidized day care that she \ncounts on, what do you think is going to happen? Which do you think is \nmore likely--that she'll be able to afford to pay for day care herself, \nor that she'll be forced to go back onto welfare?\n  Many Minnesota counties use SSBG money for home care services for the \nelderly. These counties use SSBG funds to pay for a care giver to go \ninto a vulnerable elderly person's home and help them with basic ``home \nchore'' services like taking their medicine on time and in the right \ndoses, keeping their home clean and safe, taking a bath, or making sure \nthere is food in the refrigerator. These are simple, basic services, \nbut they often mean the difference between allowing someone to stay in \ntheir own home or being forced into an institution. If SSBG funds are \ncut, vulnerable elderly are likely to lose home care services like a \nvisiting nurse or case management person, which might then force them \ninto a nursing home or an assisted living situation that would, in the \nend, cost much more money than will be saved by reducing the SSBG.\n  When speaking with people in Minnesota about how they use their SSBG \nfunds, I learned that SSBG money is also sometimes used, especially in \nrural areas, to fund transportation for elderly and disabled, so they \ncan access services like doctors, getting groceries, and just simply so \nthey're not so isolated in their home (a ride to the senior center, \nperhaps). There's no other funding source that will pay for this. For \ndisabled people who are just over eligibility guidelines for medical \nassistance, SSBG money is used to help meet their needs--managing \nmedication, transportation, and community based services like training \nand counseling. Basically, the way it's been explained to me, Minnesota \ncounties typically rely on SSBG money to pay for services for people \nwho otherwise fall through the cracks. They count on this money to \nprovide simple, basic services that keep the most vulnerable among us \nin their homes and out of much more costly institutions.\n  When I asked people in Minnesota to explain to me exactly what kinds \nof services they provide with SSBG funds, I was amazed by what I heard. \nRex Holzemer, who works for Hennepin County, which is the county where \nMinneapolis is located, gave me several short case examples from the \ncounty's social services areas that are supported by SSBG funds. He \ntold me about:\n\n  An 84-year old widow who was neglected and financially exploited by \ntenants in her duplex who had isolated her socially and taken over her \nfinancial affairs, including cashing her Social Security checks. When a \nsocial worker intervened, he found this woman emaciated and unaware of \nher circumstances. The woman was hospitalized and subsequently \ntransferred to a care setting. Adult Protection arranged for a \nconservatorship, and as part of a court-supervised settlement, the \nperpetrators agreed to pay back the bulk of the money.\n  Rex also told me about an 8-year old girl with autism, behavior \nproblems and a sleep disorder, who was provided temporary crisis \ntransitional care while her parents worked to modify her physical \nenvironment at home. The crisis service provided special training on \nappropriate behavioral interventions for the parents and other \ncaregivers, which produced positive behavioral outcomes for the child, \nthereby avoiding inpatient hospitalization and/or out-of-home \nplacement.\n  Then there is the case of a 48-year old woman with schizophrenia who \ncalled looking for help finding a living situation that would offer her \nsome needed supervision. She was referred to several community \ntransitional programs, but was unable to follow through due to her \nillness. The intake worker connected her with an outreach case manager \nwho helped this woman stabilize her life. She was referred to a \npsychiatrist, found crisis housing, and ultimately moved into her own \napartment with only periodic supportive services.\n  Or how about the case of a child born addicted to cocaine, who Child \nProtective Services had to place into foster care? The child's mother \nhas never been able to pass drug testing as required by the court-\nordered child protection plan. The child's 25-year old father, who has \nmild functional impairments, worked intensively with the Developmental \nDisabilities Parent Support Project for eight months to learn \nappropriate parenting skills. Due to the progress the father made, the \nchild was transferred at age one from foster care into the father's \nhome.\n  And what about the two-parent family with four children that was \noverwhelmed by the needs of their 15-year old son who was violent and \nout-of-control? The mother had been assaulted several times by the son, \nand had finally asked that the child be placed out of the home. The \ncounty was able to provide intensive in-home therapy with the entire \nfamily. The son also received individual therapy and participated in \nafter-school programming. The parents were provided with training on \nappropriate behavioral interventions through the in-home counseling and \nwere ultimately able to manage their son within the home, averting the \nneed for out-of-home placement.\n  In each of these cases, Hennepin County drew on SSBG funds to provide \nservices to people who desperately needed help. And in each of these \ncases, because the county was able to provide assistance, vulnerable \nindividuals were able to stay out of institutions, with their families, \nin safe, comfortable settings. But if the Labor-HHS bill is enacted \nwith the proposed SSBG cuts, Hennepin County will have to reduce \nexactly these kinds of services. And it isn't just urban counties that \nrely on SSBG funds, but many of our rural Minnesota counties also use \nSSBG funds to provide critically important services.\n  Sue Beck, the Director of Human Services in Crow Wing County, \nMinnesota, a rural Minnesota county, also told me how her county uses \nits SSBG funds. Sue explained that her county counts on SSBG funds to \nmake sure that vulnerable populations, the elderly, the disabled, \nchildren, and poor people, have the services they need to live \neconomically secure, self-sufficient lives. The vulnerable adults they \nhelp with SSBG money tend to be elderly\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\npeople, seniors or disabled people, who get home care services--someone \nto come in to help them clean their home and maintain a safe \nenvironment, bathe, have food to eat, to see that they take the right \namount of medicine when they're supposed to. Oftentimes these people \naren't eligible for medical assistance, so there's not another source \nof funding available to them when they're living in the community.\n  What will happen if SSBG funds are cut is that they will wind up \nhaving to go into a nursing home in order to qualify for funds to pay \nfor their care. Over the past several years, due to SSBG cuts that have \nalready been imposed, her county has had to cut back services in \ntransportation and ``chore services''--for disabled and elderly people \nwho need just a little bit of help--things like help shoveling snow or \ngrocery shopping. They use SSBG money currently to augment their \nemployability budget--to provide supported employment, and community \nbased employment for people who otherwise might not be able to compete \nsuccessfully in the job market. All of this is at risk when we talk \nabout cutting SSBG by more than 65 percent.\n  Dave Haley, from the Ramsey County Department of Human Services, the \ncounty where St. Paul is located, also told me about how his county \nspends their SSBG money:\n  The first example Dave gave me was that of a typical family of a \nsingle-mother who has three young children. The oldest child, a 7-year-\nold boy, has missed a significant number of school days. The mother is \nexperiencing problems with chemical dependency and involved in a \nviolent relationship with her boyfriend. The mother cannot make sure \nthat the child gets up every day on time, and is promptly fed and \ndressed for school. The family does not have a car or other personal \nmeans of transportation. Through programs partially funded with SSBG \nmoney, the County is able to provide support to the mother to resolve \nher chemical dependency problems and domestic abuse. Services ensure \nthat the seven-year-old is attending school on a regular basis and the \nboy is beginning to make academic progress.\n  There are over 2,000 young children in Ramsey County currently in \nthis situation. Ramsey County and local school districts have been able \nto develop a very active program to address these educational neglect \nissues and insure that children attend school on a consistent basis. \nThey will be forced to scale back this effort, though, if SSBG funds \nare cut by more than a billion dollars.\n  Another example that Dave gave me is that of a 30 year-old woman that \nis living in her own apartment in her home community. Thirty years ago, \na similar individual with moderate mental health needs would have been \nplaced in a state hospital miles from their family home. Over the last \nthree decades, needed supports have been developed, including programs \nto monitor and assist individuals in managing their medications, \nchecking on their money management and assisting when necessary with \nproper budgeting, teaching needed independent living skills, and \nemployment support to maintain their current job. Without periodic \nweekly checks, the individual would have great difficulty managing \ntheir daily life, and might be forced into an institutionalized living \nsituation.\n  The system that has developed over the last three decades has not \nonly improved the lives of hundreds of people in Ramsey County, it has \nalso enabled the state and federal government to save hundreds of \nthousands of dollars on more expensive institutional care.\n  Because of recent budget cuts to the SSBG, Ramsey County has already \nreduced a wide range of services: homemaker services; chemical \ndependency and mental health counseling services; budget counseling and \nmoney management for adults with chemical dependency or mental health \nissues; chemical dependency education and prevention services; \nparenting support programs for families in the child protection system; \nparenting support programs for teenage mothers; targeted efforts in \nneighborhoods with high rates for child abuse and neglect; monthly \ngrants to help families with a developmentally disabled child continue \nto provide in-home care for that child; and semi-independent living \nprograms for elderly and disabled individuals to live in their homes \nand not have to move into residential treatment facilities. These are \nprograms that have already been cut. If SSBG funding is cut further, \nRamsey County will be forced to additionally reduce funding for Meals \non Wheels, transportation services for seniors, outpatient mental \nhealth services, sexual abuse services, employment and training \nprograms, and social adjustment programs for Hmong and Lao immigrants. \nIf the proposed SSBG funds cuts are not restored, all of these \nprograms, and all of the people they serve, will suffer.\n  So you tell me, which of these programs deserves to go, because \nsomething is going to have to if this provision passes. Who do you \nthink we should turn away? Maybe low-income families with children? Or \nperhaps the elderly or disabled? You tell me, who should be the one who \ngoes to bed hungry, or sick and alone, or just plain afraid that they \nwon't make it through tomorrow?\n  I have to explain that this program is particularly important to my \nown state of Minnesota, where the proposed cut to the SSBG will have an \nimmediate and deeply felt effect. Minnesota communities are supposed to \nreceive 30 million dollars in FY 2001 under the current law; if the \nallocation is cut to 600 million dollars as proposed, Minnesota will \nlose more than 19 million dollars in funding, nearly two-thirds of its \ngrant, receiving only 10.4 million dollars in FY 2001. Most states \nwould feel similar cuts if SSBG funding were to be cut from 1.7 billion \ndollars to just 600 million dollars.\n  Minnesota is unique among all the states, though, because, by law, \nSSBG funds by-pass the governor and flow directly to the local level. \nThe state cannot touch the money--they can neither add or subtract \nfunds from the block grant. Minnesota law further requires local levels \nprograms to run balanced books, which means that they cannot carry any \nbudget surplus from one year to the next. So what that means is that if \nthese cuts to the SSBG go through, the state will not be able to help \noffset any of the lost funds with funds from other sources, the local \nlevel programs will have no budget surpluses to fall back on, and these \nfederal level cuts will be reflected immediately at the local level in \nprogram cuts. It would mean substantial reductions, or perhaps even the \nelimination of local Minnesota programs like senior congregate dining, \nmeals-on-wheels, and a host of other local community based programs. It \nwould also mean cuts in health and substance abuse programs, as \nMinnesota is one of only seven states in the country that relies more \nheavily on its Title XX grant than its SAMSA grant to fund mental \nhealth services. Furthermore, because the law governing the flow of \nSSBG funds in Minnesota would actually have to be rewritten to offset \nthe federal funding cuts, the state would not be able to make up the \nfunding shortfall to the counties until the Minnesota legislature comes \ninto session next year and passes new legislation.\n  So some of my colleagues may be saying to themselves, well that's \nunfortunate for Minnesota, but in my home state we'll be able to \nsupplement the cuts with other money--maybe the money we got from the \ntobacco settlement, or perhaps we will just transfer money from our \nTANF surplus. First, let's talk about the tobacco settlements: in some \nstates, anti-smoking and other health needs will receive first priority \nfor use of the settlement funds, not unanticipated reductions in SSBG \nfunds. Also, some states have already enacted legislation committing \nthe tobacco funds for other purposes.\n  Okay, well, then if not the tobacco settlement funds, then maybe the \nTANF surplus funds, since states will be able to transfer up to 4.25 \npercent of their surplus to SSBG. Except, according to an analysis done \nby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, there are 37 states that \nwouldn't be able to offset the funding cuts proposed in the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill by transferring TANF funds. More importantly, \nthough, we send the wrong message to the states when we tell them to \nrob Peter to pay Paul. States should not have to steal funds from one \nsocial services funding stream, in this case TANF, to replace funds \nrescinded from another social services funding stream, the SSBG.\n  In this era of prosperity, of enormous budget surpluses and huge \ngovernment windfall, of tax breaks and increased defense spending, it \nsimply defies logic\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nto further reduce SSBG funding. Now is the time for us to invest in \nmeeting the needs of our most vulnerable citizens-- the very young and \nthe very old, the disabled, and the poor. It would be a terrible breach \nof faith with the states, but more importantly with the people who live \nin those states, if we continue to raid the Social Services Block \nGrant.\n  And while I am pleased that my colleagues have pledged to restore \nfunding to this program, as well as several other critically important \nsocial service programs, I would just say again that it should never \nhave come to this in the first place. These programs are too important \nto our most vulnerable citizens, and we have a responsibility to see to \nit that they are funded first, not last. It should simply be a matter \nof course that these programs are always fully funded, and the fact it \nisn't, that we still have to come out here year after year to fight the \nsame fight to protect these programs, is ridiculous. In this era of \nbudget surpluses and tax cuts, the fact that programs to aid the \nelderly, the disabled, the young, and the poor as somehow continue to \nremain vulnerable to spending cuts ridiculous. I am pleased that we now \nhave the budget chairman's promise to restore these cuts, although I \nhope that other, equally important programs don't fall victim to these \nfunding reduction in their stead in conference. It is crucial that we \nmaintain our end of the deal we struck with the states, and with the \npeople who live in those states, and protect these programs. Again, I \nthank Senator Stevens, Senator Roth, and Senator Graham for their \nefforts to protect these programs, and hope that we see a final \nAppropriations bill that fully funds all of these critical programs \nthat serve our most vulnerable citizens.\n  I thank Senators Harkin and Specter, and also Senator Stevens and \nSenator Graham of Florida, for their work.\n  My understanding is we will be able to get this resolved; that we \nwill be able in the conference committee to work hard to restore the \nfunding for the social services block grant program.\n  I ask my colleague from Iowa; is that correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I think all of us are committed on this side. I \ndon't speak for the Senator from Pennsylvania. But in my conversations \nwith him, I understand that he is committed to replacing the social \nservices block grant. Clearly, we cannot live with those. We are going \nto restore those in conference.\n  It was simply a matter of trying to get our bill together to meet the \nbudget requirements because SSBGs were not fully funded. I can assure \nthe Senator from Minnesota that they will be funded fully in \nconference.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I say to both Senators that \nthere are two issues here that are important to me. I understand the \npressure under which both of my colleagues have labored. I thank them \nfor their support.\n  We went through this debate last year, and we had a vote. I came out \nhere with Senator Graham on an amendment to restore the funding.\n  The notion that we would actually be cutting the block grant \nprogram--which is Meals on Wheels, child care services, and help and \nassisted living, help for people to stay at home, elderly people to \nstay at home, people with disabilities to stay at home--to me is so \nshortsighted.\n  There is very moving testimony from a lot of people in Minnesota in \nthe human services area who talk with great passion about what these \ncuts would mean--especially in a State such as Minnesota where we \nautomatically pass this money directly to the county level. We wouldn't \nbe able to make up for it. The consequences of these proposed cuts in \nthe block grant program would be just unbelievable. To cut the social \nservices block grant program by over $1 billion would have a very harsh \nimpact.\n  I have complete confidence that this funding will be restored in \nconference committee. This is all about the heart and soul of the \nSenate.\n  I do not believe with a flush economy, and yet another revised \nestimate of the amount of money we are going to have for surplus, that \nwe would be cutting these kinds of programs that are so important to \nvulnerable citizens around the country. In particular, I speak for \npeople in Minnesota.\n  The health committee voted unanimously to increase the authorization \nof title I to $15 billion. Right now, this bill we are considering \nprovides for $8.36 billion. That is a little more than 50 percent of \nwhat we called for in the authorizing committee.\n  The interesting thing is this was a unanimous vote in the health \ncommittee. This is about a $400 million increase from last year. That \nis what we have here in the appropriations bill on the floor. The House \ngave almost no increase to this valuable program. This amendment says: \nLook; let's at least bump this up to $10 billion.\n  I point out at the very beginning that the title I program is one of \nthe most important education programs that we support at the Federal \nlevel; and the title I program allocates money back to our communities \nto help those students who are especially disadvantaged. The title I \nprogram is a very targeted program. It goes to the lowest income school \ndistricts--be they urban, rural, or inner suburban. The title I program \nallocates money back to our local communities and our local school \ndistricts to provide assistance for children, whether it be more \nassistance for reading, whether it be more help vis-a-vis \nprekindergarten, or whether it be afterschool programs.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that the title I program is \nfunded at best at about one-third of the level, so we really haven't \neven come close to backing up this mission and this commitment to \nchildren with the resources. I have great appreciation for what my \ncolleagues have done in this appropriations bill, but for some reason \ntitle I really stays very low.\n  Again, our committee, the HELP committee, unanimously voted to \nauthorize this up to $15 billion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have another amendment that is ready to go. We will \nset Senator Wellstone's aside, obviously.\n  How much longer does the Senator from Minnesota anticipate he wishes \nto speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have just begun. In the spirit of \ncooperating with management, I am pleased to lay the amendment aside if \nthe Senator wishes. But I will say to my colleague, I probably need \nabout half an hour to make my case.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the purpose of the inquiry was not to ask \nthe Senator from Minnesota to abbreviate his comments in any way. But \nit would help us, in the orderly management of the bill, if we could \nhave another amendment introduced now so we can get the process \nrolling, and then, if it is acceptable to the Senator from Minnesota, I \nwould ask him to yield for 5 minutes with the right to resume his \npresentation at the end of that time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nThat will be fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nbusiness be set aside so the Senator from Pennsylvania may offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3635\n\n(Purpose: Relating to universal telecommunications service for schools \n                             and libraries)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3635.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues, my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania and my colleague from Minnesota, for allowing me just \na few minutes, at least 5 minutes, to explain the subject matter of \nthis amendment.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, talking about Internet \nprotection. Let me say I commend his work as chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee in pursuing this area because it is an important area, to \nprovide needed protections for children in libraries and schools, to \nhave a program in place to deal with the issues of pornography and \nviolence and the other things that have opened up on the Internet.\n  I have nothing but words of praise for the Senator from Arizona and \nfor the work he has initiated. In fact, the amendment I have just \nintroduced uses his language pretty much as the base of the amendment. \nBut in looking at this issue, now, for the past several years--and I \nhave young children; I am very concerned about their access to the \nInternet--talking to people from both libraries and schools, and others \nwho are interested in the subject area, I believe the McCain amendment, \nwhile I think it goes so far, can in fact and should go further.\n  In this respect, as the Senator himself mentioned, there are maybe \n100 filtering software packages out there. Some are good, some are not \nso good; some are state of the art, some are not. His amendment does \nnot require anyone to buy state-of-the-art filtering software. It just \nsays you have to buy filtering software or blocking software.\n  In fact, even the state of the art does not include some of the \nthings about which I am very concerned. One of the real concerns I have \nis chat rooms. When you talk about pedophiles and people who prey on \npeople via the Internet, they do it principally through these chat \nrooms. I am not aware of very much software that blocks chat rooms.\n  So you have a lot of things in addition to sites that maybe are \npornographic or violent, or other problems you find on the Internet, \nthat may be blocked with some of these software packages. But it \ndoesn't get to the scope of the dangers on the Internet.\n  What I have suggested in my amendment is that, in the alternative, we \nrequire local communities, schools--anyone who participates in the e-\nrate, the same premise on which Senator McCain's amendment is based--\nthat they develop a policy that there be local hearings and public \nnotice, and there be a community effort put together for the community \nto get involved and make the decision on a community basis on how they \nare going to deal in a comprehensive way with this. In fact, we list \nseveral things in the amendment that must be covered by this local \npolicy.\n  The policy is then reviewed by the FCC simply to determine whether \nthe school district, for example, has met the criteria and actually has \na policy in place to deal with the areas specified in the legislation. \nIf the community decides they do not want to go through public notice, \nthey don't want to have hearings, they don't want to go through this \nprocess of developing a local plan, then Senator McCain's amendment \nfalls into line; they must buy filtering software. So we keep his \namendment as sort of the hammer to encourage localities to do that.\n  I think what Senator McCain said was absolutely right. Most of these \ncommunities are already buying software. I have been through hundreds \nof schools and have talked about this issue. Most of them understand \nthe dangers out there and, in fact, have developed or are in the \nprocess of developing a program to deal with this problem. What we want \nto do is provide some guidance to them, some encouragement to them, and \nin the case of Senator McCain's underlying amendment, which again is \npart of our amendment that I have just filed, it is a hammer that says: \nIf you don't provide a comprehensive local approach, then you have to \nbuy the software.\n  To me, it is a philosophical argument. It says: Should we have \nWashington come down and hammer you and say here is what you have to \ndo, or should we have a program that says: Here is the problem. Local \nparents and teachers and community, you go out and bring the community \ntogether and do the hard work of democracy, which is to work together \nto come up with a solution to the problem. I am hopeful we can do that.\n  I just say briefly, my amendment, the bill I have introduced which is \nS. 1545, which is the text of this amendment, has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators, American Association of \nEducation Service Agencies, International Society for Technology in \nEducation, National Rural Education Association, the American Library \nAssociation, the National Education Association, the Consortium for \nSchool Networking, and the Catholic Conference. They all support my \namendment. That is about\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\nas wide a cross-section as you can get. And I would add someone very \nlocal. On this issue, Dr. Laura Schlesinger also supports our approach \nas the alternative to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, asked for a few moments to speak in regard to this issue before \nus.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Vermont be allowed to speak \nand I then follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Minnesota for \nhis customary courtesy.\n  Over the past decade, the Internet has grown, as we know, from \nrelative obscurity to what is today, both an essential commercial tool \nand increasingly an essential educational tool. With that expansion, we \nhave had some remarkable gains. We have also seen new dangers for our \nchildren. Congress has reacted. We struggle with legislation that will \nprotect the free flow of information, as required by the first \namendment, while at the same time we shield our children from some of \nthe inappropriate material that can be found on the Internet.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, spoke of his \nconcern. I share his concern that much of the material available on the \nInternet may not be appropriate for children. I commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his good-faith effort to find a solution, but I cannot \nsupport the proposal he has urged. This amendment, his proposal, would \nrequire schools and libraries to certify, install, and enforce an \nInternet filtering program under the supervision of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and also under threat both of losing their \ne-rate discounts in the future and the financial liability of \nreimbursing discounted funds they have already spent.\n  In my view, as well intentioned as it might be, the amendment would \nsubstantially harm and not help the children of this Nation. I do not \nsupport it.\n  We have to tread cautiously and carefully in this arena but also \nunderstand a lot of schools and libraries have found a pretty practical \nway of doing this.\n  For example, many schools and libraries put their screens in the main \nreading room. One has to assume not too many kids are going to go \npulling up inappropriate things on the web sites when their teachers, \ntheir parents, and everybody else are walking back and forth and \nlooking over their shoulder saying: What are you looking at? It is one \nthing if you are looking at NASA's home page. It is another thing if \nyou are looking at wicked dungeons or something, if there is such a \nthing.\n  Past legislative efforts to protect children by imposing content-\nbased restrictions on the Internet have failed to respect our first \namendment principles and pass constitutional muster. In 1997, the \nSupreme Court unanimously struck down the Communications Decency Act, \nwhich this body approved 84-16.\n  Just last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that the \nChild Online Protection Act is likely an unconstitutional, content-\nbased restriction on protected speech.\n  I opposed this legislation--in fact, I was the only vote against it \nwhen it was offered as an amendment to the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. \n442, and spoke against it when it was included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations measure in October 1998. I predicted the courts would \nrule as they have done.\n  The McCain amendment to H.R. 4577 is likely to go the way of its \npredecessors. First, the amendment would require that schools and \nlibraries obtaining e-rate discounts for telecommunications services \nuse blocking and filtering software that makes inaccessible obscene \nmaterial and child pornography, even if local authorities determine \nthat other strategies are more appropriate for both students and \nlibrary patrons. As the National Association of Independent Schools \nnoted in commenting on this proposal last year:\n\n       * * * it is an individual school's decision to determine \n     how best to address this issue in a way that is commensurate \n     with its mission and philosophy--whether it be part of the \n     teaching and learning process, the inclusion of appropriate \n     use policies or enforceable language in parent/student \n     enrollment contracts, or even filters. It is certainly not \n     the role of the federal government to proscribe a course of \n     action that interferes with what is decidedly a local matter.\n\n  Second, the amendment would invite the FCC to be the de facto \nnational censor, collecting from schools and libraries around the \ncountry so-called ``certifications'' that they are implementing \nblocking and filtering programs on their computers with Internet \naccess. The FCC would be responsible for policing these schools and \nlibraries to ensure that they are fulfilling the promises they make in \nthe certifications, and are in fact blocking computer access to obscene \nmaterial and child pornography. The FCC would also be the ultimate \nenforcer in the scheme outlined in the amendment since the FCC has the \nresponsibility for determining when the schools and libraries have \nfailed to comply with the filtering requirements of the law and when \n``the provision of services at discount rates . . . shall cease . . . \nby reason of the failure of a school to comply with the requirements.''\n  We should not underestimate the power this would place in the FCC \nsince the e-rate is a valuable privilege, particularly for schools and \nlibraries in poor areas and in rural areas with high costs for \ntelecommunications services. The e-rate, passed as part of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, provides schools and libraries with deep \ndiscounts in telephone services and Internet access. Protecting \nchildren from viewing or receiving potentially inappropriate \ninformation is of the utmost importance. Yet, to ensure their continued \neligibility for the e-rate, and to avoid having to reimburse past \nfinancial discounts, we can anticipate that schools and libraries will \ngo overboard and block out material deemed by some to be inappropriate. \nWould, for example, online chat rooms focused on the works of Vladimir \nNabokov and including discussion of the classic Lolita be off limits, \nlet alone the work itself, since some may view it as pornographic? The \nfilm version of this book had a very difficult time finding a \ndistributor due to the nature of the subject matter.\n\n  School boards and libraries faced with the risk of losing their e-\nrate can be expected to implement highly restrictive programs. This \nbroad ``self-censoring'' imposed by the McCain amendment on schools and \nlibraries will lead to a chilling of free speech to the detriment of \nour nation's children and library patrons.\n  Another consequence will be to re-make the FCC into an updated \nversion of the Meese Commission on pornography, but with far greater \nenforcement powers and coercive effect.\n  As part of the certification process mandated in the amendment, we \ncan expect schools and libraries to submit their plans for Internet \nfiltering to the Commission for guidance on whether the proposals are \nacceptable. In practical terms, this would require the FCC to make \nliterally thousands of determinations as to what constitutes \n``obscene'' or ``child pornography'' in order to provide comfort to \nschools and libraries seeking guidance. The financial risks are too \ngreat for schools and libraries to simply wait for the FCC to find \ntheir filtering and compliance plan to be insufficient. This will, in \nthe end, defeat the local decision-making to which this amendment pays \nlip service.\n  On the contrary, the amendment if enacted may lead to the Orwellian \nnightmare fully realized. The FCC, an unelected administrative agency, \nwill be in the position to regulate the dissemination of knowledge and \ncontrol what our children can read, view, and learn at school or at the \nlibrary.\n  Taken as a whole, the problematic aspects of the McCain amendment \nwill harm schools and libraries and decrease the value of the Internet \nas an important educational tool. By requiring a certification to the \nFCC, the amendment places yet another regulatory burden on financially \nstrapped schools and libraries.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have put forward a proposal \nthat addresses this problem and avoids the pitfalls inherent to the \nMcCain amendment. We offered this proposal as an amendment to S. 254, \nthe juvenile justice bill, and it was agreed to on May 13, 1999, by a \nvote of 100-0. Our Internet filtering proposal would leave the solution \nto protecting children in schools and libraries from inappropriate \nonline materials to local school boards and\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\ncommunities. It would require Internet Service Providers with more than \n50,000 subscribers to provide residential customers, free or at cost, \nwith software or other filtering systems that will prevent minors from \naccessing inappropriate material on the Internet. A survey would be \nconducted at set intervals after enactment to determine whether ISPs \nare complying with this requirement. The requirement that ISPs provide \nblocking software would become effective only if the majority of \nresidential ISP subscribers lack the necessary software within set time \nperiods.\n\n  This Internet filtering proposal seems to be a sensible thing to do. \nAs I said, it passed 100-0. Unfortunately, progress on this proposal \nhas been stalled as the majority in Congress has refused to conclude \nthe juvenile justice conference. This is just one of the many \nlegislative proposals contained in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice \nbill, S. 254, designed to help and safeguard our children--which is why \nthat bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming majority over a year \nago.\n  I would like to see us go back to our filtering proposal. We have \nalready voted on it. It is a workable solution. It would bring about \nwhat we want to do.\n  I commend Senator McCain for his leadership and dedication to the \nsubject. I hope we will work together on the issue. We share an \nappreciation of the Internet as an educational tool, we appreciate it \nas a venue for free speech, but we also are concerned about protecting \nour children from inappropriate material whether they are at home, at \nschool, or in the library.\n  Ultimately, it is not going to be just a question of passing a law to \ndo this. I suggest parents do with their children today what my parents \ndid with my brother, sister, and me when we were growing up: Pay some \nattention to what their children read.\n  I was fortunate. I began reading when I was 4, but I had parents who \nactually talked about what I might read. Parents may want to spend some \ntime on the Internet with their children. There is software that can \nhelp to protect their children, and parents should work with that. They \nought to take a greater interest in what they are doing and not just \nassume Congress can somehow pass laws that keep getting knocked down, \njustifiably so, under the first amendment. Rather, they can work with \nthe tools we can give for their children.\n  I thank my dear friend from Minnesota for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, Senators Specter \nand Harkin, are we to go until 12:30 p.m. and then break for the \ncaucuses; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I can in 4 minutes start to describe a little bit of \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent that when we come back from the \ncaucuses, my amendment be in order. I will not be able to do this in 4 \nminutes. Other colleagues have spoken.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I \nunderstand the Senator requested when we come back at 2:15 p.m. that he \nbe recognized to continue to speak on his amendment. The amendment has \nbeen laid down; is that correct?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I modify that unanimous consent request to ask unanimous \nconsent that when the Senator finishes speaking on his amendment, \nSenator Bingaman be allowed to then offer his amendment at this point \nin time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the sequencing suggested by the Senator \nfrom Iowa is fine. That will move the bill along. The Senator from \nMinnesota has laid down his amendment. We have a number of amendments \npending at the present time. Subject to the wishes of the majority \nleader, it is our hope to vote late this afternoon on a number of \namendments. That sequencing, as articulated by Senator Harkin, is fine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to both of my colleagues, I appreciate there are \na number of amendments. I will take time just to make sure colleagues \nknow what this amendment is about. I do not intend to take a long time \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President and colleagues--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--just for a little bit of context for this amendment, \nthis amendment deals with an increase in funding not to where we should \nbe but at least a step forward for the title I program.\n  When the HELP Committee authorized the title I program, we actually \nvoted to increase the authorization of title I to $15 billion. The \ninteresting thing is that every Democrat and every Republican on the \nHELP Committee supported this increase. Every Democrat and every \nRepublican supported the increase to authorize up to $15 billion.\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\n  As a matter of fact, during the floor debate on May 1, the majority \nleader himself, Senator Lott, said:\n\n       This is a $15 billion reauthorization bill. Good work has \n     been done by this committee.\n\n  We have a budget resolution that doesn't work. We are not able to \nadequately fund important priorities. Given the emphasis on tax cuts, \ngiven the significant allocation of money for the Pentagon, we have \nrobbed ourselves of our capacity to invest in children and in \neducation.\n  What this amendment does is essentially say that the appropriation \nwould go from $8.36 billion for title I up to $10 billion for title I. \nRight now, all we have in this appropriations bill is a $400 million \nincrease, when the HELP Committee authorized $15 billion. We are trying \nto bump up the appropriation so we can do better for our children.\n  What I was saying on the floor earlier is important: The title I \nprogram is one of the heart-and-soul Federal programs. This is targeted \nmoney that goes to primarily low- and moderate-income communities and \nlow- and moderate-income students. It is assistance for the schools and \nthe school districts for more reading instruction, for afterschool \nprograms, for prekindergarten programs, for more teaching assistance. \nIt is a very important program. The title I program has made a \ndifference, even as severely underfunded as it is.\n  One of the reasons I bring this amendment to the floor--I have \ncontinued, week after week, month after month, it seems year after \nyear, to come to the floor and talk about the need to provide more \nfunding for the title I program--is that right now this program is \nfunded, maybe, at the 30-35 percent level, so that 65 or 70 percent of \nthe children who could benefit don't benefit. These children come from \nprimarily low-income families. These are kids who have been severely \ndisadvantaged. We are trying to give these schools and the teachers \nand, most importantly, the children some additional help so they can do \nbetter.\n  In my State of Minnesota, for example, typically the situation is \nthat if a school has less than 65 percent of the students on a free or \nreduced school lunch program--say it is only 60 percent--there is no \nmoney for the school because we have run out of the money. We have run \nout of financial assistance.\n  The HELP Committee Democrats and Republicans are on record saying we \nought to authorize this to $15 billion. The majority leader came out \nand said: Authorize the $15 billion; good work. But we have a budget \nresolution that has so constrained the work of appropriators that we \nhave not made the investment in education. This is precisely the \nopposite direction of where Americans want us to go. People want more \ninvestment in education. Over 60 percent of the American people say \nthat we spend too little on education. The Federal share has gone from \n12 cents to 7 cents on the dollar.\n  The title I program is a flexible program that allows our school \ndistricts to use this money to provide help for these children so they \ncan do better. One hundred percent of major city schools use title I \nfunds to provide professional development and new technology, 76 \npercent of title I funding to support afterschool activities. Ninety \npercent of the school districts use title I funds to support family \nliteracy and summer school programs. Sixty-eight percent of the school \ndistricts use title I funds to support preschool programs. Again, if we \nlook at Rand Corporation studies and others, they tell us that even as \na vastly underfunded program, title I is making a difference.\n\n  In my own home State of Minnesota, the Brainerd public school \ndistrict, which is in greater Minnesota--that means outside the metro \narea--has a 70 to 80 percent success rate in accelerating students in \nthe bottom 20 percent of their class to at least average in their \nclasses following 1 year of title I-supported reading programs.\n  We are funding title I at only one-third the level of what is needed \nto help children in this country. Forty percent of America's fourth \ngraders are still reading below grade level. Forty-eight percent of \nstudents from high-income families will graduate from college; the \npercentage from low-income families who will graduate from college is 7 \npercent. At the very time that we know that a college education is the \nkey to economic success, more than at any other time in the history of \nour country during the years of our lives, only 7 percent of children \nfrom low-income families will graduate from college.\n  There are dramatic differences in terms of the resources of school \ndistricts. My friend Jonathan Kozol, who continues to write beautiful, \npowerful, and important books about children, sent me some figures from \nthe New York metropolitan area where in the city maybe it is $8,000 per \npupil per year that is spent, and in some of the suburbs it is as high \nas $23,000 per pupil. There are dramatic differences in terms of which \nschools are wired and which schools aren't; which schools have the \ntechnology, which schools don't; which schools can recruit teachers and \npay much better salaries, which schools can't; which schools have the \nsupport services for students, which schools don't; which schools have \nthe best textbooks and the best lab facilities and which schools do \nnot.\n  I will only say this one more time because it sounds so much like \npreaching, but this is the best point I can make as a Senator. It came \nfrom my visit to the South Bronx to the Mott Haven community about 2 \nweeks ago with Jonathan Kozol, meeting with the children at PS-30 and \nwith Ms. Rosa, the principal. My colleagues would love this woman. She \nwill not give up on these children.\n  I say to my colleagues, vote for this amendment for some additional \nhelp for title I which means additional help for these children, not \nbecause if you invest in these children when they are younger and give \nthem this help they are more likely to graduate from high school, that \nis true; not because if they graduate from high school they are less \nlikely to wind up in prison, that is true; not because if you invest in \nthese children and provide a little bit more help, say, for example, in \nreading, that they are more likely to graduate and more likely to be \nproductive and more likely to contribute to our economy, that is true. \nI am telling the Senate, this amendment deserves our support because \nthe vast majority of these children are all under 4 feet tall. They are \nall beautiful. They deserve our support, and we ought to be nice to \nthem. That is why we should vote for this.\n  I believe this is a theological, spiritual amendment. I do not \nunderstand how it can be that we are not investing more money in \neducation and children. I cannot understand why, when we have some \nproven programs that are so targeted and so helpful to vulnerable \nchildren in this country, they are so vastly underfunded. I do not \nunderstand our distorted priorities.\n  We seem to have plenty of money for tax cuts, even tax cuts for \nwealthy and high-income families. We have plenty of money for the \nPentagon. Fine. OK. But why can't we, when we are talking about \nsurpluses and about an economy that is booming, make more of an \ninvestment in programs that provide support for these children.\n  What about our national vow of equal opportunity for every child? I \ndon't get it. I don't get it any longer. I have been a Senator for \nalmost 10 years. I do not understand how it can be, when the polls show \nthat people want us to invest more in education, when we have record \neconomic performance and we are talking about surpluses and not \ndeficits, and when we all go to schools and we are with children--and \nwe all like to have our pictures taken with children--that we cannot \nmake more of an investment in these children?\n  I am not talking about a new program. I am not talking about a \nprogram that has not had a proven record of success. I am talking about \nthe title I program. I am talking about a program that is vastly \nunderfunded. I am just saying we ought to at least get the \nappropriation up to $10 billion.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time just to hear what my colleagues \nmight say in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 15 minutes. \nThe Senator from Minnesota has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me make a couple of points on title I \ngenerally. Title I is one of those programs which was conceived as an \nexcellent\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nidea and which has accomplished many things. Unfortunately, it hasn't \naccomplished one of its most critical goals.\n  When title I was originally created, the purpose was to get low-\nincome children into the educational system in schools which would have \nthe capacity to teach them and the ability to teach them at a level \nthat was equal with their peers. The concern was that many low-income \nchildren weren't getting fair treatment in the school system. That was \na good idea. Unfortunately, the way it has worked out over the last 35 \nyears, it has not proven to be such a great success. In the last 35 \nyears, we have spent $120 billion on title I, attempting to educate and \ngive a better chance in life to low-income kids. The problem, however, \nis that we have accomplished very little.\n  Most low-income kids today are not getting any better education than \nthey were getting 10 years ago, 20 years ago. Their academic \nachievement levels are actually stagnant or they have dropped. We have \nseen that instead of improving the academic capability of these \nchildren, we continue to send these children through school systems \nthat essentially end up passing them through the system and not giving \nthem the skills they need to compete in America, to take part in the \nAmerican dream.\n  The statistics are fairly staggering. I think I have some of them \nhere. Just off the top of my head--I believe I recall most of them--\nover 7,000 schools that have title I kids in them have been identified \nas failing--not by the Federal Government but by the school systems \nthemselves, generally. We know that in our schools where we have \nchildren who are under title I, low-income kids, those children are \nlearning at at least two grade levels less than their peers--in the \narea of math, for example. We know that children in the third and \nfourth grades who are low-income are consistently at least a grade or \ntwo grades behind their peers. We know that low-income fourth graders \nare simply not able to compete with other fourth graders who are not \nlow-income. We know that in our high schools we are seeing the child \nwho has been a low-income child, who is qualified for title I dollars, \nwho has gone through the system--it turns out that their skills are \nright at the bottom of their classes in many cases and as a matter of \naverage. The achievement gap really has been dramatic. Yet we have \nspent all this money to try to improve their achievement.\n\n  So we as Republicans, in the markup of the title I bill this year, \nthe ESEA bill, attempted to try to address the problem. We put forward \na whole series of ideas, the purpose of which was to improve the \nacademic achievement of the low-income child. Instead of warehousing \nthese children and moving them through the system, we would actually \nexpect and demand that for these Federal dollars we received results.\n  One of the suggestions we made was called Straight A's, where we said \nto the local school districts: Your results on low-income kids hasn't \nbeen that good; maybe it is because the programs are too categorical. \nWe will let you merge them and put them into a flexible program. But if \nyou take the money under this scenario, you have to prove there has \nbeen academic achievement by low-income kids; that the gap between low-\nincome kids and kids who are not low-income is closing--not by reducing \nthe abilities of the higher income kids or the average children in the \nschool system but by actually improving the capability of the low-\nincome child.\n  Another suggestion we made was called portability, where we said that \nthe low-income child in a failing school should not have to stay in \nthat school; They should be able to move to another public school \nsystem, and the dollars that are allocated for the purpose of trying to \nhelp that child out should follow the child to the different school. \nThat is called portability.\n  The reason we suggested that is that the present title I program is \nstructured so the money goes to the administrators and the schools; it \ndoesn't go to the kids. In fact, in cities such as Philadelphia, if you \naren't in a school where 70 percent of the kids are low income, you get \nno dollars from title I. So maybe if you have a low-income child \nattending a school where, say, 50 percent of the kids are low income, \nthat school will get no title I money. That is true in a lot of \ndifferent cities across this country. In fact, there is a threshold of \n35 percent, I think, where, if you are in a school with only 35 percent \nlow-income kids, that school absolutely gets no money. Other cities \nhave adjusted that. In Philadelphia, as I said, it is up to 70 percent.\n  The practical effect, under the law as presently structured, is that \na lot of the dollars that should be going to children are not going to \nthem. A lot of the low-income kids who should be getting assistance \ndollars for tutorial help or special needs help are not getting them; \nthose dollars don't flow to that child. So we end up with a system \nwhere the dollars flow to the school and the administrators but not to \nthe children.\n\n  We suggested that we actually have the dollars go with the child, and \nif the child goes from school to school--or if they decide to do so and \ntheir parents want to get involved and make that decision--let the \ndollars that are supposed to support the child also go from school to \nschool.\n  We have put forward a whole lot of ideas. Those are only some of \nthem. We also have something called ``choice'' for public schools, \nwhere parents will be able to move their children from school to \nschool. We have the Teacher Empowerment Act, which affects the title I \nkids, which comes out of the ESEA bill, to try to improve teacher \ncapability. We have a whole set of ideas to make title I work better. \nThat is the bottom line.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota has suggested is that in a program \nthat has already spent $120 billion over 30 years and has produced \nnegative results in the area of academic achievement for children, it \nshould today arbitrarily get an additional $10 billion. In this bill, \nwe already increase that funding significantly. But this $10 billion \nshould be on top of what is already in title I.\n  Unfortunately, what would happen is the same thing that has happened \nto the $120 billion. It would end up being spent and going to \nbureaucracy and going into school systems. It would not necessarily end \nup giving children a better education--especially low-income children--\nbecause we have already proven fairly definitively that the present \nsystem isn't doing that.\n  So rather than breaking the budget by adding $10 billion which is not \noffset--and it is subject to a budget point of order, by the way--what \nwe should do is reform title I and reform the ESEA bill. We tried to do \nthat. We brought the bill to the floor, and, unfortunately, a number of \nSenators wanted to put extraneous matter on it, and, as a result, it \ngot all balled up and wasn't able to be moved. But the point here is \nthat until we get fundamental reform of title I and until we get \nfundamental reform under the new ESEA authorization, putting another \n$10 billion into this system is not going to help.\n\n  Therefore, I oppose this, first, on the budgetary grounds that it is \nnot offset and therefore is a $10 billion increase that has no way to \nbe paid for; second, on the grounds that it probably won't accomplish \nwhat the sponsor would like to accomplish, which is to improve the \nachievement of low-income kids.\n  Until we require that low-income kids' academic achievement goes up \nfor the dollars we are spending on them and put in place systems that \nare going to give the local school districts the capacity of \naccomplishing that and to give them the flexibility of Straight A's, or \nportability, or the parents the chance to participate through public \nschool choice, there is really no point in making this type of huge \nincrease in funding in this program--especially on top of the fact that \nthis committee has already significantly increased funding for this \nprogram in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from New Hampshire \nand all Senators understand this point clearly. This amendment does not \ncall for an additional $10 billion in appropriations. This amendment \njust simply says we should go from $8.36 billion to $10 billion--a \nslight increase. It is not an additional $10 billion.\n  Second, my colleague from New Hampshire and every Republican Senator \nand every Democratic Senator on the health committee voted to authorize \ntitle I to $15 billion.\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\n  Can I repeat that?\n  Every single Member of the health committee--Democrat and Republican \nalike--voted to authorize title I to $15 billion, and the majority \nleader came out here on the floor and said:\n\n       This is a $15 billion reauthorization bill; Good work has \n     been done by this committee.\n\n  If my colleague thought that the title I program was such a miserable \nfailure--and I intend to certainly take that argument on in a moment \nsince I don't think there is a shred of evidence to support it--then I \ndon't understand why my colleague and all the Republicans on the health \ncommittee and the majority leader said that they supported an \nauthorization up to $15 billion. This amendment just tries to get it \nfrom $8.36 billion up to $10 billion.\n  Third, in regard to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I \nsure would like for you folks to bring that bill out to the floor. I \nhave been waiting for my Republican colleagues to bring the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act to the floor. I have a lot of amendments. I \nam ready for the debate on education. You pulled the bill from the \nfloor, and I would love it if you would bring it back.\n\n  My colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, talks about how the \ntitle I program has been such a miserable failure. The largest gains in \ntest scores over the past 30 years have been made by poor and minority \nstudents. One-third to one-half of the gap between affluent whites and \ntheir poor and minority counterparts closed during this time. The \nCenter on Education Policy 2000 report, a study by the Rand \nCorporation, linked these gains to title I and other investments in \neducation and social programs. The final report of the National \nAssessment of Title I by the U.S. Department of Education showed that \nnational assessment of education progress scores for 9-year-olds in the \nNation's highest poverty schools have increased over the past 10 years \nby nine points in reading and eight points in math.\n  The Council of Greater City Schools shows that 24 of the Nation's \nlargest schools were able to decrease the number of fourth grade title \nI students achieving in the lowest percentile by 14 percent in reading, \nand 10 percent in math.\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire that is pretty remarkable, \ngiven the fact we don't even fund this program except at a 30-percent \nlevel. We severely underfund the program. We make hardly any \ninvestments in pre-K education.\n  The Federal Government and the Senate ought to be a player in getting \nmoney to the local communities so we can have not custodial but \ndevelopment child care--so that when children come to kindergarten they \nare not so far behind.\n  We don't make that investment.\n  We don't make the investment in health coverage. We still have \nmillions of children without health care coverage. When they come to \nschool with abscessed teeth, they cannot learn. Is it any wonder? They \nlive in communities where their parents can't afford housing, and they \nhave to move three, four, or five times a year because we don't make \nthe investment in affordable housing.\n  My colleagues, in the face of our failure to do anything about the \ngrinding poverty in the country, in the face of our failure to invest \nin the title I program, in the face of our miserable failure to invest \nin education, my colleague from New Hampshire comes out here and says \nthis has been a miserable failure when I can cite reports showing that \ntitle I has made a real difference.\n  Colleagues, 46 percent of title I funds go to the poorest 15 percent \nof all schools in America.\n  When the Senator from New Hampshire says--and I agree with him--that \nit is just outrageous if a school has a 60-percent low-income \npopulation and there may be no money, this is why: Because it is so \nseverely underfunded.\n  We have one group of low-income children in a zero sum game \nrelationship to another group of low-income children.\n  It is severely underfunded. Seventy-five percent of title I funds go \nto schools where the majority of children are poor. The General \nAccounting Office estimates that title I has increased funding to \nschools serving poor children by 77 percent. It is going up.\n  This is a targeted investment that can make a huge difference. Yet \neven with the increases, we are only reaching one-third of the children \nwho could use our help.\n  By the way, I would like to say this to every Senator before you vote \non this amendment. If your staff is looking at this debate, and they \nare going to be reporting back to you on how to vote, I will tell you: \nGo back to your States and meet with the educators. Talk to people in \nyour school districts. They will tell you they need more money for the \ntitle I program. They will tell you they are interested in a whole \nrange of issues. Senator Bingaman is going to be talking about some of \nthose.\n\n  Again, just looking at where the money goes, 100 percent of the city \nschools use title I funds to provide professional development and new \ntechnology. Does that sound like a flawed program? Ninety-seven percent \nuse title I funds to support afterschool activities. Does that sound \nlike a mistake? Ninety percent of the school districts use title I \nfunds to support family literacy and summer school programs. Do you \nwant to vote against that? Sixty-eight percent use title I funds to \nsupport preschool programs. Do you want to vote against that?\n  The title I program has been a remarkably good program given the \nrealities of these children's lives.\n  I didn't quite add it up. But I think what my colleague from New \nHampshire was saying is we spent $4 billion a year, or thereabouts, for \ntitle I programs over the last 30 years. I say to the Senator that is \nnot a bad investment. The largest group of poor citizens in the United \nStates of America are poor children. There are 14 million poor children \nin America today. Twenty percent of all the children in our country are \ngrowing up poor today. Fifty percent of those children are children of \ncolor. I don't think it is too much to provide a little bit more help \nfor these children.\n  When you go to these schools, you meet people who do not give up. You \nmeet principals and teachers who do not give up on these kids. You \nwonder how they do it. But they are so dedicated. And the largest part \nof title I money goes to the children of the youngest ages.\n  I will repeat what I said before. Make the investment and provide the \nadditional help for these children because they are small. They are \nlittle. Most of them are under 4 feet tall. They are beautiful. We \nought to help them.\n\n  I rest my case, although I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Minnesota has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has made a \ncouple of points to which I think I need to respond. First, the reason \nthe authorization bill is not on the floor is because Senators from the \nother side decided to put a political agenda on that bill. The \nunanimous consents which were requested by the majority leader to limit \nthe number of amendments to that bill and make them education \namendments and thus complete that bill were rejected by the other side.\n  Second, yes, we strongly supported increasing funding for title I, if \nit was reauthorized under a bill which was student centered. The \nproblem with the present law is it is not student centered. It is \nbureaucracy centered.\n  I am not surprised the other side of the aisle is defending the \nbureaucracy-centered bill. It was their idea in the first place. Our \nposition is we should look for academic achievement. We should not \nleave these children behind. The Senator says these are poor children. \nYes, they are poor children. Regretably, they are poor children caught \nin the cycle of poverty for generation after generation because their \neducational system has failed them for generation after generation, \neven though we spent $120 billion on title I. Child after child has \ncome out of the system unable to compete with their peers because their \nacademic achievement has been so low.\n  What we suggest is a proposal which is child centered, which is \nflexible, which is targeted on academic achievement, and which has \naccountability standards which will work so these children are not left \nbehind.\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\n  The Senator on the other side of the aisle makes the argument these \nchildren are being left behind not only because they are educationally \nunderfunded but because they have all sorts of other concerns. Yes, \nthere is no question about that. But when we look at school systems \nthat work, because they demand achievement from the children they are \nserving, the same children, then we know success in this area is \npossible. We can look at our Catholic school systems in which the same \npopulation is served. Yet they accomplish good things with those \nstudents' academic achievement.\n  The statement there has been a great increase in academic achievement \namong low-income kids is simply not accurate. What has happened is the \nacademic achievement of low-income kids has finally gotten back to the \nlevel it was in 1992. From the period 1992 to 1998, the gap in academic \nachievement between African American and white students actually grew. \nThe same was the case for Hispanic students and white students; it \nactually grew in a number of the most critical States that have a large \npopulation of African American and Spanish students.\n  The simple fact is, we have not been serving these kids effectively. \nWe do not have a program that serves these kids effectively.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is right on one count. It is not $10 \nbillion he is proposing this year, but over a 5-year budget it would \nadd up to approximately $10 billion. I stand corrected.\n  I join the Senator from Minnesota. If he is willing to put forward a \nprogram that is child centered, dedicated to academic achievement, \ngiving the local schools accountability and flexibility, then we should \ntalk about dramatic increases in funding because we would get something \nfor the dollars that would be effectively used. But to simply put more \nmoney in here on top of money that has been already increased outside \nthe budget priorities which we have already set--and remember there are \nother major budget priorities in this bill that have been paid for, \nsuch as special needs, special ed kids--it is just not appropriate. \nThat is why I oppose this amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his remarks. I \nalways enjoy discussions with him on education. I don't want to try to \nscore debate points. I cannot resist, though, saying to my colleague, \non the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, when he says that we \npulled the bill because the minority wanted to impose a political \nagenda, it is interesting; a political agenda means the minority wanted \nto put some amendments on this bill that they, the majority, didn't \nwant to have to vote on; therefore, it becomes a political agenda.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield, if the Senator will be \nbrief. I will yield on my time because I know he has no time. But I \nwant to reserve a little time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wonder if the Senator believes campaign finance and gun \nissues, which are not relevant to schools, are issues which we should \nhave been debating on the ESEA bill or should we hold them for another \nagenda?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New \nHampshire, first of all, the campaign finance reform amendment of \ncourse was initiated by Senator McCain, a well-known Republican, and \nSenator Feingold, a well-known Democrat. I support the amendment. Do \nyou want to know something. The more I think about it, the more I think \nit is very relevant to education, because I think if we don't clean up \nthis sick system, the way in which big money dominates, then we are \nnever going to have Senators voting for children and education. They \nare going to continue to vote for the big, huge, economic interests. So \nI say, actually I can't think of a more important amendment to an \neducation bill.\n  This is the debate we have been having. The Senate, over the years, \nhas been a very special institution. Part of it is because of the \nSenators' right to debate and the Senators' right to introduce \namendments. That is what the Senate is about. It is not a political \nagenda, I say to my colleague. It is just an agenda that makes my \ncolleague from New Hampshire and other Republicans uncomfortable. They \ndon't want to vote on campaign finance reform or sensible gun control \nmeasures. I would argue, in case anybody has taken a look at violence \nin the schools, that sensible gun control amendments are very relevant \nto the lives of children, very relevant to education.\n  As to the title I program, I want to respond to my colleague's \ncomments about the achievement of low-income children. Honest to \ngoodness, first my colleague came out and said it has been a miserable \nfailure; it hasn't work. Then I cited study after study showing title I \nhas made a difference. Then my colleague retreats and comes back with \nanother argument which is: Well, yes, low-income children are now doing \nbetter in some of the reading scores and mathematics scores, but they \nare only getting back to the 1993 level.\n  The truth is, here you have a title I program that is vastly \nunderfunded--30-percent level. Here you have a House of Representatives \nand Senate, too dominated by the way in which money dominates politics, \nthat have been unwilling to make the investment in children, unwilling \nto make the investment in their skills and intellect and character and, \nI argue, the health of children, and therefore there are too many poor \nchildren. I think it is a scandal that the poorest group of citizens in \nAmerica today is children. Too many children literally grow up under \nthe most difficult circumstances. Therefore, is anybody surprised the \ntitle I program does not perform a miracle?\n\n  The title I program does not mean those children succeed, I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, who come from poor communities, whose parents are \nnot high income, who had none of the encouragement, none of the great \npreschool programs other children have, who live in families who have \nto move four times because they cannot afford the housing, who live in \nneighborhoods where there is too much violence, who don't have an \nadequate diet, who don't have adequate health care. Guess what, those \nchildren don't yet do as well in reading scores and mathematics scores. \nAnd you want to pin that on the title I program, even though the title \nI program has helped them do a little better?\n  If any Senator wants to vote against this amendment on the basis of \nthat kind of argument, so be it. But I certainly hope you will not.\n  Finally, I get a little nervous with all this discussion about \naccountability and achievement because I think my good friend from New \nHampshire has the causality backwards. He is putting the cart before \nthe horse. Absolutely, let's put the focus on achievement. Let's put \nthe focus on accountability. But this is my question. Don't you think, \nat the same time that we put the focus on the achievement, and the same \ntime we put the focus on the accountability, we also need to make sure \nevery child has the same opportunity to achieve? Why is it my \ncolleagues are so silent on that point? They want to rush to vouchers, \nthey want to rush to privatizing education, they want to rush to saying \nall these children have to achieve and we are going to hold everybody \naccountable if your children don't achieve. But they don't want to make \nsure every child has the same opportunity to achieve.\n  Let's not hold our children responsible for our failure to invest in \ntheir achievement and their future. This title I program is but one \nsmall program that doesn't lead to heaven on Earth, but makes it a \nlittle bit better Earth on Earth for some of these children.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think we ought to vote for this amendment. \nI think we ought to do better by these children. This amendment, in its \nown small way, just going from $8.3 billion to $10 billion, not even \nclose to the $50 billion that the HELP Committee unanimously voted to \nauthorize appropriations up to, at least makes a bit of a difference.\n  Your school districts are for this, your principals and teachers in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\ntrenches are for this, and most importantly, we ought to provide these \nchildren with some additional help. They deserve it.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Hampshire has \n1 minute remaining. The Senator from Minnesota has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the Senator from New Hampshire 30 seconds of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is very generous of the Senator from Minnesota. I \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the Senator from Iowa 1 minute of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, did I understand the Senator from Minnesota \nto say he would be willing, if I were to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that we go to the ESEA bill with 5 amendments on both sides, \nthat the amendments be relevant, and we have final passage--the Senator \nwould agree to that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is an easy question.\n  Mr. REID. Was this a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. I was asking if he was agreeing that would be an \nacceptable approach.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My answer would certainly be no, since I talked about \nwhat the Senate was about and talked about those other amendments are \nterribly important amendments that affect the lives of children.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply state the reason we do not have the authorization \nlevels we should have on the ESEA is that we have not passed ESEA, and \nthe reason we have not passed ESEA is that we have been unable to \ndebate on this floor the issue of education. We have had debate on the \nissue of campaign finance, on the issue of guns, on the issue of \nprescription drugs, but not on the issue of education, which is too \nbad, because the bill out of committee was a good bill and, by the way, \nit did not demand the States do anything. It set up a set of options \nfor the States which the States could then follow. They could choose to \nuse portability, they could choose to use Straight A's or they could \nchoose the present law. It gave the States total flexibility. The goal \nwas to get the academic achievement of low-income kids up. That should \nbe our goal as a Senate, and that was our goal when we reported out the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 2\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me a \nlittle bit of time. I appreciate what the Senator from Minnesota said a \nwhile ago. He is absolutely right. We are blaming these kids.\n  Title I: Do my colleagues know how much each kid gets from title I? \nSomewhere between $400 and $600 a year. Go to the best schools in \nAmerica in high-income areas where they have nice houses and high \nincomes. Do my colleagues know what they are spending on kids there? \nSix to eight thousand dollars. Yet we are going to put $400 to $600 \ninto some of the kids who have the poorest lives.\n  As the Senator said, they move around a lot. They have been denied \nthe opportunity since they have been born, and we expect all these \ngreat results from $400 to $600 per student.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire wants to propose we spend $6,000 on \neach one of those poor kids, then maybe we will see them start to \nadvance more rapidly, but on $400 to $600 we are not going to do it. \nThe Senator's amendment would only get that up just a little bit more. \nWe are still way behind in what we ought to be doing in this country to \nhelp low-income students attain the same opportunity in education as \nkids from better, higher income areas are getting. The Senator from \nMinnesota is right on with this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. This abundance of generosity has carried me away. I yield \nmy time back if the Senator wishes to yield his time back, even the \nadditional time the Senator has yielded.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG. I raise a point of order against the pending Wellstone \namendment No. 3631 in that it violates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to waive the Budget Act and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to this motion occur at 5 p.m. and that there be 4 minutes \nequally divided for explanation prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to table the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire moves--\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to make sure we understand what is \nhappening here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator raising an objection?\n  Mr. REID. There is nothing pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. He asked unanimous consent to set the amendment aside.\n  Mr. REID. I do not object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be set aside.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. The Senator from New \nHampshire asked to set the amendment aside, and the time was set for a \nvote.\n  Mr. GREGG. On the motion to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. REID. He did not make his offer to table; is that right?\n  Mr. GREGG. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. We are soon going to proceed with an amendment by the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands the \nchallenge made by the Senator from New Hampshire. We, the minority, are \nwilling to take that at any time. There was an education bill on the \nfloor that we did not have anything to do with pulling. We are willing \nto start debating the education bill 10 minutes from now, 10 days from \nnow. We have a lot of things about which we want to talk regarding \neducation.\n  The Senator says there is something keeping this education bill from \ngoing forward. It is not our fault. We are willing to spend whatever \ntime is necessary to complete debate on the education bill that was \nbefore this body for a short time earlier this year. We want to debate \nthe education issue.\n  For people to say it got pulled because we wanted to talk about \ncampaign finance reform, you bet we do. We still want to talk about \ncampaign finance reform. But we want to talk about education issues \nalso. The fact that we have an education bill on the floor does not \nmean we cannot talk about other issues. We would be willing to have the \neducation bill come back, and we have a lot of education issues we \nwould bring up immediately.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, did the unanimous consent request get \napproved and was the amendment laid aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both unanimous consent requests have been \napproved. The amendment was laid aside, and the vote is scheduled for 5 \no'clock.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may engage the assistant leader from Nevada in a \ncolloquy, I am interested in knowing\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\nwhether the assistant leader would agree to a unanimous consent request \nthat would bring back the ESEA bill as reported out of committee with \nfive relevant amendments on both sides, with a vote on final passage. \nIf the Senator is agreeable to that, I am willing to walk down the \nhallway and probably get it signed onto by the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is interesting, I say to my friend from \nNew Hampshire. We are in the Senate. My friend from New Hampshire has \nhad wide experience in government. He served in the House of \nRepresentatives. We had the pleasure of serving together. He was \nGovernor of the State of New Hampshire and has been a Senator for many \nyears. He understands what the Senate is about as well as anybody in \nthis Chamber. That is, we have had rules which have engaged this Senate \nfor over 200 years, and they have worked well. We are the envy of the \nworld, how our legislative body has worked for more than 200 years.\n  What I am saying to my friend from New Hampshire is, yes, we are \nwilling to bring the education bill back today, tomorrow, any other \ntime, but we do not need these self-imposed constraints. We are not the \nHouse of Representatives. We are the Senate. We have the ability to \namend bills that come before this body. Had we been allowed the \nopportunity to treat the elementary and secondary education bill as \nlegislation has been treated for two centuries in this body, we would \nhave been long since completed with that and would have been on to \nother issues.\n  No one should think we are afraid to debate education issues. We have \na lot of education issues to debate. The Senator from New Mexico and I \nhave worked for 3 years on high school dropouts. I am not proud of the \nfact that the State of Nevada leads the Nation in high school dropouts. \nWe lead the Nation. But we are not the only State that has a problem. \nEvery State in this Union has a problem with high school dropouts.\n  In the United States, 3,000 children drop out of high school every \nday; 500,000 a year. I want to talk on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act about what we can do to keep kids in school.\n  The Senator from New Mexico will have an amendment that passed the \nSenate 3 years ago. Last year, on a strictly partisan vote, our \namendment was killed in the Senate. Democrats voted for it. Republicans \nvoted against our dropout amendment. It is really ``radical.'' I am \nsaying that facetiously. What it would do is create, in the Department \nof Education, a dropout czar, someone who could look at programs that \nare working around the country and have challenge grants in various \nStates, if they were interested in the program. We would not jam \nanything down anyone's throat. A simple program such as that was \ndefeated.\n  We would be happy to ask unanimous consent--as Senator Daschle has \ndone on other occasions--to resume consideration of the elementary and \nsecondary education bill, and that following the two amendments \npreviously ordered, the Senate consider the following first-degree \namendments, subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that they \nmay be considered in an alternating fashion as the sponsors become \navailable, and that they all be limited to 1 hour each equally divided \nin the usual form----\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection----\n  Mr. REID. I have not propounded my request yet, Mr. President.\n  We would have Senator Santorum offer an amendment dealing with IDEA \nfunding; Senator Bingaman, one on accountability; Senator Hutchison, \none on same-sex schools; Senator Dodd, afterschool programs; Senator \nGregg, afterschool programs; Senator Harkin, school modernization; \nSenator Voinovich, IDEA funding; Senator Mikulski, dealing with \ntechnology; Senator Stevens, physical education; Senator Wellstone, \neducational testing; Senator Grams, educational testing; Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island, dealing with parents; Senator Kyl, bilingual \neducation; Senator Lautenberg, school safety, dealing with guns. We \nwould be willing to do this right now. It would take about 10 or 12 \nhours. And I say----\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. There are Republicans and Democrats on this list. We would \ndo it in alternating fashion. They believe strongly in their education \nissues. We believe strongly in our education issues.\n  I say that is what we should do. That would bring the education issue \nto the forefront of this body, as it should have been brought to the \nforefront of this body a long time ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire\n  Mr. GREGG. If we are going to propound unanimous-consent requests, I \npropound a unanimous consent request as follows: That we proceed to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, as reported out of the HELP \nCommittee, at such time as the leader shall determine is appropriate, \nin consultation with the Democratic leader; that both sides be allowed \nto offer, I will make it seven amendments to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act; that the amendments shall be relevant, and \nthat there shall be a vote on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well now, the Senator from New Hampshire said that he \nwanted a unanimous-consent request that we would go to ESEA, at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader----\n\n  Mr. GREGG. In consultation----\n  Mr. HARKIN. In consultation with the minority leader.\n  Well, we have asked the majority leader. The minority leader has \npropounded this unanimous consent request in the past. We are not \nrunning the floor. The Republicans are running the floor, not the \nDemocrats.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is debate appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire, having \npropounded the unanimous consent request, has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is the Republican side that is running the floor that \nschedules the bills, not the Democrats.\n  My friend from New Hampshire just said he would be willing to have \nseven amendments on either side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Relevant.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Oh, relevant amendments. See, there you go.\n  The last ESEA bill we had up was 4 years ago. We had amendments \noffered on the Republican side that were not relevant. We didn't say \nanything. We debated them. We debated them and we voted on them. Oh, \nbut now they don't want to do that. The Republicans say: It has to be \nrelevant. And they will preclude us from offering amendments on that \nbill that are relevant--maybe not to education but relevant to what is \nhappening in America today. Yet they do not want to do that.\n  We would agree to time limits. Senator Daschle has here: 1 hour each, \nequally divided. That is 14 hours. In 14 hours, we could be done with \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be willing to agree to time limits also: 1 hour on \neach relevant amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. All amendments that are offered here, seven on each side?\n  Mr. GREGG. In my unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. To these seven amendments?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my unanimous-consent request to which I am agreeing. \nYou already have that in your request. I was just trying to be \naccommodating to your time constraints.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You can have whatever seven you want, and we will take \nour seven amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as they are relevant.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reclaim my time. The Senator says: Relevant.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to debate education, not national policy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. One of the amendments, the Senator is aware, the Lautenberg \namendment, deals with gun safety.\n  Are you aware there are precedents for gun control amendments to \neducation bills? In fact, is the Senator aware that in 1994, Senator \nGramm of Texas offered an amendment on mandatory sentences for \ncriminals who use guns, and it was put to a vote on the education bill \nthat year?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, doesn't it seem logical and sensible to \nthe Senator from Iowa that with all the deaths in schools related to \nguns, on an education bill we should have a conversation about gun \nsafety in schools?\n  Mr. HARKIN. To this Senator, it makes eminently good sense. We are \ntalking about education and safety in education. Senator Lautenberg has \nan amendment on gun safety. That is what the Republicans do not want to \nvote on. Yet the Senator from New Hampshire said: Relevant amendments. \nI am looking at the list of amendments we have. They all deal with \neducation in one form or another.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then the Senator should have no objection to my offer.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator from New Hampshire would agree that school \nsafety and guns is a relevant amendment, we can make an agreement right \nnow. Will the Senator agree to that?\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not make that ruling. It would be up to the \nParliamentarian to determine what a relevant amendment is.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. A unanimous consent that the Lautenberg amendment is \nrelevant.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will not make that decision. The offer is very \nreasonable. We are willing to debate relevant amendments on education. \nThere are a lot of relevant amendments on education that deal with \nguns. All you have to do is make it relevant and you can involve a gun \nissue. There is no question, for example, if you want to offer an \namendment that deals with using title I money for the purposes of \nallowing people to put in some sort of screening system for going into \na school relative to guns, that is a very relevant amendment, I would \npresume. But I am not the one who makes that decision. The \nParliamentarian makes the decision.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. But a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am perfectly willing to make an adjustment, to give you \na timeframe, so we can have a timeframe on the debate. We can have \nrelevant amendments, 1 hour on each amendment. I have gone up to seven \namendments now because the Senator from Nevada made a good case that we \nmight not have gotten the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico into \nthe mix. So that is seven amendments on each side and a vote on final \npassage--that is 14 hours--we vote on final passage, leaving it to the \nmajority leader to call the issue to the floor. I think we could have a \ndeal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I find it interesting, my friend from New \nHampshire making this argument. Four years ago, when the Senator from \nTexas offered a gun amendment on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, I didn't hear a peep from my friend from New Hampshire, not a \nword. But now, when we want to address the issue of school violence and \nguns, the Senator from New Hampshire says: Oh, well, now we can't \ndiscuss that. It is not relevant.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire knows, as well as I do, there is no \nrule in the Senate that demands relevancy. That is the House. That is \nwhy we are the great deliberative body that we are. We can debate and \ndiscuss things. If the Senator wants to go back to the House, where \nthey have a Rules Committee, and they only discuss issues that the \nRules Committee says are relevant--that is the House of \nRepresentatives. This is the Senate. We do not have such a rule. Thank \nGod we do not because it allows us, as Senators, to have the kind of \nopen and free debate and discussion that I think distinguishes the \nSenate from the House of Representatives. That allows us a time to cool \nthings down, as Thomas Jefferson said.\n  We are willing to bring up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand agree to a time limit. We could be done in 1 day. But the \nRepublicans do not want to vote on the gun issue.\n  They don't want to have to belly up to the bar and vote to keep guns \nout of the hands of kids. They don't want to have that amendment. \nTherefore, all of the rest of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct is held hostage by the refusal on the Republican side to allow even \n1 hour of debate and an up-or-down vote on the Lautenberg amendment. \nThat is the essence of it right now. As my friend from Nevada said, we \nare willing to go to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act right \nnow with a time limit, debate them, vote them up or down. It is the \nother side that won't let that happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know there are other things to do, but \nthere is nothing more important to the American people--I know there is \nnothing more important to the people of the State of Nevada--than to do \nsomething about education. The Senator from Iowa talked about guns. Of \ncourse, they don't want to debate that issue, even though we did more \nthan a year ago. Remember the clamor here that we had to do something \nas a result of the Columbine killings. Then we had a series of killings \nby guns in schools. We just recently had one in Florida where a boy was \nsent home because he was dropping water balloons. He came back and \nkilled the teacher. There was no safety lock on that gun. It was laying \naround. Some felon had it. I don't know who had it. Anyway, the kid was \nable to get it.\n  The majority's argument is simply a smokescreen. Of course, they \ndon't want to talk about gun safety. They also don't want to vote on \nother priority issues such as modernizing schools. The average school \nin America is almost 50 years old. In Nevada, because we have to build \none new school a month, we also need some help building schools, \nrenovating schools. We have a tremendously difficult problem. People \nthink of Nevada as the most rural place in America. It is the most \nurban place in America. Over 90 percent of the people live in two \ncommunities: Reno and Las Vegas. We have the seventh largest school \ndistrict in America, with over 230,000 students. We need some help. The \nmajority does not want to modernize the schools.\n  Wouldn't it be great if we could do something about afterschool \nprograms? That is where kids get in trouble, latchkey children, without \nsufficient supervision. We have amendments, some of which were read by \nthe Senator and I, that deal with afterschool programs. We want to do \nsomething about having not only more teachers but better teachers. That \nis what we want to consider. That is why we want to talk about \neducation.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is shortly going to offer an amendment \ndealing with quality education. If not now, he will do it later. I know \nit is something he has talked about. Yes, Senator Lautenberg wants to \noffer an amendment joined by numerous others. He is the lead sponsor to \ndeal with safety in schools, more accountability. If the majority \ndoesn't think that guns in schools and school safety are priorities for \nthe American people, then they have not been reading the papers. They \nhave not been reading their own mail that comes from home. These are \nimportant issues.\n  All we are asking is that the pending business, Order No. 491, a bill \nto extend programs and activities under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, be the order of the day; that it be called off the \ncalendar and we get back to working on it. It is the pending business \nright now. It is here in the Senate calendar of business. We should get \nback to that. We offered strict time agreements on all amendments, and \nthen we get the retort from our friend from New Hampshire: Relevant, \nrelevant.\n\n  We know what happens here. We know who controls what goes on. It is \nthe majority. If they don't want something, it is not relevant. We are \nadults. We know how things work around here. We give them the title of \nthe amendments; we tell them what they are about. We limit the time on \nthem. I don't know what we could do that would be more fair and would \nallow this agenda to move along.\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\n  We want the opportunity to vote. We don't want the opportunity to \ndebate for more than a half hour. A half hour is all we get. We feel \nvery confident that our priorities are the needs of the majority of the \npeople of this country. We are not afraid to vote on them.\n  The real reason the majority doesn't want to vote on these proposals \nis because we are going to win. People over there are going to vote \nwith us. We are going to win. There are only 45 of us. We know we can't \nwin unless we get support from the majority. We will get support from \nthe majority. This is a procedural effort to block the education agenda \nof the minority from going forward. It is too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this ad nauseam \nbecause it is sort of an internal debate. I know the Senator from New \nMexico has an amendment he wants to offer.\n  I will make a couple of points in response to the Senator from \nNevada, who always eloquently presents the minority's position.\n  The fact is, all the amendments he talked about in the area of \neducation are amendments which we are perfectly willing to get into. We \ngot into them in committee, and we are happy to get into them on the \nfloor. I suspect they would have no problem being found as relevant--\nschool construction, afterschool programs, safe schools. In fact, we \nhave done a great deal in the area of all of these accounts. On the \nSafe Schools Program, aftershool programs, we have increased funding \ndramatically in both those proposals.\n  We have brought forward an ESEA bill in a creative and imaginative \nway. I think it is being held because there are amendments people want \nto put on it which they know will cause it to not go any further than \nthis body because the bill has so many imaginative and creative ideas \nin it which the Federal bureaucracy and the educational bureaucracy do \nnot like because they return power to the States, power to parents, \npower to children, power to principals. They just don't like the fact \nthat this bill is coming up for a vote with a whole cafeteria of ideas \nthat threaten the present educational lobby here in Washington. \nTherefore, they have decided to gum it up with a bunch of amendments \nthat have no relevance at all.\n  ``Relevant'' is an important term for the education issue. The \neducation debate should be on education. There are a lot of gun issues \nwhich are education related. We are perfectly happy to take those as \nrelevant. But there are some that are not, and they know that. That is \nwhy they are throwing it on this bill, because they know it will stop \nthe bill on the floor. They can use that as an excuse for stopping the \nbill rather than being the actual reason the bill is being stopped.\n\n  As to gun amendments, we have voted on those enumerable times in this \nbody. We have had amendments relative to abortion clinics, relative to \ngun-related debt. We have had them relative to gun violence crime \nprotection, safe school new Federal restrictions on firearms, on \neducation and violence protection. There have been votes on these. The \nlist goes on and on. There have been gun amendments all through the \nprocess. There are gun amendments that can be made relevant. I would \npresume if they wanted to include those seven that I suggested, it \nwould be easy enough to do it.\n  I do think that the defense that they don't want relevant amendments, \nthat they want to have the freedom to throw whatever amendment they \nwant on this bill, is a puerile defense. ``Puerile'' is the wrong word. \nIt is a sophomoric defense because basically what they are interested \nin is not having the ESEA bill come through this House in its present \nform because it is not a form that they liked when it was reported out \nof committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We had seven amendments. That was all that was on the \nlist.\n  Mr. GREGG. All I am interested in is seven relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, does the Senator from New Hampshire \nretain the floor or is it open?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the recognition of the \nSenator from New Mexico to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3649\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure accountability in programs for disadvantaged \n students and to assist States in their efforts to turn around failing \n                                schools)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3649.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 57, line 19, after ``year'' insert the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That in addition to any other funds \n     appropriated under this title, there are appropriated, under \n     the authority of section 1002(f) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, $250,000,000 to carry out \n     sections 1116 and 1117 of such Act''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have indicated to the majority that I \nwould take a half hour to discuss the amendment on our side. I know \nSenator Reed also wishes to speak about the amendment, and perhaps \nothers.\n  If the Republican side will take the same limited amount of time, I \nbelieve that is the arrangement.\n  This is an amendment to address the central issue that has been part \nof the education debate all along, and that is the issue of \naccountability. On the last amendment Senator Wellstone proposed, I \nknow the discussion back and forth between Senator Wellstone and the \nSenator from New Hampshire. The position of the Senator from New \nHampshire was that he could support increases in title I if there was \nproper accountability for how the money was spent, if we could be sure \nthe money was spent for the purpose it was really needed.\n  The amendment I am proposing would try to put into place the \nmechanisms to ensure that accountability. That, I believe, is a reason \nthe amendment should be supported by everyone.\n  Let me indicate what current law is. Current law says that of the \ntitle I funds a State receives, they can spend a maximum of one-half of \n1 percent of those title I funds in order to ensure accountability in \nthe expenditure of those funds. That is, if you have a failing school--\nfor example, take my State. If one of our school districts in New \nMexico has an elementary school that is not doing well and is not \nshowing improvement in student performance, then the State has one-half \nof 1 percent of the title I funds it can spend in trying to assist that \nschool to do better. That is all it can spend, and that is for the \nentire State.\n  It is clear to anybody who has worked in education that this is an \ninadequate amount of money. I have here a letter that has been sent to \nme by the Council of Chief State School Officers. I want to read a \nsection from that where they indicate their support for this Bingaman \namendment to restore an increase in funding for title I accountability \ngrants to assist low-performing schools:\n\n       Last year, Congress appropriated $134 million in title I \n     accountability funds to help aid over 7,000 schools, to help \n     low-performing schools that were identified. The Council of \n     Chief State School Officers supports providing assistance to \n     low-performing schools through an increased State setaside. \n     The accountability grants are essential to help turn around \n     our Nation's most troubled schools. Several of our States \n     have already expressed reluctance to undertake the new grants \n     due to an certainty over future funding. It is critical that \n     the accountability grants be sustained and funded and funding \n     increased to the President's request of $250 million, so that \n     States and districts can continue to help improve these \n     schools. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \n     letter, dated June 21, 2000, be printed in the Record \n     immediately after my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I believe that letter summarizes very well the thrust \nof my argument. We have the Federal Government now spending over $8 \nbillion this next year--almost $9 billion--to assist disadvantaged \nstudents through the title I program. But the accompanying \naccountability provisions in the law have not been fully implemented. \nThat is, we have not seen the\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nresults we would like to see in all cases--in the case of these failing \nschools in particular--due to a lack of dedicated funding that would be \nnecessary to develop improved strategies and create rewards and \npenalties that hold schools accountable for continuous improvement in \ntheir student performance.\n  The bill before us does not identify any specific funds for \naccountability enforcement efforts. We need to ensure that a \nsignificant funding stream is provided so that these accountability \nprovisions are in fact enforced. The amendment I have offered seeks to \nensure that $250 million, which is a small fraction of the total amount \nappropriated under title I, is directly spent on this objective. This \nmoney would be used to ensure that States and local school districts \nhave the resources available to implement the corrective action \nprovisions of title I by providing immediate and intensive \ninterventions to turn around low-performing schools.\n  What type of interventions am I talking about? What are we trying to \nensure that States and school districts can do by providing these \nfunds? Let me give you a list.\n  First of all, ongoing and intensive teacher training. If you have a \nfailing school where the students are not performing better than they \ndid last year, it is likely that the problem comes back to the \nteachers. We need better training of some of our teachers in that \nschool. These funds would make that possible.\n  Second, extended learning time for students, afterschool programs, \nSaturday, and summer school to help students catch up. Again, a failing \nschool, in many cases, needs those kinds of resources.\n  Third, provision of rewards to low-performing schools that show \nsignificant progress, including cash awards and other incentives, such \nas release time for teachers.\n  Fourth, restructuring of chronically failing schools. In many cases, \nyou need a restructuring of a school. You need to replace some of the \npeople in the administration. You need to have a restructuring so that \nthe school can start off on another foot.\n\n  Fifth, intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside \nthe school to help develop and implement school improvement plans in \nthese failing schools. These are teams that go into the school and \ndetermine the causes of the low performance--for example, low \nexpectations, outdated curriculum, poorly trained teachers, and unsafe \nconditions--and assist those schools in implementing research-based \nmodels for improvement.\n  Here is one example of what I am talking about. A program with which \nmany of us have become familiar--I certainly have in my State--is \ncalled Success for All. This is a program which is called a whole \nschool reform program for the early grades, elementary schools. It was \ndeveloped by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, and it has been \nimplemented in over 2,000 elementary schools throughout the country. \nThere were over 50 schools in my home State of New Mexico this last \nyear that implemented the Success for All Program. The program is a \nproven early grade reading program which, if implemented properly, can \nensure better results. All of the studies demonstrate that it can lead \nto better results.\n  At the end of the first grade, Success for All schools have average \nreading scores almost 3 months ahead of those in matching control \nschools, and by the end of the fifth grade, students read more than 1 \nyear ahead of their peers in the controlled schools. So the program can \nreduce the need for special education placements by more than 50 \npercent and virtually eliminate the problem of having to retain \nstudents in a grade more than a year.\n  The funding contemplated in this amendment I am offering is \nauthorized under both the old version of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and the proposed new version, on which we just had a \ndebate about how to get that back up for consideration in the Senate. \nUnder section 1002(f) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \ncurrently in effect, Congress is authorized to provide such sums as may \nbe necessary to provide needed assistance for school improvement under \nsections 1116 and 1117 of the act. That is the current Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Last year, we did provide additional assistance in this bill--this \nexact appropriations bill we are debating today. We provided $134 \nmillion for this purpose, and we need to follow through on that \ncommitment this year.\n  We also agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that these funds were \nnecessary during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the bill which was reported out of the committee. Under \nS. 2, the chairman's bill, there would be an automatic setaside of \nincreased funds for title I for this purpose.\n  Unfortunately, as has been discussed here at length, the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act appears to be in limbo, and we are having \ngreat difficulty getting back to it on the Senate floor. It is simply \nirresponsible for us to invest $9 billion--or nearly that--in the title \nI program and, at the same time, still fail to provide necessary \nresources to ensure that the States, districts, and schools are held \naccountable for how that $9 billion is spent.\n  Title I requires the States and districts to implement accountability \nand assist failing schools. But we in the Congress have failed to give \nthe States and districts the resources necessary to carry out those \nmandates.\n  Title I authorizes State school support teams to provide support for \nschoolwide programs, to provide assistance to schools in need of \nimprovement through activities such as professional development, \nidentifying resources for changing and instruction, and changing the \norganization of the school.\n  In 1998, only eight States reported that school support teams have \nbeen able to serve the majority of schools identified in need of \nimprovement.\n  Less than half of the schools identified as needing improvement in \nthe 1997-1998 school year reported that this designation led to \nadditional professional development or assistance.\n  Schools and school districts that need this additional support and \nresources do five things: Address weaknesses quickly soon after they \nare identified; second, promote a progressively intensive range of \ninterventions; third, continuously assess the results of those \ninterventions and monitor whether progress is, in fact, being made; \nfourth, implement incentives for improvement; and, fifth, implement \nconsequences for failure.\n  I think many in this Senate would agree that a crucial step toward \nimproving the public schools lies in holding the system accountable for \nstudent achievement and better outcomes.\n  I hope everyone is able to demonstrate with their vote on this \namendment that they support these positive initiatives toward \nestablishing that type of accountability.\n  Unfortunately, our debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct was prematurely ended. As I indicated, it is not clear when that \nwill come back. I continue to hope it will come back to the Senate \nfloor so we can complete that bill and send it to the President.\n  I think that is a high priority that the American people want to see \nus accomplish before we leave this fall.\n  When we resume consideration of that bill, I intend to offer an \namendment that would address the area of accountability in all \neducation programs.\n  This amendment will enhance the existing accountability provisions in \ntitle I. As you know, this is the largest Federal program in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and it has been discussed \nbefore as to the great good this program does.\n  We made some important changes to title I. I indicated that the \nchairman's mark has some provision for a significant increase in the \namount of funds that could be used for these accountability purposes. \nBut under current law, States and the school districts are not able to \nspend the money they need in this area.\n  That is why the amendment I am offering today is so important.\n  I hope very much that Senators will support the amendment.\n  In my home State of New Mexico the need is enormous.\n  In 1994, fourth grade reading data showed that an average of 21 \npercent of fourth graders in my State were reading at a level that was \nconsidered proficient.\n  There is a tremendous need for additional resources in this area. The \nfact\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nis that many of these students are minority students, and many of these \nstudents require the assistance that title I was intended to provide. \nWe need to be sure that the accountability is there so these funds are \nspent in an effective way.\n  I know that Senator Reed is also here on the floor and is a cosponsor \nof this amendment. He would like to speak to it.\n  Let me indicate also, if I failed to do so at the beginning of my \ncomments, that the amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senators \nReed, Kennedy, Murray, Dodd, and Wellstone.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                  Council of Chief\n\n\n                                        State School Officers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2000.\n     Member,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the state commissioners and \n     superintendents of education, I write to comment on the \n     FY2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations bill (S. 2553), which the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee passed last month. While the Council \n     is extremely pleased with the bipartisan effort to \n     significantly increase the overall funding level for \n     education programs, we have several concerns with education \n     policy issues reflected in the bill, as well as programs \n     which are underfunded.\n       The Council applauds the Committee's decision to increase \n     funding for education by over $4.6 billion, which is higher \n     than the President's request. We are grateful that the Senate \n     recognizes the need to substantially invest in education, and \n     S. 2553 is responsive to recent polls that show 61% of the \n     public believe that the federal government does not invest \n     enough in education. Specifically, we are pleased that the \n     bill increases funding for programs such as Title I, IDEA, \n     and vocational education, although these programs still \n     remain critically underfunded.\n       Despite the high total funding level, there are several \n     elementary and secondary education issues included in the \n     bill which greatly concern the Council. We urge adoption of \n     amendments to address these issues. Amendments are needed as \n     follows: (1) restore and increase resources to assist low-\n     performing Title I schools; (2) continue development and \n     implementation of aligned state and local standards and \n     assessments; (3) provide separate, guaranteed funding streams \n     for class size reduction and school modernization; (4) \n     increase funding for teacher quality in Title II, ESEA and \n     Title II, HEA; (5) restore and increase funding for the \n     Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration program; and (6) \n     delete provisions that would allow community based \n     organizations to operate the 21st Century Community Schools \n     program. The Council urges adoption of the following \n     amendments to S. 2553:\n       Support the Bingaman amendment to restore and increase \n     funding for Title I accountability grants to assist low-\n     performing schools. Last year Congress appropriated $134 \n     million in Title I accountability funds to help aid over \n     7,000 schools identified as low performing. While CCSSO \n     supports providing assistance to low-performing schools \n     through an increased state set-aside, the accountability \n     grants are essential to help turn around our nation's most \n     troubled schools. Several of our states have already \n     expressed reluctance to undertake the new grants due to \n     uncertainty over future funding. It is critical that the \n     accountability grants be sustained and funding increased to \n     the President's request of $250 million, so states and \n     districts can continue to help improve these schools.\n       Provide guaranteed funding to allow SEAs to continue the \n     key functions of Goals 2000. This funding is necessary for \n     states and districts to continue development and \n     implementation of high standards for student achievement with \n     aligned assessments to measure progress of students, schools, \n     and systems. Goals 2000 has been the leading source of funds \n     for localities and states to develop standards and innovative \n     improvement strategies. Funding for continuing these purposes \n     must be included in Title II or Title VI, ESEA.\n       Support the Murray and Harkin amendments to provide \n     separate, guaranteed funding streams for class size reduction \n     and school modernization. S. 2553 contains provisions for the \n     use of a $2.7 billion block grant within Title VI, ESEA to \n     allow funding for any programs that a LEA determines are ``. \n     . . part of a local strategy for improving academic \n     achievement''. While CCSSO strongly supports a substantial \n     increase in funding for Title VI, Innovative Strategies to \n     enable states and districts to continue development and \n     implementation of challenging standards and assessments, we \n     oppose block granting of education programs such as Class \n     Size Reduction and School Modernization. Block granting of \n     federal education programs leads to reduction of federal \n     funding, as evidenced by the 1981 consolidation of 26 federal \n     education programs with appropriations of $750 million. \n     Today, the appropriation for these programs is $375 million. \n     When adjusted for inflation, the current appropriation is \n     only one-fourth of the $1.5 billion value these programs \n     would have today if the programs prior to block granting were \n     kept at 1980 levels. To be sustained at effective levels, \n     federal education funds should be targeted to educational \n     priorities that serve America's neediest students.\n       Separate programs for reducing class size and school \n     modernization are essential. We urge the Senate to guarantee \n     separate funding streams for these two critical programs and \n     to fund School Modernization at $1.3 billion and Class Size \n     Reduction at $1.75 billion in FY2001.\n       Support the Kennedy amendment to increase funding for \n     Teacher quality by providing substantial new funds for Title \n     II, ESEA, and Title II, HEA. S. 2553 reduces funding for \n     teacher quality by over $500 million below the President's \n     request. This funding is necessary since schools will need \n     additional resources to recruit and train the 2.2 million new \n     teachers needed in the next decade, as well as to strengthen \n     the skills of current teachers.\n       Restore and increase funding for the Comprehensive School \n     Reform Demonstration program. This highly successful program \n     has been in existence for 3 years and has provided critical \n     assistance to our nation's neediest schools and students. By \n     eliminating funding for CSRD, more than 3,000 schools in need \n     of improvement will be denied the opportunity to receive \n     funding for research-based models of schoolwide improvement.\n       Delete the Gregg amendment adopted during Committee markup \n     to allow community-based organization (CBO's) to apply for \n     and operate the 21st Century Afterschool program. This \n     innovative program should be continued to be based at schools \n     with orientation toward academic success through after-school \n     enrichment program targeted to disadvantaged youth. Current \n     law has successfully promoted LEA-CBO partnerships to expand \n     learning opportunities for youth during non-school hours, \n     weekends, and summers. Authorizing CBO's to operate the \n     programs alone would completely alter this partnerships and \n     undermine the focus on academically-related extended \n     learning. Additionally, the funding level for this program is \n     $400 million below the President's request, which would \n     result in 1.6 million fewer children receiving services.\n       We urge the Senate to address these issues during floor \n     action. These changes together with the commended strong \n     bipartisan increase in funding for education programs would \n     provide an important new appropriation for education. \n     However, if the above issues are not addressed, we cannot \n     support the bill.\n       We look forward to working with Members of the Senate to \n     increase federal education support which connects with state \n     and local efforts to strengthen classroom quality and access \n     to education excellence for all students. If we can be of any \n     assistance to you or answer any questions, please call me or \n     Carnie Hayes, our Director of Federal State Relations, at \n     (202) 336-7009. As always, thank you for considering our \n     recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gordon M. Ambach,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator be willing to enter into a \nunanimous consent that we vote on his amendment, if there is a vote, at \n5 o'clock?\n  I withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since the Senator has withdrawn his \nrequest, I don't agree to it.\n  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, the \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of Senator \nBingaman's amendment to provide additional resources to support State \nand local accountability efforts. Last year's budget included these \nfunds, and this investment must be continued.\n  I have worked long and hard on school accountability. But, frankly, \nthe leader in this regard in this body is Senator Jeff Bingaman from \nNew Mexico. He is a champion for ensuring that Federal resources go to \nschools. But we also provide incentives and opportunities for \naccountability and for improvement, along with Federal dollars. His \nefforts have been in the forefront of this great effort to improve the \nquality of our education and the quality of our schools.\n  The Federal Government directs over $8 billion a year to provide \ncritical support for disadvantaged students under title I. But even \nwith this great amount of money--$8 billion--there are still \ninsufficient resources to provide for the accountability provisions \nthat are part of title I.\n  We essentially face a situation, given the number of students who \nqualify for title I and the limited resources for the program, where \nmost of the funds go simply to providing services and not the type of \ncareful overview and thoughtful review that is necessary for program \nimprovement.\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n  With the resources that are proposed by Senator Bingaman, we will be \nable to identify more closely and more accurately schools in need of \nimprovement. We will be able to provide assistance for activities like \nprofessional development and technical assistance to schools so that \nthey can in effect improve their performance and implement State \ncorrective actions for schools that we should and must improve.\n  Today, as I mentioned before, most of the dollars are simply going \nout to meet this overwhelming demand for services without the ability \nto review, evaluate, and correct programs. With this ability we would \nnot only get the best results for our dollars, but we could materially \nimprove the educational attainment of children throughout this country, \nand particularly disadvantaged children under title I.\n  In 1994, much of the impetus for accountability began with the prior \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The 1994 amendments allowed States to move forward and develop their \nown content performance standards and to develop their own assessment \nmeasures to provide the details for our direction to improve the \naccountability of title I money.\n  But as I mentioned--this is a constant theme--because of limited \nresources, there is the difficult choice between providing the service \nand doing the accountability.\n  On a day-to-day basis, States try to keep up. But over time, they are \nfalling behind in terms of improved performance and improved quality of \neducation for students. What results is States can't as effectively \naddress weaknesses that they see. They can't invoke a progressively \nintensive range of interventions to improve schools. They can't do the \ncontinuous assessments that are necessary to keep these programs on \ntarget, focused, and provide quality education for all of our children.\n  The amendment, which the Senator from New Mexico proposes, would \nprovide resources for schools and school districts to enable them to \naddress the challenges of helping low-performance students and low-\nperformance schools. In fact, we know those students in our lowest \nperformance schools will immediately and directly benefit from the \nBingaman amendment because studies clearly show that students in low-\nperformance schools are at least a year or two behind students in the \nhigh-performing schools within the title I universe.\n  As we provide these resources, we need to focus them on the more \nproblematic schools so we can help disadvantaged children to attain \nbetter educational achievement throughout our country.\n\n  We are still in the midst of trying to reauthorize the ESEA. Within \nthe context of that act, Senator Bingaman has other accountability \nlanguage which I am proud to support with him.\n  But we have a critical opportunity--and we are at a critical juncture \ntoday--to provide resources and directions so that the accountability \nissue at least will not have to wait upon final reauthorization of the \nESEA if that final reauthorization is indeed forthcoming in this \nlegislative session.\n  I once again commend Senator Bingaman for his leadership.\n  I conclude by simply saying that we have a situation where there is a \ngreat deal of knowledge and a great deal of intuition at the local \nlevel about how they can improve this program.\n  These resources in the hands of local school authorities would make a \nreal difference in the lives of disadvantaged children, and would \nultimately go to the heart of, I believe, what our greatest challenge \nin this country is, which is to use education to provide all of us, but \nmost particularly the most disadvantaged Americans, the opportunity to \nlearn, to succeed and to contribute to this country and to our \neconomy. I urge passage of the Bingaman amendment, and I yield to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed there is no time \nagreement; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that there is \nno time agreement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we do have one other Senator who I \nbelieve is on his way to the floor and wishes to speak. If there are \nany Senators wishing to speak in opposition, we will be glad to hear \nfrom them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from New Mexico for \noffering what I think is about as important an amendment as you can \nhave, when it comes to the issue of education. Regrettably, we have \nabandoned--I hope only temporarily--the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the authorization bill. That bill is only dealt with \nonce every 6 years by the Congress. It is the bedrock piece of \nlegislation that deals with the elementary and secondary educational \nneeds of America's children; the some 50 million who attend our public \nschools every day of the school year. Of the 55 million or so children \nwho go to elementary and secondary schools, roughly 50 million of them \nattend a public school.\n  Despite the efforts of the committee of jurisdiction--we spent 2 or 3 \ndays discussing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--we have now \ndecided we are no longer going to debate that or discuss that issue any \nlonger. I think that is a tragedy when we consider how important to the \nAmerican public is the issue of education, how important it is to \nstrengthen our schools. Everyone knows so many of them are in desperate \nneed of help. That we cannot find the time--only once every 6 years--to \ntalk about this issue is deplorable.\n  It was through the efforts of my colleague from New Mexico, in fact, \nthat we were able to provide language in the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act to deal with the issue of accountability in our public \nschools. I regret this bill has been abandoned. I hope we will get back \nto it, although I am doubtful that will be the case. But, if we do, we \nwill have a chance to further discuss it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has offered an amendment to set aside \n$250 million within title I to help States implement effective programs \nto turn around failing schools. Last year, $134 million was \nappropriated for this purpose, and the committee's appropriations bill \ndoes not include any funding for accountability grants. The President \nrequested $250 million, and this amendment meets that request.\n  The fact that the proposal coming out of the committee disregards \naccountability altogether is a stunning failure to recognize how \nimportant it is that we make a concerted effort to put these failing \nschools back on their feet.\n  What is title I? We talk in terms of titles, dollar amounts, and \nalphabet soup when it comes to certain programs. Title I is the basic \neducation program to provide assistance to the most disadvantaged \nstudents in the country, whether they live in urban, rural, or suburban \nareas.\n  Roughly $8 billion, more than half the entire Federal budget's \ncommitment on education, goes for title I, disadvantaged students. In \nfact, it is an indictment of the Federal Government that we only \ncontribute less than one-half of 1 percent of our entire Federal budget \nto elementary and secondary education. Imagine, less than one-half of 1 \npercent of the entire Federal budget goes to elementary and secondary \neducation, despite the fact that most Americans say with a single voice \nthat education is about as important an issue as this country has to \naddress. Despite those feelings, we contribute a tiny fraction of the \nentire Federal budget to this most compelling need.\n  Of the $15 billion we spend on education, half is spent on these \ndisadvantaged children through title I. That is title I.\n  Senator Bingaman has offered an amendment that provides that of the \n$8.3 billion, we are going to allocate $250 million, which is not \nincluded in the present bill. It provides $250 million to do something \nto get these failing schools back on track.\n  It has been suggested that a failing school ought to be shut down. I \nunderstand the frustration that leads people\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\nto that conclusion, but too often when we shut down one of these \nschools, there are no great alternatives around the corner for these \nchildren. There is not that well-run little parochial school or some \nprivate school to which these children can go. Too often these schools \nexist in the worst neighborhoods and worst areas of the country in \nterms of economics. We need to do something to get these schools back \non track and functioning well so these children, who, through no fault \nof their own, are born into these circumstances in these neighborhoods \nand communities across the country, have a chance.\n  It is one thing to talk about accountability, but the Senator from \nNew Mexico has offered some strong, thoughtful language on how to \nachieve that accountability in our Nation's educational system. We have \nshifted our focus from what the Federal education dollar has bought to \nmore on outcome: What do you get; what comes out of that school.\n  It is a worthwhile shift to begin to determine what schools are \nproducing, how well are these children prepared to move on to the next \nlevel of education to become productive citizens of our country, good \ncitizens, and good parents. There are too often a staggering number of \nschools that fail when it comes to outputs.\n  Effective accountability measures is what business leaders call \nquality control measures. They determine whether students are achieving \nto the high standards they ought to be, to make sure public dollars are \nbeing spent wisely. Accountability is especially important in schools \nwith high concentrations of disadvantaged students to ensure all \nstudents have an opportunity to meet high standards of achievement.\n\n  In our view, we must spur change and reform in these failing schools. \nShutting them down is not the answer. Getting them to perform better \nis. Setting positive accountability standards is one of the ways to \nhelp achieve that goal. That is what the Senator from New Mexico is \noffering in this amendment: Some dollars allocated and setting \naccountability standards will help us achieve the desired results.\n  As we all know, despite concerted efforts by States and school \ndistricts, accountability provisions in title I have not been \nadequately implemented due to insufficient resources. When we have a \nbudget, such as this one, that does not allocate even a nickel for \naccountability, we cannot give a speech about accountability and then \nnot provide any of the resources to see to it that accountability is \nachieved.\n  In 1998, to make the point, only 8 States out of the 50 reported that \nschool support teams were able to serve the majority of schools \nidentified as being in need of improvement. Less than half of the \nschools identified as in need of improvement in the 1997-1998 period \nreported they received additional professional development or technical \nassistance.\n  It seems quite obvious we need to strengthen title I with only 8 \nStates out of 50. Even among those States, the results are paltry when \nit comes to accountability. We clearly need to do a far better job if \nwe are going to give these students and these families a chance to have \na school to continue and provide the education these children ought to \nbe receiving.\n  We have to strengthen title I to make more schools more accountable \nfor the academic success of all the children who attend them and to \nassure States and districts do all they can to turn around failing \nschools by using proven, effective strategies for reform.\n  We must make all schools accountable for good teaching and improved \nstudent achievement. We cannot turn our backs on low-performing \nschools, as I said. We must do all we can to improve them. If all else \nfails and we have to close them down, that is one thing, but if we jump \nto close schools without trying to improve them, too often we abandon \nthese young students.\n  School districts and States need the additional support. Less than \none-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget is dedicated to \neducation, and we are talking about $250 million out of the title I \nresources to improve the accountability standards. My view, and I think \nthe view of most of us, is that we ought to act now and make these \nschools more accountable for these disadvantaged children. I am hopeful \nthat will be the case.\n  Again, I congratulate our colleague from New Mexico for offering this \namendment. I mentioned one-half of 1 percent of the Federal budget is \nspent on elementary and secondary education. Out of 100 cents in the \ndollar we contribute, one-half of 1 percent represents 7 cents when it \ncomes to an education dollar; 93 cents come from our States and mostly \nlocal governments who support the educational needs of the local \ncommunities. When we get to our poorest communities in rural America--I \nknow the Presiding Officer can relate to this; he represents a very \ndiverse State, one that has strong urban areas but strong rural areas \nas well--when we get to a poor rural community or poor urban area, the \ntax base, in many cases, does not exist to provide for the educational \nneeds.\n\n  My hope is in the coming years we are going to do a better job of \nbeing a better partner with local towns, a better partner with our \nStates, so the Federal Government is contributing a greater share, \nabout $1. Seven cents out of 100 cents toward the needs of America's \nchildren in the 21st century is an appalling indictment of failing to \nimprove the quality of education.\n  I do not know of a single Senator who dissents when it comes to the \nissue of accountability, making sure these students are coming out of \neducational institutions with the abilities, the talents, and the \nknowledge they need to move on. On this we can all agree. We have to \nnot just talk about it, we have to invest in it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has offered a proposal that will at least \nput some dollars into the accountability standards, along with the \nlanguage that tells how best to achieve accountability. I strongly \nendorse this amendment and hope our colleagues will support it.\n  I thank the distinguished managers of this bill, Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin, for their willingness to provide for a new and \nsignificant investment in child care. I have been critical about the \naccountability standards and the lack of funding. Before those remarks, \nI should have commended them for the work they have done on child care. \nAs most of my colleagues know, I have spent a good part of my career in \nthe Senate trying to improve the quality of child care in this country. \nThis bill raises the level of the child care development block grant to \na total funding of $2 billion which will allow an additional 220,000 \nchildren across this country to be served in a child care setting.\n  To put this investment in perspective, I note that this year's \nincrease in funding of child care is double the program's growth in the \nprevious 10 years of its existence. This funding represents the fruits \nof 2 years of bipartisan efforts.\n  In addition to thanking the chairman and ranking member of this \nappropriations subcommittee, I want to recognize individuals who have \nfought long and hard to provide this assistance to America's working \nfamilies.\n  My colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, my colleagues from \nMaine, Senator Snowe and Senator Collins, and my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who has been a stalwart in fighting for \nthis issue for many years. There are a lot of other people here who \nhave been involved.\n  Senator John Chafee, who was a terrific fighter on many issues--by \nthe way, Parade magazine, this past Sunday, had a wonderful story by \nMr. Brady, who served with John Chafee in Korea. It was a wonderful \npiece about John Chafee's service in the Korean war, as we remembered \nthe veterans of that conflict that began 50 years ago the day before \nyesterday.\n  John Chafee was a tremendous fighter and great ally when it came to \nchild care. I do not want to conclude these remarks without mentioning \nhis wonderful contribution in this area.\n  The funding allocation that is in this bill demonstrates that helping \nworking families is not a partisan issue. I am glad to report that, in \nfact, in the last year, on four different occasions, we had votes on \nchild care in the midst of some very tense and heated debates. In every \nsingle instance, this body--by a fairly significant margin--supported \nincreasing the allocations for child care. It did not get done in \nconference reports, with the House of Representatives, in the first \nsession of this Congress.\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\n  But Senator Specter told me last year: I promise you this year we \nwill put the dollars in to get that level up to $2 billion. He did so. \nI thank him for fulfilling that commitment, not to me so much but to \nthe working families in this country, who need this help tremendously.\n  So for 220,000 families who do not have the choice of staying at home \nor going to work but must work, either as single parents or two-income-\nearning parents, who need the resources to provide for their families, \ndecent child care is worthwhile.\n  I note, just as an aside on this issue, we have a wonderful child \ncare facility that serves the family of the Senate. One of our \ncolleagues, John Edwards of North Carolina, is the proud father of a \nnew baby, but also has another young child. He brought the child to the \nchild care center in the last few days to receive the services of that \nsetting.\n  He was notified that in the 35-year existence of the child care \ncenter that serves the Senate family, he is the first Member of the \nSenate who actually has a child in that child care center. Certainly, \nwe get some indication of maybe why we have not been as aggressive in \npursuing the child care issues, when for obvious reasons--age and so \nforth--Members here are not likely to have children of child care age \nand needs.\n  But most Americans who have young children and work have a need \ntoday. This appropriation will assist the neediest people in the \ncountry, the neediest who are out there working every day to provide \nfor their families and also need to have a decent place, a safe place--\nhopefully, a caring place--where they can leave their child in the care \nof others when they go off to work and provide for their economic \nneeds.\n  I applaud the committee for its efforts in that regard. But as I said \nat the outset, I am very disappointed we have not done more in the area \nof accountability when it comes to elementary and secondary education \nneeds and our failing schools.\n  In this context, I urge the adoption of the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside in order that the Senate may consider Senator \nMurray's amendment concerning class size.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3604\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for class-size reduction and other activities)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3604.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, line 12, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That $1,400,000,000 of such \n     $2,700,000,000 shall be available, notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, to award funds and carry out activities in \n     the same manner as funds were awarded and activities were \n     carried out under section 310 of the Department of Education \n     Appropriations Act, 2000: Provided further, That an \n     additional $350,000,000 is appropriated to award funds and \n     carry out activities in the same such manner''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \nadditional cosponsors Senators Biden, Dodd, Robb, Wellstone, Kennedy, \nTorricelli, Reed, Lautenberg, Reid, Levin, Akaka, and Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nargue, again, that no child should have to struggle for a teacher's \nattention in an overcrowded classroom. Every child deserves a classroom \nenvironment where they can learn and grow and get individual attention \nfrom a caring, qualified teacher. With the amendment I am offering this \nafternoon, we have an opportunity, again, to make that happen.\n  I am proud to report that classrooms across America are less crowded \nthis year than they were last year. In fact, this year, 1.7 million \nchildren benefited from less crowded classrooms. The reason those \nstudents are learning in smaller classes is because this Congress made \na commitment to help local school districts hire 100,000 new fully \nqualified teachers. We are now about one-third of the way towards \nreaching that goal.\n  By all measures, this has been a very successful program. Given the \nprogress we have made, many parents and teachers would have a hard time \nbelieving that this Congress is about to abandon its commitment to \nreduce class size, but that is exactly what the bill before us would \ndo. It would abandon our commitment to helping school districts reduce \nclassroom overcrowding.\n  This bill would take the promise of smaller classes and yank it away \nfrom students and parents and teachers. This underlying bill does not \nguarantee funding for the Class Size Reduction Program as it is \ncurrently written. If it is passed without the amendment I am offering, \nschool districts across the country cannot rely on having the money \navailable to hire new teachers or to pay the salaries of the teachers \nthey have already hired.\n  I have talked to hundreds of local educators, parents, and students. \nTo them, that is unacceptable. That is why I have come to the floor \ntoday to offer my amendment that would continue our commitment to \nreducing class sizes.\n\n  Under this successful program, we have hired 29,000 new teachers, and \nwe have given 1.7 million students across the country less crowded \nclassrooms. Clearly, we are making progress, but we can't be satisfied \nwith the status quo. We need to bring the benefits of smaller classes \nto more students. It is clear that smaller classes help students learn \nthe basics with fewer discipline problems. Parents know it. Teachers \nknow it. Students know it.\n  On the chart behind me, I have listed some of the benefits of smaller \nclasses. They include better student achievement, something every \nSenator has come to the floor to speak for; fewer discipline problems, \nsomething about which we hear constantly; more individual attention; \nbetter parent-teacher communication; dramatic results for poor and \nminority students.\n  As a former educator, I can tell the Senate, there is a difference \nbetween having 35 kids in your classroom and having 18 kids in your \nclassroom. With 35 kids, you spend most of your time on crowd control. \nWith 18 kids, you spend most of your time teaching. But it is not only \nmy experience. National research proves that smaller class sizes help \nstudents learn the basics they need in a disciplined environment.\n  A study that was conducted in Tennessee in 1989, which is known as \nthe STAR study, compared the performance of students in grades K \nthrough 3 in small and regular size classes. That study found that \nstudents in small classes, those with 13 to 17 students, significantly \noutperformed other students in math and in reading. The STAR study \nfound that students benefited from smaller classes at all grade levels \nand across all geographic areas. The study found that students in small \nclasses have better high school graduation rates. These were kids who \nwere in smaller classes in kindergarten through the third grade. They \nfound, as they followed them through later on, they had better high \nschool graduation rates, higher grade point averages, and were more \ninclined to pursue higher education. Certainly these are goals this \nSenate should be proud of helping to achieve.\n  According to the research conducted by Princeton University \neconomist, Dr. Alan Kruger, students who attended small classes were \nmore likely to take ACT or SAT college entrance exams. That was \nparticularly true for African Americans students. According to Dr. \nKruger:\n\n       Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-\n     white gap in the probability of taking a college-entrance \n     exam by more than half.\n\n  Three other researchers at two different institutions of higher \neducation found that STAR students who attended small classes in the \nearly K through 3 grades were between 6 and 13 months ahead of their \nregular class peers in math, reading, and science in\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\neach of grades four, six, and eight, as they followed them through.\n  In yet another part of the country, a different class size reduction \nstudy reached similar conclusions. The Wisconsin SAGE study, Student \nAchievement Guarantee in Education, findings from 1996 through 1999 \nconsistently proved that smaller classes result in significantly \ngreater student achievement.\n  Class size reduction programs in the State study resulted in \nincreased attention to individual students. It produced three main \nbenefits: Fewer discipline problems and more instruction; more \nknowledge of students; and more teacher enthusiasm for teaching.\n  The Wisconsin study also found in smaller classes teachers were able \nto identify the learning problems of individual students more quickly. \nAs one teacher participant in the State class size reduction study \nsaid, ``If a child is having problems, you can see it right away. You \ncan take care of it right then. It works a lot better for children.''\n  The data is conclusive. Smaller classes help kids learn the basics in \na disciplined environment. I am also proud that the class size program \nis simple and efficient. The school districts simply fill out a one-\npage form, which happens to be available online. Then the Department of \nEducation sends them money to hire new teachers based on need and \nenrollment. The teachers have told me they have never seen money move \nso quickly from Congress to the classroom as under our class size bill.\n  Linda McGeachy in the Vancouver school district in my State \ncommented, ``The language is very clear, applying was very easy, and \ntheir funds really work to support classroom teachers.''\n  The class size program is also flexible. Any school district that has \nalready reduced class sizes in the early grades to 18 or fewer children \nmay use the funds to further reduce class sizes in the other early \ngrades. They can use it to reduce class sizes in kindergarten or they \ncan carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including \nprofessional development.\n  I am sure some Members are going to argue that schools could still \nhire teachers if they wanted to by using the title VI funding in this \nunderlying bill. Now, that may sound good at first, but it doesn't \nrecognize the reality of how school boards work. The language in the \nunderlying bill won't work. Mr. President, I served on a local school \nboard. Finding the money to hire and train new teachers requires a \nfinancial commitment over many years in the face of many competing \npriorities. That is one of the reasons why school districts have so \nmuch trouble reducing class size without our Federal partnership.\n  Last year, we told school districts we would give them the money to \nhire teachers for 7 years. They heard our commitment and they hired \nmore than 29,000 new teachers. Unfortunately, today, this underlying \nbill asks school districts to choose whether or not to keep those \nteachers, without any assurance that the money will still be there in \nthe coming years.\n  I can tell you, if I were still on a school board, I would find it \nvery difficult to keep those teachers, not knowing if I would have the \nmoney for them in the future. That is why we need to protect that money \nand guarantee that it goes to reduce class sizes. Because this bill \nabandons our commitment as a Federal partner, it leaves school \ndistricts with a false choice, and it means our kids are going to lose \nout. We should keep our commitment to reducing class size.\n  There is another reason why my amendment is so necessary, another \ncritical reason why using the general title VI funding is not an \nadequate substitute. I have discussed this, as my colleagues know, many \ntimes on the floor of the Senate--why programs that are put into block \ngrants with no specific purpose, such as title VI, are much less \neffective in targeting resources to our neediest students. Under the \nclass size program, money is targeted to those needy students. For \nexample, from the State level, funds are targeted 80 percent based on \npoverty and 20 percent based on student population. The program is \ndesigned to make sure economically disadvantaged students who benefit \nthe most get smaller classes. We know poor and minority students can \nmake dramatic gains in less crowded classrooms. And this amendment \ntargets new teachers directly to those vulnerable students. Without my \namendment, however, there is no guarantee those poor students will get \nthe support they need.\n  Let me be clear. A block grant that is not targeted toward a specific \neducational purpose fails to ensure that our most vulnerable students \nget the resources they need. We need to pass this amendment so we can \nguarantee those students can benefit from smaller class sizes.\n  Before I close, I want to make one final point. We are going to \ncontinue this program sooner or later. The President has made it clear \nthat he will veto this bill unless it funds the Class Size Reduction \nProgram. His track record on this is pretty clear. He has stood up for \nthe class size program time and again in the past. So the real question \nis, Are we going to vote to fund the program now, in June, or are we \ngoing to wait until the end of the fiscal year, sometime in October, \nwhen the clock is running and the congressional majority has to \nnegotiate again with the President?\n  We should do it now. We should pass this amendment now, early in the \nprocess, so that school boards across America will have a clear \nindication that money for their new teachers will be there.\n  In closing, this amendment gives my colleagues the opportunity to \nsupport one of the most successful efforts we have ever seen in our \nschools in years. This amendment gives us a chance to fix the \nunderlying Labor-HHS bill so that our students are not trapped in \novercrowded classrooms. Let's invest in the things we know work. Let's \nsupport local school districts as they work to hire new teachers, and \nlets keep our commitment to America's schoolchildren so that they can \nlearn the basics in a disciplined environment.\n  This is an issue we have worked on for some time, and the underlying \nbill will not keep our commitment to class size that is so important, \nthat so many parents, students and teachers are waiting for us to make. \nThat is why this amendment is so important.\n  I see that my colleague from Massachusetts is here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if the Senator will be good enough to yield for \na question or two.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have had the good opportunity to listen \nto the persuasive arguments of the Senator from Washington. Does the \nSenator from Washington agree with me that historically the Federal \nrole of helping local schools assist the most economically \ndisadvantaged and challenged children in this country has been very \nlimited? This was basically the origin of the Title I program back in \nthe mid-1960s. We have had some success and we have had some failures. \nBut I think the successes have been in the most recent time.\n  This is where we have been focusing our limited resources. However, \nthe change in the formula in the underlying bill, which is in complete \ncontrast to what the Senator from Washington has drafted, would target \n80 percent of the funds for the neediest children, and 20 percent for \nthe population. Now we are finding out that there has been a dramatic \nshift and the guiding force is going to be the population. So this \nwhole block grant which has been explained to be available for smaller \nclass size really isn't going to be targeted or really available to the \nchildren who probably need it the most. Am I correct in my \nunderstanding that this is one of the concerns the Senator has pointed \nout?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct. There is a role for local school districts. There \nis a role for States, and there is a role for Federal Government, \nhowever small it is, in this country in terms of education.\n  The public has told us overwhelmingly time and time again they want \nthe Federal role to remain. The Federal role, historically, has been to \nmake sure the most needy and disadvantaged students in the country, \nwherever they are, are not left behind.\n  In the class size amendment, we target the funds directly to those \nkids because they need it the most and they are helped the most by it. \nThe underlying bill, which I am amending, as the\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nSenator from Massachusetts stated, block grants the money to title VI \nfunds and therefore is block granted to all students, and it is not \nwhat the Federal role has been or should continue to be. So the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is absolutely correct that this amendment is \nimportant.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further, there are no provisions to target these funds \nto the poverty districts, which runs in complete conflict as to what we \nunderstand. We are all for additional funding in terms of education, if \nthe States want to do it. But the funding, historically, that we have \nprovided has been targeted to those areas of special needs.\n  I have been enormously impressed with Project STAR in Tennessee, \nwhich studied 7,000 students in 80 schools. It was initiated in 1985 \nand has had extraordinarily positive and constructive results in terms \nof academic success for children.\n  I was in Wausau, WI, and met with a number of people who are involved \nin the SAGE Program, which was developed in 1995. Again, it is a \nprogram for smaller class size.\n  The SAGE program is intended to help raise student academic \nachievement by requiring that participating schools do the following: \nreduce the student-teacher ratio in class sizes from 15 to 1 in K \nthrough 3; stay open for extended hours; develop vigorous academic \ncurriculums; and implement plans for staff development and professional \naccountability.\n  I listened to the Senator speak about each of these issues. In \nWisconsin, they had at least one school serving 50% or more children \nliving in poverty was eligible to apply for participation in SAGE. One \nschool, with an enrollment of at least 30% or more children living in \npoverty, in each eligible district could participate. Again, it is \ntargeted among the most challenged children.\n  The evaluation done on the 30 schools that implemented the program is \nabsolutely remarkable.\n  In the SAGE Program, from 1996 to 1997, and again in 1997 to 1998, \nfirst grade classrooms scored significantly higher in all areas tested.\n  In 1997-1998, achievement advantage was maintained in the second \ngrade classrooms.\n  The achievement benefit of SAGE small class size was especially \nstrong for African-American students. In 1997-1998, the SAGE first \ngrade post-test results showed that African-American students were \nclosing the achievement gap.\n  Further, the analysis suggests that the teachers in these classrooms \nhave greater knowledge, to which the Senator from Washington spoke. \nThey spend less time managing their class and they have more time for \nindividualize instruction emphasizing a primarily teacher-centered \napproach.\n  This has had extraordinary success--it has been tried. When the \nMurray amendment was first accepted, it had broad bipartisan support. \nThat is why many of us find it troubling. When we have something that \nwe know has been successful, why are we moving in a different \ndirection? Will the Senator help me understand that in some way?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. There have been a number of studies that have followed class \nsize reduction--from the Tennessee study in 1985 and 1990; the STAR \nstudy in 1996-1997; the SAGE Program that the Senator from \nMassachusetts mentioned in 1998-1999; the educational testing service \nstudy in 1997; New York City school study in April 2000; the Council \nfor Greater City Schools in October of 1990.\n  All of these studies have followed up on what we have been able to do \nin reducing class size and have shown the same benefits of better \nstudent achievement, fewer discipline problems, and better test scores \nfor students as they moved into the upper grades.\n  It is astounding to me that we had a bipartisan agreement 2 years ago \nto begin to reduce class size and every year, it seems, we have to come \nback and argue this again, debate it again, move on to a vote, then get \nto a point in October where we again amend the budget, and finally put \nit in the budget.\n  It seems to me, and I assume to the Senator from Massachusetts, that \nwe would be smarter to put it in the bill now so school districts that \nare trying to figure out what we are doing will have the knowledge that \nthis program will continue; that they can begin to hire their teachers, \nas they do in the months of June and July, and be ready to move on \nwithout the question of being left out there.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one second \nwithout losing her right to the floor?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that votes occur in stacked sequence following the 5 p.m. vote \non the Wellstone amendment with 4 minutes equally divided prior to each \nvote for explanation on or in relation to the Bingaman and Murray \namendments, in that order, and no second-degree amendments be in order \nprior to the votes on any of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could just ask the Senator a \nquestion.\n  My State of Massachusetts hires an average of about 500 teachers each \nyear. That is certainly not going to solve all of the problems. But it \nis making an important difference in my State, particularly when we \nknow we have hired qualified teachers, and particularly when we know \nthat across the country we have hired 50,000 unqualified teachers. We \nare getting qualified teachers who are involved in these programs. The \nselection of these teachers are worked out through the local process. \nThat is a decision, I understand, that is made locally.\n  Unless the Senator's amendment is successful, what is going to happen \nto these teachers who have been effectively hired with the \nunderstanding that they are going to have the responsibility of \nteaching children in smaller class sizes?\n  We are now in the summertime. What sort of message does this send to \nschool boards, to teachers, and particularly to parents who may be \nlooking forward to their child staying in a smaller class size in the \nnext year, if the Murray amendment is not accepted?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts by reminding my colleagues that I formerly served on a \nschool board. I can tell you what you do in the months of June and \nJuly. You hire teachers and renew contracts. School districts out there \nthat have used the Federal dollars that we have provided them for the \nlast 2 years have hired those teachers and they now have to make a \ncommitment to continue.\n  For example, the Takoma School District in my home State of \nWashington used the class size dollars to reduce class sizes of 58 \nfirst grade classrooms. In that school district, they now have 15 \nstudents in those classrooms. It has made a tremendous difference. But \nthey have hired these additional teachers, and they are now looking at \nthe underlying bill that we have which says to them that this is now \ngoing to be a block grant with no guarantee that this money will go to \nthe most needy 80 percent of the schools. Under the block grant \nprogram, they are going to lose some of the money in their districts \nfor these teachers. They, therefore, right now can't make a commitment \nto these teachers that they will be able to hire them again in \nSeptember.\n  This sends a very bad message to local school boards across the \ncountry that have hired teachers. And school boards are not going to be \nable to make the commitment that they need to make. That is why this \namendment is so important. It will send a message today--right now, \nalmost at the end of June--that they can make a commitment to those \nteachers.\n  Being a teacher right now is extremely difficult, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts well knows. Most teachers aren't paid well. They have \ntrouble staying in schools because of the many challenges that are \nthere already with this kind of uncertainty: Well, we might be able to \nhire you. You have to wait and see what Congress does in a couple of \nmonths because they haven't given us a commitment. We are not sure you \nare going to be able to go back. If I were a teacher in those \ncircumstances, I would be out finding another job immediately. These \nteachers have to put food on the table, pay their rent, and they have \nall the expenses\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\nthe rest of us have. They can't live in an uncertain job market such as \nthis.\n  We have a responsibility to tell them the truth and to tell them what \nwe are doing. By passing the underlying amendment today, we will send a \nmessage to those school boards that they can give a commitment to those \nteachers, and those teachers will know where they will be in September. \nWithout passage of this amendment, I guarantee you that we are going to \nbe in a budget debate in October where we are going to be having the \nPresident say he will veto the budget without this. And we will be \nmaking a decision in October that we could very easily and simply make \ntoday.\n  That is why this amendment is so important.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Who loses out, if that is the case?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. First of all, our students, because they won't have the \nopportunity to be in a small class to which we committed.\n  I know parents today with kids in kindergarten who maybe had an older \nchild in first or second grade, because of reduced class sizes, have \ncalled, saying: Please, my second child is on the way. For my first \nchild, it has made such a difference in their life, being in a smaller \nclass size. Make sure my second child coming behind them has the same \nopportunity.\n  That is what we are talking about today. So kids in these classrooms \ncan read, learn, write, have an adult who has the time to pay attention \nto them. That is what this amendment guarantees to students in this \ncountry.\n  I have taught before. I know what it is to have too many kids in your \nclassroom, especially in today's overcrowded classrooms across this \ncountry. Kids come with all kinds of problems that many professionals \ndid not experience when we were in classrooms many years ago. In my \nclassroom, I had an experience sitting with 24 4-year-old kids talking \nabout the ABCs. When I called on one child, he looked directly at me \nand said: My dad did not come home last night; the police arrested him.\n  I didn't have the time to stop and deal with a child who certainly \nwas in a traumatic situation because I was going to lose the attention \nand the ability to discipline 23 other kids immediately.\n  With a class size of 15, and a child coming to the classroom with \ntraumatic problems, the teacher will have the time to sit down and deal \nwith that child.\n  I wonder what happened to that 4-year-old. That was several years \nago. I wonder what happened to him. If I had the time to deal with him, \nhe would probably be doing better today.\n  We have a responsibility, for so many reasons, to continue this \nfunding. The most important reason is because of the kids.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard the Senator from Washington tell that story \non other occasions, but I find it as powerful and as important hearing \nit again.\n  Does the Senator remember the first time the Class Size Reduction \nAmendment was accepted, and later it was promoted as one of the major \nachievements by the Republican Policy Committee? It was achievement No. \n13: Teacher Quality Initiative. It mentions the $1.2 billion additional \nfunds to school districts, returned to local schools for smaller class \nsizes. Then Mr. Goodling said:\n  This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more \nimportantly, it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are \nfed up with Washington mandates, red tape and regulation. We agree with \nthe President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal \ndoes not create big, new federal education programs. Rather our \nproposal will drive dollars directly to the classroom and gives local \neducators more options for spending federal funds to help disadvantaged \nchildren.\n  Mr. Gingrich called it, ``a victory for the American people. There \nwould be more teachers and that is good for Americans.'' Mr. Armey said \nthe same.\n  At one time, there was very strong support. The only thing that \nhappened in the meantime is the record has demonstrated that it is even \nmore effective than we could have imagined.\n  I am hopeful this Senate will go on record in support of the Murray \namendment. I am also hopeful it will support the Bingaman amendment on \naccountability. We spent a great deal of time on that issue. It is \nenormously compelling. The most recent GAO studies indicate the reasons \nthat should be supported. I hope we will support the Wellstone \namendment to make sure we provide resources. At a time when we have the \nrecord surpluses in this country, it seems to me we ought to be able to \nuse some resources to reach out, help, and assist children who would \notherwise be eligible if there were those resources, and give them a \ngood start from an education point of view.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this matter before \nthe Senate. I hope we will have a strong vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nquestions, comments, and support. I, too, am surprised our Republican \ncolleagues, who took full credit for this several years ago when we \nbegan it, sending out press releases touting it, don't understand this \nissue is still as powerful.\n  I have talked to many of my colleagues who have gone home to their \nStates and visited classrooms where Federal dollars were used to reduce \nclass size. The accolades received from the kids, the parents, the \nteachers, the people who work with the kids are tremendous.\n  I offer to my colleagues on the other side, who have consistently \nvoted against this, if Members want to have a good experience, vote for \nthis amendment, go home to a classroom and talk to the kids, the \nparents, and the teachers who have been directly impacted. You will see \nsome of the good that comes from voting on an amendment such as this.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota is on the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  I ask one question so the Senator can finish a very moving \npresentation. When I am in schools, which is every 2 weeks, I always \nhave a discussion with the students about education, and I ask them \nwhat makes for good education. They talk about good teachers, and they \ntalk about smaller class size. I ask my colleague, Is that the \nexperience the Senator has?\n  This is an amendment for all Senators who spend time in schools with \nkids in their States because I deal with students over and over again. \nThis is what we need; does the Senator hear the same thing?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely correct. We \nhear from teachers, students, and parents: Smaller class sizes are \ncritical, schools need to be safe, up to date, up to code, and teachers \nwho are trained and qualified and able to be in the classroom. Those \nare the top three changes parents request.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues how critical this issue is, and \nI ask for their help and support when this issue comes up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes of debate equally divided \nprior to the vote at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are 4 minutes equally divided on \nthe Wellstone amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my amendment simply says we take the \ntitle I and move the appropriation up from $8.36 billion to $10 \nbillion.\n  Our committee, the HELP committee, authorized the full $15 million \nfor the title I program. Title I money is used for additional help for \nkids in reading, for afterschool programs, for prekindergarten \nprograms, for professional development. This is a program which helps \nespecially low-income children throughout the country. This is a \nprogram in which the last half decade has made a difference.\n  As I said earlier, it is not Heaven on Earth, but it is a better \nEarth on Earth. We provide more help for kids. This is a very important \nprogram. I say to my colleague from Washington, again, if you go to \nyour school districts and schools and talk to teachers and parents, \nthey all say they need more help right now. This program is funded at \nabout a 30-percent level. Many more children all across the country \ncould be helped by this program if we were willing to make this \ninvestment.\n  I said it earlier; I will say it a final time. Vote for additional \nhelp for these\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\nkids, mainly the younger children, not because it makes them more \nproductive--it will; not because it prevents them from dropping out of \nschool--it will help; not because it makes a difference in terms of not \ndropping out of school or winding up in prison--that is true. Vote for \nit because the vast majority of them are under 4 feet tall. They are \nall beautiful and we ought to be nice to them. We ought to be able to \nprovide them with some more assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A point of order has been raised against this amendment \nbecause the bill already contains an $8.3 billion increase for this \nfunction. The bill also increases the title 1 program by $394 million \nover the current fiscal year level.\n  These provisions in the Senator's amendment are in violation of the \nBudget Act. We have raised a point of order reluctantly, but this bill \nis at its level under the budget resolution. We must object to the \nSenator's amendment on the basis that it does violate the Budget Act. I \nraise that point of order.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n  The legislative clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.--\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 146 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

The \npoint of order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the next \ntwo votes, if there are two votes, the time for each vote be 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3649\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the Bingaman amendment in order? What is \nthe regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bingaman amendment. There are 4 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am ready to yield back our time if \nSenator Bingaman is ready to yield back his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3649\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand the next order of business \nis the amendment I offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is a \nstraightforward amendment to add $250 million to the title I part of \nthe bill and provide that that funding has to be spent to ensure \naccountability in the expenditure of the remaining nearly $9 billion.\n  One of the problems we have had in the past--and it has been referred \nto by many Senators--is that we haven't had funds available to States \nand local school districts to ensure that title I funds are spent to \naccomplish their purposes. We need to enable States to assist failing \nschools. They have not been doing that effectively. The Council of \nChief State School Officers supports this. I have a letter from them \nthat I have printed in the Record.\n  Last year, we put $134 million into this effort on this exact bill. \nThis year, the President has requested we put $250 million into it. \nThat is what my amendment proposes to do. Otherwise, current law limits \nthem to one-half of 1 percent of the title I funds. They cannot ensure \naccountability unless we add this amendment. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as the Senator has mentioned, this is $250 \nmillion of additional funds that exceeds the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time, if the Senator from New \nMexico is ready to yield back.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that under \nsubsection 302(f) of the Budget Act, as amended, the effect of adopting \nthe amendment provides budget authority in excess of the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation under the fiscal year 2001 concurrent resolution on \nthe budget and is not in order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget \nAct, I move to waive the applicable sections of the act for \nconsideration of the pending amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Bingaman amendment No. 3649. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 147 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the well be cleared.\n  That includes everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Everyone will clear the well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 49; the nays are \n50. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3604\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes equally divided on the \nMurray amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment we are now going to vote on \nsimply continues our commitment to reduce class sizes for the first \nthrough the third grades across this country. Because of the work we \nhave done in the past day, 1.7 million children are in smaller class \nsizes.\n  We have a commitment. We should keep our commitment to continue to \nreduce class size. The underlying bill simply block grants the money. \nThat will hurt our neediest and most disadvantaged students who will \nlose under that kind of proposal.\n  School boards are meeting today to determine who they will keep as \nteachers and whether they will be able to make a commitment in the \nhiring of teachers.\n  We should make this decision now so those school boards can make the \ndecisions for the coming school year rather than once again negotiating \nthis in October when the President has said he will veto a bill that \ndoes not keep the commitment to reduce class size.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment today and prevent \nschool boards across the country from having to wonder all summer long \nif we are going to keep our commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this bill accommodates the President's \nrequest for $1.4 billion for class size reduction. It is joined with \n$1.3 billion for school construction, trying to structure a bill which \ncould be signed. But we leave, in the final analysis, the judgment to \nthe local boards as to whether the local boards decide that they do not \nneed construction or if they do not need class size reduction.\n  That is what is objected to by the Senator from Washington. We have \ngone more than halfway to meet the President in putting up this money.\n  In addition, the Murray amendment would add $350 million, which \nexceeds our allocation. We think we are stretching and stretching and \nstretching. If the President is going to veto this bill, then let him \ndo so. We expect to present this bill to him long before the end of the \nfiscal year, and then we will debate it before the American public.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment violates section 302(f) of \nthe Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable sections \nof that act for consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Murray amendment No. 3604. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 44, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 148 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I don't \nwant to object to my friend doing his 10 minutes--I would like to know \nwhat we are doing on the bill. I hope we will have some information so \nSenators will know whether we are going to go ahead and debate this and \nhave amendments tonight or not, on our bill.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Shelby pertaining to the introduction of S. 2801 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the rejection of the last motion to waive, \nI think, was a wise action on the part of the Senate. I am here \nprimarily to congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania for the way in \nwhich he has dealt with the challenge of education in this bill. More \nthan $40 billion for education is a very substantial increase over the \ncurrent year.\n  That is more than a $1 billion increase in special education \nprograms, at least moving us one step further toward the promise of 40-\npercent funding of the cost of special education to the school \ndistricts of the United States.\n  In my view, the centerpiece of this bill is in its expression of \ntrust and confidence in our local school authorities, our parents, our \nteachers, our principals, our superintendents, our elected school board \nmembers, a trust and confidence expressed in a more than $3 billion \nappropriation for title VI, the innovative education program \nstrategies.\n  The last amendment would have taken roughly half of that amount of \nmoney and mandated that it go solely for additional teachers in the \nfirst three grades. Title VI, as it appears in this bill, says in \neffect our school districts--the men and women who know our children's \nnames--are better suited to make the decisions in 17,000 separate \nschool districts about what can most improve the quality of education \nfor their children. As such, we are far better off passing the bill as \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania has written it than we would be in \nincluding more mandates in this bill.\n  There are at least two outside experts who agree with that \nproposition. One comes in an interesting paper by Andy Rotherham at the \nProgressive Policy Institute, an arm of the Democratic Leadership \nCouncil. He now, incidentally, works for President Clinton. He wrote a \nlittle bit more than a year ago:\n\n       President Clinton's $1.2 billion class-size reduction \n     initiative, passed in 1998, illustrates Washington's \n     obsession with means at the expense of results and also the \n     triumph of symbolism over sound policy. The goal of raising \n     student achievement is reasonable and essential; however, \n     mandating localities do it by reducing class sizes precludes \n     local decision-making and unnecessarily involves Washington \n     in local affairs.\n\n  In my own State, the Legislative Audit and Review Committee came to \nthis conclusion:\n\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\n\n       An analysis of 60 well-designed studies found that \n     increased teacher education, teacher experience and teacher \n     salaries all had a greater impact on student test scores per \n     dollar spent than did lowering the student-teacher ratio. \n     According to one researcher, ``Teachers who know a lot about \n     teaching and learning and who work in settings that allow \n     them to know their students well are the critical elements of \n     successful learning.'' Given limited funds to invest, this \n     research suggests considering efforts to improve teacher \n     access to high quality professional development. A recent \n     national survey of teachers found that many do not feel well \n     prepared to face future teaching challenges, including \n     increasing technological changes and greater diversity in the \n     classroom.\n       The legislature's--\n\n  In this case, Washington--\n\n       approach to funding K-12 education is consistent. . . . The \n     legislature has provided additional funding for teacher \n     salaries, staff development, and smaller classes, with more \n     funding going to support teachers and less for reducing the \n     student-teacher ratio.\n\n  The point is that reducing class size is not a bad option. It is a \ngood option. I think we can all agree that it is one good thing for \nstudents. It is best done, however, when the decision about whether or \nnot to do it and how it is to be accomplished is made in local \ncommunities and not in Washington, DC.\n\n  Even that proposal pales in comparison with the now platform of the \nVice President of the United States. He calls for a massive Federal \neffort from recruiting to setting teaching standards in a sense that \nwill make the Federal Government clearly a national school board. \nTeachers who please Washington, DC, bureaucrats will get bonuses. Those \nwho do not do so will risk being fired.\n  The only thing bold about that initiative is that he has no qualms in \ntaking over each and every one of the 17,000 school districts in the \nUnited States. If he becomes our President, education policy will \nundergo a significant shift. Local community school boards and teachers \nwill be shut out of the process.\n  What we are doing in this bill is moving significantly in the right \ndirection. There is little disagreement over the necessity of a \nsignificant Federal contribution to education. It is only about 7 \npercent of the money we have spent, but it is the persistent drive of \nthis administration and of this Department of Education to increase to \nwell over 50 percent the rules and regulations governing our schools \nthat accompany that 7 percent.\n  This bill takes a dramatic step in a far better direction, a \ndirection in which the support from the Congress is generous, but the \ntrust of the Congress in the ability of school boards, teachers, \nprincipals, and superintendents to make decisions about our education \nis vastly increased all to the benefit of our children's education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are a couple of Senators who are \nreviewing language, and I hope we can enter into this unanimous consent \nagreement momentarily. While we are waiting on that, I will outline \nwhat we have worked out.\n  We have an agreement that I believe will satisfy all the Senators \ninvolved.\n  The Smith amendment will be modified with changes that are at the \ndesk. Then it will be in order for Senators Hatch and Leahy to offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to the pending McCain amendment No. 3610. I \nbelieve Senator Specter will be prepared to do that on behalf of \nSenator Hatch. Then there will be 10 minutes equally divided for debate \nrelative to the first- and second-degree amendments. I believe that \nwill be McCain and Hatch. Then we will ask the amendments be laid \naside, and the Santorum amendment will recur, with the time between \nthat time, which will be about 6:30 p.m., I presume, and 7 o'clock to \nbe equally divided between the Senators who are interested--Senator \nMcCain and Senator Santorum--and we will have two voice votes on the \nSmith issue and then two votes back to back on McCain and then \nSantorum.\n  That is the outline of what we will do. We will have two recorded \nvotes then at 7 o'clock. I am prepared to offer that unanimous consent \nrequest at this time.\n  I will read the unanimous consent request. I believe Senator Smith \nwill be here in a moment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3628, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smith \namendment be modified with the changes that are at the desk and, \nfurther, the amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3628), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.  . FETAL TISSUE.\n\n       The General accounting Office shall conduct a comprehensive \n     study into Federal involvement in the use of fetal tissue, \n     for research purposes within the scope of this bill, be \n     completed by September 1, 2000. The study shall include but \n     not be limited to--\n       (a) The annual number of orders for fetal tissue filed in \n     conjunction with Federally funded fetal tissue research or \n     programs over the last 3 years;\n       (b) the costs associated with the procurement, \n     dissemination, and other use of fetal tissue, including but \n     not limited to the cots associated with the processing, \n     transportation, preservation, quality control, and storage, \n     of such tissue;\n       (c) The manner in which Federal agencies ensure that \n     intramural and extramural research facilities and their \n     employees comply with Federal fetal tissue law;\n       (d) The number of fetal tissue procurement contractors and \n     tissue resource sources, or other entities or individuals \n     that are used to obtain, transport, process, preserve, or \n     store fetal tissue, which receive Federal funds and the \n     quantity, form, and nature of the services provided, and the \n     amount of Federal funds received by such entities;\n       (e) The number and identity of all Federal agencies, within \n     the scope of this bill, expending or exchanging Federal funds \n     in connection with obtaining or processing fetal tissue or \n     the conduct of research using such tissue;\n       (f) The extent to which Federal fetal tissue procurement \n     policies and guidelines adhere to Federal law;\n       (g) The criteria that Federal fetal tissue research \n     facilities use for selecting their fetal tissue sources, and \n     the manner in which the facilities ensure that such sources \n     comply with Federal law.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor Senators Hatch and Leahy to offer a second-degree amendment to the \npending McCain amendment No. 3610; that there be 10 minutes equally \ndivided for debate concurrently relative to the first- and second-\ndegree amendments. I further ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nthen be laid aside and that the Santorum amendment recur, with the time \nbetween then and 7 p.m. equally divided, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote in relation to that amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the Hatch-Leahy second-degree amendment at 7 p.m. this \nevening, and following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the McCain amendment, as amended, if amended, to be \nfollowed by a vote relative to the Santorum amendment, with 4 minutes \nprior to each vote for explanation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, do \nI understand correctly, I ask my friend from Mississippi, that on the \nHatch-Leahy amendment, somewhere within the agreement there is time on \nthat?\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some of that time is time for the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have 10 minutes that would be equally divided \non that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. So the Senator would have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is fine. Plain enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears no objection, and, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I believe we are ready to \nproceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I might ask the leader, so everyone \nknows, what we are facing are three recorded votes beginning at 7 \no'clock; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Two.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have two recorded votes, one on McCain and one on \nSantorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3653 To Amendment No. 3610\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3653 to amendment \n     numbered 3610.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the end the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROVISION OF INTERNET FILTERING OR SCREENING \n                   SOFTWARE BY CERTAIN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Provide.--Each Internet service provider \n     shall at the time of entering an agreement with a residential \n     customer for the provision of Internet access services, \n     provide to such customer, either at no fee or at a fee not in \n     excess of the amount specified in subsection (c), computer \n     software or other filtering or blocking system that allows \n     the customer to prevent the access of minors to material on \n     the Internet.\n       (b) Surveys of Provision of Software or Systems.--\n       (1) Surveys.--The Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention of the Department of Justice and the \n     Federal Trade Commission shall jointly conduct surveys of the \n     extent to which Internet service providers are providing \n     computer software or systems described in subsection (a) to \n     their subscribers. In performing such surveys, neither the \n     Department nor the Commission shall collect personally \n     identifiable information of subscribers of the Internet \n     service providers.\n       (2) Frequency.--The surveys required by paragraph (1) shall \n     be completed as follows:\n       (A) One shall be completed not later than one year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (B) One shall be completed not later than two years after \n     that date.\n       (C) One shall be completed not later than three years after \n     that date.\n       (c) Fees.--The fee, if any, charged and collected by an \n     Internet service provider for providing computer software or \n     a system described in subsection (a) to a residential \n     customer shall not exceed the amount equal to the cost of the \n     provider in providing the software or system to the \n     subscriber, including the cost of the software or system and \n     of any license required with respect to the software or \n     system.\n       (d) Applicability.--The requirement described in subsection \n     (a) shall become effective only if--\n       (1) 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Office and the Commission determine as a result of the survey \n     completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(A) that less \n     than 75 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided computer software or systems described in \n     subsection (a) by such providers;\n       (2) 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Office and the Commission determine as a result of the survey \n     completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(B) that less \n     than 85 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided such software or systems by such providers; or\n       (3) 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, if \n     the Office and the Commission determine as a result of the \n     survey completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(C) that \n     less than 100 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided such software or systems by such providers.\n       (e) Internet Service Provider Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``Internet servicer provider'' means a service \n     provider as defined in section 512(k)(1)(A) of title 17, \n     United States Code, which has more than 50,000 subscribers.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Leahy and myself. I believe this amendment is going to be \naccepted because it clarifies some matters that are very good.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this Hatch-Leahy amendment \nwhich is aimed at limiting the negative impact violence and indecent \nmaterial on the Internet have on children.\n  This amendment does not regulate content. Instead it encourages the \nlarger Internet service providers to provide, either for free or at a \nfee not exceeding the cost to the service providers, filtering \ntechnologies that would empower parents to limit or block access of \nminors to unsuitable material on the Internet.\n  We simply can not ignore the fact that the Internet has the ability \nto expose children to violent, sexually explicit and other \ninappropriate materials with no limits.\n  A recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 \nbelieve the Internet is partly responsible for crimes like the \nColumbine High School shooting.\n  Our amendment respects the First Amendment of the Constitution by not \nregulating content, but ensures that parents will have the adequate \ntechnological tools to control the access of their children to \nunsuitable material on the Internet.\n  I honestly believe that the Internet service providers who do not \nalready provide filtering software to their subscribers will do so \nvoluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests and that the \nmarket will demand it.\n  A recent survey reported in the New York Times yesterday, found that \nalmost a third of online American households with children use blocking \nsoftware.\n  In a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of \nPennsylvania, 60 percent of parents said they disagreed with the \nstatement that the Internet was a safe place for their children.\n  And according to yesterday's New York Times, after the shootings in \nColorado, the demand for filtering technologies has dramatically \nincreased. This indicates that parents are taking an active role in \nsafeguarding their children on the Internet.\n  That is what this amendment is about: using technology to empower the \nparent. I urge my colleagues' approval of the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Leahy, who would like to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I described this amendment earlier this \nmorning on the floor. But for those who came in late, this is an \namendment that Senator Hatch and I offered on the juvenile justice \nbill. You may recall when we voted on that, the vote was 100-0.\n  It is a filtering proposal that leaves the solution on how best to \nprotect children from inappropriate online materials accessible on \ncomputers in schools and libraries to the local school boards and \ncommunities.\n  Anybody who spends any time on the Internet knows that there is \ninappropriate material for children on there. And oftentimes you might \nhit it accidentally.\n  Having said that, we also know that you should not block out certain \nonline material because somebody thinks that Mark Twain is \ninappropriate or they may believe that James Joyce is inappropriate, or \nother such things, or it may be even the paintings on the Sistine \nChapel that some may believe are inappropriate because there are nude \nfigures in there. You have to have some kind of balance.\n  I think that local communities can do that. I know of libraries, for \nexample, that put computers monitors that have Internet access right \nout in the main reading room. This is one form of blocking because \nthere are not too many children who are going to be downloading wild, \noffensive things when they know their parents, their teachers, and the \nlibrarians are going to be walking back and forth and seeing it.\n  As I explained earlier today, I have serious concerns with the McCain \nproposal to require schools and libraries to send certifications to the \nFCC about their installation of certain blocking software and the risk \nthat the FCC will become a national censorship office, with the \nresponsibility of both policing local enforcement of the Internet \naccess policy and exacting punishment in the form of ordering E-rate \ndiscounts to stop and carriers be reimbursed.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment would require large Internet service \nproviders with more than 50,000 subscribers to provide residential \ncustomers, either for free or at low cost, software or other filtering \nsystems that can protect them. It is relatively easy to do this.\n  I would encourage parents, if this passes, to get that software and \nalso spend some time seeing what their children are looking at on the \nInternet. This requirement on large Internet Service Providers would \nonly become effective if surveys conducted jointly by the FTC and the \nDepartment of Justice demonstrate that voluntary efforts are not \nworking.\n  Senator McCain has worked very hard on this. I commend him for it.\n  Any one of us who has young children has to worry about this. We also \nhave to worry about what they are reading in the library or what they \npick up at the corner bookstore or anything else.\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\n  But before we reach a point where we assume we can be the parent of \nevery child in this country, I think we ought to give to the parents \nthe tools to use, and let them make the kind of judgments and show the \nkind of observation of their children that parents should, and that my \nparents did and that I do with my children.\n  I think the reason the Hatch-Leahy amendment passed 100-0 earlier in \nthe juvenile justice bill is because it is a reasonable compromise. It \nis a reasonable compromise. I hope it will be added on to this bill. I \nlook forward to working with Senator McCain as this bill moves to \nconference to address the serious concerns I and others have with his \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy \nfor this amendment. I think it is a very positive contribution. I think \nit is one that will again empower parents to be able to screen and \nfilter information that their children may be receiving. It is \nsomething that I think will be very helpful to this bill, and I \nstrongly support it.\n  I know we have spent some time working out the details of this \namendment. I think it is a very good one. I thank Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hatch for their involvement in this very important issue.\n  I will urge, at the appropriate time, a voice vote and adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     amendments nos. 3635 and 3610\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, are we now on the time for the McCain \nand Santorum amendments to be debated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Arizona if he wants to divide \nthe remaining time in half. I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nequally divided, and that I control the time in support of my amendment \nand Senator McCain control the other time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I discussed very briefly today, I \nrise in support of what the Senator from Arizona is trying to \naccomplish. I think he was the first to bring this issue to the floor \nof the Senate. He is to be congratulated for that.\n  He has a piece of legislation that has been out there for a couple of \nyears and has fostered a lot of good thought and a lot of discussion as \nto what the best Federal policy should be in dealing with the problem \nof inappropriate use of the Internet at schools and libraries. His \nlegislation actually led me to look further into it as constituents \ncontacted me with respect to it. So let me say, from the outset, I \ncongratulate the Senator from Arizona for his work and for his effort \nin this area.\n  I have a little different approach I want to talk about today that I \nbelieve improves upon the base bill that Senator McCain came up with a \ncouple of years ago. I have been working with a group of people, from \nthe left to the right, if you will--from the Catholic Conference to the \nNational Education Association, from the American Libraries Association \nto Dr. Laura Schlessinger. So I think our effort here covers the \nideological spectrum pretty well and is a consensus that is built \naround one thing--that while Internet filtering software is a good \nidea, generally speaking, it is an imperfect tool to meet the real \ncomplicated needs of teachers, administrators, and librarians who have \nto deal with the Internet on a daily basis in their schools.\n  I think the Catholic Conference put it best in their letter, actually \nto Senator McCain, which says that his legislation ``fails to include \none of the most effective tools utilized by the vast majority of \nCatholic schools throughout our Nation, the Ethical Internet Use \nPolicy''--in other words, a comprehensive policy at the school level to \ndeal with not only access to sites that may be inappropriate on the \nInternet, which is what filtering gets to, but a variety of different \nthings that are very important.\n  For example, electronic mail. Unfortunately, we hear so many stories \nabout people being contacted through electronic mail, chatrooms, that \nare if not as dangerous in some cases even more dangerous than the \nsites that may be accessed on the World Wide Web, where you have \npredators who are out there trying to grab the mind of a young person.\n  Again, the attempt to do filtering software is helpful. But we have \nto have a policy developed at the community level that deals with \nthings that go beyond these dangerous Internet sites, such as the \nelectronic mail and chatrooms, and other kinds of direct electronic \ncommunication.\n  Under this legislation, we require that a policy be developed at the \nlocal level with respect to unauthorized use of minors, such as \nhacking, another area which is of grave concern not just for the minors \nthemselves but for the user community at large, and a policy with \nrespect to the dissemination of personal information of the minor. \nThese minors log on. They have personal information in there. There \nneeds to be a policy to take care of that.\n  What our legislation simply does is--it would actually amend the \nMcCain amendment, although not formally here in the Senate--say that \nyou must have a local policy that includes, No. 1, at least, public \nhearing and notice requirements, a public hearing where the community \ngets together and, at the community level, we come up with an Internet \npolicy that has to meet these certain criteria. In other words, we \ndon't say how they do it, but that, in fact, they have policies that \naddress these broader concerns than just eliminating one particular \nInternet site or Internet sites. So it is, in fact, a requirement to \ndevelop a local policy.\n  If they choose not to do that, then the McCain language becomes \noperative. You must buy filtering software. We don't require filtering \nsoftware. Even the Senator from Arizona has admitted there are 90-some \ntitles out there--some are good; some are not. His legislation doesn't \ndirect you to have buy a good one; you just have to buy one. It is \ncertainly not the most comprehensive way of dealing with it. In fact, \nit may be a way that creates a false sense of security that you are \ndealing with problems, and it may actually reduce the amount of \noversight that should be present in schools and at public libraries.\n  Again, I compliment the Senator, but we need to take one step \nfurther. Given the problems we have seen develop through chatrooms, \nthrough e-mail, through hackers, and through dissemination of \ninformation about minors, to do it at the local level is the best way \nto accomplish this with the fallback hammer, if you will, of the McCain \nunderlying requirement to buy filtering software.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. It does provide for schools and libraries to deploy \nblocking or filtering technology. The amendment provides what is \nessentially a status quo loophole.\n  The Senator's amendment would allow schools and libraries the option \nof implementing an acceptable use policy. Schools and libraries are \nfree to do this today. Papers are full of reports of young children \nsurfing foreign libraries in school and being innocently exposed to \npornography downloaded by adults and left on a computer screen for \nchildren to see.\n  It is interesting to note that the American Library Association, an \noutspoken advocate for the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nis adamantly opposed to use of filters or any other type of protection \nfor children.\n  In 1997, the American Library Association passed a resolution against \nfiltering Internet pornography out of public libraries. The ALA's \ninterpretation of their resolution contained in their library bill of \nrights states that the rights of users who are minors shall in no way \nbe abridged. According to Judith Krug, director of ALA's Office of \nIntellectual Freedom:\n\n       Blocking material leads to censorship. That goes for \n     pornography and bestiality, too. If you don't like it, don't \n     look at it.\n\n  Ms. Krug goes on to discuss the concerns of parents about their \nchildren viewing pornography on library computers:\n\n       If you don't want your children to access information, you \n     had better be with your children when they use a computer.\n\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\n\n  That would be very interesting information to working mothers all \nover America as well as working fathers. I guess this is the ALA's \nconcept of an acceptable use policy: Parents beware.\n\n  The Santorum amendment does nothing about adult computer use in \nlibraries. This amendment would require libraries to block or filter \naccess to child pornography. I want to describe what my bill does as \nfar as local control is concerned. It requires that schools and \nlibraries must block or filter children's access to child pornography \nand obscene material. Further, libraries must block adult access to \nchild pornography on all computers. Why? Because we know that neither \ncategory, child pornography nor obscene material, enjoys protection \nunder the first amendment. The Supreme Court has decided that on \nseveral occasions.\n  Though the bill is clear on what sort of material must be blocked, \nlocal authorities are given complete authority to select the type of \nsoftware they deem to be appropriate. Further, local authorities are \ngiven unfettered authority to determine what material can constitute \nchild pornography and obscenity. Under this legislation, the Federal \nGovernment is expressly prohibited from interfering in the process of \nlocal control. Schools and libraries are simply required to certify to \nthe FCC they have a technology in place and are using such technology \nin coordination with the locally developed policy designed to achieve \nthe goals of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Schools and \nlibraries are required to make their blocking and filtering policies \npublicly available so that parents, patrons, and citizens can \nscrutinize the policies and work with local authorities to ensure they \nreflect contemporary community standards.\n  Again, parents beware of the status quo loophole contained in the \nSantorum amendment. It is big enough for every pornographer, pedophile, \nand hate group in America to drive a truck through.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has criticized my amendment with the \nclaim that my amendment does nothing to address chatrooms. The Senator \nis mistaken. First, schools and libraries are granted the unfettered \nauthority to block access to any material they determine to be \ninappropriate for minors. Clearly, this would provide them with the \nability to restrict kids' access to chatrooms or any other realm of the \nInternet. Despite claims to the contrary, blocking and filtering \nsoftware does restrict such access. The state-of-the-art technology \nclearly is capable of blocking such access. Filtering software would \nrestrict any communication based off keyword restrictions.\n  I could go on, but I will wrap things up with a letter signed by \nvirtually every major pro-family group. I ask unanimous consent this \nletter, dated June 22, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  American Family Association,\n\n                             Washington, DC Office, June 22, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We strongly oppose the Neighborhood \n     Children's Internet Protection Act, S. 1545, which we believe \n     would be an ineffective tool to protect children from \n     Internet pornography in schools and public libraries. The \n     bill offers schools and libraries the option of either \n     blocking pornography or implementing an Internet use policy. \n     It is this option that troubles us. Schools and libraries \n     have that option today and, sadly, most have chosen to allow \n     children access even to illegal pornography, such as \n     obscenity and child pornography. Under S. 1545, we presume \n     those schools and libraries would maintain the status quo.\n       It also must be noted that the Neighborhood Children's \n     Internet Protection Act only addresses use of computers by \n     children. A major problem, particularly in libraries, is the \n     use of computers by adults to access illegal pornography. For \n     example, pedophiles are accessing child pornography on \n     library computers and some are even molesting children in \n     those libraries. Yet, S. 1545 does not address this matter.\n       While we believe that the author of this bill, Senator Rick \n     Santorum (R-PA), has the best of intentions, his bill will \n     not provide an effective solution to the problem of \n     pornography in schools and public libraries.\n\n     American Family Association\n     Family Research Council\n     National Law Cntr. for Children & Families\n     Traditional Values Coalition\n     Morality in Media\n     Family Friendly Libraries\n     Citizens for Community Values, OH\n     Family Policy Network, VA\n     Christian Action League, NC\n     Family Association of Minnesota\n     American Family Assoc., OH\n     American Family Assoc., MI\n     American Family Assoc., KY\n     American Family Assoc., PA\n     American Family Assoc., TX\n     American Family Assoc., AR\n     American Family Assoc., MS\n     American Family Assoc., NJ\n     American Family Assoc., AL\n     American Family Assoc., GA\n     American Family Assoc., MO\n     American Family Assoc., CO\n     American Family Assoc., OR\n     American Family Assoc., IA\n     American Family Assoc., IN\n     American Family Assoc., NY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reading from the letter:\n\n       Senator McCain: We strongly oppose the Neighborhood \n     Children's Internet Protection Act which we believe would be \n     an ineffective tool to protect children from Internet \n     pornography in schools and public libraries. The bill offers \n     schools and libraries the option of either blocking \n     pornography or implementing an Internet use policy. It is \n     this option that troubles us. Schools and libraries have that \n     option today and, sadly, most have chosen to allow children \n     access even to illegal pornography, such as obscenity and \n     child pornography. Under S. 1545, we presume these schools \n     and libraries would maintain the status quo.\n       It also must be noted that the Children's Internet \n     Protection Act only addresses use of computers by children. A \n     major problem, particularly in libraries, is the use of \n     computers by adults to access illegal pornography. For \n     example, pedophiles are accessing child pornography on \n     library computers and some are even molesting children in \n     these libraries. Yet, S. 1545 does not address this matter.\n       While we believe that the author of this bill, Senator Rick \n     Santorum (R-PA), has the best of intentions, his bill will \n     not provide an effective solution to the problem of \n     pornography in schools and public libraries.\n\n  That is signed by a large group of people, including the American \nFamily Association, Family Research Council, National Law Center for \nChildren and Families, Traditional Values Coalition, et cetera.\n  On the other side, the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nsupported by the American Library Association. On that note, I will \nread very briefly from an editorial contained in the January 14, 2000, \nWall Street Journal:\n\n       Maybe blocking software is not the solution. We do know, \n     however, that there are answers for those interested in \n     finding them, answers that are technologically possible, \n     constitutionally sound and eminently sane. After all, when it \n     comes to print, librarians have no problem discriminating \n     against Hustler in favor of House & Garden. Indeed, to \n     dramatize the ALA's inconsistency regarding adult content in \n     print and online, blocking software advocate David Burt three \n     years ago announced ``The Hustler Challenge''--a standing \n     offer to pay for a year's subscription to Hustler for any \n     library that wanted one. Needless to say, there haven't been \n     any takers.\n       Our guess is that this is precisely what Leonard Kniffel, \n     the editor of the ALA journal American Libraries, was getting \n     at last fall when he asked in an editorial: ``What is \n     preventing this Association . . . from coming out with a \n     public statement denouncing children's access to pornography \n     and offering 700+ ways to fight it?''\n       Good question. And we'll learn this weekend whether the ALA \n     hierarchy believes it worthy of an answer.\n\n  The ALA hierarchy met, and obviously they seemed to defend what I \nbelieve is an indefensible position.\n  I hope we will defeat the Santorum amendment. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the critique of the \nSenator from Arizona who says ours is really status quo and this is a \nlarge loophole, it is not status quo. No. 1, it is not required under \nlaw today; we require a public notice and a public hearing and a policy \nto be formulated at the local level that addresses inappropriate matter \non the Internet, the World Wide Web, electronic mail, chatrooms, and \nother forms of direct electronic communication, such as hacking and \nother unlawful activities by monitors, and any other kind of \ndissemination of personal identification information regarding minors.\n  That is not current law. The review body is the same review body in \nhis legislation, the FCC. He requires a filtering software to be \npurchased, and you have to certify that with the FCC. We say that you \nhave to implement a\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\npolicy, have public hearings and meetings, and you have to submit that \npolicy to the FCC for them to review to ensure that you have covered \nthe areas that we require. That is not status quo.\n  He may not agree that decision should be made at the local level, and \nI accept that. I think we have an honest philosophical disagreement on \nwhether we should have a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate that you \nhave to buy filtering software. By the way, that filtering software may \ncover chatrooms; it may not. That is called monitoring software. There \nis no requirement for monitoring software to be covered for this, just \nfiltering software. Some filtering software is better than others; some \nis comprehensive, some is not, and some is older. There is no \nrequirement as to what software and how good it is that needs to be \npurchased under the McCain legislation.\n  What we say is that we believe this is best implemented at the local \nlevel. If you read from the Catholic Conference--and the Senator from \nArizona suggested that all the profamily groups were supporting his \nlegislation. I think the Catholic Conference can stand up as a \nprofamily group, and they don't support the McCain legislation; they \nsupport ours. I think one of you who are Dr. Laura Schlessinger \nlisteners know that she has been outspoken on the issue of Internet \npornography and has been leading a campaign on that issue. She has been \nworking with us and she supports the idea of having local communities \nhave public hearings and notices so parents know they can have input so \nthat we can raise the visibility of the issue at the local level in \ndealing with a variety of issues, not just a simple filtering software \nmandated by Washington, DC.\n  So it is a one-size-fits-all, and I believe incomplete, solution. Do \nyou trust the local schools and do you trust the local communities to \ncome up with a standard that meets the needs of that community? That is \nmuch more comprehensive by definition--it has to be--than the filtering \nsoftware alternative being offered by Senator McCain. I just suggest, \nand historically I have supported--particularly in the area of \neducation--local communities making those decisions for themselves, as \nopposed to a Federal mandate from Washington, DC.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want the Record to be clear that the \nCatholic Conference is not in opposition to this legislation. Here is \nthe problem contained in the report ``Filtering Facts,'' which is a \nvery deep, detailed analysis of this problem that we are facing.\n  On page 8 is a chapter entitled ``Adults Accessing Child Pornography: \n20 Incidents'':\n\n       There were 20 incidents of adults accessing child \n     pornography in public libraries. Child pornography is \n     different from other forms of pornography in that it is \n     absolutely illegal and, like drugs, is treated as contraband \n     by Federal law. Of particular concern is that many public \n     libraries employ policies that would seem to encourage the \n     illegal transmission of child pornography. Many public \n     libraries not only have privacy screens, but also destroy \n     patron sign-up sheets after use, and employ computer programs \n     that delete any trace of user activity. These policies make \n     it almost impossible for law enforcement to catch pedophiles \n     using public library Internet stations to download child \n     pornography. At the Multnomah County, OR, Public Library, and \n     the Los Angeles, CA, Public Library, pedophiles have taken \n     advantage of the anonymity to actually run child pornography \n     businesses using library computers 34 and 35.\n       The staff at Anderson, IN, Public Library observed a \n     pedophile accessing child pornography on three separate \n     occasions: ``A customer who is known to frequent Internet \n     sites containing sexually explicit pictures of nude boys . . \n     . This is the third time this customer has been observed \n     engaging in this activity.'' Yet, the only appropriate action \n     the library saw fit was to ``highly recommend that he be \n     restricted from the building for a period of not less than 2 \n     months.''\n       One of the two incidents where the library actually \n     notified police occurred at the Lakewood, OH, Public Library. \n     In an account from the Akron Beacon Journal, ``But it was the \n     library more than the police and prosecutor that alarmed \n     Chris Link, executive director of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union of Ohio. Traditionally, librarians have \n     protected their records of lending activity to the point of \n     being subpoenaed or going to jail,'' she said. But now, she \n     said, ``Librarians are scrutinizing what it is you look at \n     and reporting you to the police.'' In the case of kiddie \n     porn, Link said, such scrutiny ``would seem to make sense'' \n     until it is viewed in light of the Government's history of \n     searches for socialists and communists or members of certain \n     student movements.\n       The Callaway County, MO, Public Library even actively \n     resisted police efforts to investigate a patron accessing \n     child pornography. Library staff refused to cooperate, even \n     when issued subpoenas.\n\n  Mr. President, the list goes on and on. There is a need for this kind \nof legislation to make sure that child pornography and forms of \nobscenity, which are clearly delineated by the U.S. Supreme Court and \nare beyond any constitutional protection, are made unavailable to \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, this Santorum amendment would remove that very \nimportant provision of this legislation. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the Senator, we do not \nremove the requirement. We say that we would like to see the local \ncommunity participate and develop a comprehensive policy. If they fail \nto do so, then they have to buy the filtering system. I have visited \n160 schools since I have been in office. Over the last year and a half, \nin particular, I have talked to a lot of school librarians and \nadministrators about the Internet and Internet pornography. All of the \nones I have talked to, when I discussed the legislation and the ideas--\nin fact, some of this has come from the schools themselves throughout \nPennsylvania. The ones who glow about their policy are the ones who \nhave comprehensive policies.\n  Yes, they have filtering software, but that is just a piece of a \nbigger puzzle. If you just rely on that piece, I think what you can do \nis create a false sense of security that you have solved the problem, \nparticularly in community libraries. I argue that in requiring public \nhearings and notice and input, that will put a chilling effect on some \nof the librarians who Senator McCain referred to, who maybe are not as \nconcerned about pornography as they should be, or not as concerned \nabout chatrooms as they should be, or not as concerned about e-mails as \nthey should be. But a public consciousness and the public input that \nwill result from a community standard being applied to those people who \nwork at these facilities is the answer to that--not a filtering \nsoftware which is imprecise and, in cases of chatrooms, hacking, e-\nmail, and a variety of other things, ineffective. It is not \ncomprehensive. And so I agree.\n  There is nobody who would like to see more protection from that than \nme. I have five little kids under the age of 10. So I understand the \nneed and the concern. I come here as a father who is very concerned \nabout the ability of children to be able to access sites they should \nnot get to or communicate with people with whom they have no business \ncommunicating. But it is up to the community to take an interest in \ntheir children, to design a policy that is comprehensive, and this \nrequires a comprehensive policy. By the way, if the librarians and \nthose who run the libraries or the schools say they don't want to deal \nwith this, then you have the McCain mandate. You will have the mandate \nthat you have to buy the filtering software. So they can't avoid doing \nsomething. Again, the body that will oversee this is going to be the \nFCC, the same body the Senator from Arizona puts in place to oversee \nhis requirement.\n  So I believe what we have done is tried to build upon a positive \nstep. Again, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona. He has been a \nleader in this problem. He has blazed the trail. I believe what we have \noffered is a constructive addition to his policy.\n  I will step back on this point. The Senator from Arizona said the \nCatholic Conference doesn't oppose his bill. As I read it again, they \ndid not oppose it, but they listed two pages of concerns about his \npolicy. Then they wrote to us recently and talked about how they liked \nwhat we did. But I understand they are not in the business of opposing \nand supporting. Let me just say their intentions are clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hatch-Leahy \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3653) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3628, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nbe recognized for 4 minutes for the debate on the Smith amendment, \nwhich was agreed to. I was detained unavoidably in the car coming over \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I appreciate that many of \nmy colleagues, I am sure, as I, have been stuck in the tram coming over \nhere.\n  I thank the managers who have worked so hard to resolve the amendment \nthat I had on fetal tissue research. I know Senator Specter is opposed \nto illegal trafficking of fetal tissue. This amendment, I hope, will \nget some information on the Federal Government's policies in this \nregard.\n  I look forward to reviewing the study that we have set up in this \namendment that was agreed to. It is my hope that we can ensure that the \nspirit of the law is being adhered to when it comes to fetal tissue \nresearch.\n  This amendment will set up a GAO study of the practice of fetal \ntissue transfer to determine whether or not any fetal tissue is \ntransferred illegally for research purposes. The GAO will conduct a \ncomprehensive study of Federal involvement in the use of fetal tissue \nfor research purposes.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues have seen fit to work with me to \nagree to this amendment. I look forward to receiving a report from the \nGeneral Accounting Office in the very near future as to how much, if \nany, illegal trafficking is occurring in the area of fetal tissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3610, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. President, the question is on agreeing to \nMcCain amendment No. 3610, as amended.

There are 4 minutes equally \ndivided on the Santorum amendment. Who seeks recognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a vote in favor of the Santorum amendment \nwill basically negate the amendment we just adopted because it will \nallow schools and libraries the option of either blocking pornography \nor implementing an Internet use policy--an Internet use policy is what \nthey have now--nor does it require the filtering of child pornography \nand obscenity.\n  I have a letter signed by various organizations, including the \nAmerican Families Association, Family Research Council, and many other \norganizations. The final paragraph says:\n\n       We believe the author of the bill, Senator Santorum, has \n     the best of intentions. His bill will not provide an \n     effective solution to the problem of pornography in schools \n     and public libraries.\n\n  I agree with them. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree. My amendment is \nsupported by groups on the left and the right and the middle: the NEA, \nthe American Library Association, and the Catholic Conference.\n  Senator McCain started the ball rolling. I give him credit for \nrequiring Internet software. The fact is, that is not comprehensive \nenough and not locally generated. My amendment says we have to have \npublic notice and a public meeting by the community, involving the \nlibrary or the school, to develop a comprehensive Internet policy.\n  Blocking software does not deal with chatrooms, e-mails, hacking, and \ndissemination of minor information over the Internet. It is good as far \nas it goes, but we need a comprehensive policy that is locally \ndeveloped with community standards. If they choose not to do that, then \nthey have to buy the software.\n  We require a policy that deals with all of these four things I just \nmentioned and have public meetings and public notice to get the \ncommunity involved.\n  One of the big problems with use of the Internet is that parents and \ncommunity leaders do not know what is going on with this little black \nbox in the library or school. This requires public comment, it requires \npublic notification, and public input in a process that desperately \nneeds to be a public one and community standards need to be set.\n  It is supported by a wide variety of organizations. Those of my \ncolleagues who voted for the McCain amendment can also vote for this \namendment and walk out with a clear conscience and see a much more \ncomprehensive policy put in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3635.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 75, nays 24, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 150 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--75\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Helms\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--24\n\n     Abraham\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     DeWine\n     Dorgan\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thompson\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3635) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3619.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), for herself and \n     Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 3619:\n       On page 59, line 12, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That funds made available \n     under this heading to carry out section 6301(b) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be \n     available for education reform projects that provide same \n     gender schools and classrooms, consistent with applicable \n     law''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly because I \nthink we have agreement in a bipartisan effort on this amendment. I am \nvery pleased that we will be able to offer this amendment and hopefully \nclarify some of the issues that have surrounded single-sex classrooms \nin schools for public education.\n  As most people know, title VI is the part of our education funding \nthat allows for new and innovative and creative approaches to public \neducation. We have set aside money so school districts can come forward \nand say that their school districts need this particular type of \nemphasis. If it is creative, and it serves the needs of that particular \nschool district, they can get Federal funding for those kinds of \nprograms.\n  One of the types of education that has been proven in certain \ninstances to help the girls or boys who have participated are single-\nsex schools and single-sex classrooms. Many parochial schools and \nprivate schools are single sex. There are girl schools and boy schools. \nSome parents want to have their children in that atmosphere because \nthey believe that sometimes girls can excel if they don't have boys in \nthe class and they are more willing to speak up. This has been shown in \nmany instances to be the case. And the same is true particularly with \nadolescent boys where they have single-sex schools, and they are not \ndiverted by having girls in the class. They do better in some \ncircumstances.\n  We are not saying that we prefer this approach. We are not saying \nthat we mandate it. We are not even suggesting that it be done. We are \nsaying that we want to have as many options for public school districts \nand students as we can possibly give them so that the local community \nand the parents can make the decision for the boys and girls who are \nattending those schools about what will give them the best chance to \nget the best education that they can get. Allowing them to have title \nVI funding for a single-sex school or single-sex classroom is one way \nto put one more option out there. That is what this amendment does.\n  I am very pleased to have worked with Members on both sides of the \naisle to try to clarify this situation because, in fact, we have \nseveral public schools that are single sex.\n  The Young Women's Leadership Academy in East Harlem is a girls \nschool. California has three girls schools and three boys schools. \nWestern High in Baltimore is over 100 years old. It is a girls school. \nPhiladelphia has a girls school that has been quite successful for \nmany, many years.\n  We say if this is an option that parents want to pursue, we want to \nhave that option on the table. Parents may not be able to afford a \nprivate school or maybe they prefer public education. Let's give them \nanother option among the many that we are seeing now in creative \nlearning and better opportunities for the young people in a particular \nschool district. That is what the amendment does.\n  I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. I believe \nthere is no opposition to this amendment. I am very pleased that is the \ncase because if we can clarify this and if we can open more options for \nschool districts to have to meet specific needs of students and their \nindividual school districts, why not?\n  That is what our Federal dollars should do--allow the decisions to be \nmade at the local level with as many options as we can possibly give \nthem.\n  I appreciate the support of everyone in the Senate. I have worked \nwith many Members of the Senate. Senator Collins is a cosponsor of this \namendment. Senator Collins has been one of the strongest supporters of \ngirls schools and classrooms and boys schools and classrooms of any \nMember of the Senate.\n  I look forward to having our vote tomorrow. I hope, frankly, that it \nis unanimous.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2553, the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill for FY 2001.\n  The bill provides $272.6 billion in new budget authority and $221.9 \nbillion in new outlays for the operations of the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education and numerous related federal \nagencies.\n  I have concerns about $6.1 billion in mandatory offsets in the bill. \nThese offsets are likely to be challenged on the floor in a way that \ncould put the bill over the allocation. I am also concerned about the \nadvanced appropriation for 2003 in the SCHIP program.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $335.0 \nbillion in budget authority and $330.7 billion in outlays. The bill is \nexactly at the Subcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays. The scoring of the bill reflects the adjustments \nagreed to in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for Continuing Disability \nReviews (CDRs) and adoption assistance.\n  I commend the managers of the bill for their diligent work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nH.R. 4577, LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n              [By fiscal year 2001, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            General\n                                            purpose  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.......................    97,820    237,142   334,962\n  Outlays................................    93,074    237,578  330,652\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................    97,820    237,142   334,962\n  Outlays................................    93,074    237,578   330,652\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.......................    86,151    233,459   319,610\n  Outlays................................    86,270    233,644   319,914\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.......................   105,947    237,142   343,089\n  Outlays................................    96,561    237,578   334,139\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.......................    96,837    237,142   333,979\n  Outlays................................    92,590    237,578   330,168\n \n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays................................  ........  .........  ........\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.......................    11,669      3,683    15,352\n  Outlays................................     6,804      3,934    10,738\nPresident's request: \\1\\\n  Budget authority.......................    -8,127  .........    -8,127\n  Outlays................................    -3,487  .........    -3,487\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.......................       983  .........       983\n  Outlays................................       484  .........       484\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Because the Senate-reported bill includes $5.8 billion in BA savings\n  that offset the gross levels in the bill but that are not included in\n  the President's budget, the comparison of the bill to the President's\n  request overstates the difference by that amount.\n \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleagues in \nsupport of restoring funds to cuts made in the Senate Labor, Health and \nHuman Services appropriations bill to the Social Services Block Grant \nprogram. This block grant program serves millions of older Americans, \nchildren and people with disabilities across the nation. The funding \nhelps states provide services that no one else will provide. The money \nkeeps people independent. It keeps them out of nursing homes. It keeps \nthem employed. These are not frivolous services. They are critical to \nthe well-being of thousands of people.\n  In my state of Iowa, more than 100,000 Iowans receive services under \nthis block grant Polk County, including the city of Des Moines, gets \nthis funding to transport developmentally disabled residents to doctor \nvisits, physical therapy, employment, and day treatment. The county \nprovides 56,000 of these trips each year. Under a funding cut, these \nrides could stop. Polk County's developmentally disabled residents \nwould be on their own for transportation.\n  Polk County also funds residential treatment for developmentally \ndisabled and mentally ill residents. The treatment costs $75 a day. \nThat helps people avoid nursing home stays. It makes sense, because no \none wants to go to a nursing home, and the expense is large. Under a \nfunding cut, the county could eliminate residential treatment for 34 \nresidents.\n  Clay County is already having trouble providing placements for \nclients with mental health problems and developmental disabilities. The \ncounty has a waiting list for placements. Providers' fees have been \nfrozen for over three years.\n  I hope to spare any Iowans from more worry about this funding. It's a \nrelief to hear assurances of complete funding of social services.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the \nremarks of several of my colleagues who spoke previously on several \nissues of importance to me and my home state of Texas with regard to \nprovisions in the fiscal year 2001 Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations bill.\n  The bill as presently drafted would rescind important welfare funding \nto states under the program known as ``TANF'' (Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families). It would also cut the Social Services Block Grant \n(SSBG) program by $1.1 billion. Finally, the bill would threaten \nfunding under the Children's Health Insurance (or ``CHIP'') Program.\n  I was very pleased to hear Senator Stevens, the distinguished \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Roth, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, confirm on the floor \ntoday that they are committed to resolve these issues in favor of the \nstates during the conference. I look forward to working with both \nSenator Stevens and Senator Roth to ensure that these issues are \nadequately addressed in that process.\n  It is my understanding that the rescissions in TANF, CHIP, and SSBG \nfunding in the bill were, in effect, temporary measures included until \nthe broader funding issues could be resolved in conference. \nNevertheless, I am very pleased to hear a reaffirmation of their \ncommitment to address this in conference.\n  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that TANF funds totaling \n$240 million, including $39.5 million in Texas, are not jeopardized. \nThese funds stem from a provision in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act that I \nand others supported to provide additional funds to high-growth, high-\nneed states like Texas, Florida, California, and others. Under the \nrevisions in federal welfare payments contained in that welfare reform \nbill, states like these stood to lose significant funds, and it was \nunclear whether they would be able to meet their legal obligations to \nlow income families.\n  To help ensure that states like these could continue to meet the \nneeds of their residents while they transition to the new system of \nemphasizing work and self-sufficiency over dependence, I supported the \ninclusion of these so-called ``supplemental grants'' funds in the \nwelfare reform law. Since then, these funds have been an important \ncomponent of some 17 states welfare reform programs, programs that have \nbeen tremendously successful. For example, in my state of Texas, \nwelfare rolls have been reduced by 63 percent.\n  Texas and other states that have been so successful in helping people \nto become self-sufficient should not be penalized for that success. \nWhile some have argued that states have billions in unused welfare \nfunds, it is my understanding that Texas, for one, has obligated to \ndate all of its TANF funds. To rescind more than $39 million in funds \nfrom our state would disrupt not only the welfare program, but also the \nmany other activities funded by TANF funds in the state, including \nworker training and child care. This disruption of fiscal year 2000 \nfunds would also affect the state legislative process, necessitating a \nretroactive budget adjustment during the next session of the Texas \nLegislature, which will not meet again until January of next year.\n  The federal TANF program was also intended to allow states to develop \nfunding reserves to utilize during times of economic downturn and/or \nhigher than usual unemployment. For example, the Texas Workforce \nCommission was able to recently use TANF funds to respond to the more \nthan 18,000 Texans who lost their jobs during the oil price crash of \n1997 to 1999.\n  It is also fundamentally unfair to only cut TANF funds to the 17 \nstates that presently receive them, while not affecting the funding \nreceived by the other 33 states. These states, on average, use TANF \nfunds at a higher rate than the national average, using 97 percent of \ntheir total allocations versus 93 percent for other states in fiscal \nyear 1999. In short, they need the additional funds.\n  Many states that receive these supplemental funds are presently \nplanning to expand their welfare and related programs, to include a \nbroader range of services to enable all welfare recipients to become \nself-sufficient. Many single mothers, for example, have child care and \ntransportation needs that make it all but impossible to find and keep a \njob. Others simply lack basic education and job skills that preclude \nthem from holding virtually any employment. Still others have chronic \nsubstance abuse and psychological problems that are complex and \ndifficult to address. As states seek to bring these so-called ``hard \ncore'' welfare recipients into the economic mainstream, they will need \nall the TANF and other forms of federal assistance they can get to \nbreak the cycle of poverty.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and the \nSenator from Delaware, Senator Roth for their comments today and for \ntheir responsiveness on these issues.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, as it was reported out of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill reduced \nfunding for two vitally important programs--the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program (S-CHIP) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) \nprogram.\n  When you look at the bill, there are major increases for other \nprograms, which to me, suggests that the Subcommittee did not \nadequately prioritize what should be funded.\n  The programs that these cuts would have affected--S-CHIP and SSBG--\nare essential for welfare reform; helping to keep people off welfare \nand eliminating some of the reasons why people went on welfare in the \nfirst place.\n  I support many of the programs and items that are funded by this \nbill, and\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nI commend the fine work of our federal agencies in carrying out these \nprograms, but I am not convinced that we should provide huge increases \nin funding for some programs--like a 15 percent increase for NIH--at \nthe expense of addressing basic human needs in other programs--such as \nS-CHIP and SSBG.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the cuts to these programs that have been \nincluded in this bill. I know that the Senate Appropriations Committee \nChairman, Senator Stevens, has indicated that he will work to ensure \nthat full funding is restored in Conference. However, I want to be \nclear to my colleagues--these two programs must not return to the \nSenate floor with these cuts intact. Funds must be restored in \nConference, and, in my view, the Conferees also need to take out some \nof the increases in the Labor-HHS bill in order to bring it within its \n302b allocation.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, when Congress passed the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, one of the provisions included in that \nlandmark legislation called for the establishment of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--or S-CHIP as it is known.\n  S-CHIP is the single largest federal investment in health insurance \nsince the establishment of the Medicaid and Medicare programs in 1965. \nIt is a partnership between the federal government and our states, \nenacted to improve access to health care for children.\n  I lobbied for this program as Vice Chairman of the National \nGovernors' Association. As the Governor of Ohio, I understood how \nimportant it would be to the children of this country and their \nparents. In particular, I saw what it would mean to parents who were \nmoving off welfare as part of welfare reform but needed assurances that \ntheir kids would have health care.\n  As most of my colleagues know, as people move off welfare, they lose \ntheir Medicaid insurance. However, even as individuals move towards \npicking up health insurance where Medicaid left-off, the biggest thing \nthat parents are concerned about is being able to provide health care \nfor their children. I am concerned that if the S-CHIP program is not \nfunded appropriately, it will take a lot of people who have gone off \nwelfare and force them to have to go back on.\n  I remember speaking to mothers who were on welfare when I was \nGovernor, at the time when we were going through welfare reform, and \nmany of these individuals told me that the reason they went on welfare \nin the first place was to get health care coverage for their children.\n  S-CHIP gives parents peace of mind that their children have access to \nquality health care if it is not available through their place of \nemployment and they don't have enough money to afford health care \ncoverage.\n  S-CHIP is not a ``one size fits all'' sort of program. One of the \nmore appealing aspects of S-CHIP is its flexibility. States have been \nable to design innovative new programs and methods of reaching out to \nhelp uninsured children.\n  Some states are even looking at with ways in which they can provide \nfamily coverage for the same cost as covering a child.\n  Thus far, S-CHIP has been able to help over 2 million children obtain \nhealth insurance, and the opportunities to expand the program through \nits flexibility seem limitless. It is a program that is universally \nsupported in our states.\n  Therefore, you can imagine my surprise to find that when the Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported out its version of the Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill last month, the \nbill contained a provision to rescind $1.9 billion from S-CHIP.\n  The reason given for this S-CHIP rescission was a desire to free up \n$1.9 billion in budget authority to help finance discretionary programs \nin the Labor-HHS appropriation bill.\n  Although the Senate appropriations bill restores the $1.9 billion to \nS-CHIP in 2003, the funds would be of little use to states and children \nin need of health insurance in the coming fiscal year.\n  If the federal government is to be a true partner with the states, \nthen the states must have the confidence that the federal government \nwill not shrink from its commitment to S-CHIP and to children. Actions \nsuch as the proposed $1.9 billion rescission threaten the integrity of \na critical program designed exclusively to help 2 million of our \nnation's children.\n  I can understand why our nation's governors, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have been united in their opposition to the proposed cut in \nS-CHIP--because the program works. We should not be in the position of \nreversing the federal-state partnership that makes this vital program \nfunction.\n  In addition to the proposed cuts in S-CHIP, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill had proposed another break in a commitment that \nCongress made with the states.\n  In 1996, as part of welfare reform, Congress agreed to provide $2.38 \nbillion each year for the Social Services Block Grant, or SSBG.\n  States and local communities have been able to target SSBG funds \nwhere they are most needed. For example, in my state of Ohio, funds \nhave been used for such programs as adoption services in Washington \nCounty and foster care assistance in Montgomery County; home-based care \nfor the elderly and the disabled such as home delivered meals in \nFranklin County; child and adult protective services in Cuyahoga and \nAllen Counties; and substance abuse treatment in Hamilton County--just \nto name a few.\n  However, the funds for SSBG have been chipped away little by little. \nIn fiscal year 2000, the program is funded at $1.7 billion, but the \nSenate Labor-HHS appropriations bill, as reported, only proposed $600 \nmillion for fiscal 2001--75 percent less than the amount promised to \ngovernors in 1996!\n  A cut of this magnitude would be difficult, at best, for state and \nlocal governments to absorb, especially on top of the cuts over the \npast few years. Congress can't assume states will make up for the loss.\n  As such, the lack of funding would have caused a disruption in \ncritical services to individuals in need--many of whom are not covered \nby other federal programs.\n  Many of the programs funded through SSBG prevent additional costs to \nthe federal government in the long run. For example, SSBG helps provide \nin-home services to the elderly and the disabled, thereby eliminating \nthe need to place them in a costly institutional setting. In addition, \nSSBG funds are used for family preservation and reunification efforts \nin order to cut down on the number of foster care placements.\n  The notion that states can make up this $1.1 billion loss with TANF \nfunds is false. Many of the populations served through SSBG, primarily \nthe elderly and the disabled, have no connection to the traditional \nwelfare system and cannot be served with TANF funds.\n  That's why I am pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement \nwith the Appropriations Committee to take these provisions from the \nLabor-HHS bill. In my view, these provisions would have had a \ndevastating impact on our most vulnerable citizens: children, the poor \nand the elderly.\n  Again, I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work in \ngetting these provisions removed from this bill. I believe their \nefforts will go a long way towards restoring the faith of our state and \nlocal leaders that the Senate is truly committed to giving them the \nopportunity to help all Americans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President. I regret that I was unable to vote on \nAmendment 3625 to the Labor-Health Human Services appropriations bill. \nIt was important for me to be in Montana for a conference I had \norganized on the future of our state's economic development.\n  I would like to explain how I would have voted on this amendment, had \nI been present.\n  In our current era of staggering scientific achievement--as \ndemonstrated by yesterday's announcement of the mapping of the human \ngenome--it is easy to become complacent with medical technology.\n  However, we cannot afford the price of complacency. One of the \ngreatest health threats our nation currently faces is antibiotic \nresistant infections. These infections are the result of abuse and \nmisuse of antibiotics--the drugs which form the keystone of modern \nmedicine. These drug resistant infections know no barriers and are a \nthreat\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nto us all. The World Health Organization reports that antibiotic-\nresistant infections acquired in hospitals kill over 14,000 people in \nthe United States every year. Unless steps are taken to monitor and \nprevent antibiotic misuse, this number can only increase.\n  Protecting our nation and our children from antibiotic resistant \ninfections is vital. That is why I am pleased to support this \namendment. This legislation increases the ability of public health \nagencies to monitor and fight antibiotic resistant infections. It also \nseeks to reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistance by educating \ndoctors and patients about the proper use of antibiotics.\n  This legislation will help protect the health of all Americans and I \napplaud my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. MURKOWSKI pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2799 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5873-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5873-S5876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  OIL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is appropriate I comment on the \nannounced position by our Vice President today on his program to lower \noil imports and stabilize climate change.\n  As identified in the AP summary of June 27, under a program to \n``lower oil import and stabilize climate,'' the Vice President's plan \nfor a national energy security and environmental trust fund calls ``for \ndiverting more than $80 billion over the next 10 years from projected \nFederal budget surpluses for tax incentives to drive investment in \nenergy efficient technologies for transportation and energy use.''\n  Notice it doesn't identify any new source of energy to relieve the \nshortage.\n  He proposes in a $4.2 billion program to encourage electric \nproduction from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and $1 \nbillion for accelerated depreciation for investments and distributed \npower assets.\n  But the bulk of the plan is expected to cost $68 billion over the \nnext decade and is dedicated to what Gore calls a technology for \ntomorrow, a competitive program designed to provide tax relief, loans, \ngrants, bonds, and other financial instruments for emission reduction \nat powerplants and industrial facilities. He doesn't mention one word \nabout what kind of energy he proposes we are going to use.\n  He indicates we will harness that uniquely American power of \ninnovation. Innovation will not go in your gas tank and get you home or \nget you on a vacation. He goes on to say: We will say to the Nation's \ninventors and entrepreneurs, if you invest in these new technologies, \nAmerica will invest in you.\n  The Presidential candidate said: Through the power of free market, we \nwill take a dramatic step forward for our children's health, which will \nalso be a dramatic new step towards a stable climate.\n  It is a good deal of rhetoric and sounds pretty good. But in reading \nthat, one would come to the conclusion that we simply have not been \ndoing anything in the area of renewables. I point out for the Record, \nin the last 5 years this country has spent $1.5 billion for renewable \nenergy research and development.\n  What have we done over the last two decades? We have spent $17 \nbillion over the last 20 years in direct spending, in tax incentives \nfor renewables. My point is, we are all supportive of renewables, but \nhow successful have we been? We have been putting money on them. We \nhave been providing tax incentives.\n  Our total renewable energy constitutes less than 4 percent of our \ntotal energy produced. That excludes hydro. Mr. President, 4 percent is \nfrom biomass, less than 1 percent from solar and wind. Yet most of the \nmoney in the technology has gone to solar, wind, and biomass.\n  So when the Vice President suggests a program of expenditures, some \n$80 billion over the next 10 years, we need relief now--the American \nconsumer, the American motorist, the trucker. We see on our cab bills a \nsurcharge. We see on the airplane bills a surcharge. We need relief \nnow.\n  We have spent $1.5 billion for renewable research over the last 20 \nyears and $17 billion in the same period in direct spending and direct \nincentives for renewables. My point is not to belittle renewables or \ntheir important role, but the reality is there is simply not enough. At \nless than 4 percent--excluding hydro--they simply are not going to \nprovide the relief we need.\n  I think it is important we understand the Vice President's programs. \nWhile we all want to conserve energy, we want to reduce pollution, we \nwant to reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil, the facts are in \nmany cases we are not reducing the dependence on foreign oil. We are \nincreasing. In 1973 and 1974 when we had the Arab oil embargo, we were \n37-percent dependent on imported oil. Today, we are 56 percent on an \naverage and we have gone as high as 64 percent.\n  In the Vice President's plan, I want to know how he plans to reduce \nthe Nation's dependence on foreign oil when the Secretary of Energy is \nout soliciting for greater production from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and \nMexico.\n  He wants to reduce the threat posed by global warming. I think that \nis a challenge for American technology and ingenuity. He wants to \ncurtail brownouts by increasing electric grid reliability. What has the \nadministration done of late in that regard? They have not worked with \nthe Energy Committee, which I chair, on electric restructuring, which \nwas designed specifically to address how we were going to provide an \nincentive for more transmission lines to be built so we could ensure \nthat we would not have brownouts, how we were going to ensure that we \nwould have adequate energy, whether natural gas, coal, oil, or nuclear.\n  This administration, right down the line, in its energy policy, \nspecifically, has highlighted that it does not have an energy policy. \nWe have seen that in our inability to prevail on high-level nuclear \nwaste storage. We are one vote short of a veto override.\n  It is also important to go in and identify the new initiatives that \nthe Vice President has indicated are in his policy statement. One is to \n``extend incentives for natural gas exploration.'' That is actually in \nhis statement. But let me refer to a statement our Vice President made \nOctober 22, 1999, in Rye, NH:\n\n       I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no \n     new drilling--\n\n  No new drilling, Mr. President.\n\n     even in areas already leased by previous administrations.\n\n  I don't know how he can make that statement on October 22, 1999, and \ntoday and yesterday make the statement that he wants to extend \nincentives for natural gas exploration. Where is it going to come from? \nI certainly don't know where it is going to come from.\n  I could go on and on and identify each one of these, where there is \nan inconsistency. But the fact is, his program, at a cost of $75 \nbillion to $80 billion over 10 years, supposedly from the surplus, is \nnot going to do a single thing today to reduce gasoline prices. So what \nare we going to do? How are we going to relate to this? I think it is \nfair to say the Vice President misses the point.\n  To borrow a phrase from the Clinton administration: It is the \ngasoline prices, stupid.\n  We are paying more for gasoline than at any other time in our \nhistory. That is the fact. Gasoline and natural gas prices have \ndoubled. Do you remember last March, we were paying $10, $11, $12 a \nbarrel? Today we are paying $32 a barrel.\n  Natural gas, which is assumed to be a godsend, our relief, has gone \nfrom $2.65 per thousand cubic feet to $4.56 for deliveries in January. \nThe American consumer has not felt this, but they will. And there will \nbe a reaction. Wait until people start getting their gas bills around \nthis country--not just their gas bill but their electric bill, because \na good deal of the electricity is generated from gas.\n  So the Vice President wants to radically change the domestic energy \nindustry in the future and he wants to spend $75 billion to $85 billion \nto do it. Think about the conventional sources of energy and the \nadministration's position. Coal? They oppose coal. They\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\noppose advanced technology, clean coal, expansion of the coal mines, \nexpansion of the generation from coal. They have already identified \nnine plants they propose to close and it is a dispute whether the \nmanagers of these plants have purposely extended the life of the plants \nor, as the management says, in order to maintain the plants to the \npermits they have had to do certain improvements.\n  They oppose hydro. Their proposal is to tear down the hydro dams out \nWest. There is a tradeoff there. The tradeoff is that you put more \ntrucks on the highway if you do away with the barge transportation \nsystem on the Columbia River. It is not just a few more trucks on the \nhighway; it is several hundred thousand because the barges are the most \neffective way to move volumes of tonnage.\n  They oppose nuclear--no nuclear. They oppose oil and gas drilling, as \nindicated by the comments of the Vice President.\n  I think it is fair to say Vice President Al Gore is OPEC's best \nfriend because in reality the only answer they have is to propose to \nimport more energy. Where are we getting that energy? Saudi Arabia and \nanother country, which I find really gets my attention in the sense of \nbeing indignant. I guess I might say I am outraged. A few years ago, in \n1991 and 1992, we fought a war in Iraq--Desert Storm. We lost 147 lives \nin that war. We had roughly 427 men and women who were wounded in that \nconflict. We had 23 taken prisoner. Since that time, we have enforced a \nno-fly zone over Iraq. That no-fly zone is an aerial blockade, if you \nwill. It has cost the American taxpayer over $10 billion to enforce. \nYet, from time to time, we launch a sortie to fly over Iraq, where they \nviolated the no-fly zone. We drop bombs on various targets near \nBaghdad. This is part of our foreign policy.\n\n  Perhaps I can simplify this. It seems to me we buy their oil. The \ninteresting thing is we start out with 50,000 barrels a day. Last year \nit was 300,000 a day. Today it is 750,000 barrels a day. We buy the \noil, send Saddam Hussein the money. Then we put the oil in our \nairplanes and we go bomb him.\n  Maybe it is more complicated than that. There are a few people who \nare unfortunate victims. Saddam Hussein holds up a press release and \nsays: The Americans and the British have killed so many Iraqi citizens.\n  That obviously rallies his people around him and the vicious circle \nstarts again.\n  That is where we are getting our greatest single increase of oil--\nfrom Iraq, a country where it wasn't so long ago we were sacrificing \nlives. It is from a tyrant who obviously is using the money he is \ngetting from the oil he smuggles to develop his missile technology and \nhis biological warfare capability. Clearly, he is up to no good and \nrepresents a significant threat to the Mideast and Israel as well, \nwithout question.\n  Here we have an administration, a Vice President, who has no real \nrelief in sight. He has a 10-year program costing $80 billion that is \nnot going to provide the American consumer with any cheaper gasoline \ntomorrow, the next day, next week, next month, or next year. But what \nthe Vice President proposes is designing your future but ignoring the \ncrisis at the pump. The Vice President wants the Government to tell you \nwhat energy you are going to use and what price you are going to pay \nfor it. That is basically what we are doing with reformulated gasoline.\n  We have refineries now customizing gasoline because the Environmental \nProtection Agency has mandated certain formulas in various parts of the \ncountry. I am not here to debate the merits. But the reality is, it \ncosts money. Why does it cost money? For a lot of reasons. We have lost \nsome of our regional refiners. We have lost 37 refiners in this \ncountry, under Clinton-Gore, two administrations, 8 years. The \nrefineries have not been replaced. We have not had a new refinery in \nthis country for 10 years.\n  Why? There are a lot of reasons. One is there is an inadequate return \non investment. Another reason is that the permitting takes so long. The \nthird is the potential Superfund sites; they are just not an attractive \ninvestment. So we have constricted ourselves, we have put on more \nregulations, and the price is being passed on to the consumer.\n  While I applaud the Vice President for recognizing that American \ningenuity and technology should drive future energy demands, the \nreality is that unless we increase our domestic supply, we are going to \ncontinue to have shortages and higher prices. The alternatives to that \nare not very bright from the standpoint of any immediate relief.\n  I am going to also make a reference to an article in the Washington \nTimes, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 26, 2000]\n\n                     Occidental Deal Benefits Gores\n\n\n            Sale of federal oil field boosts family fortune\n\n                            (By Bill Sammon)\n\n       Vice President Al Gore's push to privatize a federal oil \n     field added tens of thousands of dollars to the value of oil \n     stock owned by the Gore family, which has been further \n     enriched by skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n       Shares of Occidental Petroleum jumped 10 percent after the \n     company purchased the Elk Hills oil field in California from \n     the federal government in 1998. Mr. Gore, whose family owns \n     at least $500,000 in Occidental stock, recommended the sale \n     as part of his ``reinventing government'' reform package.\n       The sale, which constituted the largest privatization of \n     federal land in U.S. history, transformed Occidental from a \n     lackluster financial performer into a dynamic, profit-\n     spewing, oil giant. Having instantly tripled its U.S. oil \n     reserves, the company began pumping out vast sums of crude at \n     low cost.\n       As the months went by, Occidental was able to sell the oil, \n     which ends up at gasoline retail outlets like Union 76, for \n     more profit. Rising oil prices have significantly improved \n     Occidental's bottom line, said analyst Christopher Stavros of \n     Paine Webber.\n       This year, the company posted first quarter revenues of \n     $2.5 billion, or 87 percent higher than a year earlier. \n     That's a bigger increase than at nine of 10 other oil \n     companies listed in a survey that Mr. Gore cited last week as \n     evidence of price gouging.\n       The rise in Occidental oil prices, coupled with the \n     acquisition of the Elk Hills field, has paid handsome \n     dividends for the Gore family.\n       The vice president recently updated his financial \n     disclosure form to put the value of his family's Occidental \n     stock at between $500,000 and $1 million. Prior to the Elk \n     Hills sale and gasoline price spike, Mr. Gore had listed the \n     value of the stock at between $250,000 and $500,000.\n       Gore aides insist the vice president's push to sell Elk \n     Hills does not constitute a conflict of interest. They point \n     out the family's Occidental shares were originally owned by \n     Mr. Gore's father, who died in 1998, leaving the stock in an \n     estate for which the vice president serves as executor.\n       Although Mr. Gore continues to list the stock on his \n     financial disclosure forms, aides said the shares are in a \n     trust for the vice president's mother, Pauline.\n       ``He doesn't own stock because he's trying to avoid \n     conflicts of interest,'' said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. \n     ``He's the executor of the estate, but he's not the trustee \n     of the trust. It's a separate thing.''\n       Still, Mr. Gore's recommendation to privatize Elk Hills \n     ended up enriching his mother, who is expected to eventually \n     bequeath the stock to the vice president, her sole heir.\n       Last week, Mr. Gore began a concerted effort to blame \n     skyrocketing gasoline prices not only on ``big oil,'' but \n     also on Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Gore aides have emphasized \n     that Mr. Bush once ran several oil-exploration firms and has \n     accepted more campaign contributions from oil companies than \n     the vice president.\n       The Texas governor has dismissed the attacks as an attempt \n     to divert attention away from Mr. Gore's energy and \n     environmental policies, which have driven up gasoline prices. \n     Political analysts say the spiraling gas prices could imperil \n     Mr. Gore's presidential bid because they are highest in the \n     Midwest, which he must carry in order to win the White House.\n       The political and financial fortunes of the Gore family \n     were established largely with oil money from Occidental's \n     founder, Armand Hammer. Part capitalist and part Communist, \n     Mr. Hammer became the elder Gore's patron more than half a \n     century ago, showering him with riches and nurturing his \n     political career through the House and Senate.\n       The elder Gore enthusiastically returned the favors. In the \n     early 1960s, Sen. Gore took to the Senate floor to defend Mr. \n     Hammer against FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who wanted to \n     investigate Mr. Hammer's Soviet ties.\n       In 1965, the elder Gore helped Mr. Hammer obtain a visa to \n     Libya, where he opened oil fields that turned Occidental into \n     a multinational powerhouse.\n       When the elder Mr. Gore lost his re-election bid in 1970, \n     Mr. Hammer installed him as head of an Occidental subsidiary \n     and gave him a $500,000 annual salary. The man who had begun \n     his career as a struggling schoolteacher in rural Tennessee \n     ended it as a millionaire oil tycoon.\n       The younger Gore also benefited from Mr. Hammer's \n     generosity. He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in \n     annual payments of $20,000 for mineral rights to a parcel of\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\n     land near the family's homestead in Tennessee that Occidental \n     never bothered mining.\n       When the younger Gore first ran for president in 1988, Mr. \n     Hammer promised former Sen. Paul Simon ``any Cabinet spot I \n     wanted'' if he would withdraw from the primary, according to \n     a 1989 book by the Illinois Democrat.\n       Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, once flew in Mr. Hammer's \n     private jet across the Atlantic Ocean. They hosted Mr. Hammer \n     at several presidential inaugurations and remained close to \n     the oilman until his death in 1990.\n       In 1992, when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was considering \n     Mr. Gore as his running mate, the elder Gore wrote a memo \n     describing his son's ties to Mr. Hammer. The document was \n     designed to provide Mr. Clinton with answers to possible \n     questions from reporters.\n       Mr. Hammer's successor at Occidental, Ray Irani, has \n     continued to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars into the \n     campaigns of Mr. Gore and the Democratic Party. For example, \n     two days after spending the night in the Lincoln Bedroom in \n     1996, he cut a check for $100,000 to the Democratic Party.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The title of the article is, ``Occidental Deal \nBenefits Gores.'' I don't begrudge the Gores or any families having any \ninvestment. What I do begrudge is the realization that the Vice \nPresident has lashed out and attacked big oil. I am not here to defend \nbig oil. As chairman of the Energy Committee, we are having a hearing. \nWe are going to invite the various oil companies and refiners to come \nin and explain to us why prices have gone up and what the future is \nlikely to hold.\n  It is fair to point out Vice President Al Gore has been linking \nGeorge W. Bush to big oil. I am not here to separate that, but as this \narticle points out, the Vice President's efforts to push to privatize \nElk Hills, which was a Federal oilfield in California, added a good \ndeal--as a matter of fact, hundreds of thousands of dollars--to the \nGore family estate fund. This was the Occidental Petroleum that bought \nElk Hills.\n  Occidental's profits soared, and, of course, the Gore family stock in \nthe company went from a listing of roughly $250,000 to $500,000, up to \n$1 million, as a consequence of the privatization of Elk Hills. Again, \nI do not begrudge the Vice President and his family making a fair \nreturn on an appropriate investment. There is absolutely nothing wrong \nwith it. But those who live in glass houses should not take baths. In \nthis case, that fits the position of the Vice President.\n  Finally, I spoke on the floor Friday about the energy crisis we are \nhaving. I talked about the Clinton-Gore energy policy, or lack of it. \nAfter I spoke, my good friend from Iowa made some observations and \nstatements about energy policy that I think warrant some consideration. \nI am going to take the time, with the indulgence of the occupant of the \nchair, to respond.\n  We do two things in Alaska well: We harvest timber, and we harvest \nfish. We do not have a great deal of agriculture potential. We do some \nhay, potatoes, barley, and oats, but we have a short season. Fish and \ntimber we do well. So I know something about fish and timber. I do not \nknow much about corn. I do know quite a little bit about energy, as \nchairman of the Energy Committee.\n  After reading the statement of the Senator from Iowa, I think a few \nof his observations deserve a little closer examination. The Senator \nsuggested our investment in ethanol production, in hydrogen, fuel cell \nresearch, and renewable energy has been minimal. He said:\n\n       We need to get a few million dollars in for the use of \n     hydrogen in fuel cells and fuel cell research.\n\n  Again, the reference I made earlier to what we have expended speaks \nfor itself. What we have expended in these areas is truly not \ninsignificant. It is a major expenditure in the area of over $20 \nbillion overall in renewables. As a consequence of that, indeed, the \nSenator from Iowa would agree, we have been expending a good deal in \nthese areas of promoting renewables.\n  As a member of the Senate renewable and energy efficiency caucus, I \nam a supporter of ethanol production, hydrogen, fuel cell research, and \nrenewable energy. To support hydrogen research, I moved through my \ncommittee and into law the Hydrogen Future Act which is Public Law 104-\n271. It was originally introduced in the House by Bob Walker and \nauthorized the hydrogen research, development, and demonstrations \nprograms of the Department of Energy.\n  In the nearly 5 years that have passed since that time, we have spent \nover $100 million on hydrogen and fuel cell research in the Department \nof Energy. Over the past 5 years, we have spent another $1.5 billion \nfor renewable energy research and development, $330 million of which \nhas gone for biomass research, including ethanol.\n  To support renewable wind energy, I have supported as a member of the \nFinance Committee a production tax credit for investments in wind \nenergy.\n  To support renewable biomass energy, I have supported the repeal of \nthe ``closed loop'' rule for the biomass energy tax credit in an effort \nto boost biomass energy production, including ethanol.\n  I am also a cosponsor of Senator Lugar's biofuels research bill, S. \n935, which passed this body.\n  To support the deployment of distributed renewable energy, I have \nworked to make Alaska a test bed for many of these technologies. Alaska \nhas scores of small communities that are not on a consolidated electric \ngrid.\n  We are exploring the use of wind turbines, fuel cells, and other \ntechnologies to displace the expensive diesel fuel currently used in \nthese communities because these are the technologies that will make \nsense in a developing world of energy.\n  These are all areas that are very important in the effort to decrease \nour imports of foreign energy and protect our environment, and I do \nsupport them personally, as well as in my position as chairman of the \nEnergy Committee.\n  Senator Harkin's contention that we ``need to get a few million \ndollars'' for research in these areas suggests we are not making these \ninvestments when, in fact, we are. I did not want any of my colleagues \nor America to be misled.\n  Talking about gasoline prices again, Senator Harkin also encouraged \nme, as chairman of the Energy Committee, to subpoena oil company \nexecutives, to put them before my committee and start asking the \n``tough questions'' in an effort to get to the bottom of the high \nprices.\n  Indeed, my staff and I had already been planning and have planned a \nhearing on gasoline prices to include representatives from the industry \nand the administration. We made that decision several days ago. That \nhearing, as announced, will be held on Thursday, July 13, at 9:30 a.m.\n  At that time, we plan to explore issues of gasoline supply problems \nand ask if deliverability, transportation, refining, and blending \nresources are adequate to supply our near-term and long-term gasoline \nneeds. It is a matter of supply and demand. The supply is down, the \ndemand is up.\n  But it may interest my friend from Iowa to know that subpoenas are \nunlikely to be necessary for the oil companies or their \nrepresentatives. When our committee asks them to appear, they appear. \nThey answer the questions asked of them, and I am not anticipating any \nproblem with the oil companies responding to our questions.\n  On the other hand, I think you would agree, sometimes we do have \nproblems with the administration. Secretary Richardson recently found \nit inconvenient to appear before our committee on the Los Alamos \nmatter. So there is some doubt he will show up to answer, as Senator \nHarkin puts it, the tough questions.\n  We are considering asking the EPA Administrator, who is responsible \npretty much for the reformulation of gasoline around the country, where \nthe refineries are now customizing, and that would be EPA Administrator \nCarol Browner. There is some question she will appear. She may be \nworried the reformulated gasoline requirements have, in fact, \nbalkanized the market and driven prices up. That might make her \ninclined not to attend.\n  While the Senator from Iowa said in his remarks Friday that \nreformulated gasolines were ``not the problem,'' I am personally not so \nsure of that. Consider the following facts: Under the Environmental \nProtection Agency regulations, fuel made for consumption in Oregon is \nnot suitable for California's consumption. Fuel made for distribution \nin western Maryland cannot be sold in Baltimore. Areas such as Chicago \nand Detroit are islands in the fuel system, requiring special \n``designer'' gasolines. Gasoline sold in Springfield cannot be sold in \nChicago.\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\n  A recent Energy Information Agency report observed that an eastern \nU.S. pipeline operator handles 38 different grades of gasoline, 7 \ngrades of kerosene, and 16 grades of home heating oil and diesel fuel.\n  Between Chicago and St. Louis, a 300-mile distance--think of this--\nfour different grades of gasoline are required. Is that necessary? I am \nnot here to debate that point, but I am here to tell you that it all \ncosts money and the consumer pays for it. It is estimated that \nreformulated gasoline costs an average of 50 cents more a gallon for \nthe reasons I have outlined.\n  The predictable result is refiners lack the flexibility to move \nsupplies around the country to respond to local or regional shortages. \nAgain, I advise the President that 37 refineries have closed. No new \nones have opened. Why? I think the answer is obvious.\n  These are among the questions we will explore in our hearing, and I \nhope we will have good cooperation from the industry and good \ncooperation from the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  There are a few things we do know before the hearing.\n  Even before we convene the hearing, here is what we already know. \nAmericans are now paying more for their gasoline than at any other time \nin history. Our dependency on foreign oil is at an all-time high--\nhigher than any other time in history.\n  Again, we fought a war 9 years ago over threats to our oil supply. I \nhave indicated the loss of life we have had, the prisoners who were \ntaken, and those who were wounded.\n  Further, domestic oil production is down 17 percent since the start \nof the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  I think it is important for Members to recognize we have a little \nhistory to indicate why we are in this predicament.\n  We will almost assuredly have brownouts this summer when energy usage \nexceeds energy supply. That is because the Clinton-Gore administration \nhas actively curtailed domestic energy production in all forms in \nvirtually all areas of this country.\n  For 8 years, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have been \nwarned that our foreign oil consumption was increasing and our domestic \noil production was decreasing. One can only assume they chose to ignore \nthe warnings, and now we have record prices for gas and home heating \noil.\n  This is a problem of leadership. Both the President and the Vice \nPresident and my good friend, Senator Harkin from Iowa in a speech, \nsuggested that the oil companies are to blame. It is the blame game \nplayed around Washington, DC, all the time. And maybe the oil companies \nare partially responsible. I am not ruling that out.\n  But leadership is not assessing blame. Leadership is about preventing \nthe crisis before it happens. Sadly, the crisis is here, and Americans \nare paying the price. Perhaps even worse, the most powerful Nation on \nEarth--the most powerful Nation in the history of the world--is at the \nmercy of a handful of oil-producing nations because we are not \nproducing our own domestic resources.\n  Where would we get them? We have the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt \nall around Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, and other areas. We have the \nOCS off the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi, and my \nState of Alaska. We have the resources here. There is absolutely no \nquestion about it. We have the technology. We also have an \nadministration that would much rather send the Secretary of Energy \noverseas to beg for increased production from OPEC and from Saddam \nHussein than generate domestic oil production here at home where we are \nassured we would have a continued supply. We could keep the jobs here \nand the dollars here.\n  If we were willing to fight for oil supply in the Persian Gulf, we \nought to be willing to drill for it domestically here in the United \nStates.\n  I talked about what the Vice President has said about this. I have \nnoted the Vice President's sudden interest, as expressed on his \ncampaign trail, about the prices paid by gasoline consumers, and again, \nhis suggestions that the oil companies are to blame.\n  Surely this cannot be the same Vice President Gore who cast the \ntiebreaking vote for higher gasoline taxes in this Senate body.\n  Surely this is not the same Vice President who wrote in his book, \n``Earth in the Balance,'' that: ``Higher taxes on fossil fuels . . . is \none of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner \nconsistent with a more responsible approach to the environment.''\n  Perhaps the Vice President doesn't have to buy gas as the rest of us, \nbut someone needs to tell him that raising taxes on gasoline only hurts \nhard-working Americans.\n  In summary, to conclude, I think the energy policy of the Clinton-\nGore administration can be summed up in a single word. That word is \n``no''--no domestic oil exploration or production, no use of coal, no \nuse of nuclear power, no use of hydroelectric power, no to increasing \nsupplies of natural gas, and no to new oil refineries.\n  We have a better idea; that is, the National Energy Security Act of \n2000, introduced by Senator Lott, myself, and others because it \nencourages domestic production, energy efficiency, renewable energy, \nand other energy resources, with the goal of decreasing our oil imports \nto a level below 50 percent.\n  We have a goal in our energy policy, in our Republican plan. Ask the \nClinton-Gore administration what their energy policy is, what their \ngoal is. As I see it, it is an $80 billion expenditure on renewables \ncoming about in 10 years, when today, if you exclude hydro, only 4 \npercent of our energy comes from renewables. I wish there were more.\n  Anyway, this is the kind of balanced approach that I think will keep \nenergy supplies stable and affordable for America. I urge my colleagues \nto support the National Energy Security Act of 2000, which was raised \nhere on the floor the other day and the leader assures me is pending.\n  I thank the occupant of the chair and the clerks for prevailing at \nthis late hour. I have been asked to close the Senate today. So with \ntheir indulgence, I will proceed. My reason for keeping you here \ntonight, obviously so late, is the inability to get floor time in \nmorning business because of the accelerated schedule. So I hope you \nwill understand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5876-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5876-S5877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO PEACE: INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF IRA WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to report on major progress in the \nimplementation of the Northern Ireland peace accords. I know many \nAmericans have been very closely following the events in Northern \nIreland over the past number of years, under the leadership of \nPresident Clinton, Vice President Gore, and the former majority leader, \nGeorge Mitchell, who provided a herculean effort to bring together the \ndisparate sides in Northern Ireland.\n  New ground was broken over the weekend which significantly enhances, \nI think, the prospects for permanent peace after more than a quarter of \na century of sectarian conflict. I mentioned George Mitchell. I \nmentioned the President and the Vice President. Certainly people like \nJean Kennedy Smith, the American Ambassador to Ireland, our colleagues \nhere, Senator Kennedy and Senator Pat Moynihan, and Peter King in the \nHouse--there is a long list of people who have been trying very hard to \nget the two communities of Northern Ireland to come together and \nresolve their differences, establish a political framework for dealing \nwith future conflict, and to abandon the bullet and the bomb, which has \nclaimed too many lives over too long a period of time. The news this \nweekend is that we are far closer to achieving that goal.\n  Martti Ahtisaari, the former President of Finland, and Cyril \nRamaphosa, the former leader of the African National Congress, reported \nto Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain yesterday that the Irish \nRepublican Army allowed them to examine the organization's hidden \narsenals during the weekend of June 24. The independent inspectors \nconcluded that the IRA's weapons caches could not be used without \ndetection.\n  This is a major achievement. This is one that has broken open the \nissue of disarmament that has been one of the stumbling blocks to \nachieving the final goals of the Good Friday accords.\n  This first inspection by international experts is credible evidence \nthat the IRA is prepared to follow through with\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\nrespect to its commitment of May 6 to open its secret arsenal of \nweapons to international inspection. This confidence-building measure, \nin my view, could convince the people of Northern Ireland that the IRA \nis sincere with respect to its pledge to put its weapons ``completely \nand verifiably'' beyond use in the context of implementation of the \nGood Friday accords, those very accords which George Mitchell of Maine, \nthe former majority leader, was so instrumental in bringing about. It \nwould seem to me that the decision by David Trimble to press members of \nthe Ulster Unionist Party to rejoin the Northern Ireland Assembly has \nbeen vindicated by recent events. I commend David Trimble, as well.\n  Despite numerous setbacks that have occurred from time to time with \nrespect to the full implementation of the 1998 accords, Prime Minister \nTony Blair, and the Prime Minister of Ireland, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, \nand President Bill Clinton have never lost faith in the process.\n  By the way, people like Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern deserve \ngreat credit, as do David Trimble, Gerry Adams, John Hume, and Martin \nMcGuinness, who have done a magnificent job in bringing this about. \nThere are so many people who have been part of the effort to achieve \nwhat I think we are on the brink of achieving here. The events over the \nweekend demonstrate that their faith is not misplaced. They deserve \ngreat credit for not losing faith.\n\n  I, too, have remained optimistic that peace is possible. That is \nbecause I believe the people of Northern Ireland are anxious to put \nthis long and very painful conflict behind them. Indeed, before the \nFebruary setback over decommissioning, which caused key provisions of \nthe peace accords to be suspended, the Northern Ireland Assembly and \nthe executive had been functioning. The reactivation of the assembly \nlate last month has once again restored self-government in Belfast. The \ninternational inspections of weapons caches together with the renewal \nof discussions between the IRA and the International Commission on \nDecommissioning are giant steps toward the full decommissioning of \nweapons throughout Northern Ireland.\n  The IRA has historically held itself out as the guardian of the \nCatholic minority--a minority that has experienced decades of \ninequality and injustice at the hands of a Unionist or Protestant \nmajority. Paradoxically, the IRA has sought to promote justice and \nequality for the Catholic community through violence and other \nterrorist acts against the police and the Protestant majority.\n  The Good Friday accords acknowledge past inequalities and injustices \nand, at the same time, establish a framework for resolving these \ninequities through the political process. There are now strong \nindications that the IRA is prepared to work within that framework to \nachieve its objectives.\n  The IRA's willingness to permit international inspections of its \nweapons is further proof that it is within the realm of possibility to \nremove the bomb and the bullet from Irish politics once and for all. It \nis my fervent hope that these independent inspections will reduce the \nfeelings of mistrust that have historically plagued relations between \nthe Nationalist and Unionist communities and their political leaders \nand allow further progress to be made toward implementing other \nimportant provisions of the accords, especially those related to police \nreform.\n  Each side has taken positive steps to meet the letter and spirit of \nthe Good Friday Accords. Having said that, there is much that remains \nto be done to achieve other equally important objectives of the \naccords, particularly the guarantee of justice and equality for all of \nthe people of Northern Ireland --Protestants and Catholics. Toward that \nend, I would urge the British government to move forward expeditiously \nto implement the recommendations of the Independent Commission on \nPolicing for Northern Ireland, the so called Patten Commission. \nCreating a police force that is professional, impartial, and \nrepresentative of the community it serves, as called for by the Patten \nCommission, is the only way to guarantee justice and equal treatment \nfor all.\n  Since the parties first embarked on the road to resolving Northern \nIreland's ``Troubles'' in 1994, there have been steps forward and there \nhave been steps back--sometimes it has seemed more of the latter than \nthe former. The latest actions by the IRA set the stage for a new \nchapter in the history of Northern Ireland--a chapter of peace and \nreconciliation between the communities of Northern Ireland, as embodied \nin the letter and spirit of the 1998 Good Friday Accords. I strongly \nurge Northern Ireland's political leaders to take to heart the \nsignificant progress toward peace that has been achieved in recent \nweeks--to draw from that progress renewed energy. And, to find the \ncapacity to set aside mistrust, allow deep-seated wounds to heal, and \nproceed together to make justice and equality a reality for all the \npeople of Northern Ireland.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield, without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator's statement. \nI want to make sure the Record reflects the one person's name that \nwasn't mentioned who has played such a critical role in this process \nfor years, and that is Senator Christopher Dodd from Connecticut.\n  There is no one who has been more involved with this, with the \nknowledge he has of foreign affairs generally, but of the particular \ncountry of Ireland. I know of his love for the people of Ireland and \nhow much he personally has been involved in this, how much time he has \ndevoted to it. He has named everybody who has had something to do with \nit, but the one name he left off was his own.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I appreciate his kind \ncomments. I will add additional names, too: people such as Tip O'Neill \nand Tom Foley. There is a long history that goes back several decades \nof people who have fought for a political solution to the problems here \nand within Ireland. I am grateful to my colleague from Nevada for \nmaking the point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5877-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, domestic violence is often the crime that \nvictims don't want to admit and communities don't want to discuss. \nHowever, almost 10,000 domestic violence victims in South Dakota last \nyear got help from the Department of Social Services. This represents a \nlow estimate of the number of South Dakotans who are victims of \ndomestic violence as many victims fail to seek help.\n  Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number \nof forcible rapes of women declined, and the number of sexual assaults \nnationwide has gone down as well. Despite the success of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, domestic abuse and violence against women continues \nto plague our communities. Consider\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nthe fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this country, and \nthat nearly one in every three adult women experiences at least one \nphysical assault by a partner during adulthood. In fact, more women are \ninjured by domestic violence each year than by automobile accidents and \ncancer deaths combined.\n  These facts illustrate that there is a need in Congress to help \nstates and communities address this problem that impacts all of our \ncommunities.\n  I recently joined Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), Senator Orrin Hatch (R-\nUT), Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD), and others in sponsoring bipartisan \nlegislation, S. 2787, to reauthorize the 1994 Violence Against Women \nAct. Authorization for the important programs contained in this law has \nalready expired, and Congress must act now to ensure that successful \nprograms dealing with domestic violence are funded in the future.\n  As a state lawmaker in 1983, I wrote one of the first domestic \nviolence laws in South Dakota which dedicated a portion of marriage \nlicense fees to help build shelters for battered women. I was also a \ncosponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act in 1990 in the \nHouse of Representatives. Even at that time, many people denied that \ndomestic violence existed in our state. Finally, in 1995, the President \nsigned legislation to strengthen federal criminal law relating to \nviolence against women and fund programs to help women who have been \nassaulted.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, South Dakota \norganizations have received over $6.7 million in federal funding for \ndomestic abuse programs. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act \ndoubled prison time for repeat sex offenders; established mandatory \nrestitution to victims of violence against women; codified much of our \nexisting laws on rape; and strengthened interstate enforcement of \nviolent crimes against women.\n  The law also created a national toll-free hotline to provide women \nwith crisis intervention help, information about violence against \nwomen, and free referrals to local services. Last year, the hotline \ntook its 300,000th call. The number for women to call for help is: 1-\n800-799-SAFE.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the provisions of the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act, the legislation that I am sponsoring in the Senate \nwould improve our overall efforts to reduce violence against women by \nstrengthening law enforcement's role in reducing violence against \nwomen. The legislation also expands legal services and assistance to \nvictims of violence, while also addressing the effects of domestic \nviolence on children. Finally, programs are funded to strengthen \neducation and training to combat violence against women.\n  I have asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to quickly pass S. 2787, \nand I am hopeful that the Senate will approve this important piece of \nlegislation this year so that we can continue fighting domestic abuse \nand violence against women in our state and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5878-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN SOLIDARITY WITH ALL VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF TORTURE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \nbarbaric practice of torture. Yesterday--June 26th, was the 3rd annual \nU.N. International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors. The \nTorture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition has designated this \nweek, June 26th--June 30th, the week of commemoration of torture \nvictims and survivors. Mr. President, colleagues, we should take this \nweek to honor victims of torture, but more importantly, we should use \nthis week as a reminder that together, we can make our world torture-\nfree.\n  Torture has no ideological, geographical, or other boundaries--\nsurvivors of torture are everywhere. The practice of torture is one of \nthe most serious human rights abuses of our time. According to the 1999 \nAmnesty International report, torture and other forms of severe ill-\ntreatment conducted by government security forces, or condoned by other \ngovernment officials, occurred in 125 countries last year.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am extraordinarily proud of the Center \nfor Victims of Torture in Minneapolis, which since 1985 has been doing \npioneering work in addressing the complex needs of survivors of \ntorture. And while we have come a long way in the last fifteen years in \nraising awareness of torture and helping torture victims, there is \nstill much more we should and could be doing to stop this terrible \npractice.\n  My own agenda in the Senate has included a number of human rights \ninitiatives, including the sponsorship of the original Torture Victims \nRelief Act in 1998, which authorized funding to support foreign and \ndomestic treatment centers in providing services to the millions of \nsurvivors of torture worldwide and the estimated 400,000 survivors in \nthis country alone. Repressive governments frequently torture those who \nare defending human rights and democracy in their own country, and the \nTorture Victims Relief Act recognizes the debt we owe to these \ncourageous people who have made such a sacrifice for cherished \nprinciples.\n  It is hard to imagine that in today's world torture still exists, but \nit does. In solidarity with all victims of torture, I ask you to join \nme this week in honoring them by helping raise awareness about torture \nworldwide. All week the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support \nCoalition will be requesting meetings with members and staff, and \nconducting seminars to educate the public about torture. I urge you \nmeet with the Coalition or to attend a seminar to learn the truth about \nthe brutality of this crime. Educating yourself and the public about \nthis terrible human rights abuse is the best way to honor its victims. \nTogether we can end this barbaric practice. Together we can put a stop \nto torture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5878-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to call the Senate's \nattention to a recent tribute to the late Justin Brande authored by \nProfessor Carl Reidel of the University of Vermont.\n  In his article, Professor Reidel captures the spirit of one of the \nmost influential pioneers of 20th Century Vermont environmental \nstewardship. Justin Brande of Cornwall was among the founders of the \nLake Champlain Committee and the Vermont Natural Resources Council, two \nof the most enduring and effective conservation organizations in our \nstate.\n  Vermonters committed to stewardship of the land, to clean water and \nto family farms owe a debt to Justin Brande. He was a leader in organic \nagriculture and a selfless volunteer for countless community and \nstewardship organizations who earned the sincere respect of all.\n  I request that the text of Dr. Reidel's article be prined in the \nRecord and note that his words serve as a wonderful reminder of a life \nwell led and a\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nVermonter whose legacy will nurture future generations. Vermont has \nbeen greatly improved because of both Justin Brande and Carl Reidel.\n\n  [From the Sunday Rutland (VT) Herald/the Times Argus, May 14, 2000]\n\n                  Brande Exemplifies Secret of Vermont\n\n                            (By Carl Reidel)\n\n       ``What's Vermont's secret?'' a friend in Minnesota asked \n     after I gave a talk in 1975 about Vermont's innovative \n     environmental laws. He couldn't understand how such a small \n     state could be ``so creative, even bold.''\n       I replied that I didn't know. I had only lived in Vermont \n     two years.\n       I'm confident now that I know the secret of Vermont. It is \n     people like Justin Brande, who lived in Cornwall from 1951 \n     until he died on April 11 at the age of 83. Like so many who \n     come to live in Vermont from elsewhere, Justin and Susan \n     Brande knew they were coming home when they moved here. And \n     the Vermont Constitution asserts that they are real \n     Vermonters: ``Every person of good character, who comes to \n     settle in this State . . . shall be deemed a free denizen \n     thereof, and entitled to all rights of a natural born subject \n     of this state . . .'' (Chapter II, 66).\n       After graduating from Williams College and several years of \n     legal studies, Justin married Susan Kennedy and moved to \n     Vermont. They settled on a dairy farm in Cornwall, where they \n     raised eight children. In the late '60's Justin sold their \n     herd and enrolled at the University of Vermont, where he \n     earned a master's degree in resource economics. He continued \n     to work his land, honing the ability to farm organically long \n     before most people heard of ``organic'' agriculture. I can't \n     guess how many people he taught over the years to make \n     compost and garden in ways that made pesticides and chemical \n     fertilizers unnecessary by drawing on the inherent health of \n     the land.\n       Early on Justin became involved in his community as a \n     relentless advocate for the land--a free denizen who may have \n     participated in the founding of more Vermont environmental \n     institutions than anyone I have known. And always as a \n     volunteer. He has been a delegate or alternate on the \n     Addison County Regional Planning Commission since its \n     founding. He helped establish the Lake Champlain \n     Committee, and was a founder and the first director of the \n     Vermont Natural Resources Council.\n       In recent years he co-founded the Smallholders Association, \n     which advocates ownership of small, sustainable farms and \n     businesses. Once again, he was ahead of others in seeing the \n     dangers of large enterprises out of scale with Vermont. He \n     argued that his call for moderation and limits was ``not \n     nostalgia for the past, but a real workable model for today \n     and the future * * * a truly humane, democratic and \n     sustainable society.''\n       Former Sen. Art Gibb recalls him as ``a man ahead of his \n     time, a voice crying in the wilderness'' in his advocacy for \n     land protection. Gov. Deane Davis who, with Gibb, crafted Act \n     250, said of him that ``although a staunch environmentalist, \n     he came to problems open-minded until all the evidence was \n     in. Then he took his stand. Justin got me started, and kept \n     after me until Act 250 was signed into law.''\n       My first encounter with Justin was shortly after I came to \n     UVM in 1972 to direct the new Environmental Program. One of \n     the first to teach in the program, his courses seemed to \n     cover everything from cosmology to composting, with no \n     student surviving without new respect for the English \n     language and permanent doubts about conventional economics.\n       When he offered a course in ``organic gardening''--the \n     first at UVM--the dean of the College of Agriculture chided \n     me for allowing such ``nonsense'' in a classroom. It wasn't \n     the first or last time that Justin Brande defined \n     conventional thinking.\n       The secret of Vermont exemplified in Justin Brande's life \n     is not, however, to be found in this summary of his \n     accomplishments. Rather, it is in the words of the \n     Constitution, which define a free denizen of Vermont as a \n     ``person of good character.'' Justin passed the test in every \n     way.\n       He was a person of unusual integrity--a man who lived his \n     convictions, every day, in every place. Never a traitor to \n     his beliefs, Justin taught me and many others by example the \n     deeper meanings of personal integrity.\n       He was a man of courage who was himself in the presence of \n     anyone, be it a fellow farmer, college president, governor or \n     member of Congress. Friend or foe did not daunt him, because \n     he always put principle above reputation.\n       He was a man who cared enormously, for family and friends, \n     for Vermont, for Lake Champlain, for land and life itself. \n     Justin and I enjoyed a good debate. We could disagree \n     strongly, but never with an unkind word.\n       Once, at the end of a lively discussion, he said to me: \n     ``What I like about you, Reidel, is that you are often in \n     error, but never in doubt.''\n       I have no doubts whatsoever that the secret of Vermont is \n     people like Justin Brande, the every-day denizens who are the \n     real heroes of this state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5879-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5879-S5880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICARE'S BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to recognize the \nbirthday of one of the most important programs known to the American \npeople today: Medicare. Thirty-five years ago this week, the Medicare \nprogram was established in order to provide timely, quality health care \ncoverage for America's retirees and the disabled. Today, the Medicare \nsystem still serves this country well, and I believe issues relating to \nits modernization, long-term solvency, and improvement should be among \nour top priorities in this legislative session.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 had a tremendously detrimental effect \non provider payments under Medicare and on the organizations that \ndeliver daily care to our seniors. The provisions in the Balanced \nBudget Act (BBA) relating to Medicare were designed to gradually help \ncontrol costs to the program. Instead, the result has been an affront \nto organizations fighting for their existence. As a Member of the \nSenate, I meet with people daily from Minnesota who come to detail \ntheir concerns, their frustrations, and the impact the BBA continues to \nhave on their institutions. These are institutions serving all segments \nof the healthcare industry, including inpatient and outpatient hospital \ncare, skilled nursing facilities, home health care and emergency \nmedical services.\n  Prior to the BBA, my state of Minnesota already experienced one of \nthe lowest capitation, or reimbursement rates, in the country, so the \nBBA and additional reductions in Medicare payment strategies have taken \nan enormous toll in my state. In fact, the situation has become so dire \nfor so many institutions, providers and patients that the Minnesota \nAttorney General and the Minnesota Senior Federation have filed a \nlawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services in an \neffort to restructure payment schedules and capitation rates under \nMedicare Part C, or Medicare +Choice.\n  As I was working on my statement for today, I glanced across my desk \nand came across an advertisement that I think is relevant. The \nadvertisement reads: ``Where Will Our Patients Go?'' It cites a new \nstudy conducted by Ernst & Young showing that between 1998 and 2000, \nhospital operating margins in the United States declined from 5.5 \npercent to 2.6 percent, a reduction of more than 50 percent in 2000. \nDuring that same period, hospitals' operating margins on services to \nMedicare patients declined from 2.5 percent in 1998 to negative 0.5 \npercent in 2000. Negative 0.5 percent. Translation: every Medicare \npatient that walks through the door of our hospitals and clinics cannot \ncontinue down this path of payment reduction while continuing to \nprovide timely, quality health care services to our seniors and the \ndisabled.\n  I raise these issues to emphasize the measurable consequences of \nlegislative efforts to date, and to outline the challenges we face when \nattempting to add a prescription drug benefit onto an already ailing \nMedicare system. That is why during the budget process, I, along with \nSenator Abraham and several of our colleagues, sent a letter to the \nbudget resolution conferees requesting that language be included in the \nfinal report ensuring that any Medicare reforms, including the addition \nof a prescription drug benefit, would not be implemented at the expense \nof the provider payment rates that are in drastic need of restoration.\n\n  The simple fact is that Medicare does require reform. What form that \nwill ultimately take is really the question. Clearly, Congress has \ntaken steps to reinvigorate Medicare since passage of BBA including: \nthe Balanced Budget Refinement Act, which in a broad sense returned \nfunds to hospitals for outpatient services; the Hatch bill, which \nreduced the arbitrary caps on complicated cases in skilled nursing \nfacilities; and the American Hospital Preservation Act, which currently \naddresses the other half of the hospital equation inpatient services. \nBut these are only band-aids applied to a system that needs \ncomprehensive reform or modernization, including a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  As you know, the Bipartisan Commission to Reform Medicare, under the \ndirection of Congressman Bill Thomas, and Senators Breaux and Frist, \nadvocated dramatic reform in order to better position Medicare in the \nfuture and enhance the benefits offered under the program. Their plan \nrelied heavily on\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nthe injection of private-sector competition in managing benefits. My \nsense is, whatever additional reforms we pursue in Congress need to \nincorporate this kind of private-sector approach. By allowing the \nprivate sector to compete for the business of Medicare beneficiaries, \nboth the Medicare system and the beneficiaries under it would stand to \nbenefit from greater choice and greater flexibility when it comes to \nmeeting their health care needs.\n  In fact, Senators Breaux and Senator Frist have recently drafted a \nnew proposal: Breaux-Frist 2000, the Incremental Bipartisan Medicare \nReform and Prescription Drug Proposal. The proposal calls for a new \nMedicare agency outside of the Health Care Financing Administration and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, which would administer the \ncompetitive relationship between traditional Medicare Fee for Service \nplans and private plans, and would include a prescription drug benefit.\n  Is this ultimately the approach we should take? I do not know. \nHowever, I am committed to exploring efforts like these that place a \npremium on reform or modernization, while attempting to improve benefit \nlevels for beneficiaries through private-sector competition.\n  One of the important improvements that has received a lot of \nattention lately is the provision of a prescription drug benefit. I \nthink most of us would agree that were Medicare to be developed today, \nit would include a benefit of this type. Now, I am not a \npharmacologist, nor am I a medical doctor, so when I first introduced \nmy own prescription drug plan for Medicare over a year ago, I was \namazed at the discoveries that have taken place in this area. The most \nremarkable thing to me is that not only do many of these new, \ninnovative products slow the rates of disease progression, but they \noften create measurable differences in the number of emergency room \nvisits, expensive and invasive procedures, and even deaths. \nPrescription drugs today have an enormous financial impact in terms of \nreducing overall health care costs over the long term and should be \nincorporated into the Medicare system.\n  To that end, I introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs \nfor Seniors Act, or MEDS. My bill was an early attempt to heighten the \ndebate surrounding prescription drugs, and at the same time provide a \nplan that would address the needs of the nearly one third of senior \ncitizens in this country who currently lack any form of prescription \ncoverage. We have all heard the frightening stories of the choices that \nmany seniors are forced to make when it comes to paying for \nprescription drugs. Unfortunately, many of these stories have been used \nto stir the political cauldron over the past several months. But the \nreality is that making choices between food, shelter, and medicine is \nall too common among our neediest seniors. MEDS was introduced to help \nthese people.\n\n  My plan would add a prescription benefit under the already existing \nPart B of Medicare, without creating or adding any new overly \nbureaucratic component to the Medicare program. It works like this: The \nPart B beneficiary would have the opportunity to access the benefit as \nlong as they were Medicare eligible. Those with incomes below 135 \npercent of the nation's poverty level would be provided the benefit \nwithout a deductible and would only be responsible for a 25 percent co-\npayment for all approved medications. I think the neediest American \nseniors who are Medicare eligible should be able to access the benefits \nof medical technology like everyone else, and while they will be \nresponsible for 25 percent of the costs, I believe the benefit will \nreduce the necessity for tough decisions between food and medicine. \nMost important, MEDS has no benefit cap. This allows seniors to access \nthe care they need when they need it, for as long as they need it.\n  My bill also provides relief for seniors above the 135 percent \nthreshold who may be facing overwhelming prescription drug costs \nbecause of the number of medications they take, or the relative expense \nof them, by paying for 75 percent of the costs after a $150 monthly \ndeductible is met. A provision of this type, in addition to the fact \nthat there is no cap on the benefit, is necessary for those who \nconfront high monthly prescription costs.\n  An important part of my plan is that it is not universal and will not \ndisplace anyone from the private insurance coverage that they currently \nhave and probably prefer. Rather, it is offered to provide prescription \ncoverage to those who really need it.\n  Is MEDS perfect? Will it appeal to everyone? Maybe not. But it \nincludes principles that I believe must be included in order for any \nprescription drug bill to hit its mark.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that the challenge before us \ntoday is to enable Medicare to shape and adapt itself to reflect the \nrealities of an ever-changing health care system. After 35 years of \nendless tinkering, we have a real opportunity to make it more \nresponsive, more helpful, and more attuned to the needs of current and \nfuture retirees and disabled persons in this country. I can think of no \nbetter birthday gift for a program that has served so many--and for the \naging, baby-boom generation--than a reinvigorating shot in the arm to \nMedicare that will deliver it into the twenty-first century and keep it \nhealthy for years to come. This is something to which I am wholly \ncommitted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5880-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5880-S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO REBECCA RYAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMs. Rebecca Ryan, who recently retired after more than twenty years of \nteaching in the South San Francisco Unified School District. Ms. Ryan \nis a shining example of what a dedicated teacher can do.\n  Becky Ryan began her teaching career in 1972 in the South San \nFrancisco Unified School District. After 28 years, she is ending a \ncareer that has been filled with many accomplishments.\n  With over twenty years of experience teaching English as a Second \nLanguage Classes, Becky recognized that many immigrant parents, because \nof their inability to speak English, were reluctant to become involved \nin their children's education. This lack of parental involvement was \ndetrimental to the children, and led her to found the Spruce Literacy \nProject at Spruce Elementary School in South San Francisco. This unique \nprogram teaches immigrant parents, mostly mothers, how to read, write, \nand speak English. With a better understanding of the English language, \nparents are able to more fully participate not only in their children's \neducation, but also in their local communities.\n  The profound effect the Spruce Literacy Project has had was most \nevident last year, when the mothers she taught banded together to \noppose funding cuts to the program. Becky has been praised for her can \ndo spirit and her encouragement of students.\n  She has truly made a lasting impact on her students. She has spent \nher career helping to open doors to those who would have otherwise \nfound them closed. A good teacher affects many lives, and the greatest \ncompliment I can give to Rebecca Ryan is that she helped so many \nstudents become productive and successful citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the Friday, June 9 edition \nof the San Mateo County Times on Ms. Ryan's retirement be reprinted in \nthe Congressional Record following my statement.\n\n             [From the San Mate County Times, June 9, 2000]\n\n                  Breaking Barriers and Forging Bonds\n\n                           (By Laura Linden)\n\n       South San Francisco--Many teachers upon retirement can look \n     back and know that they had a positive influence on their \n     students. But perhaps few have helped students make such \n     profound life transformations as Rebecca Ryan, founder of the \n     Spruce Literacy Project at Spruce Elementary School.\n       Through the program, Ryan has taught dozens of immigrant \n     parents, mostly Spanish-speaking mothers, how to speak, read \n     and write English. The idea is the parents will get involved \n     with their kids' educations once the language barrier is \n     knocked down.\n       But according to several mothers who attended a retirement \n     breakfast for Ryan on Wednesday, her work has radiated \n     outward, affecting every corner of their lives. Ryan, a \n     petite Anglo with energy to burn and a deft command of \n     Spanish, has pumped the women up with praise and \n     encouragement, propelling them into American society with a \n     fearless attitude.\n       ``I'm not afraid of anything now,'' said 30-year-old Carmen \n     Reyes, whose child attends Spruce Elementary.\n       Reyes' outlook is a psychological world away from the way \n     she felt when she arrived in this country in 1986 with zero \n     English\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\n     skills and a lot of fear about a society she didn't \n     understand. ``I was scared for everything, everybody,'' she \n     recalled.\n       Other mothers echoed this sentiment.\n       Before taking the literacy class, rites of parenthood like \n     teacher-parent conferences or PTA meetings were unfathomable, \n     they said. The thought of meeting with a teacher, principal \n     or doctor gripped them with fear. They were worried and \n     frustrated when they could not read a letter sent home from \n     school. Often they were too shy, or even ashamed, to try to \n     find out what it was about.\n       So assured are these women now that when the district \n     threatened to cut the Spruce Literacy Project last year, the \n     mothers vociferously rallied to save it. They are also in the \n     midst of a fund-raising drive to replace Spruce Elementary's \n     dilapidated and unsafe kindergarten playground.\n       The women still grapple with English, but they've learned \n     that stumbling through the language is the only way to get \n     better.\n       ``I can go to the doctor and to the dentist and the bank. I \n     don't need much help,'' said 27-year-old Cristina Rodriguez, \n     who immigrated from Mexico when she was 15 but only recently \n     learned to write. Her newfound skills helped her move up from \n     dishwasher to server at Denny's, she said.\n       Ryan started teaching English-as-a-second-language classes \n     in the South San Francisco Unified District in 1972 and still \n     wears a ring that students gave to her that year. A few of \n     those students were at the breakfast on Wednesday.\n       ``It's so great to see how well they've done,'' Ryan said. \n     ``One woman's son has graduated from Stanford, another one's \n     child became a doctor.''\n       When asked why she is retiring, Ryan just said ``it's \n     time.'' She said she will keep in touch with her former \n     students through sewing and reading groups.\n       Teaching ESL for 20 years, Ryan saw that parents were \n     avoiding contact with their kids' schools. She decided that \n     the cultural and language barriers hurt the school as much as \n     the families and founded Spruce Literacy Project in 1992 with \n     a grant from the Peninsula Community Foundation. The program \n     will continue with a new teacher next year, Ryan said.\n       On the Spruce Elementary campus, the program is a \n     convenience for the mothers who take their children to class \n     and then head to their own class down the hall.\n       Gladis Pacheco, 39, said two years of the literacy classes \n     helped her land a good job for Catholic Charities in San \n     Francisco. She came to this country from El Salvador 18 years \n     ago and for most of those years she avoided speaking English. \n     ``In my country I was a secretary but here I was a maid,'' \n     she said.\n       Now she can help her three young children with their \n     homework. Her daughter, Martha, sent a letter to Ryan \n     thanking her for teaching her mom English.\n       ``It was so cute, I didn't even know that she did that,'' \n     Pacheco said.\n       Perhaps the best part is knowing the children are proud of \n     you, Rodriguez said. ``My daughter was sad before when I \n     couldn't speak English but now she's happy,'' she said.\n       Perhaps the best example of Ryan's 28 years in the district \n     is the Flores family.\n       Alejandro Flores, 20, and Florisela Flores, 23, took ESL \n     classes from Ryan when they were in elementary school. Now \n     students at San Francisco State University, the siblings say \n     they gained a sense of well-being from Ryan that continues to \n     this day.\n       ``I was a silent kid, very lonely. But (Ryan) was so nice \n     to me. I liked computers and she rewarded me with computer \n     time,'' said Alejandro, who along with his studies runs a Web \n     design company with a friend.\n       Florisela said she wouldn't be studying three majors with \n     the intention of getting a master's degree in computer \n     science if Ryan hadn't shown her the power of persistence 15 \n     years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5881-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTEL CORPORATION'S TEACHER HOUSING FUND\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when discussing the profound effect \nof California's Silicon Valley on our Nation's economy, we too often \nfocus on just the raw numbers: staggering revenues, high profile IPOs \nand the bottom line.\n  Today, I want to focus on an outstanding example of good corporate \ncitizenship in Silicon Valley intended to promote home ownership and \nhonor teachers at the same time.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Silicon Valley is in the midst of \na housing crisis which makes owning a home an impossibility for most \nteachers. The region's high cost of living makes it extremely difficult \nto recruit and retain talented teachers.\n  Today, I am pleased to inform the Senate that Intel Corporation and \nthe Santa Clara Unified School District have joined forces to create an \ninnovative pilot program designed to help public school teachers buy \nhomes in one of the country's most expensive housing markets: the Intel \nTeacher Housing Fund.\n  Under this new program, which will be administered by the Santa Clara \nCounty Unified School District, Intel will provide the fund with $1.25 \nmillion over the next five years. Eligible teachers will receive $500 \neach month from the fund to help with mortgage payments, for up to five \nyears.\n  I applaud Intel's leadership in forging the much-needed local \npartnerships that will help lead to solutions to Silicon Valley's \naffordable housing crunch. It is my hope that other companies will \nfollow Intel's lead, and show the world that America's high-technology \nfirms are the hub and the heart of the 21st century economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5881-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5881-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE EXPANDED THREAT REDUCTION INITIATIVE--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 118\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Enclosed is a report to the Congress on the Expanded Threat Reduction \nInitiative, as required by section 1309 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65).\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, in Saturday's Washington Post business \nsection there is a headline story: German Phone Giant Seeks U.S. Firm. \nThe concluding paragraph:\n\n       But Hedberg stressed that a joint venture will not, under \n     any circumstances, be considered as the means of crafting an \n     offering for\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n     multinationals: Deutsche Telekom wants full control of \n     whatever course it pursues.\n\n  Accordingly, on behalf of Senators Inouye, Rockefeller, Dorgan, \nKerry, and myself, we introduce legislation to clarify the rules \ngoverning the takeover of U.S. telecommunications providers by overseas \ncompanies owned by foreign governments. The original rules in this area \nwere established by statute in the 1930's, and while the law has not \nchanged, the FCC's interpretation of this statute has.\n  It is time to revisit this matter to ensure that current policy is \nconsistent with efforts to promote vigorous domestic competition, \nmaintain a secure communications system for National Security while \nmeeting our International Trade Obligations.\n  The statute expressly prohibits the transfer of a license to any \ncorporation owned 25 percent or more by a foreign government, but \nallows the FCC to waive this prohibition if doing so would be in the \npublic interest. Unfortunately, the FCC in previous rulemaking has \nfound that the public interest is satisfied solely on the basis of \nwhether the foreign government owned company is based in a WTO country. \nIf the country is a member of the WTO, the FCC assumes that the public \ninterest standard has been met.\n  The legislation we introduce today will bar outright the transfer or \nissuance of telecommunications licenses to providers who are more than \n25 percent owned by a foreign government. We would not be alone in \ntaking this step. Governments across the globe have prevented \ngovernment owned telecommunications providers from purchasing assets in \ntheir countries. In the last month, the Spanish government prevented \nKPN, the Dutch provider, from purchasing Telefonica de Espana because \nof the Netherlands government's stake in KPN. They were not alone; the \nItalian and Hong Kong governments have recently thwarted takeover \nattempts by Deutsche Telekom, of Telecom Italia, and Singapore Tel, of \nHong Kong Telecom, for just such reasons.\n  Recent comments by Deutsche Telekom are particularly disturbing. \nDuring a recent press conference in New York, DT's CEO, Rom Sommer, \nstated ``that the market cap of Deutsche Telekom today vs. any American \npotential acquisition candidate means that nobody is out of reach.'' DT \nis approximately 59 percent government owned, has approximately 100 \nmillion euros in cash and operates essentially from a protected home \nmarket. NTT, the Japanese Government owned provider and France Telecom, \nthe French Government owned provider are similarly situated.\n  Since 1984, U.S. telecommunications policy has encouraged vigorous \ndomestic competition. The modified final judgment and the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act are key examples of our efforts in this area. \nWhile our efforts to foster competition have benefited consumers, these \nefforts have depressed the earnings and stock prices of U.S. domestic \nproviders.\n  But in ``Promoting competition'' here at home we may be facilitating \nthe ease by which foreign protected players may emerge with key U.S. \nassets. So for example, regulated European monopolists Deutsche Telekom \nand France Telecom, both majority foreign government owned--and subject \nto considerably less domestic competition, are reportedly eyeing U.S. \ncompanies.\n  For more than fifty years, U.S. international trade policy has \nencouraged governments to separate themselves from the private or \ncommercial sector. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Government \nencouraged various privatizations of foreign government-owned \ncommercial ventures.\n  With the end of the Cold War and the rise of global capitalism, we \ncan justifiably claim an enormous amount of success in these efforts. \nUnfortunately, these efforts are far from complete. Around the globe, \nsome of the world's most important sectors remain shackled with \ngovernment-owned competitors. These government owned companies distort \ncompetition and undermine the concept of private capitalism.\n  To allow these government-owned entities to purchase U.S.-based \nassets would undermine longstanding and successful U.S. policy. \nMoreover, allowing these competitors into the United States could \npotentially undercut our efforts to ensure competition in our domestic \ntelecommunications market and in markets abroad.\n  Government ownership of commercial assets results in significant \nmarketplace distortion. Companies owned by governments have access to \ncapital, capital markets and interest rates on more favorable terms \nthan companies not affiliated with national governments. Many lenders \nmay assume, correctly, that individual governments would not allow \nthese companies to fail.\n  In addition, companies competing with these providers may suffer from \nincreased costs as a result of the entrance of such providers into the \nmarket. Lenders may conclude that the difficulty in competing with a \ngovernment-owned company will increase the likelihood of failure. As a \nresult, the entrance of a government supported provider into a market \nraises troubling anti-competitive issues. Many of these anti-\ncompetitive effects can be relieved merely by the elimination of \ngovernment-owned stakes.\n  Finally, with regard to foreign markets, it is troubling to permit \ncompanies to be regulated by the governments that own them. While there \nis little we can do to effect this situation, we can take care to see \nthat it is not exacerbated. These companies may use profits from these \nanticompetitive markets to unfairly subsidize U.S. operations.\n  I must raise the national security concerns that trouble me greatly. \nWe can all agree that telecommunications services are important for \nnational security concerns. To permit a foreign government to own such \nassets would raise too many troubling questions.\n  The United States government--for national security purposes--created \nand nurtured the Internet in the 1960s and 1970s to ensure redundancy \nin communications. To permit foreign government owned companies to \npurchase the infrastructure necessary to support the Internet would \nundercut the very success of these efforts.\n  This bill is timely for one additional reason. In recent days we have \nseen an increase in European Union antitrust scrutiny in the \ntelecommunications area. Much of that activity has focused on two high \nprofile proposed mergers, WorldCom-Sprint and Time Warner-AOL, despite \nthe limited impact that these mergers will have on the European Union. \nThis trend has become so pronounced that it received coverage in last \nweeks Washington Post in a story entitled, ``EU Resists Big U.S. \nmergers.''\n  This increased antitrust activity is particularly troublesome because \ncompetitors to both companies are owned by European governments \nincluding the German, French and Dutch governments.\n  Moreover, several of these government owned companies are widely \nreported to be interested in purchasing the remnants of Sprint that may \nbe separated as a result of this investigation. In fact, according to a \nrecent Financial Times story, as a result of aggressive antitrust \nenforcement, a strong American competitor--MCI WorldCom may fall prey \nto one of these government owned-competitors.\n  For the United States Justice Department to take this step is one \nmatter--these mergers involve American companies, primarily doing \nbusiness in the United States. For the EU to take this step--when it is \nlikely to assist European Companies owned by its member governments--is \nquite another.\n  Moreover, this is not the first time that the EU has intervened in a \nU.S. merger to protect European government owned companies. Several \nyears ago, the EU objected to the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger in \norder to protect the government owned Airbus consortium.\n  In conclusion, this legislation establishes all of the correct \nincentives. It does not prohibit foreign investment; rather, it \nprohibits foreign government investment. Many companies have expressed \na desire to enter the U.S.; ours is a lucrative market. By encouraging \nadditional privatization of the government-owned telecommunications \nproviders interested in providing services in the United States we will \nfurther the ideals of international capitalism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2794. A bill to provide for a temporary Federal district judgeship \nfor\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nthe southern district of Indiana; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                TEMPORARY JUDGESHIP FOR SOUTHERN INDIANA\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Richard Lugar to \nintroduce the Southern District of Indiana Temporary Judgeship Act. \nThis legislation creates an additional temporary judgeship for the \nSouthern District of Indiana to help alleviate the strain experienced \nover the past five years as a result of an extremely heavy caseload.\n  In the last year alone, the Southern District has seen a higher than \naverage number of case filings with 585 filings per judge, compared to \nthe national average of 493 filings per judge. The Federal Bureau of \nPrisons ``Death Row'' has recently been located at the United States \nPenitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is part of the Southern \nDistrict. As a result, the Southern District anticipates a significant \nincrease in the number of petitions in death habeas cases. In addition, \nthe Southern District of Indiana includes our state capital of \nIndianapolis, the center of government and politics in the Hoosier \nState. The court has experienced an increase in the number of cases \nwhich raise political and public policy questions. The Southern \nDistrict court is clearly overburdened.\n  The legislation I introduce today is critical to ensuring the \ndelivery of Justice in the Southern District of Indiana. There is wide \nagreement about the need for this additional judgeship and, in fact, \nthe Judicial Conference has called on Congress to add a temporary \njudge. I urge my colleagues to give this legislation their serious \nconsideration and support. I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2795. A bill to provide for the use and distribution of the funds \nawarded to the Western Shoshone identifiable group under Indian Claims \nCommission Docket Numbers 326-A-1, 326-A-3, 326-K, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                western shoshone claims distribution act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Western \nShoshone Claims Distribution Act.\n  Historically, the Western Shoshone were the residents land in the \nnortheastern corner of Nevada and parts of California. For more than a \nhundred years, the Western Shoshone have received no compensation for \nthe loss of their tribal lands. In the 1950's, the Indian Lands Claim \nCommission was established to compensate Indians for lands ceded to the \nUnited States. The commission determined that Western Shoshone land had \nbeen taken through ``gradual encroachment,'' and awarded the tribe 26 \nmillion dollars. The commission's decision was later approved by the \nUnited States Supreme Court. However, it was not until 1979 that the \nUnited States appropriated more than 26 million dollars to reimburse \nthe descendants of these tribes for their loss.\n  Mr. President, the Western Shoshone are not a wealthy people. A third \nof the tribal members are unemployed; for many of those who do have \njobs, it is a struggle to live from one paycheck to the next. Wood \nstoves often provide the only source of heat in their aging homes. Like \nother American Indians, the Western Shoshone continue to be \ndisproportionately affected by poverty and low educational achievement. \nThe high school completion rate for Indian people between the ages of \n20 and 24 is dismally low. American Indians have a drop-out rate 12.5 \npercent higher than the rest of the nation. For the majority of the \nWestern Shoshone, the money contained in the settlement funds could \nlead to drastic lifestyle improvements.\n  Yet twenty years later, those three judgement funds still remain in \nthe United States Treasury. The Western Shoshone have not received a \nsingle penny of the money which is rightfully theirs. In those twenty \nyears, the original trust fund has grown to more than 121 million \ndollars. It is long past the time that this money should be delivered \ninto the hands of its owners. The Western Shoshone Steering Committee \nhas officially requested that Congress enact legislation to affect this \ndistribution.\n  It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that the vast \nmajority of those who qualify to receive these funds support an \nimmediate distribution of their money. This Act will provide payments \nto eligible Western Shoshone tribal members and ensure that future \ngenerations of Western Shoshone will be able to enjoy the benefit of \nthe distribution in perpetuity. Through the establishment of a tribally \ncontrolled grant trust fund, individual members of the Western Shoshone \nwill be able to apply for money for education and other needs within \nlimits set by a self-appointed committee of tribal members.\n  It is clear that the Western Shoshone want the funds from their claim \ndistributed with all due haste. Members of the Western Shoshone \ngathered in Fallon and Elko, Nevada in May of 1998. They cast a vote \noverwhelmingly in favor of distributing the funds. 1,230 supported the \ndistribution in the statewide vote; only 53 were opposed. I rise today \nin support and recognition of their decision. The final distribution of \nthis fund has lingered for more than twenty years and it is clear that \nthe best interests of the tribes will not be served by prolonging their \nwait.\n  Mr. President, twenty years has been more than long enough.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2795\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Western Shoshone Claims \n     Distribution Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the conservation and development of \nwater and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \nconstruct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                water resources development act of 2000\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000, and I am pleased that my \ncolleagues Senator Bob Smith, Environment and Public Works Committee \nchairman and Senator Max Baucus, ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee have joined as co-sponsors of this bill.\n  The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA2000) is the \nculmination of four hearings that the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works has held regarding a number of different water resources \ndevelopment issues and projects. The cornerstone of this year's WRDA \nbill will be the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, however, \nthe bill that I am introducing today does not contain an Everglades \nRestoration Title. That title will be added as an amendment to this \nbill by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Bob \nSmith when the full Committee marks-up WRDA 2000 on Wednesday, June 28, \n2000.\n  Some of my colleagues may question the need for a water resources \nbill this year since Congress passed a WRDA bill just last year. In \nreality, last year's bill was actually unfinished business from the \n105th Congress, and if Congress is to get back on its two year cycle \nfor passage of WRDA legislation, we need to act on a bill this year. \nThe two year cycle is important to avoid long delays between the \nplanning and execution of projects and to meet Federal commitments to \nstate and local governments partners who share the costs of these \nprojects with the Federal government.\n  While the two year authorization cycle is extremely important in \nmaintaining efficient schedules for completion of water resources \nprojects, efficient schedules also depend on adequate appropriations. \nThe appropriation of funds for the Corps' program has not been adequate \nand, as a result, there is a backlog of over 500 projects that will \ncost the federal government $38 billion to complete.\n  I believe these are worthy projects with positive benefit-to-cost \nratios and capable non-Federal sponsors. Nevertheless, the inability to \nprovide adequate funding for these projects means that project \nconstruction schedules are spread out over a longer period of time, \nresulting in increased construction costs and delays in achieving \nproject benefits.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that budget allocations and Corps \nappropriations are beyond the purview of the authorization package that \nI am introducing today, but I believe that the backlog issue should \nimpact the way we approach WRDA2000 in three very important ways.\n  First, we need to control the mission creep of the Corps of \nEngineers. I am not convinced that there is a Corps role in water and \nsewage plant construction, and I am pleased to report that the bill \nthat I am introducing today contains no authorizations for \nenvironmental infrastructure, such as wastewater treatment plants or \ncombined\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\nsewer overflow systems. Another example is the brownfields remediation \nauthority proposed by the White House for the Corps. Brownfield \nremediation is a very important issue. It is a big problem in my state \nof Ohio and I am working to remove federal impediments to State \ncleanups. Having said that, I do not believe this is a mission of the \nCorps of Engineers, and the bill that I am introducing today does not \ncontain authority for the Corps to be involved in brownfields \nremediation.\n\n  We need to recognize and address the large unmet national needs \nwithin the traditional Corps mission areas: needs such as flood \ncontrol, navigation and the emerging mission area of restoration of \nnationally significant environmental resources like the Florida \nEverglades.\n  The second thing that we need to do is to make sure that the projects \nCongress authorizes meet the highest standard of engineering, economic \nand environmental analysis. We must be sure that these projects and \nproject modifications make maximum net contributions to economic \ndevelopment and environmental quality.\n  We can only assure that projects meet these high standards if \nprojects have received adequate study and evaluation to establish \nproject costs, benefits, and environmental impacts to an appropriate \nlevel of confidence. This means that a feasibility report must be \ncompleted before projects are authorized for construction. Thus, WRDA \n2000 only contains projects which have completed feasibility reports.\n  Finally, we have to preserve the partnerships and cost sharing \nprinciples of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. WRDA '86 \nestablished the principle that water resources project should be \naccomplished in partnerships with states and local governments and that \nthis partnership should involve significant financial participation by \nthe non-federal sponsors. This bill contains no cost share changes.\n  My experience as Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio convinced me \nthat the requirement for local funding to match federal dollars results \nin much better projects than where Federal funds are simply handed out. \nWhether it's parks, housing, highways, or water resources projects, the \nrequirement for a local cost share provides a level of accountability \nthat is essential to a quality project. Cost sharing principles must \nnot be weakened, and I am pleased to report that they are not in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today ensures that we \nonly commit to those projects that are properly within the purview of \nthe Corps of Engineers, it provides that each project meets the \nnecessary criteria for federal involvement and it preserves the cost-\nsharing arrangement with state and local sponsors that has been in \nplace for more than a decade. It is a responsible approach to meeting \nour nation's water resources needs, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to advance the goals of this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000 be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill as ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my \ncolleagues, Senators Voinovich and Baucus, in the introduction of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000. As many of you know, the \nadministration presented a proposal to Congress in April of this year, \nwhich I introduced by request at that time. The bill we introduce today \nincludes a number of the provisions contained in the Administration's \nrequest, in addition to those Member requests which met the criteria \nagreed to by myself, Senator Voinovich, the chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and Senator Baucus, the \nranking member of the Committee.\n  In responding to questions regarding what projects were included in \nthis bill, I remind my colleagues that it has been the policy of the \nCommittee to authorize only those construction projects that conform \nwith cost-sharing policies established in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1986, and amended by subsequent WRDAs. In addition, \nit has been the policy of the Committee to require projects to have \nundergone full and final engineering, economic, and environmental \nreview by the Chief of Engineers to ensure that the project is indeed \njustified.\n  In ensuring the integrity of the WRDA process, that criteria served \nas the base to guide us to where we are today. S. xxxx is a responsible \nbill that provides for the traditional mission of the U.S. Army Corps \nof engineers and which also recognizes the Corps' expanding presence in \nthe area of environmental restoration. This bill contains 23 \nauthorizations for flood control, navigation, shoreline protection, and \nenvironmental restoration projects for which a Chief's Report is \nexpected by the end of the calendar year. In addition, there are \napproximately 31 project-related modifications and provisions, as well \nas 35 feasibility studies. While half of the projects in this bill are \nin the navigation mission, nearly a quarter are dedicated to \nenvironmental and ecosystem restoration projects, demonstrating this \nchairman's belief that the Corps is moving in the right direction. This \nbill strongly adheres to the fundamental purposes and principles of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers.\n  This sound bill deserves prompt action by not only the Senate, but \nour counterparts in the House of Representatives, The number of \nlegislative days left this year is dwindling. If we are to enact water \nresources legislation prior to adjournment, it will take the full \ncooperation of both Chambers of Congress and our respected leadership. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to move the WRDA process \nforward as expeditiously as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2797. A bill to authorize a comprehensive Everglades restoration \nplan; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            restoring the everglades, an american legacy act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today is a historic day. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators Graham, Mack, Voinovich, and \nBaucus, in introducing a measure to restore, preserve and protect one \nof America's unique ecosystems: the Everglades. More than six months \nago, I went to Florida and made a promise to the people of that state \nand this nation. I promised to make Everglades restoration my top \npriority as the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I am proud to say that after many months of hard work, \nintense negotiation, and through it all, uncompromising dedication, we \nhave before us the bill to restore America's Everglades.\n  Our bill not only has the support of the two Senators from Florida, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, it has \nthe support of the State of Florida and the administration. It truly is \nbipartisan. It truly is historic.\n  We all know that the Everglades face grave peril, but such dire \nsituations do not always serve to motivate Congress to act, \nparticularly in a presidential election year. The truth of the matter \nis that the federal government is partially responsible for the \ncondition of the Everglades and it is our obligation to fix what we \nhelped break. The Everglades cannot afford for Congress to delay.\n  The unintended consequence of the 1948 federal flood control project \nis the too efficient redirection of water from Lake Okeechobee. \nApproximately 1.7 billion gallons of water a day is needlessly directed \nout to sea. The original Central and Southern Florida Project was done \nwith the best of intentions--the federal government simply had to act \nwhen devastating floods took thousands of lives prior to the project's \nconstruction. Unfortunately, the very success of the Central and \nSouthern Florida Project disrupted the natural sheet\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nflow of water through the so-called ``River of Grass,'' altering or \ndestroying the habitat for many species of native plants, mammals, \nreptiles, fish and wading birds.\n  Well, we are going to recapture that wasted water, store it, and \nredirect it, when needed, to the natural system in the South Florida \necosystem. It sounds simple, but in actuality, the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan is quite complex and will take 30 years to \nconstruct. Each step in the Plan was carefully chosen and the bill my \ncolleagues and I have introduced today represents the first stage of \nthat process.\n  A project of this size is not without uncertainties. Our bill \nauthorizes four pilot projects to get at some of those unknowns. In \naddition, this bill authorizes an initial suite of ten construction \nprojects. These projects were carefully selected by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the South Florida Water Management District and included \nin the plan as the projects that would, once constructed, have \nimmediate benefits to the natural system. Almost right away, the plan \ngets at restoring the natural sheet flow that years of human \ninterference has interrupted.\n  Our bill goes farther, by authorizing programmatic authority for the \nCorps and the non-federal sponsor to move forward with critical \nprojects that will have immediate, independent, and substantial \nbenefits to the natural system. Together, these components represent \nthe first phase. The rest of the projects will come to Congress for \nauthorization as part of the biennial Water Resources Development Act.\n  One of my favorite aspects of the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan is its inherent flexibility. If we learn something new \nabout the ecosystem, perfect our modeling techniques, or just plain see \nthat something isn't working right, through the concept of adaptive \nmanagement, we can modify the plan based on the new information on \nhand.\n  Is this bill expensive? I suppose that depends on your point of view. \nI am well-known as a fiscal conservative and I certainly do not believe \nin wasting the taxpayers' money. The total cost of implementing the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is $7.8 billion dollars. The \ntotal cost to the Federal government, however, is $3.9 billion. That's \nright. The State of Florida is picking up fifty percent of the tab. \n$3.9 billion over the number of years that this project will be \nconstructed amount to an average of $200 million a year. That is about \na can of coke, if you can find the right machine, for each American \neach year to restore this national treasure. It should be noted that I \nfully support increasing the budget of the Corps of Engineers so that \nit can comfortably fund not only this project, but the numerous other \nmeritorious projects within the Corps mission.\n  I hear my colleagues asking: how do we know the natural system is \ngoing to be the primary beneficiary of the water made available by this \nproject? I'll tell you how. Our bill contains painstakingly negotiated \n``assurances language'' that provide the mechanism by which water is \nreserved and allocated for the natural system. The Secretary of the \nArmy and Governor of the State of Florida will enter into an up-front, \nbinding agreement that will ensure that water available from the plan \nwill be available for the natural system. Furthermore, the Secretary of \nthe Army, in concurrence with the Governor of the State of Florida and \nthe Secretary of the Interior will promulgate programmatic regulations \nto ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan are achieved.\n  I repeat for the benefit of my colleagues, this bill has the support \nof the State of Florida, the administration, and a bipartisan group of \nco-sponsors. This truly is a remarkable feat that deserves recognition \nby the Senate in the form of swift passage.\n  I am afraid too often people forget that the Everglades is a national \nenvironmental treasure. Restoration benefits not only Floridians, but \nthe millions of us who visit Florida each year to behold this unique \necosystem. We need to view our efforts as our legacy to future \ngenerations, as my dear friend and predecessor, the late John Chafee so \nexemplified. Many years from now, I hope that this Congress will be \nremembered for putting aside partisanship, politics, self-interest and \nshort-term thinking by answering the call and saving the Everglades \nwhile we still had the chance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire, Senator Baucus, Senator Voinovich, and Senator \nMack, to introduce legislation to restore America's Everglades. The \ndiversity of this group speaks volumes about the national commitment to \nrestoring America's Everglades.\n  The Everglades is sick. We need to perform the surgery to make it \nwell. Since the passage of the Central and South Florida Flood Control \nProject in 1948, nearly half of the original Everglades has been \ndrained or otherwise altered. According to the National Parks and \nConservation Association, the national parks and preserves contained in \nthe Everglades are among the ten most endangered in the nation.\n  In 1983, when I was Governor, Florida launched an effort--known as \nSave Our Everglades--to revitalize this precious ecosystem. Our goal \nwas simple. By the end of our efforts, we wanted the Everglades to look \nand function more like it had in 1900 than it did in 1983. Back then, \nrestoring the natural health and function of this precious ecosystem \nseemed like a distant dream. But after seventeen years of bipartisan \nprogress in the context of a strong federal-state partnership, we now \nstand on the brink of seeing that dream become reality.\n  I want to speak for a moment about that federal-state partnership. I \noften compare this unique partnership to a marriage--if both partners \nrespect each other, and pledge to work through any challenges together, \nthe marriage will be strong and successful. Today, we are again \ncelebrating the strength of that marriage, and this legislation \ncontains several provisions born out of the respect that sustains this \nmarriage.\n  For example, it requires that the Federal Government pay half of the \ncosts of operations and maintenance. It offers assurances to both the \nFederal and State governments regarding the use and distribution of \nwater in the Everglades ecosystem. Everglades restoration can't work \nunless the executive branch, Congress, and State government move \nforward hand-in-hand.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, the administration, the \nState, and stakeholders in this project to continue that cooperation \nand achieve the historic goal of preserving the Everglades for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for the \nEverglades restoration bill introduced today by my friend, and chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Bob Smith. This \nbill represents a tremendous amount of effort and hard work and I am \ngrateful to all my colleagues who have joined Senator Graham and me in \nthis effort.\n  Today is an important day in the nearly twenty-year process of \nrestoring America's Everglades. It is important because we are standing \nat last at the historic juncture between planning and action. It is \nimportant because now--at long last--we have a realistic chance of \nrestoring, and protecting for future generations, a unique \nenvironmental treasure that is fractured, starved for water, and locked \nin a steady state of decline. And it is important because the bill \nwe're introducing today represents the cumulative efforts of all those \nwho did the work on the largest and most significant environmental \nrestoration project in our nation's history.\n  Why does this bill matter? Why are the Everglades deserving of \nCongress' time and effort? Let me offer a few reasons. This bill \nmatters because in the last century a wonderful, pristine natural \nsystem in the heart of South Florida was systematically robbed of its \nbeauty and uniqueness in the name of short-term human interest. This \nbill matters because the America's Everglades is a national treasure, \nunique in the world, and deserving of a better fate than what is \ncurrently written for it in the laws of this country. Our bill matters \nbecause we Floridians--after years of acrimony and conflicting goals--\nhave come together behind a balanced plan that fully reconciles the \nneeds of the natural system with those\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nof the existing water users. And the restoration matters--to us, as \nlegislators--because past Congresses caused this problem, and we in our \ngeneration should fix it.\n  It has been well documented how the Congress in 1948--acting under \nthe pressures of the day--authorized the systematic destruction of the \nEverglades in the name of flood control, urban development, and \nagriculture. That is history and we cannot change that. Instead, we \nmust respond to the needs and priorities of our own generation, and \npass this good bill to restore America's Everglades.\n  Let's be clear, Mr. President. Passing this bill, this year, is all \nthat remains between the long years of study and the actual restoration \nof America's Everglades. The administration has done their part in \ndevoting a tremendous amount of time and effort on the document before \nyou. To Governor Bush's credit, the State of Florida has already \nwritten this plan into Florida's laws and arranged funding for \nFlorida's share of the cost. There is only one task remaining: we in \nCongress must pass this plan, this year, and let the work of \nrestoration begin.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the bill we're \nintroducing today. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2798.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Deposit \nand Share Insurance Adjustment Act of 2000.\n  This bill will insure that the value of Federal Deposit and Share \nInsurance is not eroded by inflation and remains at a steady value of \n$100,000.

A bill to allow a deduction for Federal, State, and local \ntaxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, or other motor fuel purchased by \nconsumers between July 1, 2000, and December 31, 2000; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                     emergency fuel tax act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator Campbell and \nSenator Abraham today in introducing legislation that will ease the \nburden that the American motorist is facing every time he or she fills \nup at the gas pump. Those of us who are going to the gas pumps lately \nknow that we are starting to see gas prices at an all-time high. We \nhave never had gas prices approaching $1.75, which is the standard \nprice for regular gasoline in the United States today.\n  Our legislation recognizes that many consumers are facing a gasoline \nemergency. They use their cars to get to work, drive to day care, and \ntake their children to summer school. Suddenly they are finding that \nfilling up the family car's gas tank is costing $50 to $70 or even $100 \nin some parts of the country. And in an America where the Clinton-Gore \nadministration has done its best for seven years to increase America's \ndependence on OPEC, the American public was lulled by the \nAdministration into believing that gas prices would always remain \nstable and cheap. The result: Nearly 50 percent of all vehicles sold \nare low-mileage sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n  Earlier this year, I co-sponsored legislation that would have \ntemporarily repealed the 4.3 cent gas tax increase that was enacted in \n1993 with Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking vote. Many Senators \nexpressed concern that a temporary repeal of the tax would affect the \nhighway construction program. Although our legislation resolved that \nproblem, all Democrats and a few Republicans rejected providing gas tax \nrelief and the measure was defeated.\n  This is a new concept in one sense. But it does not establish a \nprecedent. The bill I am introducing is to temporarily reduce the \nburden of all gasoline taxes on the American motorist. The bill will \nallow individuals and families to take an above-the-line deduction on \ntheir income that they pay taxes on for gasoline taxes incurred between \nJuly 1 and December 31 of the year 2000. This means every taxpayer who \ndrives will be able to take advantage of the tax deduction from his or \nher income tax.\n  The deduction of gasoline taxes is not a new idea. Up until 1978, \nmotorists could deduct the State and local gasoline taxes if they \nitemized those taxes.\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nLegislation I have introduced today goes a step further by also \npermitting the deduction of Federal gasoline taxes, and it is an \ninclusive tax deduction since it will allow itemizers and nonitemizers \nto claim these taxes.\n  For example, if we adopt this measure, and a family in my State of \nAlaska has a car that gets 20 miles per gallon and they drive perhaps \n9,000 miles in the next 6 months, they will get a $118 tax deduction; \nthe same family in Michigan will get a $195 tax deduction; a family in \nColorado will receive a $181 tax deduction.\n  Some detractors say citizens will have to itemize returns. Most \npeople go to self-service gas stations where a receipt is provided. I \nthink most Americans would welcome this $195 or $181 tax deduction. I \ndon't think it is too much to ask motorists.\n  The IRS will surely draft some easy-to-use tables that will list by \nState the total gasoline tax burden. I have an example of what the \ntables look like. I ask unanimous consent that gas tax tables prepared \nby the American Petroleum Institute be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the average national price of unleaded \nregular gasoline is anywhere from $1.70 to $1.80 today. This weekend \nbegins the summer driving season. Gasoline prices could well go above \n$2 a gallon in many parts of the country. As we know, they are already \nover $2.30 in Chicago, Milwaukee, and other areas.\n  Our proposal is a modest attempt to help the American family cope \nwith these extraordinary price rises. This isn't going to solve the \nproblem of high gasoline prices. We could have solved that problem 5 or \n6 years ago if we would have adopted the 1995 budget which permitted \ndrilling in America's most promising new oil area, the sliver of the \nArctic Coastal Plain, but President Clinton vetoed that bill, surely \nwith the concurrence of Vice President Gore. So today we are dependent \nas never before on imported oil. The result is the record gasoline \nprices.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the Emergency Fuel Act of 2000 \nand the previously referenced tax tables be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the Emergency Fuel Tax Act of \n     2000.\n\n     SEC. 2. TEMPORARY INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR FEDERAL, STATE, \n                   AND LOCAL FUELS TAXES.\n\n       (a) Allowance of Deduction.--\n       (1) In general.--In the case of the retail sale of \n     gasoline, diesel fuel, or other motor fuel after June 30, \n     2000, and before January 1, 2001, there shall be allowed to \n     the purchaser a deduction under section 164 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in an amount equal to the Federal, \n     State, and local taxes on the sale.\n       (2) Deduction allowed to nonitemizers.--The deduction under \n     subsection (a) shall be taken into account in computing \n     adjusted gross income under section 62 of such Code.\n       (b) Taxes Imposed Other Than at Retail.--For purposes of \n     subsection (a), any tax on any gasoline, diesel fuel, or \n     other motor fuel which is imposed other than on the retail \n     sale shall be treated as having been imposed on such sale and \n     as having been paid by the purchaser.\n       (c) Guidelines.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     establish such procedures (including the publication of \n     tables where appropriate) as are necessary to enable \n     taxpayers to determine the amount of taxes for which a \n     deduction is allowed under subsection (a).\n       (d) Motor Fuel.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``motor fuel'' means any motor fuel subject to tax under \n     subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   GASOLINE TAXES STATE-BY-STATE,

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish an integrated environmental reporting \nsystem; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nTHE STREAMLINED ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTING AND POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nbipartisan legislation, the Streamlined Environmental Reporting and \nPollution Prevention Act of 2000, with Senator Crapo, my colleague on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, as an original cosponsor.\n  This bill will require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nto give businesses one point of contact for all federal environmental \nreporting requirements, and to otherwise minimize the administrative \nburdens of environmental reporting. This ``one-stop'' reporting system \nwill use a common nomenclature throughout and use language \nunderstandable to business people, not just to environmental \nspecialists. Its electronic version will also provide pollution \nprevention information to the business. The bill will also\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\ngive each State, tribal, or local agency the option of reporting \ninformation to one point of contact at EPA, which will facilitate their \nefforts to streamline environmental reporting.\n  Mr. President, a law streamlining environmental reporting will \nobviously benefit industry. It will be of great environmental benefit \nas well. High-quality environmental information is the foundation of \nenvironmental policy-making. Unfortunately, there are significant gaps \nand inaccuracies in the environmental information reported by \nbusinesses today. This is because environmental reporting currently \ninvolves scouring several different EPA offices for the applicable \nrequirements, and then mastering a bewildering variety of reporting \nformats and regulatory nomenclatures. Reducing needless complications, \nas our bill does, will increase compliance with reporting programs and \nimprove the accuracy of the information reported.\n  In addition to improving environmental information, a law \nstreamlining environmental reporting will help businesses prevent \npollution at the source. Mainstream business decision-makers--those who \ndesign the business's product, decide how to make it, manufacture it, \nand instruct customers in its use--inadvertently make the vast majority \nof environmental decisions at the business. When a business designs its \nproduct and the process for manufacturing the product, it is locking in \nits major environmental impacts. Streamlining environmental reporting \nwill make it easier for mainstream business decision-makers to \nunderstand their environmental obligations. This will make it easier to \nincorporate environmental considerations into the design of products \nand production processes, and instructions on their use--that is, \npreventing pollution at the source.\n  This bill is endorsed by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the Printing Industries of America, the National \nAssociation of Metal Finishers, the American Electroplaters and Surface \nFinishers Society, the Metal Finishing Suppliers Association, the U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group, Environmental Defense, the National \nEnvironmental Trust, and the National Pollution Prevention Roundtable. \nI ask unanimous consent that their statements of support, the text of \nthe bill, and a section-by-section summary of the bill be entered into \nthe Record.\n  Mr. President, this is a bipartisan win-win bill that will be good \nfor U.S. industry and good for the environment. I urge my colleagues to \njoin Senator Crapo and me in supporting this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2800\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (D) other items that the Administrator considers to be \n     appropriate;\n       (6) in consultation with the committee referred to in \n     paragraph (5), implement, and update as necessary, a \n     nomenclature throughout the integrated reporting system that \n     uses terms that the Administrator believes are understandable \n     to reporting persons that do not have environmental \n     expertise;\n       (7) consolidate reporting of data that, but for \n     consolidation under this paragraph, would be required to be \n     reported to the integrated reporting system at more than 1 \n     point in the same data submission;\n       (8) provide for applicable data formats and submission \n     protocols, including procedures for legally enforceable \n     electronic signature in accordance with the Government \n     Paperwork Elimination Act (44 U.S.C. 3504 note) that, as \n     determined by the Administrator--\n       (A) conform, to the maximum extent practicable, with \n     public-domain standards for electronic commerce;\n       (B) are accessible to a substantial majority of reporting \n     persons; and\n       (C) provide for the integrity and reliability of the data \n     reported sufficient to satisfy the legal requirement of proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt;\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n       (9) establish a National Environmental Data Model that \n     describes the major data types, significant attributes, and \n     interrelationships common to activities carried out by the \n     Administrator and by State, tribal, and local agencies \n     (including permitting, compliance, enforcement, budgeting, \n     performance tracking, and collection and analysis of \n     environmental samples and results), which the Administrator \n     shall--\n       (A) use as the framework for databases on which the data \n     reported to the Administrator through the integrated system \n     shall be kept; and\n       (B) allow other Federal agencies and State, tribal, and \n     local governments to use;\n       (10) establish an electronic commerce service center, \n     accessible through the point of contact established under \n     paragraph (1), to provide technical assistance, as necessary \n     and feasible, to each person that elects to submit applicable \n     electronic reports;\n       (11) provide each reporting person access, through the \n     point of contact established under paragraph (1), to \n     scientifically sound, publicly available information on \n     pollution prevention technologies and practices;\n       (12) at the discretion of the Administrator, develop, \n     within the reporting system, different methods by which the \n     reporting person may electronically provide the required \n     information, in order to facilitate use of the system by \n     different sectors, sizes, and categories of reporting \n     persons;\n       (13) provide protection of confidential business \n     information or records as defined under section 552a of title \n     5, United States Code, so that each reported item of data \n     receives protection equivalent to the protection that item of \n     data would receive if the item were reported to the \n     Administrator through means other than the integrated \n     reporting system;\n       (14) develop (or cause to be developed), and make available \n     free of charge through the Internet, software for use by the \n     reporting person that, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     assists the person in assembling necessary data, reporting \n     information, and receiving information on pollution \n     prevention technologies and practices as described in \n     paragraph (9); and\n       (15) provide a mechanism by which a reporting person may, \n     at the option of the reporting person, electronically \n     transfer information from the data system of the reporting \n     person to the integrated reporting system through the use, in \n     the integrated reporting system, of--\n       (A) open data formats (such as the ASCII format);

INTERAGENCY COORDINATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--At the request of any Federal, State, \n     tribal, or local agency, the Administrator shall coordinate \n     the integration of reporting required under section 3 with \n     similar efforts by the agency that, as determined by the \n     Administrator, are consistent with this Act.\n       (b) Integrated Reporting Across Jurisdictions.--Under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator may develop a procedure \n     under which a person that is required to report information \n     under 1 or more laws administered by the Administrator and 1 \n     or more laws administered by a State, tribal, or local agency \n     may report all required information--\n       (1) through 1 point of contact using a single electronic \n     system or paper form; and\n       (2) in the case of an annual reporting requirement, at 1 \n     time each year.\n       (c) Common Data Format Across Jurisdictions.--To facilitate \n     reporting by persons with facilities in more than 1 State, \n     tribal, or local jurisdiction, the Administrator shall \n     encourage the use of a common data format by any State, \n     tribal, or local agency coordinating with the Administrator \n     under subsection (a).\n       (d) Provision of Information.--At the request of the \n     Administrator, the head of a Federal department or agency \n     shall provide to the Administrator information on reporting \n     requirements established under a law administered by the \n     agency.\n       (e) Selective Use of Integrated Reporting System.--The \n     Administrator may design the integrated system to allow a \n     reporting person to use the integrated reporting system for \n     some purposes and not for others.\n\n     SEC. 5. REGULATIONS.\n\n       The Administrator may promulgate such regulations as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORTS.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, if the Administrator determines that 1 or more \n     provisions of law explicitly prohibit or hinder the \n     integration of reporting and other actions required under \n     this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report \n     identifying those provisions.\n\n     SEC. 7. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act limits, modifies, \n     affects, amends, or otherwise changes, directly or \n     indirectly, any provision of Federal or State law or the \n     obligation of any person to comply with any provision of law.\n       (b) Effect.--Neither this Act nor the integrated reporting \n     system shall alter or affect the obligation of a reporting \n     person to provide the information required under any \n     reporting requirement.\n       (c) Reporting.--Nothing in this Act authorizes the \n     Administrator to require the reporting of information that is \n     in addition to, or prohibit the reporting of, information \n     that is reported as of the day before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NFIB,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the 600,000 small \n     business owners that make up the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), I would like to express support \n     for the ``Streamlined Environmental Reporting and Pollution \n     Prevention Act of 2000.''\n       The 1996 Code of Federal Regulations, which is the annual \n     listing of agency regulations, takes up 204 volumes with a \n     total of 132,112 pages. According to research conducted by \n     the Small Business Administration, small businesses bear 63 \n     percent of the total regulatory burden. It is no wonder that \n     a 1996 NFIB Education Foundation Study ranked unreasonable \n     government regulations and federal paperwork burdens as two \n     of the top ten problems facing small business.\n       Simplying this complex system of regulations is a priority \n     for NFIB. As you know, we set our positions on matters of \n     public policy by regularly polling our membership. When we \n     asked small business owners whether they would support the \n     creation of a short-form reporting system, 81 percent of our \n     members said, ``yes.''\n       A group of small business owners that are NFIB members \n     reviewed your proposed legislation and they were particularly \n     pleased with the following:\n       The shift to a one time annual reporting requirement will \n     save valuable time and money.\n       The legislation wisely extends the benefits of a simplified \n     reporting system to small business owners that do not have \n     the capability of reporting electronically.\n       The requirement that information on new methods and \n     technology be made available to assist in pollution \n     prevention efforts will be helpful to small business owners \n     that do not have direct access to research and development \n     programs.\n       The requirement that the U.S. environmental protection \n     Agency (EPA) shift to using common chemical identifiers and a \n     common nomenclature will be helpful.\n       Your legislation provides the EPA with a much-needed push \n     towards simpler regulatory requirements. I hope that you find \n     our comments helpful, and I look forward to working with you \n     on this bill and other efforts that will make it easier for \n     small business owners to comply with environmental laws.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Federal Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         Printing Industries of America, Inc.,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, March 8, 2000.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the Printing \n     Industries of America, we wish to express our support for the \n     ``Streamlined Environmental Reporting and Pollution \n     Prevention Act of 2000.'' We believe that this legislation is \n     a win-win for the environment and the economy, and we look \n     forward to working with you to enact this legislation during \n     the 106th Congress.\n       As a trade association representing thousands of small \n     printers, we believe the vast majority of small businesses \n     want to do the right thing by the environment, but often they \n     simply do not know what is required of them. This legislation \n     establishes a mandatory duty on the EPA Administrator to \n     develop a way for businesses to fulfill all of their annual \n     reporting obligation in a single electronic filing. While \n     there are no guarantees, we believe this mandate will set in \n     motion a process that leads to simplified reporting and fewer \n     duplicative request for information. By simplifying reporting \n     requirements, more small businesses will understand their \n     reporting and compliance obligations, and we can achieve our \n     dual goals of easing regulatory burdens and improving the \n     environment.\n       The proposed legislation also contains important \n     protections that should address potential concerns \n     stakeholders. For example, statutory impediments to \n     integrated reporting are not repealed, but EPA must identify \n     such provisions within two years of enactment. Businesses who \n     choose to report on paper or under the current system can \n     continue to do so. A state or local agency can maintain its \n     separate reporting requirements, or it can request EPA to \n     collect its data requirements on the EPA reporting system. \n     Existing protections for confidential business information \n     are maintained. Overall, we believe this legislation is \n     carefully tailored to address a real problem, while\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n     avoiding unnecessary controversy. We believe this is \n     legislation that can and should be enacted this year.\n       Once again, thank you for your leadership in introducing \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Benjamin Y.

Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: This letter is to express our \n     appreciation for your work on environmental reporting issues, \n     and to endorse the bill you plan to introduce with Senator \n     Crapo, the ``Streamlined Environmental Reporting and \n     Pollution Prevention Act.''\n       As the three leading trade and professional associations \n     for the nation's surface finishing industry, we work to \n     advance the viability and critical economic contribution of \n     approximately 5000 manufacturing facilities, which range from \n     small ``job shops'' to Fortune 500 companies. The National \n     Association of Metal Finishers (NAMF) represents the \n     interests of finishing companies and owners, the American \n     Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society (AESF) \n     represents technical, research and scientific personnel \n     associated with the industry, and the Metal Finishing \n     Suppliers Association (MFSA) represents a wide range of \n     vendors of equipment, chemicals and environmental consulting \n     expertise.\n       As you know, our work during the '90s with USEPA on the \n     reinvention front has led to better environmental performance \n     for the finishing industry and constructive regulatory \n     change. It remains our view that one of the most significant \n     environmental regulatory challenges in the coming years will \n     be the management of the ever-increasing weight and \n     complexity of reporting burdens, particularly for small \n     business. Your legislation takes sensible, incremental steps \n     to address issues with which the Agency continues to have \n     great difficulty.\n       A key project undertaken by our industry and USEPA under \n     the ``Common Sense Initiative'' is the so-called ``RIITE'' \n     study. This effort applied a Business Process Reengineering \n     approach to identify and evaluate environmental reporting \n     burdens across the entire federal system. The results were \n     compelling, and pointed to the overwhelming need for \n     consolidating and streamlining the reporting system. We have \n     strongly encouraged the Agency to attack these issues in the \n     context of its ``Reinventing Environmental Information'' \n     initiative, and agency officials appear to be making an \n     attempt in concert with involvement from the states, \n     including New Jersey. However, discrete and meaningful \n     changes are still on the far horizon.\n       Accordingly, we commend your work and that of your staff, \n     Nikki Roy, in advancing sensible discussion on this issue, \n     and look forward to working with you on your legislative \n     effort in the coming months.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christian Richter,\n     Director, Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Association \n           of State PIRGs.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing to express U.S. \n     PIRG's endorsement of your bill, ``The Streamlined \n     Environmental Reporting and Pollution Prevention Act 1999.'' \n     This bill presents an important opportunity to advance \n     environmental protection while reducing the burden associated \n     with environmental reporting requirements.\n       The bill will require EPA, within four years, to provide \n     businesses with one point of contact for all federal \n     environmental reporting requirements. This `one-stop' \n     reporting system will use a common nomenclature and language \n     understandable to businesspeople, not just to environmental \n     specialists. Its electronic version will also provide \n     pollution prevention information to businesses.\n       By helping businesses identify environmental reporting \n     requirements to which they are subject, this new system will \n     make it easier for businesses to comply both with those \n     requirements and with other environmental laws. Using a \n     common nomenclature and simpler language will also improve \n     the accuracy of the environmental information reported. In \n     addition, by providing information on pollution prevention to \n     businesses as they report their environmental information, \n     this system will promote pollution prevention. These are all \n     objectives for which U.S. PIRG has long advocated.\n       Thank you for your leadership in demonstrating once again \n     that government can advance environmental protection while \n     helping business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jeremiah Baumann,\n     Environmental Advocate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2000.\n     Dr. Manik Roy,\n     Office of Senator Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Nikki: I am writing in support of the intent and \n     approach of Mr. Lautenberg's draft bill to require the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     establish an integrated environmental reporting system.\n       Integrating environmental reporting is a common sense way \n     to make government work better for regulated entities as well \n     as those who seek to use public information to advance \n     environmental protection. When properly structured, these \n     reforms can lessen the administrative burden on reporting \n     entities while using the ``teachable moment'' of reporting to \n     illuminate pollution prevention opportunities.\n       With continued careful attention to specific language, \n     Senator Lautenberg's legislation will make good sense for \n     both the environment and the economy.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Kevin Mills,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Pollution Prevention Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Environmental Trust,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the National \n     Environmental Trust, we wish to thank you for sponsoring \n     ``The Streamlined Environmental Reporting and Pollution \n     Prevention Act of 1999.'' NET will fully support enactment of \n     this legislation because it will improve environmental \n     protection and at the same time reduce the administrative \n     burden associated with environmental reporting.\n       This proposed legislation demonstrates that it is possible \n     to achieve a cleaner environment and maintain a strong \n     economy at the same time. If enacted, this legislation will \n     provide business with ``one-stop'' reporting through a single \n     point of contact for all federal environmental reporting \n     requirements, which will reduce redundancies and paperwork. \n     By making it easier to report, compliance should improve. The \n     provisions for pollution prevention ``feedback'' through the \n     new system will assist businesses in achieving cleaner \n     operations.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing this \n     important legislation which will reduce businesses' costs of \n     environmental reporting and compliance and at the same time \n     result in vast improvement in environmental performance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Patricia G.

Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Pollution Prevention Roundtable (National \n     Roundtable), to express the National Roundtable's endorsement \n     of your bill, ``the Streamlined Environmental Reporting and \n     Pollution Prevention Act of 1999.'' The bill advances \n     concepts included in the National Roundtable's proposed \n     amendments to strengthen the Pollution Prevention Act of \n     1990.\n       The bill will require EPA, within four years, to provide \n     each business with one point of contact for all federal \n     environmental reporting requirements. This ``one-stop'' \n     reporting system will use language understandable to business \n     people, not just to environmental specialists. In addition, \n     the ``one-stop'' reporting system will simplify reporting due \n     to the use of common nomenclature. The electronic version \n     will also provide pollution prevention information to \n     businesses.\n       Obviously, a law that streamlines environmental reporting \n     will benefit industry by allowing them to spend less time on \n     reporting and more on actually preventing pollution and other \n     substantive environmental improvements.\n       Mainstream business decision-makers--those who design the \n     business's products, decide how to make it, then proceed to \n     produce it and instruct customers on its use and disposal--\n     make the vast majority of environmental decisions in our \n     society. Unfortunately, many times such decisions are made \n     without consideration of their environmental consequences. \n     This is largely due to the complexity of environmental \n     regulations, which typically lead businesses to hire \n     environmental specialists, who often act in isolation of \n     product and process designers.\n       Streamlining environmental reporting will make it easier \n     for mainstream business decision-makers to understand their \n     environmental obligations and incorporate environmental \n     considerations into the design and production of their \n     products. Streamlined reporting is a critical tool needed to \n     meet the challenging pollution problems of the 21st century.\n       If you have any questions about our comments or about the \n     National Roundtable please have your staff contact either \n     Natalie Roy or Michele Russo in our Washington D.C. office at \n     202/466-P2P2.

Short title\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlined Environmental \n     Reporting and Pollution Prevention Act of 2000.''\n     Sec. 2. Definitions\n       Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n       Integrated reporting system means the system established \n     under section 3 of this Act.\n       Person includes both private and government facilities.\n       Reporting requirement means a routine, periodic, \n     environmental reporting requirement. The term refers neither \n     to most emergency information, nor to business transaction \n     information (e.g. information submitted by EPA contractors).\n     Sec. 3. Integrated environmental reporting\n       (a) Within 4 years of enactment, EPA integrates and \n     streamlines its reporting requirements in accordance with \n     subsection (b), to the extend not prohibited by Act of \n     Congress, and in a manner consistent with the preservation of \n     the integrity, reliability, and security of the data \n     reported.\n       (b) The integrated reporting system has the following \n     attributes:\n       (1) EPA establishes one point of contact through which \n     reporting persons may submit all information required by EPA \n     reporting requirements. The information may be submitted in \n     paper form or through electronic media, such as an EPA \n     webpage. This provision operates at the discretion of the \n     reporting person. (See subsection (c).)\n       (2)(A) Each State, tribal, or local agency that receives \n     information on a reporting person which it then must report \n     to EPA (for example, under a delegation agreement) is allowed \n     to submit such information to one point of contact at EPA. \n     This provision operates at the discretion of the State, \n     tribal, or local agency, and facilitates such agencies' \n     efforts to streamline their own reporting requirements. (See \n     Section 5.)\n       (2)(B) Each State, tribal, or local agency that reports \n     through the integrated reporting system has full access to \n     the data reported to EPA through the system.\n       (3) A reporting person has full access to any information \n     it reports to EPA and to State, tribal, or local agencies \n     that is subsequently reported to EPA. In order to ease future \n     reporting, EPA provides the person the information in a \n     modifiable format, allowing the person to update the \n     information on the form and send it in to comply with a \n     current reporting requirement.\n       (4) The reporting system directs the reporting person to \n     information on applicable OSHA reporting requirements and \n     environmental reporting requirements administered by other \n     Federal agencies.\n       (5) The reporting system uses consistent units of measure \n     and consistent terms for chemicals, pollutants, waste, and \n     biological material. It also uses a standard method of \n     identifying reporting facilities. EPA develops such ``data \n     standards'' in consultation with State and tribal \n     governments, reporting persons (i.e. industry), environmental \n     groups, and information technology experts. (If EPA prefers, \n     the data standards may be developed through a negotiated \n     rulemaking with the stakeholders.)\n       (6) The reporting system uses a nomenclature that uses \n     terms understandable to reporting persons that do not have \n     environmental expertise.\n       (7) Information that would otherwise be reported at more \n     than one point in the same data submission is reported only \n     once.\n       (8) The reporting system uses protocols consistent with the \n     Government Paperwork Elimination Act and public-domain \n     standards for electronic commerce.\n       (9) EPA establishes a National Environmental Data Model to \n     use as the framework for EPA databases on which reported data \n     is kept. The data model is made available for use by other \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies, as their \n     discretion.\n       (10) Reporting persons may receive technical assistance \n     from an electronic commerce service center that is accessible \n     through the reporting system.\n       (11) Reporting persons may receive scientifically-sound \n     publicly-available information on pollution prevention \n     technologies and practices through the reporting system.\n       (12) EPA may develop different ``interfaces'' for the \n     reporting system to facilitate use by different sectors, \n     sizes, and categories of reporting persons.\n       (13) Each reported data element receives protection \n     equivalent to that provided under current law to protect \n     confidential business information and privacy.\n       (14) EPA develops and disseminates software, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, that helps the reporting person in \n     assembling necessary data, reporting information, and \n     receiving pollution prevention information under paragraph \n     (11).\n       (15) The reporting system uses an ``open data format'' \n     (such as ASCII format) that allows persons to download \n     information from their own internal data management systems \n     directly to the integrated reporting system. This provision \n     operates at the discretion of the reporting person.\n       (c) Existing regulatory definitions are not modified by the \n     data standards and nomenclature implemented under paragraphs \n     (5) and (6) above unless amended by regulation.\n       (d) Nothing in this Act requires any person to use the \n     integrated electronic reporting system instead of an \n     individual reporting system.\n     Sec. 4. Interagency coordination\n       (a) EPA coordinates with State, tribal and local efforts \n     that EPA believes consistent this Act, at the request of the \n     State, tribal or local agency. (See section 3(b)(2).)\n       (b) Under subsection (a), EPA may coordinate with a State, \n     tribal, or local agency to establish a reporting system that \n     integrates reporting to both EPA and the other agency.\n       (c) To ease reporting by persons with facilities in several \n     jurisdictions, EPA encourages the use of a common data format \n     by any State, tribal, or local agency coordinating with EPA \n     under subsection (a).\n       (d) Other Federal agencies provide EPA information on their \n     reporting requirements.\n       (e) EPA may design the integrated reporting system to allow \n     a reporting person to use it to comply with some requirements \n     and not others.\n     Sec. 5. Regulations\n       EPA may promulgate such regulations as are necessary to \n     carry out this Act.\n     Sec. 6. Reports\n       Within 2 years of enactment, EPA reports to Congress those \n     provisions of law that prohibit or hinder implementation of \n     this Act.\n     Sec. 7. Savings clause\n       (a) Nothing in this Act affects any provision of Federal or \n     State law or the obligation of any person to comply with any \n     provision of law.\n       (b) Nothing in this Act affects the obligation of a \n     reporting person to provide the information required under \n     any reporting requirement.\n       (c) Nothing in this Act authorizes new reporting \n     requirements or requires the elimination of existing \n     reporting requirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 2801. A bill to prohibit funding of the negotiation of the move of \nthe Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States \nuntil the Secretary of State has required the divestiture of property \npurchased by the Xinhua News Agency in violation of the Foreign \nMissions Act; read the first time.\n\n\n            the chinese news agency divestiture act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Washington Times reported last week \nthat the Chinese Government-owned news agency, Xinhua, had purchased \nproperty on Arlington Ridge Road in Virginia a location that overlooks \nthe Pentagon and has direct line of sight to many of our key Government \nbuildings including this Capitol and the White House.\n  In fact, the property is so appealing that the East Germans bought it \nin the early 1980s, which led Congress to amend the Foreign Missions \nAct.\n  The Secretary of State, through the Foreign Missions Act, has broad \nauthority to oversee the purchase of buildings in the United States by \nforeign government entities. Under the Act certain identified \ngovernments are required to notify the State Department of their intent \nto purchase property in the United States. China is one such country.\n  The Secretary of State then has 60 days to review the sale, and \nreceive input from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the \nFBI. She has the option to disapprove the sale during this period.\n  None of this occurred--despite the fact that China was notified in \n1985 that its news agency was required to follow these procedures--and \non June 15 the sale was finalized.\n  The Foreign Missions Act provides the Secretary of State with the \nauthority to remedy this violation of law. Under section 205 of the \nact, the Secretary may force the news agency to divest itself of the \nproperty.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will ensure that this broad \nauthority is used.\n  The legislation has two basic requirements: First, it requires the \nSecretary of State to report to the Intelligence and Foreign Relations \nCommittees whether she intends to force the news agency to divest \nitself of the property.\n  Second, the bill prohibits any State Department funds from being used \nto negotiate with the Chinese on the relocation of the Chinese Embassy \nin Washington until she certifies that she has instituted divestiture \nproceedings and will ensure that any further purchase of property by \nthe news agency will be pursuant to the Foreign Missions Act.\n  By prohibiting funds for further negotiations until this violation of \nU.S. law is resolved, this second provision\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nwill also ensure that this issue is handled separately from on-going \nnegotiations to relocate both the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the \nChinese Embassy in Washington, DC.\n  The potential for this building to be a source of unparalleled \nespionage is not a theoretical matter. While there is nothing new about \nPRC spying, as an emerging economic and military power, China \nincreasingly challenges vital U.S. interests around the globe through \nits aggressive security and intelligence service--employing both \ntraditional intelligence methods as well as non-traditional methods \nsuch as open source collection, elicitation, and exploitation of \nscientific and commercial exchanges.\n  In December 1999, the Director of Central Intelligence and the \nDirector of the FBI reported to the Intelligence Committee, in \nunclassified form, that:\n\n       As the most advanced military power with respect to \n     equipment and strategic capabilities, the United States \n     continues to be the [Military Intelligence Department of the \n     People's Republic of China]'s primary target.\n\n  The DCI went on to report:\n\n       During the past 20 years, China has established a notable \n     intelligence capability in the United States through its \n     commercial presence.\n\n  And added that China's commercial entities play a significant role in \npursuit of U.S. proprietary information and trade secrets.\n  One of China's greatest successes has been its collection against the \nU.S. nuclear weapons labs. As the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded \nlast year:\n\n       China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons \n     information, [including] at least basic design information on \n     several modern U.S. nuclear reentry vehicles, including the \n     Trident II (W88).\n\n  The special advisory panel of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board PFIAB concluded:\n\n       [T]he nature of the intelligence-gathering methods used by \n     the People's Republic of China poses a special challenge to \n     the U.S. in general and the [DOE] weapons labs in particular. \n     . . . The Chinese services have become very proficient in the \n     art of seemingly innocuous elicitations of information. This \n     approach has proved very effective against unwitting and ill-\n     prepared DOE personnel.\n\n  In another example, an investigation by the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence concluded that U.S. officials ``failed to take \nseriously enough the counterintelligence threat'' in launching U.S. \nsatellites on PRC rockets. Technology transfers in the course of U.S.-\nPRC satellite launches:\n\n       Enable the PRC to improve its present and future space \n     launch vehicle and intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\n  But the Chinese are also active in traditional methods of \nintelligence gathering, which brings us to the subject of my \nlegislation. Especially in the wake of U.S. military success in the \nGulf War, the acquisition of advanced U.S. military technology has been \na primary thrust of PRC espionage and intelligence collection efforts.\n  If you want money, and if you are so inclined, you rob a bank \nbecause, as a bank robber Willy Sutton famously observed: ``that's \nwhere the money is.''\n  If you want information on the most advanced military power in the \nworld, the Pentagon is where the information is.\n  I am hopeful that this bill can be taken up and passed quickly by the \nSenate and the House in order to ensure that the divestiture occurs in \nan orderly and speedy manner.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2802. A bill to amend the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status \nAct of 1994 to add White Earth Tribal and Community College to the list \nof 1994 Institutions; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n designation of white earth tribal & community college as a 1994 land \n                           grant institution\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich will add the White Earth Tribal & Community College of Mahnomen, \nMinnesota to the list of 1994 Land Grant Institutions. Designation as a \n1994 land grant institution would give White Earth Tribal & Community \nCollege access to critical federal funding and resources made available \nunder the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 as well \nas providing eligibility for other programs.\n  Tribal colleges provide their students and their communities at-large \nwith otherwise non-existent opportunities. They serve as library \nfacilities for historical tribal documents--things like the oral \nhistory of elders that might otherwise be lost in time. They promote \npride in their shared tribal background, and they provide unique \nopportunities for learning about this background. They are a center of \nlearning for the entire community--not only learning about their tribal \nhistory, but also the basic learning that enables some to continue \nadult education, some to go on to 4-year institutions and some to \nfinish graduate school. The colleges also offer a place for alcohol \nabuse workshops, job training seminars, and in some cases even day care \ncenters. These colleges can offer benefits for all people in their \ncommunities, which is why we should offer our help to those tribal \ncolleges who demonstrate their ability to serve their students and \ntheir community in this way.\n  The purpose of the 1994 land-grant act was to enable tribal colleges \nto receive funds to build their programs, enhance their infrastructure, \nand educate their communities. However, new tribal colleges, founded \nsince 1994 are not automatically eligible for land grant status, they \nmust be so designated by legislation. One such college is the White \nEarth Tribal & Community College in Mahnomen, Minnesota. Founded in \n1997, this college is now the center of learning for approximately 100 \nstudents. Their courses cover a wide range of material including math, \nhistory, computer science, and business communications. The college is \ncurrently seeking accreditation and is a member of the American Indian \nHigher Education Consortium (AIHEC). White Earth Tribal & Community \nCollege is also recognized by its peers as an important place of higher \nlearning. Other local colleges, such as Moorhead State University, \nNorthwest Technical College, and Northland Community and Technical \nCollege, accept its transfer credits.\n  Mr. President, we should offer this college the opportunity it \ndeserves to expand and strengthen its efforts to enhance the lives of \neveryone around it. Giving White Earth Tribal & Community College the \nsame federal land-grant status that we gave other tribal colleges in \n1994 is a matter of basic equity. Adoption of this legislation would \nsignal a willingness to continue our support of new tribal colleges in \ntheir efforts to enhance education in their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5911-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5911-S5913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Idaho (Mr. \nCrapo) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1150, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to more accurately codify the depreciable \nlife of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\n\n                                S. 1159\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the names of the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Lautenberg) and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1159, a bill to provide grants and contracts \nto local educational agencies to initiate, expand, and improve physical \neducation programs for all kindergarten through 12th grade students.\n\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1333, a bill to expand \nhomeownership in the United States.\n\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Boxer) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1510, a bill to revise the \nlaws of the United States appertaining to United States cruise vessels, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1608\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Cochran) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1608, a bill to provide \nannual payments to the States and counties from National Forest System \nlands managed by the Forest Service, and the revested Oregon and \nCalifornia Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands \nmanaged predominately by the Bureau of Land\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nManagement, for use by the counties in which the lands are situated for \nthe benefit of the public schools, roads, emergency and other public \npurposes; to encourage and provide new mechanisms for cooperation \nbetween counties and the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement to make necessary investments in Federal lands, and reaffirm \nthe positive connection between Federal Lands counties and Federal \nLands; and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2100\n\n  At the request of Mr. Edwards, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Bryan) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2100, a bill to provide for \nfire sprinkler systems in public and private college and university \nhousing and dormitories, including fraternity and sorority housing and \ndormitories.\n\n\n                                S. 2274\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 2274, a bill to amend title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act to provide families and disabled children with the \nopportunity to purchase coverage under the medicaid program for such \nchildren.\n\n\n                                S. 2293\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Roberts) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2293, a bill to amend the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to \nprovide for the payment of Financing Corporation interest obligations \nfrom balances in the deposit insurance funds in excess of an \nestablished ratio and, after such obligations are satisfied, to provide \nfor rebates to insured depository institutions of such excess reserves.\n\n\n                                S. 2357\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Bingaman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2357, a bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to permit retired members of the Armed \nForces who have a service-connected disability to receive military \nretired pay concurrently with veterans' disability compensation.\n\n\n                                S. 2386\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n(Mr. Wyden) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2386, a bill to extend the \nStamp Out Breast Cancer Act.\n\n\n                                S. 2434\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Louisiana State \nUniversity Tigers on winning the 2000 College World Series. The Tigers \nfinished the 2000 season with a regular season record of 46 and 12 and \na perfect post season record of 13 and 0. Even though the Tigers \nenjoyed great success in both the regular and post seasons, winning the \nnational title was no easy feat. Despite their stunning success in \nearlier post season games, the Tigers found themselves trailing the \nStanford Cardinal 5 to 2 in the eighth inning of the final game of the \nworld series. Through sheer will and determination the Tigers were able \nto come from behind with a single by Tiger catcher Brad Cresse, which \nbrought Ryan Theriot home for the game winning run. LSU's thrilling \nvictory enraptured loving fans throughout Louisiana.\n  This final victory was the culmination of a season's worth of \npersistence and hard work which has characterized their performance \nthroughout the decade. To date, the Tigers have won five national \ntitles but have refused to rest on their laurels. LSU's team batting \naverage of .341 this season is a truly commendable achievement. Senior \ncatcher Brad Cresse distinguished himself by hitting 30 home runs over \nthe course of the season. Senior pitcher Trey Hodges earned the Most \nOutstanding Player Award of the College World Series by exhibiting the \nsame discipline and skill that carried him through the year. The \nguiding hand for the Tiger's winning season, LSU coach Skip Bertman, \ncontinually instilled in his players a sense of dedication, teamwork, \nand sportsmanship. Coach Bertman's tireless efforts were recognized \nwhen he was awarded the National Coach of the Year Award by the \nCollegiate Baseball Newspaper. The accomplishments of these heroes of \ncollege baseball will certainly serve as the standard for generations \nto come.\n  Louisiana State University's national championship spotlights one of \nthe Nation's premier State universities, which is committed to academic \nand athletic excellence.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 277\n\n       Whereas the United States of America and the sovereign \n     Indian Tribes contained within its boundaries have had a long \n     and mutually beneficial relationship since the beginning of \n     the Republic;\n       Whereas the United States has recognized this special legal \n     and political relationship and its trust responsibility to \n     the Indian Tribes as reflected in the Federal Constitution, \n     treaties, numerous court decisions, federal statutes, \n     executive orders, and course of dealing;\n       Whereas Federal policy toward the Indian Tribes has \n     vacillated through history and often failed to uphold the \n     government-to-government relationship that has endured for \n     more than 200 years;\n       Whereas these Federal policies included the wholesale \n     removal of Indian tribes and their members from their \n     aboriginal homelands, attempts to assimilate Indian people \n     into the general culture, as well as the termination of the \n     legal and political relationship between the United States \n     and the Indian tribes;\n       Whereas President Richard M. Nixon, in his ``Special \n     Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' on July 8, 1970, \n     recognized that the Indian Tribes constitute a distinct and \n     valuable segment of the American federalist system, whose \n     members have made significant contributions to the United \n     States and to American culture;\n       Whereas President Nixon determined that Indian Tribes, as \n     local governments, are best able to discern the needs of \n     their people and are best situated to determine the direction \n     of their political and economic futures;\n       Whereas in his ``Special Message'' President Nixon \n     recognized that the policies of legal and political \n     termination on the one hand, and paternalism and excessive \n     dependence on the other, devastated the political, economic, \n     and social aspects of life in Indian America, and had to be \n     radically altered;\n       Whereas in his ``Special Message'' President Nixon set \n     forth the foundation for a new, more enlightened Federal \n     Indian policy grounded in economic self-reliance and \n     political self-determination; and\n       Whereas this Indian self-determination policy has endured \n     as the most successful policy of the United States in dealing \n     with the Indian Tribes because it rejects the failed policies \n     of termination and paternalism and declared that ``the \n     integrity and right to continued existence of all Indian \n     Tribal and Alaska native governments, recognizing that \n     cultural pluralism is a source of national strength'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States recognizes \n     the unique role of the Indian Tribes and their members in the \n     United States, and commemorates the vision and leadership of \n     President Nixon, and every succeeding President, in fostering \n     the policy of Indian Self-Determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/27/senate-section/article/S5935-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5935-S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
