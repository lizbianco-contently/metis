Mr. President, I am going to take advantage of this \ntime to speak on behalf of the National Energy Security Act of 2000.\n  For the benefit of the Chair, this is the result of a 10-member task \nforce appointed by the Majority Leader, which he asked that I chair. \nThe Task Force included Senators Nickles, Craig, Hutchison, Collins, \nDomenici, Snowe, Roth, Santorum, and Smith of New Hampshire.\n  The bill before us is S. 2557. The purpose of the legislation is to \naddress a harsh reality that it is currently hard to identify just what \nthe administration's policy is toward energy in this country at this \ntime, other than to increase imports of crude oil coming into the \ncountry. The Majority Leader charged us to examine the impacts of \nincreased U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources and the resulting \nincreased energy cost to American consumers.\n  It is estimated that the increase in the price of crude oil, which \nhas risen from roughly $10, $11, $12 a barrel a year ago, to as high as \n$34--and it is currently about $30--has resulted in an increase, if one \ncould compare it to a tax increase, of about $100 billion to the \nAmerican consumer.\n  If you have taken a cab in Washington, DC, you have noticed there is \na little sticker that says they are going to charge 50 cents extra \nbecause of the increased cost of gasoline. If you have taken an \nairplane lately, you have noticed a surcharge from $20 to $40 on your \nticket. So the multiplier is out there, Mr. President, and it is a \nsignificant factor in adding to inflation.\n  So at the leader's request, we have established a very simple goal \nfor our energy security through this legislation. The goal of the bill \nis to decrease\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nAmerica's dependency on foreign oil to less than 50 percent by the year \n2010. It is kind of interesting, but the current administration figures \nindicate that since President Clinton has come to office, we are \ncurrently consuming 14 percent more oil than we did approximately 7 \nyears ago and producing 17 percent less.\n  There is indeed a need for an energy policy. This is what the \nNational Energy Security Act of 2000 proposes to establish.\n  We anticipate achieving the goal of reducing our imports of oil \nthrough a number of considerations.\n  One is enhancing the use of renewable energy resources--including \nhydro, wind, solar, and biomass. We spend a good deal for experimental \nfunding for these renewable sources. But the reality is we have a long \nway to go before they are going to take a major share of our energy \nproduction.\n  Second, we are proposing to conserve energy resources and improve \nenergy efficiencies.\n  Third, we propose to increase domestic energy supplies, including \noil, gas, and coal.\n  The bill also addresses the concerns of regional consumers, \nparticularly in the Northeast.\n  It allows the Department of Energy's Secretary Richardson to create a \nhome heating oil reserve and strengthen the weatherization program.\n  It establishes a State-led education program to encourage consumers \nto take action to minimize seasonal price increases and shortages of \nhome heating fuel.\n  It provides incentives for construction and rehabilitation of private \nhome heating oil storage facilities.\n  The purpose is very simple. Imported energy should supplement our \ndomestic energy supplies--not supplant them.\n  The administration has looked for a quick fix and has pointed \nfingers. We understand that the American energy supply problem cannot \nbe solved overnight. It is going to take a long-term view. We have to \ntake it one step at a time. But it is time to begin taking those steps \nand that is a process we further today.\n  The administration continues to lull the American public into a sense \nof indifference about energy supplies and the energy situation and has \nreally hidden behind a slight decrease in prices at the pump. However, \nI would suggest these reductions in price are not here to stay.\n  I refer to an article that appears in the Wall Street Journal of May \n16 entitled ``Tight U.S. Gas Markets Boost Oil Prices''--a price of \n$30, and a year ago it was $12 or $13.\n  What about the inflation factor? A significant indicator is the \nincreased cost of energy.\n  What about the balance of payments? One-third of our $300 billion \ndeficit balance of payments--$100 billion--is the cost of imported oil.\n  As a consequence, we have had an opportunity to hear from consumers \nall over the country stung by the high prices of heating oil, \nparticularly in the Northeast corridor. And it is fair to say that as \nwe go into the summer, this particular area of the country, which is \napproximately 30-percent dependent on oil-powered generation, will \nexperience substantial price increases as a consequence of increased \nenergy demand, particularly for air-conditioning.\n  It is estimated that electricity costs in the Northeast region may \ndouble what they were last year and in some cases triple.\n  The idea is that the older oil-fired power generation facilities are \nthe last to come online, and ordinarily there is a windfall profit \nassociated with that. Whatever it takes to support financially the cost \nof the higher generating resource--namely, oil--the other energy \nsources, whether they be gas or coal, rise to that price level--a \npractice known as ``uniform pricing.'' The consumer is stuck as a \nconsequence, and prices go up as a result of the windfall profit.\n  Finally, as the economies of Asia, Europe, and the United States \ncontinue to grow in the context of a set energy market, there will be \nincreasing demands for energy resources by the fourth quarter of this \nyear, again leading to tightening of petroleum supplies and a \ncorresponding increase in prices.\n\n  Many of us in this body on both sides of the aisle have made \nstatements that the administration really lacks an energy policy. If \nyou go back and recognize that in 1973 and 1974 we were 34-percent \ndependent on imported oil, today we are 56-percent dependent. And last \nmonth we got up to 61-percent dependence.\n  The realities are, if we look to increasing imports to offset our \nincreased consumption as well as the rest of the world, we are going to \nbe paying the piper because, as indicated in this article today, we can \nlook to OPEC and we can look to Venezuela, but, nevertheless, they have \nindicated self-discipline, and the price range is expected to be \nsomewhere between $22 and $28 a barrel, which suggests, if you will, \nthat the discipline to maintain this price is there.\n  I see another Member of our task force is on the floor and intends to \nspeak on this.\n  As I have outlined our proposal in general terms and identified our \ngoals--I again point out the realization that we want to protect energy \nsecurity, we want to protect consumers and low-income families, and we \nwant to increase domestic energy supplies--it should be noted that the \nlast written statement from the administration about its proposal on \nenergy was a narrow one. It came out during the last week of April from \nthe Office of the Secretary of Energy, entitled ``Energy Secretary \nRichardson Announced Six Short-Term Actions to Help Prevent Power \nOutages.''\n  I think it is appropriate to highlight just what this contains \nbecause clearly it does not address increased production.\n  It specifically states in the six points:\n  First, to work with agencies to identify opportunities to reduce \nliquid consumption and Federal water problems during times of peak \ndemand.\n  I assume that means we are going to shut off water and our irrigation \nprojects.\n  Second, it urges the Federal Regulatory Commission and State \nutilities to commission, solicit, and improve targets that will help \nreduce electric demand.\n  So we are going to propose an increase in the price of electricity to \nensure that people reduce their consumption.\n  Third, explore opportunities for use of existing backup generators \nduring power supply emergencies.\n  I wonder if we are going to confiscate the private sector generators.\n  Fourth, conduct an emergency exercise with State and local \ngovernments to help prepare for outages.\n  It looks as if they are pretty much giving up the ship and are \npreparing for those outages as opposed to generating more energy.\n  Fifth, work closely with the utility industry to gain up-to-date, \nrelevant information about potential grid-related problems.\n  They are going to keep us informed.\n  Lastly, they are going to prepare public service announcements. So we \nwill know what is coming.\n  I hardly think that fits the bill as we address the need for precise \nenergy policy and the realization that the administration lacks an \nenergy policy of any kind.\n  In conclusion, let's relate the position the administration has taken \nwith regard to energy.\n  There is no effort to spur domestic oil and gas production.\n  There is no effort to open up the area of the Rocky Mountain \noverthrust belt to encourage exploration for gas.\n  There is no effort by the administration to loosen the noose they \nhave put around the neck of our domestic energy industries.\n  They are refusing to resolve the nuclear waste issue.\n  They have refused to recognize hydro as a renewable resource and are \nproposing in some cases to take dams down out west.\n  If you identify the energy resources and recognize the position of \nthe administration, it is quite clear that they do not have an energy \npolicy. That is why I commend the leader and the other members of the \ntask force for developing a plan that is a workable, achievable plan \nthat will substantially address the emergency associated with our \nenergy situation in this country. I again refer to this as the National \nEnergy Security Act of 2000.\n  I see the leader on the floor, and perhaps at this time he wishes to \nintroduce the bill and make some remarks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3959-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3959-S3960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n                      ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure this morning to introduce \nand cosponsor, with the distinguished chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, S. 2557, the Energy Security Act of 2000.\n  There is a dark cloud on the horizon for America's future and for our \neconomy and for job creation. This cloud could cause serious problems \nin the future. That cloud is the fact that we don't have a national \nenergy policy. Despite a lot of rhetoric that we do--there is nothing \nto worry about--there is plenty to worry about.\n  The American people remember the long lines we faced at the gasoline \nstations in the 1970s. At that time, we were dependent on foreign oil \nfor much less than 50 percent, probably around 45 percent at the time. \nWe passed legislation in an attempt to deal with that problem and, for \na variety of reasons, the prices came back down. The problem was not \nresolved, and the problem is much worse today.\n  In today's Wall Street Journal, for instance, there is an article \nentitled ``Tight U.S. Gas Market Boosts Oil Prices.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2000]\n\n                Tight U.S. Gas Market Boosts Oil Prices\n\n                        (By Alexei Barrionuevo)\n\n       A tight U.S. gasoline market drove world crude-oil prices \n     back to nearly $30 a barrel yesterday, and analysts say \n     little in the short term will help arrest the run-up.\n       This time, the worry isn't about a shortage of oil, but a \n     confluence of gasoline-related issues and a hot economy.\n       In the past five weeks, wholesale gasoline prices have shot \n     up 30% out of concerns about refinery production, new \n     environmental regulations and a patent dispute. That has left \n     the false impression that crude is in short supply, pulling \n     crude-oil prices up more than $4 a barrel.\n       The drop in retail gasoline prices, which normally trail \n     wholesale prices by a month or more, has stopped dead in its \n     tracks, with the average U.S. price at $1.46 a gallon of \n     regular unleaded, according to the Energy Information \n     Administration. With U.S. refineries expected to get little \n     help from foreign sources this summer because of new \n     environmental gasoline requirements, price spikes are \n     possible.\n       The new surge in oil prices is also bound to intensify \n     inflation concerns. Analysts have dismissed the significance \n     of a creep up in consumer prices earlier in the spring, \n     saying that it was a temporary trend driven by the jump in \n     oil prices and would likely recede once oil prices fell.\n       Since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     loosened up production in late March, the attention has \n     turned to refiners, who must crank up production to meet \n     summertime demand. Refiners, who had cut production and \n     scheduled more maintenance work over the winter amid \n     depressed margins, now are trying to catch up in a hurry. \n     U.S. refiners are currently running at about 92% of capacity \n     and will need to kick production up to 97% to meet expected \n     demand.\n       Gasoline inventories continue to be low, in part because of \n     demand for a federally mandated cleaner-burning gasoline to \n     be required in about one-third of the U.S. beginning June 1. \n     European and Venezuelan refiners, which usually provide a \n     total of 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of gasoline and gas \n     components, have had difficulty making the fuel. And some \n     ``blenders,'' which are critical to upgrading foreign \n     gasoline, particularly in the Northeast, are holding off on \n     reformulated gasoline because of concerns about gas patents \n     held by Unocal Corp., which has been pursuing violators.\n       Add to all that strong gasoline demand despite the steepest \n     pump prices in years. ``High prices pull down demand but \n     income pulls it up, and right now income is winning out over \n     price,'' said Larry Goldstein, president of Petroleum \n     Industry Research Foundation in New York.\n       U.S. officials, who two months ago put heavy pressure on \n     OPEC to increase production when oil hit $34 a barrel, are \n     scrambling once again. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met \n     with OPEC President and Venezuelan Minister Ali Rodriguez \n     over the weekend to urge OPEC ministers to open up the taps a \n     bit more next month.\n       Mr. Richardson, who thinks $30-a-barrel oil is too high, is \n     expected to discuss new visits to producing countries at a \n     White House meeting today focusing on oil and electricity \n     issues, government officials said. ``I will continue to do \n     what we said we would do, monitor the oil market and stay in \n     touch with producing countries and others,'' Mr. Richardson \n     said yesterday in La Jolla, Calif.\n       With the current run-up in crude prices, OPEC is entering \n     territory where its price-band mechanism could be tested. The \n     band, agreed to in March, gives Mr. Rodriguez power to direct \n     changes in production based on a 20-day average of prices \n     that translate to roughly $24 to $30 a barrel for West Texas \n     Intermediate.\n       Even if prices are within the band, most analysts expect \n     OPEC to vote to put more oil on the market at its meeting \n     next month. ``We are now talking about prices that make a \n     number of producers uncomfortable,'' Mr. Goldstein said. Only \n     three countries--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab \n     Emirates--have spare capacity, and most of it is in Saudi \n     Arabia.\n       Speaking yesterday, Mr. Rodriguez said there is ``no \n     inclination to increase production,'' but that oil prices \n     would ``return to an acceptable level.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It says in this article that crude oil prices were back up \nto nearly $30 a barrel yesterday, and for the last month our dependency \non foreign oil was in the range of 60 percent. This is going to have an \neffect on the price of fuel oil. It will have an effect on the price of \ngasoline. It will have an effect on the economy. While we saw some \nleveling off or some general slide back, we have done nothing to secure \nour country's energy future.\n  Earlier, I tried to put in place some reduction in the Federal \ngasoline tax, to stop until the end of the year the 4.3-cent Federal \ngasoline tax that was added back in the early 1990s and say if \nnationwide gas reached an average of $2 a gallon, we would suspend the \nentire Federal gasoline tax for the balance of the year. The Senate was \nnot inclined to go along with that.\n  My purpose was a wakeup call--first, that gasoline prices are \nprobably not going to go down; more than likely, they will go up. But \nthe wakeup call was bigger than that, to try to make people realize \nthat we don't have a national energy policy.\n  What are we going to do? I ask the American people: Do we feel safe \nwith the idea we are dependent on foreign oil, OPEC oil, oil from Iraq, \noil from Libya? I don't. What if they decide not only to turn down the \nspigots but to turn the spigots off? What would America do? Within 30 \ndays we would be in serious trouble.\n  Now, we have a strategic oil reserve, and that was a very wise \ndecision; it could be helpful in dealing with a national security \nemergency. It would help deal with a crisis created if the spigot \nshould be cut off. However, I think to not have a plan to be less \ndependent on foreign oil is irresponsible. We can't tolerate it.\n  So what are we going to do? We know now we are dependent on the \nforeign oil imports to the tune of 56 percent of oil consumed, compared \nto 36 percent imported in 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo. Even \nthe Department of Energy predicts America will import at least 65 \npercent of foreign oil for our energy needs by the year 2020. Secretary \nRichardson even admitted that the administration had been caught \nnapping when energy prices began to rise a few weeks ago.\n  We appointed a task force to deal with this problem, to look at it, \nto see what we could do to address our energy needs for the future. It \nis a multifaceted proposal, not only aimed at gasoline or oil but \nacross the spectrum. This task force has been working to find these \nreasonable solutions to give us more of our own energy supplies. \nChairman Murkowski has headed that task force. This task force has been \na diverse group, including Senators from all over the country--Senator \nCraig from Idaho, who is on the floor; Senator Nickles from Oklahoma; \nSenator Hutchison from Texas; also Senators from the Midwest and \nNortheast, including Senator Collins of Maine; Senator Snowe; Senator \nRoth of Delaware; Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, Senator Smith of \nNew Hampshire. They have worked together and have come up with a \nproposal that I think will make a real difference. It will encourage \nalternative sources. It will try to enhance the use of renewable energy \nresources, including hydro, nuclear, coal, solar, and wind.\n  We need to increase our domestic supplies of nonrenewable resources, \nincluding oil and natural gas. In my own State of Mississippi, and in \nthe gulf off the coast, we have a tremendous supply of natural gas. \nNatural gas is relatively cheap and is a very clean source of energy. \nYet there is no incentive to make greater use of natural gas. We have \nmore oil deposits. We know it. Some of them are in marginal wells, some \nare in large areas such as off the coast of Alaska. We have to do \nsomething to take advantage of these resources, give incentives to take \nadvantage of them.\n\n  I absolutely support the effort by the Alaskan Senators who advocate \ngetting the oil off the coast of Alaska in\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nwhat is commonly referred to as ANWR.\n  We should also look at unique needs within the country, in the \nNortheast where they have extraordinarily cold weather, compared to my \npart of the country, where people are dependent on home heating fuel. \nWe need to strengthen the Department of Energy weatherization program. \nWe need to establish a State-led education program to encourage \nconsumers to take actions to minimize seasonal price increases and fuel \nshortages. We should authorize the expensing of costs associated with \nbuilding new home heating oil storage. We should authorize the \nSecretary to build a home heating oil reserve. If we don't do that, \nmore than likely there will be a problem in the Northeast next year. We \nhave a number of tax incentives that would encourage more production. \nWe would provide relief for marginal wells.\n  By the way, these so-called marginal wells are responsible for 50 \npercent of U.S. production, so they may be marginal but they are \nsignificant. It allows for expensing of oil and gas exploration costs. \nIt would delay rental payments. The 1999 Taxpayer Relief Act had a 5-\nyear carryback provision, and that is included.\n  Finally, there is an expansion of tax credits for renewable energy to \ninclude wind and biomass facilities. Some people say we shouldn't be \ngiving any kind of consideration or breaks to people who are out there \ntrying to produce more oil and gas; they may not need it; it may not be \ngood for the environment.\n  What do you mean? That is the most fallacious argument of all. It can \nbe done safely and cleanly and we need that resource. The alternative \nis to go ahead and continue to be dependent on OPEC and other countries \nfor our energy needs. It is irresponsible.\n  This is a broad package. It is a good package. I thank Senator \nMurkowski and the task force for their work. We will talk more about it \nlater. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a \nlook at this. This is something that should not be partisan. It is not \npartisan. It should be bipartisan. It will help our country all across \nthe Nation both in terms of energy needs and in terms of energy \nproduction. This is not something that is aimed only at this \nadministration. I emphase this administration has no plan to deal with \nthis problem, but this administration is going to be leaving shortly. \nWhat are we going to do about the future? We need to come together. We \ncannot continue down the path we are headed. If we do, I predict \ndisaster looms on the horizon. I want to make sure that we make our \nbest effort to do something about it so we can avert this disaster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, in order to have this important bill placed \non the calendar, I ask for the first reading of S. 2557.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2557) to protect the energy security of the \n     United States and decrease America's dependency on foreign \n     oil sources to 50 percent by the year 2010 by enhancing the \n     use of renewable energy resources, conserving energy \n     resources, improving energy efficiencies, and increasing \n     domestic energy supplies, mitigating the effect of increases \n     in energy prices on the American consumer, including the poor \n     and the elderly, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask for its second reading, and I object to my own \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The bill will be read the second time on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Idaho would \nlike to be recognized to speak for 10 or 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this is an important day in the Senate. I \nthink it is important for us to let Americans know there is a group of \ntheir national leaders who are focused on developing a national energy \npolicy for this country. You have heard the majority leader of the \nSenate speak for just a few moments. He touched on some very critical \nquestions that I think Americans are asking when they go to the gas \npump and they find, as they have found for the last good many months, \nthat their energy costs are going up dramatically. But high oil prices \nare doing more than raise the price of gasoline. With spikes in \nelectrical production during this last heat spell on the east coast, we \nare going to find that when the power bill gets to that consumer, his \nor her power bill has gone up substantially.\n  As a result of sustained high oil prices, several weeks ago the \nmajority leader convened a task force in the Senate, led by Senator \nFrank Murkowski, who is chairman of the full Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I, as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, \nserved with that task force and today our work product has been \nintroduced. But this is a work product that resulted not by just a \ngroup of us coming together to decide what was a better idea, it is a \nproduct of a good many hearings held by the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to explore the effects of the cost of energy now \nand in the future on the American consumer.\n  As a result of that, S. 2557 has been introduced today. That is \nbetter known as the National Energy Security Act for 2000. The \nlegislation is designed to do a number of things, but its overall \nobjective is to reduce our dependence on imported crude oil below 50 \npercent. Crude oil and gas prices shot up earlier this year. At the \ntime we were importing about 55 percent of our crude oil needs. Now, \naccording to the latest Energy Information Administration figures, U.S. \ndependency on foreign crude oil as of May 5, is just over 60 percent. \nWe are getting about 9.2 million-barrels-a-day from somewhere else in \nthe world. The U.S. is now importing about a million barrels a day more \nthan we were importing in January of 1999.\n  In addition, the U.S. is importing more finished petroleum products. \nThat is a rather new phenomenon. We have seen the tearing down of many \nof our refineries during the last good number of years for failure to \nretrofit to meet Clean Air Act requirements because there was no cost \nincentive to do so. In fact, there has not been a major refinery \npermitted in the U.S. since 1975. Now we are importing more finished \nproduct.\n  In January of 1999, our daily import level of motor gasoline, for \nexample, was about 441,000 barrels per day. During the week ending May \n5, according to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. \nimported an average of 562,000 barrels a day of motor gasoline.\n  In other words, if the average consumer were looking at a chart \ngraphed along with these increases we have just talked about, the price \nof gasoline would be going up and so is our reliance on imports. We are \nno longer the masters of our own destiny. We no longer control the \nfuture of energy in this country. That is a sad day for Americans, when \nthat reality is in front of us. It is something I think this country \nhas to deal with.\n  The Energy Information Administration estimates our dependency on \nimports could rise to more than 65 percent by the year 2020. At the \nrate we are going, my guess is we will be there long before that.\n  For the last nearly 8 years, the Clinton-Gore administration has \nrefused to develop an effective national energy policy. The \nadministration has published national energy plans and, I will be \nblunt, I do not think they are worth the paper on which they are \nprinted. Here is exactly why. Their plans pay only lip service to the \nneed to increase domestic oil and gas production. They have \nconsistently underfunded research into more efficient and clean use of \ncoal for electric generation. Yet the U.S. has an abundance of coal \nthat we ought to be using in an effective and environmentally sound \nway. They have underfunded research into how we can improve the \nefficiency and safety of our nuclear generating stations. And they have \nrefused to recognize hydropower as a renewable resource.\n\n  The Presiding Officer and I come from an area of the country where \nhydropower is king. Many of our rivers are dammed to produce an \nabundance\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nof electrical energy, and our electrical energy costs to consumers are \nthe lowest in the Nation, while our environment is generally very \nclean. Yet as the chairman of the Energy Committee said just a few \nmoments ago, this administration has, as a policy, not recognized \nhydroelectricity as a renewable resource. Quite the opposite: It \nproposes that we ought to start removing dams from our rivers for \nenvironmental reasons and without regard for existing economic uses.\n  Instead of strong producing policies for our country and incentives \nfor producers to produce more energy, the Clinton-Gore administration \nhas focused its attention on solar energy and wind power and energy \nfrom biomass, and demanded significant increases in Federal money to \nencourage more use of these resources. There is nothing wrong with \nsupporting renewables. I support renewables. I think most in the U.S. \nCongress do. We have been subsidizing solar and wind now for more than \n25 years, but they meet only about 3 percent of our total energy \ndemand. I think renewables, including hydropower, must play a role in \nmeeting the needs of the U.S., but the real solution lies in boosting \noil and natural gas production and finding cleaner, more efficient ways \nto use coal. That is where our research dollar ought to be going \nbecause that is the only way we will be able to meet the demands of the \nmarketplace.\n  The bill Senator Lott has just introduced is the product of several \nmonths of discussion and analysis that I have already outlined. The \ncommittee was chaired by Senator Frank Murkowski. Let me take just a \nfew more minutes and explain a the major steps the bill takes to \nimprove our energy future.\n  The bill would require the Secretary to report annually on progress \ntoward limiting our dependence on foreign oil down to no greater than \n50-percent. The Secretary must lay out legislative and administrative \nsteps to meet that goal and recommend alternatives for reducing crude \noil imports. To increase our use of natural gas, the bill creates an \ninteragency working group to design a policy and strategy for greater \nuse of natural gas.\n  The bill extends authority to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and \nprevents drawdown of the reserve until the President and the Secretary \nof Defense agree that a drawdown will not threaten our national \nsecurity.\n  Our bill contains a title to protect consumers and low-income \nfamilies, and to encourage energy efficiency. It expands eligibility \nfor residential weatherization programs, creates a program to educate \nconsumers to help them avoid seasonal price fluctuations, and also \nestablishes a heating oil reserve to help the Northeast deal with \nshortages and severe price fluctuations.\n  Our bill also contains a title addressing increased use of other \ndomestic energy sources like coal and more efficient use of our nuclear \nand hydro resources. It also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to report on how costs for relicensing hydroelectric \nfacilities can be lowered.\n  The bill also authorizes a Federal oil and gas leasing program for \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the remaining \ngreat potential sources of crude oil in this country, with estimated \nyields of well over 16 billion barrels, the kind of production that \ncould come in at about 1.5 million barrels a day and do that for nearly \n20 years or more. Despite that potential the Clinton-Gore \nadministration opposes going there to explore for oil.\n  The amount of additional domestic production would, if added to \ntoday's domestic production, reduce our 60-percent dependency below the \n50-percent mark that our legislation seeks. I think 50 percent is a \nresponsible goal, not only one demanded by the public but demanded by \nthe Congress and that should be supported by this administration and \nfuture administrations.\n  The bill also contains provisions to streamline and reduce the costs \nassociated with gas and oil leasing on Federal lands to enhance \ndomestic production and to encourage small oil producers to keep low-\nvolume wells operating during harsh economic times.\n  Finally, we have included in the legislation tax credits for wind and \nbiomass energy and electrical production from steel-making facilities \nand tax incentives for residential solar use. In other words, we want \nto encourage all kinds of energy. We do not want to pick and choose and \ndecide that some do not fit our policy or our lifestyle. What this \npublic wants is a market basket full of reasonable energy sources at \nreasonable costs. It is to our benefit, it is to our economy's benefit, \nand it is to the world's benefit that we drive these technologies as \nwell as conventional forms of energy production.\n  What is the policy of the Clinton-Gore Administration? My colleagues \nhave seen it in action. We saw our Secretary of Energy walking around \nthe Middle East with a tin cup: Oh, sheik, oh, sheik, if you are from \nthe Middle East or if you are from Venezuela or if you are from Mexico, \nplease, turn on your valves and give us a little oil. Please, please, \nit may hurt our lifestyle.\n  How sad it is that our great country has been reduced to that kind of \npolicy. The legislation Senators Lott and Murkowski have introduced \ntoday can help us regain control of our energy destiny from the Middle \nEast and OPEC.\n  The news today reported there is a huge new discovery of oil in the \nCaspian Sea which is years away from production, and if it comes \nonline, it will be in a politically unstable place in the world over \nwhich we have little or no control.\n  Does the average consumer going to the gas pump every day want to \nhave to turn to the East and ask a sheik to turn on a valve so that he \nor she can get to work at a reasonable cost? I doubt that, and that is \nwhat this legislation is about. That is why Senator Murkowski, Senator \nLott, I, and others have joined together to offer up this legislation \nas a national energy policy for this country, not only to direct this \nCongress, but to direct this administration and future administrations \nto an achievable goal of reducing foreign crude oil imports below the \n50-percent level and recognizing the great creativity in this country \nto produce energy in abundance, at low cost, and through a variety of \nresources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the special \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Idaho. He has outlined \nvery carefully the basic underlying theme, which is we are proposing an \nenergy policy. That energy policy is enunciated in the National Energy \nSecurity Act of 2000, S. 2557, which was introduced by the leadership \nthis morning and on whose behalf the Senator from Idaho has spoken.\n  We have--I emphasize this--we have laid down an energy policy for \nthis country. I suggest there is not one Member who can identify \nspecifically what is the administration's energy policy. We know what \nit is not. Let's take nuclear power. We know they are opposed to it. \nThey will not address the issue of nuclear waste.\n  We know they are against domestic oil and gas production.\n  We know they are against hydroelectric power expansion.\n  We know they are against new natural gas pipelines.\n  What are they for then? It is pretty hard to identify until one \nbegins looking at the record of the Secretary in trying to generate \nrelief from the oil shortage we are experiencing.\n  I will speak about the oil shortage specifically because it is very \nreal and is identified on this chart.\n  This chart is designated by quarter, this is global demand and global \nsupply for each quarter this year. The reality is, by the end of the \nfourth quarter, the demand will exceed the supply by about 2 million \nbarrels a day. I could spend a lot of time on this chart and show where \nthe oil comes from--OPEC, Iraq, OPEC supply, non-OPEC supply--but we \nhave a basic economic factor where we have more demand than supply. \nWhen we have that kind of situation, the price goes up and the American \ntaxpayers pay through the nose. Last year, oil was $11, $12, $13 a \nbarrel. Earlier this year, we saw $34-a-barrel oil. Currently we are at \nabout $29 to $30.\n  Where are we looking to accommodate this increase demand with this \nadministration? We are looking to Iraq--\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\nof all nations of the world, Iraq. Think about it. This next chart \nshows our imports from Iraq. They were very small through 1997. In \n1998, they began to jump up. The specifics are, in 1998 we imported \n300,000 barrels a day from Iraq; currently, we are importing 700,000 \nbarrels a day. How quickly we forget that in 1990 and 1991 we fought a \nwar with Iraq. We lost 293 American lives. There were 467 wounded. \nThere was a cost to the American taxpayers of approximately $7.4 \nbillion.\n  What have we done since then? We have enforced a no-fly zone. That is \nvery similar to an aerial blockade.\n  What has it cost the taxpayers of this country since the war? It has \ncost the taxpayers approximately $10 billion just to keep Saddam \nHussein fenced in.\n  The American press does not even print this anymore. We get the \nfigures from the French press of what is going on over there. Enforcing \nthe no-fly zone in Iraq has required more than 240,000 sorties since \nthe end of the gulf war at an average cost of $7 million an hour. We \nhave flown 21,000 missions since 1998. We have bombed them on more than \n145 days since Desert Fox in December of 1998. Since December of 1998, \nIraq reports 295 of their citizens have been killed and 860 wounded in \nairstrikes. Airstrikes on Iraq occur almost daily. Where are we looking \nfor oil? Iraq. What kind of a foreign policy does this administration \nhave?\n  Saddam Hussein seems to be deliberately luring us, sadistically using \nhis own people as bait, into killing innocent Iraqis for sympathy to \nlift the no-fly zone. At the same time, he is dramatically increasing \nhis own military capacity. What is happening? He is smuggling out an \nawful lot of oil. What is he using the funds for? Every Member of this \nbody should get a classified briefing from the Intelligence Committee \nand find out for themselves what he is doing. It is a very dangerous \nsituation with which we are going to have to reckon at some point in \ntime, and God help us.\n  U.N. sanctions certainly have not done the job. What we are doing \nwith Saddam Hussein is rewarding him. Iraq will export $8.5 billion in \noil this year, and it is estimated the smuggling will generate \napproximately $400 million which goes to enrich Saddam Hussein and goes \nto his Republican Guard which keeps him alive.\n  Think about it. We are looking to Iraq for our oil. What is Iraq \nlooking towards? This is a bizarre pattern.\n\n  If we think about it, it is fairly simple. It is so simple that I \nhope my colleagues will reflect on its significance. He uses the money \nwe send him for new arms--new biological technology--we take his oil, \nand we fill our warplanes. And what do we do? We go bomb him. Then we \nbuy some more of his oil, send him some money, and the process starts \nall over again.\n  We are spending billions and billions of dollars to contain Iraq's \nexpansion, and billions and billions of dollars to permit Iraqi \nexpansion by increasing their refining capacity. As we do this we are \nrisking the lives of American service men and women, our security, the \nsecurity of our allies, and the American way of life, if you will, \npursuing an energy policy which can only end in a tragedy.\n  I think today my colleagues who have joined the leader in the \nintroduction of the National Energy Security Act of 2000 have put \nforward an energy plan, an energy policy. It is up to the \nadministration now to match it. Because so far the only thing the \nadministration has done is to come out with six very weak short-term \nactions: to help prevent power outages which would terminate the \ngeneration to Federal water projects; it would encourage price \nincreases; it would explore the opportunities for the inventory of \ngenerators held by the private sector; it would conduct emergency \nexercises; it would work with the utility industry to update \ninformation; and prepare public service announcements.\n  What kind of an energy policy is that?\n  I see my good friend, the junior Senator from Texas, seeking \nrecognition.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nheading the task force that put together a balanced approach, with a \nclear goal--a simple goal--of reducing foreign oil dependence in the \nUnited States of America to under 50 percent by the year 2010, so that \n10 years from today we could have what I think is a very modest goal of \n50-percent capability in the United States of America to produce the \noil and gas needs of our country.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to see what has been happening to \noil prices over the last 3 years. First, we went down so low that the \nlittle guys could not make it. We lost thousands of small well \nproducers because they could not make it on $10-a-barrel oil. They \ncould not meet their expenses. So they went under and they capped the \nwells.\n  When a well is capped, it is almost impossible to reopen it because \nit is so expensive. These are wells that produced 15 barrels a day or \nless. We are not talking about gushers. We are not talking about \nthousands of barrels a day, which some do produce in other parts of the \ncountry. We are talking about 15 barrels a day, a barely break-even \nproposition at any price, but certainly not at $10.\n  What we are trying to do is take the artificially low prices and the \nridiculously high prices that we see today because we are dependent on \nforeign imported oil, and say: What will allow us to stabilize these \nprices? What will allow us to stabilize these prices is exactly what is \nin the bill we are introducing today and which we hope Congress will \nact on before we leave; and that is, we encourage the little guys by \ngiving them a floor--just as we do farmers--when prices go below $17 a \nbarrel. We would just give them a tax credit so they could stay in \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Alaska talked about many of the other parts of this \nbill. I hope we can have bipartisan support so we can stabilize the \nprices for consumers in America and jobs in our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3962-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3962-S3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had a tremendous honor this weekend to \nmarch in the Million Mom March, along with about 750,000 citizens of \nthis great country. They were moms; they were dads; they were grandmas \nand grandpas; and children in strollers.\n  We really all had in our hearts one wish for Mother's Day--to turn \naround the gun violence that is plaguing our Nation.\n  It was quite a march. It was quite an event because the emotion was \nhigh. The spirits were high. Perhaps the most touching part of it, for \nme and for many others, was the presence of so many moms and dads whose \nfamilies have been touched by gun violence, whose children have been \nkilled by gun violence, cut down by gun violence, maimed by gun \nviolence.\n  The victims were there with a message: That they want to make sure \nother families never have feelings of pain and loss and anguish which \nwill last all their lives.\n  I am embarrassed to say to my constituents that this Congress has \ndone nothing--nothing at all--to reduce gun violence in our country. \nAfter Columbine, we passed five sensible gun measures--very modest, \ngood, sensible gun measures--such as making sure every handgun is sold \nwith a safety lock, and others that are very sensible: closing the gun \nshow loophole so that a mentally imbalanced person or a criminal cannot \nwalk into a gun show and simply be handed a gun--hand the cash over and \nget the gun with no background check.\n\n  We know the background checks work, but they don't apply to gun \nshows. So Senator Lautenberg offered a very important amendment and it \nwas added to the juvenile justice bill to close that gun show loophole. \nVice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. We know that will \nkeep guns out of the criminals' hands. But what has happened in this \nSenate? Nothing. The power of the gun lobby can be felt in this \nChamber--the power of the money of the gun lobby, the power of the \nthreat of the gun lobby, and the gun lobby rules in this Senate, the \ngun lobby rules in the House of Representatives, and the gun lobby says \nif one of the candidates is elected President--namely, George Bush--\nthey will run an office out of the White House.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. Let's look at the deaths from gun \nviolence in our country. There were 58,168 deaths in Vietnam over 11 \nyears. They were tragic deaths. People were cut down in the prime of \ntheir lives. In 11 years, there were 58,168 deaths. Let's look at the \nlast 11 years in America--the war on our streets, the war in our \nschools and, yes, even the war in our churches and Jewish community \ncenters, where gunmen come in and cut people down in the prime of their \nlives; and they cut children down. There were 395,441 gun deaths in the \n11-year period.\n  Now, we stopped the war in Vietnam--Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, people of every race, color, and creed. We stopped that \nwar. We can stop this war. But I will tell you, it isn't going to be \neasy. The gun lobby is not going to make it easy. We have to have \ncourage. There are those of us in this Senate who are going to be on \nthis floor from now on, in the name of the million moms who marched \nwith the dads, the grandmas, the grandpas, and the children. We are \ngoing to be here. We are going to be here day after day. We are going \nto force this Senate to look this issue in the eye, to look families in \nthe eye, to bring out the five sensible gun control measures that are \nin the juvenile justice bill. What excuse is there since Columbine High \nSchool, where 13 people were killed? Thirteen kids are killed every \nday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. We will be back on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California. \nEvery day in America, 13 mothers receive a phone call or a knock on the \ndoor, a word from a neighbor, and their lives are changed. Every day in \nAmerica, 13 mothers learn that one of their children has been killed by \na gun. Every day in America, 13 mothers have a pain in their heart that \nwill be there for a lifetime.\n  This last Sunday, I went to Chicago, IL, on the banks of Lake \nMichigan. Our Million Mom March chapter came together, and thousands of \npeople came out. They were inspired, of course, by the fact that it was \nMother's Day and that we were addressing this issue because it is a \nfamily issue, and especially an issue that mothers take to heart \nbecause mothers, by their nature, protect their children. They came \nforward on the banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago and here on The Mall \nin Washington, DC, and in Los Angeles, and in cities across America, to \nsay: Let us protect our children; protect our children from the gun \ncriminals who menace our neighborhoods, our communities and our \nschools; protect our children from the gang bangers who spray these \nbullets from semiautomatic and automatic weapons across playgrounds, \nday care centers, and bus stops; protect our children from careless gun \nowners who insist on their constitutional right to own a gun but will \nnot accept their moral responsibility to store it safely away from \nchildren; protect our children from a gun lobby in this town that has \nmade a mockery of democracy, which owns this Chamber and owns the House \nof Representatives, which stops us in our tracks; protect our children \nfrom the indifference of millions of American families who know what I \nsay is true but who didn't come to the march, who don't call a \nCongressman or a Senator and just shake their heads and say, ``It's \npolitics, it's hopeless; they don't listen, they don't care.''\n  The Million Mom March was an inspiration to so many people. It was an \ninspiration to me because at the end of the march in Chicago, the Bell \nCampaign, which sponsored it, invited the families of gun victims to \ncome forward and literally ring a bell for their victim. They started \ncoming slowly from the crowd, and then the numbers increased. The \nprocession went on and on and on--black, white, brown, men, women, \nbrothers and sisters, sons and daughters, breaking down in tears as \nthey pealed that bell for a gun victim.\n  I stood there, as a Member of the Senate, humbled by that experience, \ntrying to imagine for one brief moment what it must be like to receive \nthat telephone call or that knock on the door. I vowed I would come \nback to this Chamber this week and begin a personal campaign, a \npersonal crusade to make the Senate act on this issue. To think that it \nis 1 year after Columbine and we have done nothing--we have not passed \na bill to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or kids; we have been \ntotally stopped by this gun lobby--it is a disgrace, a disgrace to this \nChamber, to the Congress, and to this country. The million moms who \ncame forward are watching and waiting and praying that before this \nends, we will do something.\n  The National Rifle Association bought a full-page ad in the \nWashington Post Friday criticizing the Million Mom March. Here is what \nthey said: ``It is a political agenda masquerading as motherhood.''\n  I have a message for the National Rifle Association. This was no \nmasquerade; this was the real thing. These were real families who have \nendured the pain and suffering of gun violence. They are coming forward \nand challenging you, gun lobby, National Rifle Association, and \nchallenging us in the Senate and in the House to do what is right for \nAmerica, to reduce gun violence, reduce the pain, and reduce the \nsuffering.\n  There is no excuse for the fact that, for 1 year, the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate has refused to bring a bill to the \nfloor so we could vote and send to the President a bill to keep guns \nout of the hands of criminals and kids. You will hear more about this \nissue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3964-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3964-S3965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n                     FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD MEETING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a meeting started 1 hour and 5 minutes ago \nat 20th Street and Constitution Avenue here in Washington, DC. The \nFederal Reserve Board is meeting in a large room in a building that \ntakes up nearly the entire block.\n  No one in this Chamber is allowed at that meeting. No ordinary \nAmerican citizen is allowed at this meeting. The door is locked. They \nare meeting behind closed doors at the Federal Reserve Board to decide \nhow much they want to raise interest rates once again.\n  I think it is important to allow people to see who is meeting. Here \nare the pictures of the folks at the Fed--the Federal Board of \nGovernors. The ones with the stars are the regional Federal Reserve \nbank presidents who will make the decision this morning.\n  They increased interest rates last June, in August, in November, in \nFebruary, and again in March. In North Dakota, in Idaho, in Illinois, \nand in California, the average American household is now paying $1,200 \na year in additional interest charges as a result. If you have a \n$100,000 mortgage, you are paying $100 a month more for your mortgage \npayment. Why? Because the Federal Reserve Board feels that too many \npeople are working in this country and that our economic growth ought \nto be slowed.\n  If you ask them about the circumstance, they would say: We really \nhave controlled inflation; it is because we have increased interest \nrates that inflation has been under control.\n  That is like the weatherman taking credit for the sunshine. The fact \nis, this economy has worked in spite of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  This Federal Reserve Board, under Mr. Greenspan's tutelage, has added \nnearly a three-quarters of 1 percent increase in the real Federal funds \nrate during his term versus the 20 years prior. It has added nearly a \ntwo percent increase in the real prime rate during the Greenspan years \nversus the prior years. They have leaned and tilted their interest rate \npolicies towards the big banking center interests, and against the \nconsumer's interest and against the taxpayers' interests.\n  By what justification would they increase interest rates this \nmorning? This morning the Consumer Price Index came out. It is flat; \nplumb flat. The Producer Price Index from last month was down. The core \ninflation rate is down.\n  By what justification will the Federal Reserve Board decide to charge \nhigher interest rates on the American people? They say, in a Washington \nPost article by John Berry, that the new theory of the Fed is that if \nworker productivity is up in this country, it puts pressure on the \neconomy, and, therefore, they should raise interest rates to slow down \nthe economy.\n  What a prosperous notion. It used to be when I came to the floor and \nindicated that the Fed complained workers were getting more money, or \nthere was a threat that they would get more money but their \nproductivity wasn't rising, the Fed used to say that is inherently \ninflationary. Now what they say is that it doesn't matter how \nproductive they are; in fact, the more productive they are, the more \nlikely it is the Fed wants to raise interest rates.\n  Talk about people flying blind. I learned to fly an airplane about a \nquarter century ago. I remember that as you do your solo cross-country \nflying the airplane, you have to learn to rely on instruments. How do \nyou know where you are going? You have to read your instruments? The \nfact is, the Federal Reserve Board doesn't have instruments that work \nanymore.\n  To the extent you could picture a group of bankers in gray suits and \nwearing goggles, with a leather helmet and a silk scarf--to the extent \nyou could picture them flying and flying blind--I respectfully say they \nare flying in the wrong direction and are perfectly happy to do so even \nwhen told.\n  The thing that I find interesting is this: We have an economy that \nhas been remarkably strong. The Fed has been remarkably wrong all \nalong. They have said our economy cannot grow more than 2\\1/2\\ percent, \nand if it does we are going to have more inflation. It has and we \nhaven't.\n  They have said that unemployment can't go below 6 percent. If it \ndoes, we will have more inflation. Unemployment has been below 6 \npercent for 5 years, and inflation has been down.\n  The Federal Reserve Board has been wrong about the performance of \nthis economy. Yet as they write about the Fed, they simply take what \nthe Fed says, print it, and they print no discussion about the \nalternatives. So we have no real debate about this.\n  The interesting thing is 30 years ago a one-quarter percent increase \nin interest rates proposed by McChesney Martin caused an outcry in this \ncountry. It was front-page headlines. Lyndon Johnson was President. He \ncalled this guy down to the ranch in Texas and put pressure on him all \nthe weekend. It was front-page news. Today the Fed can go behind closed \ndoors and raise interest rates one-half percent, and nobody seems to \nmind.\n  All of these chairs are largely empty in the Senate. I wonder where \npeople are. What if someone were to bring to the floor of the Senate a \nproposal that said, what we would like to do is increase taxes on the \naverage household in this country by $1,210 a year. If there were a \nproposal to increase taxes in the amount of $1,210 a year, all of these \nchairs would be full. There would be a raging debate, and all of the \nfolks would come to the floor to talk about taxes. They would be \nhollering and bellowing.\n\n  But guess what. You can increase interest rates five, six, or seven \ntimes by the Federal Reserve, and impose an additional $1,210 a year \ninterest charge on the average household, and there is not a whimper.\n  Again, let me give credit where credit is due. All of these folks \nlook alike. They largely think alike. All of them wear gray suits. All \nof them have a banking background. When they close the doors and lock \nthe American citizens out down at the Federal Reserve Board, they are \ngoing to make a banking decision.\n  What is the banking decision? They increase interest rates on the \nAmerican people in order to protect the big banking center interests.\n  The point is this: There is no inflation. There is no evidence of \ninflation.\n  It is going to be uncomfortable for the Fed. But of course they do \nnot deal with comforts. Once they close the doors, they have all the \ncomforts at hand.\n  Just this morning the Consumer Price Index was announced, and it is \nflat; no inflation.\n  Just this morning--a little over an hour ago--they went into the \nroom, closed the doors, and locked everybody else out. Guess what they \nare going to decide. They will announce that they have decided, despite \nthe fact there is no inflation, because American workers are more \nproductive that justifies an increase in the interest rates.\n  Why if the American worker is more productive should the American \nworker not be entitled to a better share of income? Of course, they \nshould. That is not inflationary. But the Federal Reserve Board has now \nconcocted this goofy new theory that says if the American worker is \nmore productive, they must impose an added charge on the average \nAmerican.\n  You talk about people who can't think. I don't understand. Maybe they \nneed to loosen all those neckties. But there is something wrong at the \nFed.\n  I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank him for \nbringing us back to this point about the Fed behind closed doors. When \nthey raise the rates, this is really a hidden tax, is it not, I ask the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It certainly is, and it is a tax that was not a part of \nany public discussion and imposed in a room with the doors locked.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No representation for the American people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No representation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to ask the Senator another question. The decisions \nthey make today are behind closed doors. Does the Senator know how long \nit will be before we will be able to look at the detailed books to find \nout why they made those decisions? I will answer it. It will be 5 years \nbefore we will fully know why they made the decisions. Maybe if we knew \ntomorrow, or next week, or next month why they made the decision, we \nmight want to make some changes around here in the way we operate. They \nmake the decisions, and we will not know the full picture for 5 years \nwhy they did it.\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will know in 5 minutes that it was a mistake. If these \nfolks at a time when there is no additional inflation raise interest \nrates once again to try to slow down this economy and penalize the \nAmerican workforce for being more productive, we will know in 5 minutes \nthat is a mistake.\n  I hope with this announcement that will apparently be made at about 2 \no'clock this afternoon this group of folks perhaps might exhibit some \ngood sense for a change.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, 7 minutes, and the Senator from Iowa, the remaining \ntime.\n  First of all, I join with our colleagues who spoke earlier about the \nextraordinary events we saw on The Mall this past weekend.\n  I was here a few moments ago when we listened to the majority leader \ntalk about the urgency of passing a comprehensive energy program. \nEnergy programs are important, and we have a great interest in it in \nour part of the country, particularly as we are looking forward to \nanother fall and another winter, and the importance of developing some \nprotections in the form of reserves and other factors. That is a very \nimportant policy issue. I am glad our Republican leader thinks that is \nof such urgency.\n  But the fact is, the issues which the Senator from California and \nothers have spoken about, and taking sensible and responsible and \ncommonsense actions on guns, particularly to ensure greater safety and \nsecurity in the schools of this country, are also a matter of enormous \nimportance.\n  I am reminded of the debate we had on elementary and secondary \neducation. We had 6 days of debate, although some of that was limited \nin terms of being able to debate only a handful of amendments. We took \n16 days on the bankruptcy bill and had 67 amendments.\n  Many of us on our side believe we ought to put our priorities \nstraight. One of them is to take action in terms of sensible and \ncommonsense issues on the proliferation of guns.\n  Second, we ought to be addressing the education issue, which is of \nsuch importance to families across this country.\n  We reject the position of the majority in giving short shrift on the \nissue of education. We want to debate that, and we want action on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3965-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3965-S3970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BANKRUPTCY REFORM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate the continued deterioration of the position which had been \naccepted previously by the Senate on the issue of bankruptcy.\n  That may seem an issue that is distant and remote to many of our \ncolleagues or many around this country, but it is an issue that will \naffect basically working women who are disproportionately hit by the \npressures of bankruptcy because of the allocations of credit at the \ntime of separation or their shortage of alimony or the shortage of \nchild payments. It hits them disproportionately.\n  It hits older workers disproportionately in terms of their medical \nbills. About half of those bankruptcies are a result of the escalation \nand the costs of medical bills, coupled with the fact of prescription \ndrug costs and the shortage of prescription drugs. That is another \nmatter of priority. That is another matter we believe ought to be \naddressed. The failure of this body to address providing decent quality \nprescription drugs on the basis of need and on the ability to pay is \nalso a major gap in our Medicare system. We should be taking action on \nthat. When we don't, we find increasing numbers of individuals are \nfalling into bankruptcy because they can't afford the prescription \ndrugs. The credit cards last for only so long, and the payments they \nreceive in terms of working families last only so long, and then they \nget overwhelmed with their payments and they go into bankruptcy.\n  There is a third group of individuals who go into bankruptcy as a \nresult of being downsized. They worked hard all of their lives. The \npeople who go into bankruptcy have the same work habits as those who do \nnot. The overwhelming majority are hard-working Americans who fall into \nhard times.\n  As has been stated time and time on the floor of this body, it is \nalways useful to ask who is going to benefit from a piece of \nlegislation and who is going to pay a price with the passage of a piece \nof legislation. I have not seen in this Congress or any recent times \nthe scales so unbalanced. Those that are going to benefit are going to \nbe the credit card companies, banking interests; those harshly treated \nwill be average working Americans who have fallen into difficult times, \neither economically or because of health care needs or because of age \nand the job challenges they are facing.\n  Only recently there was an excellent article in Time magazine. The \ntotal number of individuals going into bankruptcy is declining. Still, \nwe have this economic power that is trying to jam this legislation \nthrough the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United \nStates behind closed doors. I was listening to my colleagues talk about \nactions taken behind closed doors. They find out on the bankruptcy \nlegislation these are matters that are taking place behind closed doors \nas well.\n  The Time magazine article pointed out what is happening to an average \nfamily. Charles and Lisa Trapp are mail carriers in Plantation, FL, \nwhere Annelise, 8 years old, developed a muscular disorder and needed \naround-the-clock nursing care. Lisa had to quit her job, and with \n$124,000 in doctor bills, insurance will not cover paying off credit \ncards, which is the least of their worries. They have filed for chapter \n7 bankruptcy. The medical costs are what the Trapp family insurance did \nnot cover. They had to use credit cards to buy groceries and they have \nan accumulation of $59,000 in credit card bills. The point is, they \nused the funds available on the credit cards for their groceries so \nthey could use what income they had to pay for the needed prescription \ndrugs.\n  This family, under this Republican bill, is treated harshly and \npoorly. The Trapp family are a brave and courageous family. And this \nsituation is being replicated. It is fundamentally wrong.\n  Mr. President, for over two years, Congress has been struggling to \nreform the bankruptcy laws. From the beginning, the debate has been \nunfairly slanted toward the credit card companies and banks at the \nexpense of vulnerable Americans. It is especially disturbing that the \nfinal bill may well be drafted without the appointment of conferees or \neven public meetings. The American people deserve a better process and \na fairer bill.\n  A fair bankruptcy reform bill will balance the needs of debtors and \ncreditors. It will not allow credit card companies and other special \ninterests to take unfair advantage of thousands of citizens who find \nthemselves in economic crisis--citizens like the Trapp family recently \nfeatured in Time magazine.\n  The Trapps are not wealthy cheats trying to escape their financial \nresponsibilities. They are a middle class family engulfed in debt \nbecause of circumstances beyond their control. Like half of all \nAmericans who file for bankruptcy, the Trapp family had massive medical \nexpenses.\n  Charles and Lisa Trapp met while working as mail carriers in \nPlantation, Florida. They married and have three children--the \nyoungest, Annelise, has a degenerative muscular condition. She requires \nround-the-clock medical care. In her wheel chair or in bed, she uses a \nrespirator at least eight hours a day. As a result, the Trapps have \n$124,000 in doctors' bills that insurance won't cover, and $40,000 of \ncredit card debt for groceries and other necessities.\n  The plight of the Trapp family is similar to that of many other \nAmerican families confronted with serious illness and injury. Over 43 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nAmericans have no health insurance, and many millions more are under-\ninsured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 percent of \ntheir income on medical care. Older Americans are hit particularly \nhard. Too often, each of these families and senior citizens is one \nserious illness away from bankruptcy.\n  A report recently published in Norton's Bankruptcy Adviser says,\n\n       The data reported here serve as a reminder that self-\n     funding medical treatment and loss of income during a bout of \n     illness or recovery from an accident make a substantial \n     number of middle class families vulnerable to financial \n     collapse . . . For middle class people, there is little \n     government help, so that when private insurance is \n     inadequate, bankruptcy serves by default as a means for \n     dealing with the financial consequences of a serious medical \n     problem.\n\n  The data collected in the report make clear that this problem affects \nboth the poor and the middle class. In many cases, health insurance is \ninsufficient to protect a family with medical problems. ``The \nbankruptcy courts are populated not only with the uninsured, but also \nwith those whose insurance does not cover all the financial \nconsequences of their medical problems''--families facing medical debts \nthat have outrun their policy limits--facing co-payments beyond their \nmeans--facing lost income not covered by their insurance.\n  When the health care system fails these men and women and children, \nthe bankruptcy system catches them before they hit rock bottom. What \nwill happen to these families if we fundamentally destroy the \nbankruptcy system?\n  What will happen to those who can't pay their bills because they were \nlaid off in a merger or downsizing that left them without adequate \nincome or basic benefits? Over half of all Americans say that the \nreason they file for bankruptcy is because of job loss. That fact is \nnot surprising. Despite low unemployment, a record-setting stock \nmarket, and large budget surpluses, Wall Street cheers when companies--\neager to improve profits by down-sizing--lay- off workers in large \nnumbers.\n  Often, when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a \nstudy of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported that only about one-quarter of these workers were \nlater employed in full-time jobs paying as much as or more than they \nhad earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are forced \nto accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, and jobs with fewer benefits \nor no benefits at all.\n  For many hard-working men and women, these job benefits--particularly \na pension-- can be the difference between a secure retirement and \npoverty. But instead of action by Congress to expand pension benefits, \nan offensive anti-pension provision was quietly slipped into the \nbankruptcy reform bill at the last minute.\n  It is wrong for Congress to let credit card companies and other \nlenders pressure workers to give up the protection they now have for \ntheir pensions in bankruptcy. Clearly this so-called ``pension waiver'' \nprovision should be struck from the final bill.\n  It would also be a mistake to ``cap'' the amount of pension assets \nthat a worker can protect in bankruptcy. Federal law already imposes \nstrict limits on pension contributions. Unlike homestead abuses, \nretirement plans can't be used as part of a scheme to divert assets \nbefore bankruptcy.\n  It was the combination of a medical problem and a job loss that \npushed Maxean Bowen--a single mother--into bankruptcy. Maxean told Time \nmagazine that she was a social worker in the foster-care system in New \nYork City when she developed a painful condition in both feet that made \nher job, which required house calls, impossible. As a result, she had \nto give up her work and go on the unemployment rolls. Her income fell \nby 50 percent. She had to borrow from relatives, and she used her \ncredit cards to make ends meet. Like so many others in similar \nsituations, she believed that she would soon be back on her feet and \nable to pay her debts. But, like thousands who file for bankruptcy, \neven when Maxean was able to work again, she owed far more than she \ncould repay.\n  She was at the mercy of her creditors. ``They would call me on the \njob . . . that was very embarrassing. They call you early in the \nmorning. They call you late at night. Sometimes I get calls at 10 \no'clock at night. And they are very nasty.'' Maxean tried paying her \ncreditors a few hundred dollars when possible, but it wasn't enough to \nkeep her bills from piling up because of interest changes and late-\npayment fees. Maxean said she was ``going crazy.''\n  If she was going crazy, so are many others. Reports show that by the \ntime individuals and families file for bankruptcy protection, more than \n20 percent of income before taxes is going toward paying interest and \nfees on their debts. Time magazine reports that study after study \nproves that Chapter 7 debtors have little if any ability to repay more \nof their debts. ``The notion that debtors in bankruptcy court are \nsitting on many billions of dollars that they could turn over to their \ncreditors is a figment of the imagination of lenders and lawmakers.''\n  Maxean's plight was made worse by the fact that she is a single \nmother. In 1999, over 500,000 women who head their own households filed \nfor bankruptcy to try to stabilize their economic lives. 200,000 of \nthem are also creditors--trying to collect child support or alimony. \nThe rest are debtors struggling to make ends meet. Divorced women are \nfour times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or \nsingle men.\n  The House and Senate bankruptcy bills are especially harsh on \ndivorced women and their children. Under current law, an ex-wife trying \nto collect support enjoys special protection. Her claims--like very few \nothers--survive her husband's bankruptcy and provide a realistic \nopportunity to collect support payments from her former husband. Under \nthe pending bill, however, credit card companies are given a new right \nto compete with women and children for the husband's limited income \nafter bankruptcy.\n  It is true that the bill moves support payments to the first priority \nposition in the bankruptcy code. But that only matters in the limited \nnumber of cases in which the debtor has assets to distribute to a \ncreditor. In most cases--close to 99 percent --there are no assets, and \nthe list of priorities has no effect.\n  The claim of ``first priority'' in bankruptcy is a sham to conceal \nthe real problem--the competition for resources after bankruptcy. This \nlegislation creates a new category of debt that cannot be discharged \nafter bankruptcy--credit card debt. And, when women and children are \nforced to compete after bankruptcy with these sophisticated lenders, \nthe women and children lose.\n  In ways like these, the bankruptcy reform bills currently being \nnegotiated by the House and the Senate are a travesty. They remove the \nbankruptcy safety net that has been a life-line for the poor and middle \nclass. The credit card companies will receive a huge windfall, and they \nwill walk away with few incentives to act more responsibly. And in a \nfurther insult, the House Republican negotiators want to preserve one \nof the most flagrant fat-cat loopholes--the ability of wealthy debtors \nto escape their responsibilities by using the homestead loophole in the \ncurrent bankruptcy code.\n  The Time magazine article makes these points effectively by comparing \nthe plight of two debtors--James Villa and Allen Smith. James Villa is \na 42 year-old stockbroker living in a $1.4 million home in Boca Raton, \nFlorida. He was President, CEO and indirect owner of 99.5 percent of \nthe stock of H.J. Meyers & Co., Inc--a brokerage firm with offices \naround the country. During the firm's heyday, Mr. Villa bought \nexpensive cars, boats, and jewelry. But he fell on hard times when \nMassachusetts securities authorities found that his firm had engaged in \nfraudulent and unethical practices. Before further action could be \ntaken, the firm closed its doors and Mr. Villa moved to Florida. That \nstate has a broad homestead exemption, which allowed him to protect \n$1.4 million of assets--his Boca Raton home--from creditors, including \nclients of the brokerage firm who had lost their savings.\n  How can that be fair, when Allen Smith, a retired security worker, \nhas lost everything? Mr. Smith served in the Coast Guard during World \nWar II and later went to work at Chrysler. He was eventually laid-off \nduring a downsizing. Too young to collect Social Security, he started \nworking as a security guard. He and his wife Carolyn\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nbought a home and lived a solid middle-class lifestyle until their \nlives started to crumble.\n  Beginning in 1984, Mr. Smith's wife lost her toe, then one leg, then \nthe other leg to diabetes. To accommodate her disability, Mr. Smith \nrenovated their home using money borrowed against the equity. He \ndeveloped throat cancer, high blood pressure, and a heart murmur and \nhad to leave his job. The family was $115,000 in debt--double their \nannual income--so the Smiths filed for bankruptcy. They agreed to pay \n$100 a month under the requirements of Chapter 13.\n  Carolyn Smith died later that year, and Mr. Smith was left--without \nher companionship or Social Security checks--to struggle alone. \nEventually--after being hospitalized with a stroke, after cataract \nsurgery, and after an irresponsible friend didn't pay his mortgage--Mr. \nSmith's Chapter 13 bankruptcy failed. His situation isn't unusual--two-\nthirds of all Chapter 13 plans fail--but the consequences were \ndevastating. Mr. Smith will be moved to Chapter 7, and he will lose his \nhome.\n  Any bill sent to the President for his signature must not make Allen \nSmith's life more difficult while protecting James Villa's ability to \nlive in luxury. Congress must pass a better and fairer bill worthy of \nthe name reform. The President should not hesitate to veto a bad \nbankruptcy bill that flunks the fairness test.\n  For over a century, the bankruptcy laws have provided needed relief \nfor those who fall on hard times. This Congress should not be a party \nto unfair reforms designed to benefit the powerful credit card industry \nand wealthy debtors, at the expense of the large numbers of needy \ncitizens whom the bankruptcy laws are supposed to help, not hurt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under Senator Kennedy's control, Senator \nWellstone has 7 minutes and Senator Harkin has 7 minutes, and, \nfollowing that, Senator Kennedy retains 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy \nand some of my other colleagues on the floor here today to talk about \nthe so-called bankruptcy reform bill. I spoke for about twenty minutes \nyesterday on the same topic and my intent then is the same as that of \nmy colleagues today: which is to shine a line on this bankruptcy bill, \nand focus the attention of the Senate on what Congress is poised to do \nto harshly punish working families overwhelmed by debt.\n  Yesterday I mentioned the Bartlett and Steel article from Time \nmagazine of last week entitled ``Soaked by Congress.'' I commend it to \nmy colleagues' attention. And yesterday I also read some excerpts from \nthat article to give colleagues an idea of what a typical family \nactually looks like who files for bankruptcy. In all honesty, I think \nmany in the House and Senate were hoodwinked last year by a very clever \nmedia campaign on the part of the big banks and the credit card \nindustry. I mean, it shouldn't be too surprising that the bill passed \nwith the overwhelming margin that it did if you assumed that colleagues \nfocused on the media campaign, the ad campaign, the legions of Gucci \nloafer wearing lobbyist that descended on the Hill. Because, frankly, I \ndon't believe that many of my colleagues who did vote for the bill \nwould have done so had they known then what they should know now, now \nthat there has been some balance to the debate.\n  Now the House and Senate leadership have staff burning the midnight \noil trying to finish this bill so that they can stick it in an \nunrelated conference report. But while they do that, we have 40 million \nAmericans without health insurance who we aren't rushing emergency \nlegislation to safeguard. The Patients' Bill of Rights is MIA in \nconference for almost a year. We are crawling along--actually not even \ncrawling anymore it appears--on Education--though schools are crumbling \nand kids can't learn because we aren't investing what we should into \ntheir education. I mean these are real emergencies facing millions of \nAmericans. And yet it is so-called bankruptcy reform that the House and \nSenate are falling all over themselves to pass. This morning I want to \nfocus on the reasons why this bill is being moved at light speed--the \nfalse reasons as well as the real reasons.\n  Bankruptcy does not occur in vacuum. We know that in the vast \nmajority of cases it is a drastic step taken by families in desperate \nfinancial circumstances and overburdened by debt. The main income \nearner may have lost his or her job. There may be sudden illness or a \nterrible accident requiring medical care. Certainly most Americans have \nfaced a time in their lives where they weren't sure where the next \nmortgage payment or credit card payment was going to come from, but \nsomehow they scrape by month to month. Still, such families are on the \nedge of a precipice and any new expense--a severely sick child, a car \nrepair bill--could send a family into financial ruin. Despite the \ncurrent economic expansion there are far too many working families in \nthis situation. That is the true story behind the high number of \nbankruptcy filings in recent years and I want to make clear to my \ncolleagues that the evidence shows that the very banks and credit card \ncompanies who are pushing this bill have a lot to do with why working \nfamilies are in this predicament today.\n  The bankruptcy system is supposed to allow a person to climb back up \nafter they've hit bottom, to have a ``fresh start.'' There is no point \nto continue to punish a person and a family once their resources are \nover matched by debt. The bankruptcy system allows families to regroup, \nto focus resources on essentials like their home, transportation and \nmeeting the needs of dependents. Sometimes the only way this can occur \nis to allow the debtor to be forgiven of some debt, and in most cases \nthis is debt that would never be repaid because of the debtor's \nfinancial circumstances. In fact, in over 95% of bankruptcy cases \ncreditors receive no distributions from the filer's assets--not because \nfolks are able to beat the system--but because in the vast majority of \ncases the debtor simply has no assets left.\n  The sponsors of this measure and the megabanks and credit card \ncompanies behind this bill don't like to focus on those situations. \nThey paint a picture of profligate abuse of the bankruptcy system by \nirresponsible debtors who could pay their debt but simply choose not \nto. Such people do take advantage of the system, there is no question. \nBut this bill casts a wider net and catches more than just the \nbankruptcy ``abusers.''\n  ``Soaked by Congress'' does an excellent job of setting the record \nstraight. It notes that a study last year by the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute found that only 3 percent of debtors who file under Chapter \n7--where debtors liquidate assets to repay some debt while the rest of \nthe debtor's unsecured debt is forgiven--would actually have been able \nto pay more of their debt than they are required to under Chapter 7. \nEven the U.S. Justice Department found that the number of abusive \nclaims was somewhere between 3 percent and 13 percent. This means that \nthe number of people filing abusive bankruptcy claims is astonishingly \nlow. But this legislation seeks to channel many more debtors into \nchapter 13 bankruptcy--where the debtor enters a 3-5 year repayment \nplan and very little debt is forgiven. Yet in the pursuit of the few, \nthis bill imposes onerous conditions, and ridiculous standards on all \nbankrupts alike. Additionally, under current law, 67 percent of the \ndebtors in chapter 13 fail to complete their repayment plan often \nbecause they did not get enough relief from loans, and because economic \ndifficulties continued. So this legislation would take individuals, the \nmajority of whom desperately need a true ``fresh start'', and force \nthem into a bankruptcy process which \\2/3\\ of debtors already fail to \ncomplete successfully. And my colleagues call this reform?\n  Furthermore, the consumer credit industry would like this to be a \ndebate about financial responsibility. But\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nwhat is apparently not obvious to many of my colleagues is that debt \ninvolves both a borrower and a lender. Yes, a person should be \nresponsible for repaying money lent to them on fair terms. But is it \nnot in the lender's interest to not over lend? Should not the banks, \nand the credit card companies, and the retailers bear some \nresponsibility for the so-called bankruptcy crisis?\n  As high cost debt, credit cards, retail charge cards, and financing \nplans for consumer goods have skyrocketed in recent years, so have the \nnumber of bankruptcy filings. As the consumer credit industry has begun \nto aggressively court the poor and the vulnerable, bankruptcies have \nrisen. Credit card companies brazenly dangle literally billions of card \noffers to high debt families every year. They encourage card holders to \nmake low payments toward their card balances, guaranteeing that a few \nhundred dollars in clothing or food will take years to pay off. The \nlengths that companies go to keep their customers in debt is \nridiculous.\n  So any thinking person would ask at this point. Why is the House and \nSenate calling out the stops to pass this bill? What's driving this \nbill? Well as ``Soaked by Congress'' notes, the big banks spent $5 \nmillion last year specifically on bankruptcy lobbyists and another $50 \nmillion on firms that lobbied on bankruptcy as well as other matters. I \nwonder how much money working families overburdened with medical bills \npaid to influence Congress last year? Is that why we weren't listening?\n  That makes this a reform issue, a basic question of good government. \nRegardless of how you feel about the bill, this is terrible \nlegislating. I don't think that the 100 members of the Senate or the \n435 members of the House came to Congress to be dictated to by secret \ncommittees formed by the leadership. This week we are debating \neducation in the Senate. Can you imagine trying to explain to a 9th \ngrade civics class what the House and Senate leadership are trying to \ndo? They would learn how minority rights are protected in the Senate, \nabout how there are regular procedures--high bars--for the majority to \novercome to force something to passage over the objections of a \ndetermined minority. All of that goes out the window for the 4th branch \nof government--the conference committee.\n  We don't have time for debate, we don't have time for legislative \nbattles in this Congress. We don't have time for the hallowed \ntraditions of the Senate. Just form a secret committee and stick in an \nunrelated conference report in the dead of night. What is so essential \nabout this bill that the leadership must make such a mockery of the \nlegislative process?\n  The most expedient means is the best means according to this logic. \nBut at what cost? Only a handful of power brokers are at the table. \nWorking families aren't represented. Seniors aren't at that table. \nMinorities aren't in the loop. Women and children, and single parent \nfamilies weren't invited.\n  So I would say to my colleagues in closing, folks can make the claim \nthat big money doesn't buy results in Congress but they won't use this \nbill as the poster boy for that argument. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to go to their leadership. It isn't too late to ask \nthem to reconsider this course.\n  We come to the floor today as Senators to shine a light on the \nbankruptcy bill. I spoke about this bill for some 20 or 30 minutes \nyesterday. I thank two fine journalists, Bartlett and Steele, for their \nfine work, ``Soaked by Congress.'' I sent this article out to every \nSenator. I hope my colleagues will read this article. It is about how \nthe House and Senate were hoodwinked last year by a clever media \ncampaign on the part of big banks and the credit card industry.\n  I point out not to my colleagues but, frankly, to people in the \ncountry that some of the House and Senate leadership, with the majority \nparty taking the lead, have been burning the midnight oil trying to \nfinish this bankruptcy bill so they can stick it into an unrelated \nconference report. While they do that, we have 40 million people who \ndon't have any health insurance at all. That is not an emergency? While \nthey do that, the patient protection bill of rights is barely moving at \nall. It may be crawling; it may not even be crawling. While they do \nthat, we don't pass any kind of education measure. While they do that, \nthere is no response to 700,000-plus mothers--Sheila and I were proud \nto join them this past Sunday--who came to Washington, DC. They said: \nWe are a citizens' lobby. We will take on special interests. We will be \nhere for our children. We will be here to reduce violence. We will be \nhere for sensible gun control. But there has been no response to that. \nThat is not considered to be an emergency?\n  But boy, oh boy, when it comes to this bankruptcy bill, some of my \ncolleagues, some of the leadership on the other side, can't wait to \nstick this into an unrelated conference report. I think there is a \nreason for that. In the piece that Bartlett and Steele wrote called \n``Soaked by Congress,'' they do an excellent job of getting the record \nstraight. As opposed to the media campaign by these banks and credit \ncard companies about all of this abuse, it turns out that the American \nBankruptcy Institute found only 3 percent of debtors under chapter 7 \ncould have done any better.\n  Now, all in the name of a few people who abuse this system, we have \nfamilies my colleague, Senator Kennedy, talked about, with 40 percent \nof them in bankruptcy because of medical bills, and the vast majority \nof the remaining are because someone lost their job or because there \nhas been a divorce and now they are a single parent.\n  What in the world is going on here? In this piece, ``Soaked by \nCongress,'' Barlett and Steele point out that big banks spent $5 \nmillion last year specifically on bankruptcy lobbyists and another $50 \nmillion on firms that lobbied on bankruptcy as well as other matters.\n  I say to my colleague Senator Feingold, and my colleague Senator \nHarkin, and I would say it to my colleague Senator Kennedy if he were \non the floor, this is the ultimate reform issue. We are talking about \npeople, mainly women, mainly senior citizens, mainly working-income, \nmaybe low-income people, people without much clout who are completely \nrolled by this bill.\n  Now we find out all about the pension grab. Now we find out about all \nsorts of other provisions that are egregious, that I do not have time \nto summarize, that I summarized yesterday. Now we find out that, given \nwhere this bill is going in conference, it is going to be even more \nharsh toward the most vulnerable citizens in this country. But that \nwill not see the light of day; it will get tucked into an unrelated \nconference report.\n  I say to my colleagues, we do intend to speak out on this issue. I \nhope the President will make it clear he will veto this bill. It is too \nharsh, there are too many egregious provisions, and right now we are \nnot conducting our business the way we ought to as the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy and others for \ngetting this time to talk about the bankruptcy bill.\n  I must at the outset admit that due to the press of business around \nhere, and I am not on that committee that formulated this bill, I had \nnot really looked at the bankruptcy portions of it in depth. A lot of \npeople I admire and have respect for have supported the bill. I \nsupported a number of amendments. When the bill finally passed, I had \nsome qualms about it. I voted against it. But I had not really delved \ninto it in very much depth until a week ago, last week, when Time \nmagazine came out with one of the longest stories I have ever seen Time \nmagazine do. It has been mentioned by the previous two speakers, a \nstory called ``Soaked By Congress.'' It is 12 pages or more long.\n  I read it. When I read it, some memories started coming back to me of \nmy days when I was a legal aid lawyer before coming to Congress. I was \nthinking about the people we represented at the low end of the economic \nspectrum who could not afford to get another attorney from a private \nlaw firm, and the people we took through bankruptcy. These were people \nat wit's end. I remember them. Often it was a woman with a couple of \nchildren, her husband\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\ntook off, there was illness in the family, she racked up a lot of \nbills, and she had nowhere to go.\n  At that time in Iowa, we were also debating a bill in the Iowa \nLegislature to limit the amount of interest that could be charged on a \ncredit card. The Iowa Legislature in fact at that time passed a limit \nof 15 percent. It did not hurt the State at all. I remembered that, \nreading this article.\n  When you heard the debate out here on the bankruptcy bill, you would \nthink these were people out living high on the hog, going to the best \nrestaurants, taking foreign vacations, driving Mercedes Benz cars and \nBMWs, they have beautiful homes and stuff, and all of a sudden they \ndecide they have been living the life of Riley and they do not want to \npay their dues, so they go into bankruptcy court. That is the image of \nthe average person filing bankruptcy that came out here on the Senate \nfloor during that debate. That is a very bad misrepresentation.\n  As the Time magazine article pointed out, the median characteristics \nof a person discharging chapter 7 bankruptcy: Gross income, $22,800--\ngross; reported expenses, $20,592; total debt, $42,000, of which \nmiscellaneous debt--medical bills is about $10,000; unsecured debt, \ncredit card, about $23,000; and secured debt, a car, about $9,000.\n  Another thing I remembered from my days as a legal aid lawyer: Most \nof the people going into bankruptcy were women. It has not changed. As \nthe Time magazine article points out, 497,000 single women filed for \nbankruptcy last year compared to only single 367,000 men.\n  What are the reasons? Because of a job loss, 51 percent; 46 percent \nbecause of medical reasons; 19 percent because of a family breakup. The \nreason that adds up to more than 100 percent is that people said: I \nlost my job and my family broke up. That is why most people are going \ninto bankruptcy court today, not because they have been living high on \nthe hog and they are out there trying to get away.\n  We heard statements made on the floor that bankruptcy is not as \nshameful as it used to be. I beg to differ. Most of the people who go \ninto bankruptcy court are embarrassed, they are ashamed. I remember \nthem from my days as a legal aid lawyer. They fell on hard times, the \ninterest charges keep piling up and piling up, and they could never get \nahead of it. They have kids to care for, and they have expenses they \nhave to keep up just to take care of their families. That is who is \ngoing into bankruptcy court. It is not because of living high on the \nhog.\n\n  The real deviousness of the expected final version of the bill, what \nis really bad, is, for example, as Time magazine pointed out, an \nindividual who had made millions of dollars sort of scamming the system \non investments--Villa, his name is. James Villa is a 42-year-old one-\ntime stockholder who lives in a $1.4 million home in Boca Raton. They \ncontrasted him to 73-year-old Allen Smith, a retired autoworker with \nthroat cancer who lives in an $80,000 home in Wilmington, DE.\n  They go through the whole story. I do not have the time. You can read \nit. But Villa profited handsomely, he bought Ferraris, he bought a \n$22,000 Rolex watch for his wife, a 3-carat $44,000 wedding ring, \n$9,000 diamond earrings. In October 1988, Massachusetts securities \nauthorities ruled he had been engaging in fraudulent and unethical \npractices. They revoked their broker-dealer registration. He packs up, \nmoves to Florida, takes his money, and buys this huge $1.4 million \nhouse. Guess what. It is beyond the reach of his creditors thanks to \nthe homestead exemption in Florida.\n  How about 73-year-old Allen Smith of Wilmington, DE? He served in \nWorld War II, worked hard all his life as an auto mechanic, and, guess \nwhat. He lost his job, then his world started falling apart, and now he \nhas cancer. He has filed chapter 13, and now they can take his house \naway from him.\n  We stopped that abuse in the Senate version of the bill. But, \nunfortunately, I am told that the loophole filled provision in the \nHouse that will allow this practice to continue is likely to be in the \nfinal measure. This bill is bad, it is getting worse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do Senators Kennedy and Wellstone have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kennedy has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent I be yielded Senator Kennedy's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on \nthe floor this morning to talk about the bankruptcy bill. We need to \ntalk about this bill because what is now going on is that those who \ndesperately want to pass the bill are acting in secret to try to avoid \nthe public scrutiny that might lead to some changes in the bill that \nwill benefit average people.\n  The latest rumor is that the bankruptcy bill's sponsors want to \ncombine it with the ``e-signature'' bill and a bill that has never even \nbeen considered on the Senate floor--the bill to increase the number of \nH-1b visas--and bring it to us as a package. Supposedly this will make \nit more appealing to some people who oppose one or another of those \nbills. But I think combining major pieces of legislation in a package \nlike this just makes things worse. We are talking here about doing an \nend run around the legislative process simply to get things done for a \nnarrow set of special interests. I think that's a disgrace and I hope \nmy colleagues will resist it.\n  This is a bill that gets worse the more you look at it. I am \ndisturbed by reports that the final bill will look more like the House-\npassed bill than the bill that passed the Senate. But it does not \nsurprise me that this is happening, since a bill that is worked out \nbehind closed doors is much more likely to favor powerful financial \ninterests. A public process generally serves the public interest. So no \none should be shocked that the private process that the bill's \nproponents have been following is going to yield a bill that leaves the \npublic behind.\n  I commend to all my colleagues a major investigative story in the May \n15th issue of Time Magazine by reporters Donald Bartlett and James \nSteele. Bartlett and Steele have done a masterful job in explaining how \nbankruptcy reform legislation ended up being a wish list for the credit \ncard industry. Even more important, they show us the kinds of people \nwho will be hurt by this bill--honest debtors who are down on their \nluck, forced into bankruptcy by the loss of a job or divorce or \ncatastrophic medical bills. The bill is particularly detrimental to the \ninterests of women. They constitute the largest segment of bankruptcy \nfilers in 1999. These are the people that this bill turns its back on, \nat the same time that it gives the credit card industry virtually \neverything that it asked for.\n\n  Now I don't deny that there is need for some reform in our nation's \nbankruptcy laws. But what happened with this bill is that when monied \ninterests were given an inch to correct some abuses they took a mile. \nOne area that I devoted a lot of time to on the Senate floor was the \ntreatment of tenants under this bill. The landlord-tenant provision of \nthis bill is typical of the sledgehammer approach that the bill takes \nto alleged abuses by people declaring bankruptcy.\n  It started with stories of people repeatedly filing for bankruptcy in \norder to avoid paying rent. But to address that situation a provision \nwas inserted in the bill that completely eliminates the protection of \nthe automatic stay for tenants in bankruptcy. And when I suggested in \nan amendment that tenants who had never before filed for bankruptcy and \nwere willing to pay their rent during the bankruptcy proceedings should \nbe protected from being thrown out on the street, the proponents of \nthis bill said no. The National Association of Realtors and other \ngroups representing landlords adamantly opposed any weakening of the \nextreme provision in the bill. And they got their way.\n  That is the kind of excess that you get in legislation when one side \nis dumping money into the process and the other side is not or cannot. \nCommon Cause just put out a stunning report recently on the amount of \nmoney that the credit industry has contributed to members of Congress \nand the political parties in recent years. $7.5 million in 1999 alone, \nand $23.4 million\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nin just the last three years. One company that has been particularly \ngenerous is MBNA Corporation, one of the largest issuers of credit \ncards in the country. In 1998, MBNA gave a $200,000 soft money \ncontribution to the Republican Senatorial Committee on the very day \nthat the House passed the conference report and sent it to the Senate.\n  This year, MBNA gave its first large soft money contribution ever to \nthe Democratic party--it gave $150,000 to the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee on December 22, 1999, right in the middle of Senate \nfloor consideration of the bill.\n  So it is no mystery to me why this bill is so anti-consumer, and I \ndon't think it's a mystery to the public either. The bill contains \nprecious little to address abuses by creditors in debt collection and \nreaffirmation practices, and it contains very weak credit card \ndisclosure provisions. The credit card industry has ridden the rise in \npersonal bankruptcies to get the changes in the law that it wants, but \nhas resisted efforts to inform consumers of the risks of overuse of \ncredit cards. Better disclosure might reduce the number of bankruptcy \nfilings in this country, but the credit industry has successfully \nprevented the Congress from requiring such disclosure.\n  There is still time to step back from the brink. Nonpartisan experts \nhave many recommendations to reform the bankruptcy laws in a balanced \nand fair way to get at the abuses, without causing undeserved misery to \nthousands of powerless and defenseless Americans. Let's listen to them \nrather than the credit card issuers who are lining our campaign \ntreasuries.\n  I again thank the Senators from Massachusetts, Minnesota and Iowa and \nmy other colleagues who are here this morning to call attention to this \ncrucial issue, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Delaware \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3970-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3970-S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPREME COURT DECISION IN U.S. v. MORRISON\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I attended the Million Mom March with my \nwife. I do not think anyone should misunderstand the significance and \nconsequence of so many mothers and a number of fathers giving up \nMother's Day to make an important point. These were not a bunch of wild \nradicals. These were a bunch of moms from rural areas, inner cities, \nand suburban areas. They were black, they were white, Hispanic, Asian \nAmerican. They were basically making a plea. As I stood there and \nlistened, I was reminded of a quote attributed to John Locke speaking \nabout someone he heard. He said:\n\n       He spoke words that wept and shed tears that spoke.\n\n  I do not know how anyone could have attended any significant portion \nof that march and not felt, as John Locke felt, listening to the words \nthese women spoke that wept and the tears they shed that spoke volumes \nabout the insanity of our policy.\n  Irony of all ironies; the next day, on Monday, the Supreme Court \nhands down a decision, not about guns but about the protection and \nempowerment of women in society. Yesterday, in United States v. \nMorrison, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of an act that I \nspent 8 years writing and attempting to pass--six of which were in \nearnest--the so-called Violence Against Women Act. There is one \nprovision of that act they struck down and only one provision. That is \nthe provision that empowered women to take up their cause in Federal \ncourt to make the case they were a victim of sexual abuse because, and \nonly because, of their gender and to sue their attacker for civil \ndamages in Federal court; empowering women to not have to rely on the \nprosecutorial system or anyone else to vindicate the wrong that had \nbeen done to them if they can supply the proof.\n  As the author of that act, I must tell my colleagues that I was \ndisappointed by the Court's decision but, quite frankly, not surprised \nby it.\n  I emphasize, though, the Morrison case struck down the civil rights \ncause of action women have in Federal court, no other part of the act. \nNothing in the Court's decision yesterday affects the validity of any \nother provision, any other program, or the need to reauthorize these \nprograms through my bill, the Violence Against Women Act II, which now \nhas 47 cosponsors.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the Court's ruling yesterday will have a \nsignificant impact on Congress' ability to respond to public needs in a \nway that has not been constrained since the 1930s. The Court has been \ninching toward this decision and this line of reasoning in case after \ncase over the last several years. The Court has grown bolder and bolder \nin stripping the Federal Government of the ability to make decisions on \nbehalf of the American people, part of the objectives of the Honorable \nChief Justice, who believes in the notion of devolution of power and \nthinks that the Federal Government should have significantly less \npower.\n  The Court's decision--and these have all been basically 5-4 \ndecisions--in United States v. Lopez in 1995 struck down the Gun-Free \nSchool Zones Act, a decision upon which the Court heavily relied in the \nMorrison case in striking down the civil rights remedy.\n  In the case of Boerne v. Flores, a 1997 case, the Court struck down \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Again, this is not mostly about \nwhat act they like and do not like; it is about Congress' power. Those \nwho thought we should not be dealing with guns were happy with the \nLopez case substantively. Those who thought we should have more \nreligious freedom in public places, our conservative friends--and I \nhappen to agree with them on that point--were disappointed when the \nSupreme Court reached in and said as to section 5 of the 14th \namendment, which is the provision which says the Congress shall \ndetermine how to enforce the 14th amendment, no, no, no, Congress is \nnot the one; we--the Court--are going to decide.\n\n  There, then, was another decision, the Supreme Court's watershed \ndecision in the Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, a 1996 decision, \nand the cases that followed, in which the Court limited Congress' \nability to authorize private citizens to vindicate Federal rights in \nlawsuits against their States, and that included the Fair Labor \nStandards Act and the Age Discrimination Act.\n  Putting it in simple terms, if the State of Florida discriminated \nagainst somebody in State employment because of age in violation of the \nFederal act, the Court said: Sorry, Florida has immunity. A Federal \nGovernment cannot protect all Americans against age discrimination \nbecause of a new and novel reading of the 11th amendment.\n  The Court's decision today is at peace with those rulings. \nFundamentally, this decision is about power. Who has the power, the \nCourt or the Congress, to determine whether or not a local activity, \nsuch as gender-motivated violence, has a substantial impact on \ninterstate commerce? Yesterday the Court said it: The Court has this \npower--echoes of 1920 and 1925 and 1928 and 1930, the so-called Lockner \nera.\n  I find it particularly striking the Court acknowledged in Morrison \nthat in contrast to the lack of congressional findings supporting the \nlaw struck down in Lopez, the civil rights remedy is supported by \nnumerous findings regarding the serious impact of gender-motivated \nviolence on interstate commerce. I conducted 4 years of hearings to \nmake that record.\n  We showed overwhelmingly that the loss of dollars to the economy of \nwomen being battered and abused and losing work is billions of dollars. \nWe showed overwhelmingly that women make decisions about whether to \nengage in a business that requires them to cross State lines based in \nsignificant part upon the degree to which they think they can be safe, \nbased upon a survey of 50 State laws, and whether or not they \nadequately protect women as they do men against violence.\n  The record is overwhelming. Nonetheless, instead of applying the rule \nthey had traditionally applied in determining whether Congress has the \nright to be involved in what is a local matter, they came up with a new \nstandard.\n  Instead of applying the old standard of: Is there a rational basis \nfor Congress to find, as they did, the traditional ``rational basis \nreview'' to decide whether Congress' findings in this case were \nrational--and I cannot conceive of how they concluded they could not \nbe--the Court simply disagreed with the\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nfindings, marking the first occasion in more than 60 years that the \nCourt has rejected explicit factual findings by the Congress, supported \nby a voluminous record. They, in fact, explicitly rejected the findings \nthat a given activity substantially affects interstate commerce.\n  The Court justified the abandonment of the deference to Congress by \ndeclaring that whether particular activities sufficiently affect \ninterstate commerce ``is ultimately a judicial rather than a \nlegislative question.''\n  I could not disagree more fundamentally with the Court's ruling. \nQuite frankly, this will affect the Violence Against Women Act less \nthan it is going to affect a whole lot of other things. The Supreme \nCourt precedents have long recognized that Congress has the power to \nlegislate with regard to local activities that, in the aggregate, have \na substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n  I personally believe Justice Souter, who wrote the principal dissent \nin this case, had it right when he explained that:\n\n       [t]he fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for \n     the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose \n     institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking \n     testimony far exceeds ours.\n\n  I am left wondering, where does the Court's decision leave Congress' \nformerly plenary power to remove serious obstructions to interstate \ncommerce, whatever their source?\n  It is reminiscent of the Lockner era when they said, by the way, you \nhave those labor standards having to do with mining--mining is not \ninterstate commerce. Then they came along and said production is not \ninterstate commerce. Then they said manufacturing is not interstate \ncommerce. Until midway in the New Deal, with the end of the Lockner \nera, they said: Woe, woe, woe; wait a minute, wait a minute.\n  Unfortunately, this decision yesterday reads more as a decision \nwritten in 1930 than in the year 2000.\n  As Justice Souter documented so well in his dissent, the Court \nappears to be returning to a type of categorical analysis of Congress' \npower under the Commerce Clause that characterized the pre-New Deal \nera, where, as I said, manufacturing, mining, and production were all \nheld to be off limits despite their obvious impact on interstate \ncommerce. Now it is a new standard: ``Economic activity'' versus \n``noneconomic activity.''\n  If Congress can regulate activity with substantial effects on \ninterstate commerce, then I, as Justices Souter and Breyer, do not \nunderstand what difference it makes whether the causes of those \nsubstantial effects on interstate commerce are in and of themselves \ncommercial.\n  In any event, suffice it to say that this type of formalistic, \nenclave analysis--where certain spheres of activity are held off limits \nto Congress--did not work in the 1930s and will work no better in the \n21st century.\n  Because it is impossible to develop judicially defined subject matter \ncategories spelling out in advance what is in Congress' Commerce Clause \npower and what is out, I believe the dissenting Justices are correct \nthat Congress, not the courts, must remain primarily responsible for \nstriking the right Federal-State balance, and that the Members of \nCongress are institutionally motivated to strike that balance by virtue \nof the fact that we represent our States and local interests as well as \nthe Federal interest.\n  So why has the Court revived the form of analysis that so ill-served \nthe Nation in the years leading up to the judicial crisis of 1937? \nAgain, I find Justice Souter's explanation convincing: In both eras, \nthe Court adopted these formalistic distinctions in interpreting the \nCommerce Clause in service of broader political theories shared by a \nmajority of the Court's members.\n  In the pre-New Deal era, that broader political theory was laissez \nfaire economics; now it is the new federalism. In both instances, the \nCourt has been eager to substitute its own judgment for that of the \npolitical branches democratically elected by the people to do their \nbusiness.\n  Those of you who are conservatives in this Congress, who say that \nyou, in fact, want the democratically elected bodies making these \ndecisions, I suggest to you that this is one of the most activist \nCourts we have had in 50 years. It is supplanting its judgment for the \ndemocratically elected branches of the Government.\n  So have at it, conservatives. This judicially active Court is \nsupplanting their judgment for the democratically elected bodies.\n  Justice Stevens put it bluntly in his recent dissent in the recent \nage discrimination case. He said: The Court's federalism decisions \nconstitute a ``judicial activism''--that is his quote, not mine--that \nis ``such a radical departure from the proper role of this Court that \nit should be opposed whenever an opportunity arises.''\n  This is one Senator who plans to keep up that opposition.\n  Stay tuned, folks, because what this upcoming election is about is \nthe future--the future--of the power of the elected branches of the \nGovernment versus the Court which is appointed for life. This is a \nconservative agenda that is being forced upon the democratically \nelected bodies, as it was in the 1920s. The next President is going to \nget to pick somewhere between one and three new Justices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a speech I made on the \nSupreme Court and its changing direction be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks By Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, \n                           Septmeber 17, 1999\n\n       Today marks the anniversary of an extraordinary event, the \n     212th anniversary of the birth of the Constitution of the \n     United States. On September 17, 1787, the Constitutional \n     Convention, its work complete, rose and submitted the \n     Constitution to the thirteen states for ratification. \n     Bringing together thirteen different states with diverse \n     cultures and established governments--some of these harking \n     back a hundred years--did not come easy. In 1775, at the time \n     of the Continental Congress, John Adams, writing to his wife, \n     Abigail, described: ``[f]ifty gentlemen meeting together all \n     strangers * * * not acquainted with each other's language, \n     ideas, views, designs. They are therefore jealous of each \n     other--fearful, timid, skittish.''\n       The men who attended that Constitutional Convention knew, \n     even then, that they had begun the greatest political \n     experiment in human history, producing a document that would \n     become an engine of change throughout the world. According to \n     James Madison's account, Governor Morris of Pennsylvania \n     stated that:\n       He came here as a Representative of America; he flattered \n     himself he came here in some degree as a Representative of \n     the whole human race; for the whole human race will be \n     affected by the proceedings of this Convention.\n       ``This Country,'' Governor Morris continued, must be \n     united. If persuasion does not unite it, the sword will. * * \n     * The scenes of horror attending civil commotion can not be \n     described. * * * The stronger party will then make [traitors] \n     of the weaker; and the Gallows & Halter will finish the work \n     of the sword.\n       The Framers, in their vision and wisdom, did unite the \n     country, fashioning a government that was both federal--that \n     is, comprised of sovereign states--and, at the same time, \n     truly national in power. The Framers respected and sustained \n     the essential role of the states. But, at the same time, the \n     Framers made national law supreme, a principle enshrined in \n     the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and created a \n     government empowered to bind both the states and individuals, \n     powers denied the government under the Articles of \n     Confederation.\n       The Constitution also established a vigorous and \n     independent presidency--what Alexander Hamilton in the \n     Federalist Papers called ``energy in the executive''--by \n     freeing the Chief Executive from selection by the legislature \n     and granting the President real and meaningful powers. As \n     early as McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall \n     in 1819 recognized the ``great powers'' the national \n     government possessed:\n       to lay and collect taxes; to borrow money; to regulate \n     commerce; to declare and conduct a war; and to raise and \n     support armies and navies. The sword and the purse, all the \n     external relations, and no inconsiderable portion of the \n     industry of the nation, are entrusted to its government.\n       And, on this 212th anniversary of the crafting of the \n     Constitution--a day and age now marked by national malaise \n     about and distrust of our government and its institutions--it \n     is only fitting to reflect on how right Governor Morris was \n     about how the Framers' creation has transformed--and \n     transfixed --the human race. Under this Constitution, we \n     settled a vast continent--from the Atlantic to the Pacific \n     coasts; we mobilized millions of men to unite the nation and \n     end slavery, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution; we \n     ascended, like the mythical phoenix, from the ashes of the \n     Great Depression; we turned back despotism and preserved a \n     free Europe in two World Wars; we won the Cold War; and we \n     now enjoy economic and military power unrivaled across the \n     globe and unmatched in the history of the world. No small \n     achievements, these.\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\n       These achievements make us the envy of the world. Just last \n     week, I returned from a trip to six European countries, \n     including Kosovo, and I met with six Presidents. The \n     President of Bulgaria said to me:\n       I know of no other country that has risked the lives of its \n     young men and women and would spend $15 billion dollars on \n     behalf of a place in which it has no economic interest, no \n     strategic interest, and no territorial interest--only an \n     interest in defending human rights.\n       Could we have achieved these successes without vigorous \n     presidential leadership? We owe our position in the world to \n     the choices made by the Framers at the Constitutional \n     Convention. Imagine accomplishing what we have in the two \n     centuries of our brief history without a strong federal \n     government and a strong president.\n       More than our achievements, though, it is our public \n     institutions that other nations seek to imitate. In every \n     place I traveled around the world last month, every one of \n     those six foreign Presidents talked about how they wanted to \n     mimic American governmental institutions--our Congress, our \n     President, our courts. They do not talk about our resources; \n     they do not talk about the American people themselves; they \n     talk about our institutions. It is these public \n     institutions--not a common ethnicity or religion, which, of \n     course, we do not share--that acts as the glue that binds \n     this country together.\n       But although other nations clamor to model their \n     institutions after ours, our own public discourse reflects a \n     deep and abiding angst about and suspicion of our government. \n     Last November, only 38 percent of Americans voted, a 50-year \n     low that ranks the United States at or near the bottom of the \n     world's democracies in voter participation. As of 1995, voter \n     turnout in 14 European countries, by contrast, was above 70 \n     percent.\n       And take Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward's recent \n     book, Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate, \n     which New York Times columnist Frank Rich recently nicknamed \n     ``All the Presidents Stink.'' Woodward's book puts between \n     two covers a cynicism about government that you can purchase \n     for fifty cents by picking up a daily newspaper, and for less \n     than that by turning on your television. A style of attack \n     and scandal journalism toward public officials dominates the \n     news media--and studies by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Dean of \n     the Annenburg School of Communication and her colleague \n     Joseph Cappella, have shown that cynical coverage breeds \n     cynical voter reactions.\n       It produces the kinds of expectations what were well \n     captured by Marvin Lucas, a 59-year-old custodial supervisor \n     at a college in Milledgeville, Georgia. Responding to a \n     Washington Post-Kaiser Foundation interviewer, Mr. Lucas said \n     ``I compare politicians with used car salesmen: say one \n     thing, do another.''\n       And the ``other thing'' that politicians do, of course, is \n     to feather their own nests and the nests of special interest \n     groups that support their reelection campaigns. That is the \n     dominant opinion people have of American elected officials. \n     If that is your starting point, it is no wonder that in 1994, \n     56 percent of Americans thought that government did more to \n     hinder their family's achieving the American dream than to \n     help them achieve it, while only 31 percent thought that \n     government helped them. (The numbers had improved by 1997, \n     but were still negative--47 percent to 38 percent).\n       Heaven knows that politicians are far from perfect, and our \n     own missteps and, yes, deceptions, contribute to the \n     country's cynical attitude. Some historians trace the \n     contemporary decline in faith in government to Lyndon \n     Johnson's 1964 Presidential campaign, where he pledged that \n     ``no American boy will fight a foreign war on a foreign soil \n     if I'm elected President.'' Within a year of that statement, \n     Johnson had ordered massive increases in draft calls and the \n     military build-up for the Vietnam War. Then Watergate cut \n     right to the heart of our faith in elected officials.\n       And today, highly negative campaigning has become an art \n     form, as each candidate tries to tag his opponent with being \n     an insider, or else being a corrupt person who just hasn't \n     had the chance to be corrupt on the inside yet. When Majority \n     Leader George Mitchell was retiring from the Senate, he \n     remarked to Jim Lehrer on the News Hour that so long as \n     campaigns consist of one candidate calling his opponent a \n     crook and the other calling his opponent a scoundrel, is it \n     any wonder that Americans believe that Congress is filled \n     with crooks and scoundrels?\n       So I don't want to understate the complexity of the sources \n     of contemporary cynicism and distrust toward elected \n     officials. What worries me, though, is that this cynicism and \n     distrust is way out of proportion to the actual \n     accomplishments of the federal government, and way out of \n     proportion to the sincerity and honesty with which my \n     colleagues conduct themselves every day in doing the \n     country's business.\n       This public cynicism is not the only current raging in \n     American politics today, however. There is a movement among \n     intellectuals, historians, and political scientists to shift \n     the locus of political power, or to ``devolve power,'' from \n     the national government to the states. George Will, one of \n     the champions of this ``devolution of power'' movement, \n     explained its premise as follows:\n       [I]t is unwholesome that Washington, like Caesar, has grown \n     so great. Power should flow back to where it came from and \n     belongs, back to the people and their state governments, back \n     to state capitals * * *\n       This is nothing less than a fight for the heart and soul of \n     America. This is a fight about power. And it is a fight about \n     who will be left in charge.\n       In my view, the value of devolution of power from the \n     national government to the states can be overstated. \n     Certainly the abuse of power, whenever it occurs, must be \n     checked. The federal government admittedly does tend to grab \n     power for itself without due regard for whether its goals can \n     better be achieved at the local level. But the state and \n     local governments, in contrast, tend toward parochialism \n     without due regard for the national interest. Thus, \n     devolution of power is not per se a good thing. At whatever \n     level of government, it all depends how that power is used.\n       It cannot be that the Framers intended to hamstring the \n     federal government in favor of the states. If that was their \n     intent, why abandon the Articles of Confederation? And just \n     try to imagine the United States attaining its successes to \n     date without a strong national government and a vigorous \n     President. To go one step further--imagine how difficult it \n     will be to fortify our position in the world in the 21st \n     century without a powerful central government.\n       The current cynicism about our public institutions, it \n     seems to me, is also beginning to gain a foothold in the \n     constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court, and that is \n     also of concern to me, and is something I would like to spend \n     the next few minutes discussing with you. Now first I want to \n     say that today's Supreme Court is the best-informed, hardest \n     working Court we have ever had. In particular, I want to \n     commend Justice Souter, a native son of this great state of \n     New Hampshire, for writing several of the most scholarly and \n     persuasive dissents this Court has seen in recent years--\n     dissents that I am confident will prove prophetic.\n       Yet the Supreme Court of today embodies both strands of the \n     phenomenon now plaguing our American culture--both the public \n     cynicism about, and the intellectual disdain for, our \n     national government. The Court is sharply critical of the \n     political branches of our federal government, accusing them \n     in case after case this decade of arrogating power to \n     themselves at the expense of state governments. But in \n     assuming the role of ``Chief Protector'' of the allocation of \n     power between the federal government and the states, the \n     Supreme Court of late has regrettably adopted a court-\n     centered view of the scope of federal power. In doing so, it \n     has arrogated to itself a responsibility that more properly \n     befits the political branches.\n       In my opinion, we have in the past eight years or so begun \n     to see a series of opinions in which the Supreme Court has \n     become bolder and bolder in stripping the federal government \n     of the ability to make decisions on behalf of the American \n     people. So far, the immediate effects of these decisions are \n     real, but relatively modest. They may represent marginal \n     readjustments in the allocation of power under \n     the Constitution. On the other hand, if I am right and the \n     jurisprudence is being driven by an oversized sense of \n     distrust and cynicism toward democratically elected \n     government--and especially toward the federal government--\n     the decisions could constitute the beginnings of a sea \n     change that could take us quite literally back to a style \n     of judicial imperialism unseen in this country since the \n     early 1930s.\n       The trio of cases decided by the Supreme Court at the very \n     end of the last Term are a prime example of this court-\n     centered view of federal power. For example, in its 5-4 \n     decision in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense \n     Board v. College Savings Bank, the Court held that Congress \n     had no power to subject the states to private patent \n     infringement suits in federal court because in the Court's \n     view, the statute was not ``appropriate'' legislation to \n     enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said no to patent \n     infringement cases against state entities because the Court--\n     not Congress--decided that legislation remedying patent \n     infringement by state entities was not really necessary. In \n     so deciding, the Court made a quintessentially legislative \n     judgment.\n       To the same effect was the companion case, College Savings \n     Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense \n     Board, in which the Court dismissed out of hand Congress' \n     effort to hold state entities accountable to private parties \n     for misrepresenting the states' commercial products in \n     violation of federal trademark law, because the Court decided \n     that the statute did not protect ``property rights'' within \n     the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       The two Florida Prepaid decisions unfortunately flow \n     directly from City of Boerne v. Flores, in which the Court in \n     1997 struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as \n     also exceeding Congress' authority under section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. In ruling that Congress had gone too \n     far in protecting religious liberty, the Court in essence \n     held that Congress had not done its homework to the Court's \n     satisfaction. The Court attacked the legislative record as \n     lacking what it considered to be sufficient modern instances \n     of religious bigotry and found that the statute was ``out of \n     proportion'' to its supposed remedial or preventive objects. \n     Again, the Court in effect decided that a law simply was not \n     really necessary.\n       Implicit in the Court's obvious willingness in Boerne to \n     second-guess Congress' legislative judgment in the name of \n     protecting\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\n     state governments is the notion that it is for the Supreme \n     Court, and not Congress, to specify the meaning of the \n     provisions of the Constitution, even when Congress claims to \n     enforce the individual liberties protected by the Fourteenth \n     Amendment.\n       It is as if the Court has forgotten that the only \n     institution mentioned in section 5 of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment is Congress. The text of section 5 is clear and \n     simple: ``The Congress shall have power to enforce, by \n     appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.'' It \n     was for Congress, not the courts, to be the primary guarantor \n     of individual rights as against oppression by state \n     authorities, and for Congress, not the courts, to assess \n     whether and what legislation is needed for that purpose. \n     Remember that the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in the \n     long shadow of the Dred Scott decision. The court-centered \n     view the Court has since taken of that amendment is directly \n     at odds with the universal sentiment at the time of its \n     adoption that it was our federal legislature, not the courts, \n     that could best be trusted to police the states.\n       What seems to lie at the heart of the headline-grabbing \n     cases of the past few terms is the Court's willingness to \n     disregard the views of Congress in favor of its own. It is as \n     if the Court believes that it has a better sense of the \n     economic and other real-world implications of the laws \n     Congress passes than do those elected by the people to serve \n     in that branch.\n       The Court's recent decisions contain troubling echoes from \n     the New Deal era, when the Supreme Court was swift to \n     substitute its own judgment of what was desirable economic \n     legislation for that of Congress and the President. Here is \n     just one illustration from that bygone era: In Railroad \n     Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co., the Court in 1935 \n     struck down the Railroad Retirement Act as unconstitutional, \n     in part because the Court concluded that it was not a valid \n     regulation of interstate commerce. Congress enacted the \n     statute, which established a compulsory retirement and \n     pension system for all railroad carriers, to promote \n     ``efficiency and safety in interstate transportation'' both \n     by reducing the aging population of employees and by \n     improving the employees' sense of security and morale. In its \n     opinion, the Court stated, however: ``We cannot agree that \n     these ends * * * encourage loyalty and continuity of \n     service.'' We cannot agree. That is a breathtaking \n     statement by a court which had abandoned its proper role. \n     We cannot agree?\n       And in denying Congress what Justice Breyer in dissent has \n     called ``necessary legislative flexibility,'' such as to \n     create, for example, ``a decentralized system of individual \n     private remedies,'' the Court has returned to the kind of \n     court-centered conception of federal power that typified not \n     only the New Deal era, but the Lochner era as well. As \n     Justice Souter predicted in his Alden v. Maine dissent \n     lamenting the Court's sovereign immunity decisions:\n       The resemblance of today's state sovereign immunity to the \n     Lochner era's industrial due process is striking. The Court \n     began this century by imputing immutable constitutional \n     status to a conception of economic self-reliance that was \n     never true to industrial life and grew insistently fictional \n     with the years, and the Court has chosen to close the century \n     by conferring like status on a conception of state sovereign \n     immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structure \n     of the Constitution. I expect the Court's latest essay into \n     immunity doctrine will prove the equal of its earlier \n     experiment in laissez-faire, the one being as unrealistic as \n     the other, as indefensible, and probably as fleeting.\n       (Justice Souter, I sincerely hope that you are correct when \n     you said ``probably as fleeting'' because if you are wrong, \n     and the Court's pronouncements endure, then I am afraid that \n     the country is in bigger trouble than I thought.)\n       Don't misunderstand me. I do not mean for a second to \n     disparage the role of the states. The states play a critical \n     part in warding off tyranny by the national government and in \n     performing all the fundamental functions with which the \n     governments closest to the people are charged. Certainly \n     those of you who live in this great state of New Hampshire--\n     whose motto is ``Live Free or Die''--understand that better \n     than anyone else. As James Madison wrote in the Federalist \n     Papers:\n       The powers reserved to the several States will extend to \n     all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, \n     concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, \n     and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the \n     State.\n       But we should think long and hard before allowing one \n     branch of our government--the federal judiciary--to cripple \n     its co-equal branches, the political branches, of government. \n     To do so is to put in jeopardy all that we have accomplished \n     in our brief history and all that we may do in the future.\n       I must tell you that I am gravely concerned about the \n     direction the Court is headed. I have a particular stake in \n     this which I will confess now and that is the fate of the \n     civil rights remedy created by the Violence Against Women Act \n     of 1994, which I wrote. Earlier this year, the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated the civil rights \n     remedy in Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State \n     University, and the case may come before the Supreme Court in \n     the coming Term if the Court grants review.\n       The civil rights remedy creates a new federal cause of \n     action allowing a victim of gender-motivated violence to sue \n     her attacker in court. I believe--indeed, I know--that \n     violence against women restricts the participation of women \n     in the national economy, inhibits their production and \n     consumption of goods and services in interstate commerce, and \n     obstructs their ability to work and travel freely. In short, \n     violence against women was, and is, a national problem of \n     epic proportions that substantially and adversely affects \n     interstate commerce. A massive legislative record compiled \n     after four years of fact-finding hearings in Congress \n     irrefutably confirms the impact of violence against women on \n     the national economy and interstate commerce.\n       When we enacted the Violence Against Women Act civil rights \n     remedy in 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee explicitly \n     found that the provision satisfied the ``modest threshold'' \n     required by the Commerce Clause, and we in Congress were \n     confident of the statute's constitutionality. The civil \n     rights remedy quite appropriately attempted to remove an \n     obstruction to interstate commerce, much as the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964 barred race discrimination in hotels and \n     restaurants because such discrimination, as the Court put it \n     in upholding the statute, ``imposed `an artificial \n     restriction on the market.' ''\n       But less than a year after we enacted the Violence Against \n     Women Act and its civil rights remedy, the Supreme Court \n     decided United States v. Lopez and invalidated, as beyond \n     Congress' Commerce Clause authority, the Gun-Free School \n     Zones Act, which prohibited the possession of a firearm \n     within 1000 feet of a school. In the wake of Lopez, I find \n     myself asking: Will this Court accept the congressional \n     judgment that violence against women adversely affects the \n     national economy? Or will this Court second-guess the remedy \n     we chose to address that effect?\n       Ironically, the Court may find itself the champion of \n     states' rights that the states do not even want. Just as with \n     the Patent Remedy Act, where no state testified in favor of \n     immunity from private patent infringement actions, the vast \n     majority of states strongly favor the Violence Against Women \n     Act civil rights remedy. Forty-one state attorneys general \n     wrote to Congress in favor of the statute, including the \n     civil rights remedy, before its enactment. Only a few weeks \n     ago, 33 Attorneys General submitted an amicus brief to the \n     Supreme Court asking the Court to grant the petition for \n     certiorari and uphold the statute because the states ``agree \n     with Congress that gender-based violence substantially \n     affects interstate commerce and the States cannot address \n     this problem adequately by themselves.''\n       I also fear that the Supreme Court's readiness to disregard \n     the people's judgment has served as a clarion call to the \n     federal courts to usher in what Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has called the \n     ``Constitution in Exile.'' According to Judge Ginsburg, the \n     doctrine of enumerated powers, the nondelegation doctrine, \n     the Necessary and Proper, Contracts, Takings, and Commerce \n     clauses, had become ``ancient exiles, banished for standing \n     in opposition to unlimited government.''\n       In service of this ``Constitution-in-Exile,'' the lower \n     courts have begun to read the Constitution in a revolutionary \n     way. Thus, a district court in Alabama decided, remarkably, \n     that the Superfund amendments were unconstitutional because \n     they did not regulate interstate commerce, a decision later \n     reversed on appeal. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit's ruling \n     striking down the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against \n     Women Act transforms Lopez v. United States from an important \n     reminder that Congress' commerce power is not without limits, \n     into what is arguably the most momentous decision of the last \n     fifty years regarding the scope of federal power.\n       That same court of appeals has tightened the noose in yet \n     another way. The Fourth Circuit ruled last year in Condon v. \n     Reno, a case now under review by the Supreme Court, that \n     Congress may not pass a law when that law applies only to the \n     states, and not also to private individuals. In other words, \n     Congress may not require the states to comply with federal \n     law if the law does not also affect private individuals.\n       The jury is still out on whether the Supreme Court will let \n     the other shoe drop and sustain these additional restrictions \n     on federal power, but the Court seems primed and poised to do \n     so. Much hangs in the balance. If your eyes glaze over when I \n     speak about Congress authorizing private actions for patent \n     infringement or trademark violations by state entities, then \n     think about the Fair Labor Standards Act, which the Court \n     held last June in Alden v. Maine could not be enforced \n     against noncompliant states by state employees seeking \n     backpay. How far we have come from the Framers' vision of a \n     federal government strong enough and flexible enough to do \n     the people's business. As Justice Souter observed in his \n     dissent in Alden v. Maine:\n       Had the question been posed, state sovereign immunity could \n     not have been thought to shield a State from suit under \n     federal law on a subject committed to national jurisdiction \n     by Article I of the Constitution.\n       Other cases could potentially serve as a resounding wake-up \n     call as to the extent to which the federal government's hands \n     have been tied in addressing problems of national import. In \n     the coming Term, the Court will take up the question whether \n     the Congress had the power in the Age Discrimination in\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n     Employment Act to authorize private law suits against state \n     violators. A case raising a similar issue with respect to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act is sure to follow. And if the \n     Court says no, private individuals who suffer age, \n     disability, and other forms of discrimination at the hands \n     of state actors will have few means at their disposal to \n     enforce their rights under federal law, and the federal \n     government will rarely be able to help them.\n       The Court left open the possibility that the federal \n     government could sue noncompliant states, but if you think \n     that it is realistic for the federal government to come to \n     the rescue by going into court on a regular basis to \n     vindicate the federal rights of private individuals, think \n     again. I do not see a massive expansion of the federal \n     litigating corps happening any time soon. Nor do I see how \n     that could be anything but self-defeating if the goal is to \n     minimize the federal intrusion into state government affairs. \n     By elevating the states' sovereign immunity to an immutable \n     principle of constitutional law, the Court, as Justice Breyer \n     recognized in his College Savings Bank dissent: ``makes it \n     more difficult for Congress to decentralize governmental \n     decisionmaking and to provide individual citizens, or local \n     communities, with a variety of enforcement powers. By \n     diminishing congressional flexibility to do so, the Court \n     makes it somewhat more difficult to satisfy modern \n     federalism's more important liberty-protecting needs. In this \n     sense, it is counterproductive.''\n       Now don't get me wrong. Sometimes the federal and state \n     governments do not get their relationship quite right. We do \n     not have infallible institutions. But when the Supreme Court \n     restricts the flexibility of Congress to decide how best to \n     address national problems within the scope of its enumerated \n     powers, the Court truncates the learning process otherwise \n     underway in our political institutions--a result a \n     conservative court--conservative with a small ``c''--should \n     hesitate to effect.\n       The Court has imposed by fiat limitations on the exercise \n     of federal power that might very well have come about without \n     the Court's interference. In other words, the Court in Garcia \n     v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority got it right \n     when, in 1985, it overruled National League of Cities v. \n     Usery, a case decided a decade earlier, that had restricted \n     the federal government's power to regulate the states ``in \n     areas of traditional governmental functions.'' Instead, the \n     Court announced in Garcia that the political process, not the \n     Court, should serve as the principal check on federal \n     overreaching. I must disagree with the notion that leaving it \n     to Congress and the President is like leaving the fox to \n     guard the chicken coop, or as Justice O'Connor put it in her \n     dissent in Garcia, like leaving the ``essentials of state \n     sovereignty'' to Congress' ``underdeveloped capacity for \n     self-restraint.''\n       The Violence Against Women Act civil rights remedy is a \n     good example of Congress' developing capacity for self-\n     restraint. At the outset, those most concerned about domestic \n     violence and rape wanted a statute with a broad sweep, and so \n     we started out by introducing a provision in 1990 that \n     arguably would have federalized a significant portion of \n     state laws against domestic violence and rape. But the \n     Conference of Chief Justices of State Supreme Courts, the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States--and Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist, in particular--pointed out to Congress, while the \n     bill was under consideration, that the civil rights provision \n     might significantly interfere with the states' handling of \n     domestic relations and rape cases, while at the same time, \n     overburdening the federal courts. The federal and state \n     judiciaries raised the concern, we examined it, and we \n     decided that they were right. Congress then carefully \n     redrafted the civil rights remedy so that it would not have \n     that effect.\n       There are other recent examples--such as the Unfunded \n     Mandates Act--that came about because the states complained \n     to Congress that we were forcing them to use their tax \n     dollars to do whatever we mandated in Washington. The states \n     staged a mini-rebellion. So Congress wrote a new law \n     requiring federal restraint. And for that, I must give my \n     Republican colleagues their due.\n       But when the Supreme Court plays traffic cop on the streets \n     of federalism, the Court does our country a disservice by \n     cutting this national political dialogue short. We are \n     already reaching many of the conclusions the Court has now \n     cemented into the Constitution. James Madison wrote in the \n     Federalist Papers that the new federal government would be \n     sufficiently national and local in spirit as ``to be \n     disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or \n     the prerogatives of their governments.'' Our political \n     institutions can be trusted. The Framers understood this.\n       In short, the disconnect between our public and cultural \n     perceptions of our institutions and reality is stunning. Keep \n     in mind that the rest of the world is struggling to \n     emulate our institutions because they believe it is our \n     institutions that separate us from other nations--indeed, \n     from other democracies--and are the bedrock upon which our \n     successes are founded.\n       Yet our public discourse, our legal opinions, our very \n     culture, are compelling us to overlook or scorn our own \n     accomplishments. We are losing, as a nation, the communal \n     notion that our strength lies in our institutions. \n     Relentlessly accentuating the negative when it comes to our \n     political institutions, however, eclipses our considerable \n     successes. And this predilection to distrust the political \n     branches now seems to be shared equally by the judicial \n     branch, not only when it comes time to decide how to \n     distribute power between the federal government and the \n     states, but also when it comes to making a judgment of what \n     is in the best interests of Americans.\n       I talked to you tonight about cynicism, devolution of \n     power, and how we got here. In my view, all of that can be \n     overcome by the right leadership, the right people in power, \n     who will recharge the public's imagination and confidence. \n     The public mood can be transformed in an election, a single \n     cycle. Maybe it will take a generation. But it can be \n     changed. Elected officials who cater too much or too little \n     to state interests can be voted out of office. But if the \n     Supreme Court chisels into stone new constitutional \n     restrictions on federal power, new hoops through which \n     Congress must leap, where will we be then? You cannot go to \n     the polls to undo a constitutional ruling of the Supreme \n     Court. There is no further appeal--no appeal to a higher \n     court, no appeal to the voters. Nothing short of a new \n     constitutional convention or an amendment to the \n     Constitution--and you know how easy that is--or will do. \n     James Madison was right: trust the political process. ``WE \n     CANNOT AGREE''? Please.\n       Let me conclude by making the following simple point: if, \n     at the federal level, we are such a failure institutionally, \n     why does the rest of the world look to us to copy our \n     supposed frailties? If we are such a failure--with our last \n     six Presidents supposedly flops--how is that our incomes are \n     actually growing, crime is going down, drug use is down, and \n     our economy is in better shape than that of any nation in the \n     history of the world? How did we produce a nation willing and \n     able, as the President of Bulgaria pointed out, to spend \n     billions of dollars and risk the lives of its men and women \n     to advance the cause of human rights? Did it happen by \n     chance? Did it happen by accident? It happened as a direct \n     result of our unique political institutions.\n       The Framers set out to create a centralized government \n     robust enough to deal with national problems, but with built-\n     in guarantees that it be respectful of, and sensitive to, \n     local concerns. There is an inherent tension in the document. \n     But look at the sweep of history: as the balance of power has \n     shifted back and forth between the national government and \n     the states, our resilient political branches have adjusted \n     and responded. The rest of the world gets it.\n       We must remember that politics--and politicians--are not \n     the enemy. The Constitutional Convention was composed of men \n     who were regarded as gifted even in their own day. As the \n     French charge d'affaires wrote to his government as the \n     Convention convened:\n       If all the delegates named for this Convention at \n     Philadelphia are present, we will never have seen, even in \n     Europe, an assembly more respectable for the talents, \n     knowledge, disinterestedness, and patriotism of those who \n     compose it.\n       Above all else, these men were politicians. And I am not \n     suggesting by this that our government today boasts the likes \n     of a Jefferson or a Madison, but I am suggesting that we have \n     fine and decent men and women with significant capabilities \n     who choose public service. And some of you are among them.\n       The hostility we see from the Supreme Court toward the \n     elected branches of government is the same suspicion we see \n     in the eyes of the ordinary person on the street. \n     ``Politics'' has become a dirty word. But as those of you \n     here who live in this state of strong local community \n     governments and town hall meetings, know better than anyone, \n     ``politics'' is fundamental to how we govern ourselves in a \n     democracy. At the end of the day, politics is the only way a \n     community can govern itself and realize its goals without the \n     sword.\n       So I stand before you today, on this 212th anniversary of \n     the completion of the work of the Constitutional Convention, \n     ready and willing to defend politics--even national politics. \n     It was what those 50 gentlemen, all strangers, who met 212 \n     years ago defended and vindicated. And it is what, in the \n     end, has made and will continue to make us secure and strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3974-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I note on the floor with me this \nafternoon is Senator Bingaman. We are both here to speak about the \ndisaster and catastrophe that has occurred in New Mexico. I would like \nto speak maybe for 5 or 6 minutes, then yield to my colleague, and then \ncome back and do a little more.\n  During my time in the Senate, which is now approaching 28 years, I \nvividly remember coming down and hearing Senators have to tell the \nSenate about a disaster of significant proportions in their home State. \nThe Senator wanted to tell us about how bad things were and lay the \ngroundwork for the Congress, the Government of the United States, to do \nwhat it must to help those who are victims in a disaster.\n  To tell you the truth, I have been to Los Alamos, oh, so many times \nover the last 28 years. Most of them have been very joyous occasions, \nwhen we met with some of the greatest scientists in the world, talked \nabout some fantastic science, met some wonderful people, and saw a \nbeautiful town up there in the mountains. It came into being when the \nUnited States of America decided a former boys' academy up there in the \nmountains would be the center around which we would develop our first \natomic weapons. It was a closed city for a long time but a beautiful \nplace.\n  Sure enough, never did I expect to see what I saw last Thursday when \nSenator Bingaman and I, the Secretary of Energy, and James Lee Witt, \nthe head of our emergency disaster relief agency for the United States, \nand others flew out there. Then we helicoptered around. Then we drove \nthe streets to see what was occurring.\n  Senator Bingaman took a little different tour than I. He saw some of \nthe housing. I saw where they set up the headquarters to manage and \noperate things. So he will have some very vivid recollections of what \nhe saw, of houses burned to the ground.\n  Essentially, it is, indeed, a very sad day when probably one of the \ngreatest laboratories human beings have ever set up--in terms of great \nscience, not just because of great buildings but because great \nscientists have lived there and worked--is surrounded by flames. Many \npeople supported those most talented of Americans--and even some of our \ngreatest friends from other countries have been there as part of \nAmerica's research in atomic and nuclear weapons safety, \nresponsibility, and reliability--to go there and see a ghost town as \nyou drive the streets, with smoke on one side, fire on one side, a \nhouse burned down, your heart kind of goes out. A great deal of empathy \npours from you.\n  We are very lucky, the Senate should know; even though over 44,000 \nacres have burned, something like 400 housing units have burned to the \nground, and upwards of 25,000 people have been evacuated--many are \nreturning now. Damage and fire are still going in some of the canyons--\nbut, we are very grateful that in the canyons that are still burning \nthere are not very many housing units in the path. The forest is still \nburning and will burn for a long time. Yet nobody died, nobody got \nseriously hurt. Two or three firemen were injured, as I understand it, \nand none of those was serious.\n  The fire is now no longer threatening the houses of the city of Los \nAlamos or of White Rock, the adjoining community. In some very \nmiraculous way, none of the big administrative and research buildings \nof the laboratory was hit by this fire. It went around them and got \nsome housing subdivisions, but only a few buildings of minor \nsignificance that are part of this enormous science complex were \nburned.\n  The houses that burned, burned right to the ground. All that is left \nis cement foundations, as Senator Bingaman will describe and perhaps \nshow some pictures. If there were houses that had cars in the front \nyards, the cars were burned to a crisp. The metal is twisted and \nburned. In some places, you can see an icebox that is hanging over the \nvacuum that used to be sheltered by walls and roofs. The icebox just \nmelted. It is no longer even noticeable. You cannot recognize it as \nbeing such. It is melted and completely different in form.\n\n  Essentially, all this was going on right around and close to a \nlaboratory that does an awful lot of nuclear work, that has some \ncompounds that are housed in cement bunkers so nothing can happen to \nthem. And, sure enough, to this day there has been no radioactivity \nescape from any of these buildings and/or research facilities.\n  That is not just the Federal Government saying it. The New Mexico \nenvironmental department has monitored this. The greatest and best \nmonitors from around the country are located there, and the ambient air \nmonitors have indicated there is no radioactivity in the air. So now we \nhave to start back up the path of trying to see how we can rebuild the \nlives of people there.\n  I am not going to go into detail other than to say we are beginning \nto move in the right direction. The laboratory personnel will begin to \nmove in and see what is needed. In one of the communities, people are \ncoming back. Parts of Los Alamos will be reoccupied soon. But I am sure \nSenator Bingaman and I will be asking the Senate, from time to time, to \nassist us, either with legislation that will direct how this should be \nhandled, or certainly with money that will make the repairs and bring \nthis facility back to where maybe we could say we will make it as whole \nas possible.\n  I want to close my first few remarks, and then yield to my friend, \nSenator Bingaman, by saying that right next to this forest, which \nsurrounds Los Alamos, the Los Alamos property that belongs to the \nDepartment of Energy, is a national monument called Bandelier. It is \nrather renowned.\n  Both Senator Bingaman and I have had reason to work specifically for \nthings to preserve and make the Bandelier National Monument a great and \nbeautiful place. But it appears that in order to clear out that \nBandelier forest a bit, because so much growth had accumulated and \nbecause of so many fallen trees and other things, that a planned burn \ntook place. It looks as if\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nthat planned burn got out of hand. It further looks as if it maybe \nshould not have been started at all. I think the House passed a \nresolution today indicating that the U.S. Government is responsible for \nall these damages because of this controlled fire that got out of hand. \nSurely that will be looked at.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Senator \nMurkowski, with Senator Bingaman as ranking member, has asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to begin an investigation. The executive \nbranch has been rather forthcoming. They have told us, by Thursday \nevening, no later than Friday, they will give us, and I presume the \npeople of New Mexico, the country, and Los Alamos, the results of an \nevaluation by some of the Government's best experts on controlled fires \nand forest maintenance. They will tell us what they think went wrong.\n  At this point, I do not think there is any question that, at least--I \nstart with the proposition, and I am certain Senator Bingaman will \naddress the same issue--we are responsible to make that community \nwhole, to make those individual residents who lost their homes and lost \ntheir property whole, and whatever expenditures have been incurred by \nthe people and by the community that we, as a national Government, must \nmake them whole. I am not sure what that means. But it will not take us \nlong to find out.\n  In the meantime, I am very pleased that New Mexico's delegation is \ngoing to meet this afternoon. Hopefully, we will all be working \ntogether, the three House Members and the two Senators--Senator \nBingaman and myself--in an effort to bring before the Senate and the \nHouse the appropriate remedies and the appropriate resources that are \nneeded to do everything we can to make that community whole and make \nthe individuals who have been subject to this terrible disaster as \nwhole as possible.\n  I have additional remarks, about another forest fire occurring in \nanother part of New Mexico and about some of the heroes there. There \nwere heroes in other fires, too. But I yield to Senator Bingaman for \nhis comments, and then I will reclaim some time when he is finished.\n  I thank the Senate and the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici.\n  It is a pleasure to work with him in trying to solve some of these \nimminent problems that afflict our State. We hope very much we can do \nthat in an effective way, with the help of the rest of the Senate and \nthe rest of Congress.\n  Mr. President, on May 4, National Park Service officials set a fire \nin Bandelier National Monument to clear brush and deadwood that had \naccumulated in one corner of the monument, known as the Cerro Grande. \nWe all know now what happened next.\n  That fire became an uncontrollable wildfire as high winds fanned the \nflames over the next several days.\n  Its smoke plume stretched across New Mexico and into Texas and \nOklahoma--a plume that was visible from outer space.\n  The fire spread across the Santa Fe National Forest and torched the \nnorthern and western parts of the City of Los Alamos, destroying 260 \nhomes and other residential units that had housed over 400 families.\n  The fire has, as of yesterday evening, consumed over 44,000 acres. \nIts perimeter last night was 85 miles.\n  The City of Los Alamos and the neighboring community of White Rock \nevacuated a total of over 20,000 people. A voluntary evacuation of \n3,000 persons also took place in the next closest city, Espanola\n  The fire has damaged over 10 percent of the Santa Clara Pueblo Indian \nReservation, where 1,500 people live, and threatens both the water \nsupply and economic lifeline for that community.\n  On Saturday, President Clinton declared a Major Disaster in 12 New \nMexico counties, as a result of the Cerro Grande fire and wildfires in \nseveral other locations in the State.\n  This week, and perhaps next week as well, we will be considering \nappropriations bills that contain emergency supplemental spending for a \nvariety of disasters that have occurred over the past several months. I \nbelieve that it is important for the Senate to make some critical \nadjustments to these spending bills to mitigate the effects of the \nCerro Grande fire, and to prevent the occurrence of other catastrophic \nfires in the West this spring and summer.\n  As a first step, we should consider additional defense emergency \nspending to mitigate damage that has occurred at Los Alamos National \nLaboratory due to the fire. Thankfully, the laboratory was spared major \ndestruction. At the same time, the damage to the laboratory was not \nzero. A number of buildings and trailers were destroyed, and the fire \npointed up some systemic weaknesses in some of the laboratory's \nemergency and security systems that need to be addressed\n  Second, we need to deal with the aftermath of the destruction of \ndwellings for over 400 families in Los Alamos. The Administration and \nthe Congress needs to act quickly to make them whole for the \ndestruction of their homes and the loss of their belongings. I'm sure \nwe have all seen pictures that show the total loss suffered by many \nfamilies.\n  Making these Los Alamos community members and their families whole is \nnot simply a matter of fairness--the government, after all, set the \nfire that burned them out. What happens to the residents of the City of \nLos Alamos and the surrounding communities also affects our national \nsecurity.\n  The prime national security asset at Los Alamos, when you stop to \nthink about it, is not some scientific facility at the lab or a \nstockpile of some special nuclear material. The most important national \nsecurity asset at Los Alamos are the people who work there. It is their \nbrains, their special expertise, and their detailed knowledge of \nnuclear security issues that won the Cold War. Without the continuance \nof this human resource, the long-term future of our nuclear deterrent \nwill be in jeopardy, and we may find ourselves prone to unpleasant \nsurprises in a world where nuclear proliferation is still an important \nthreat.\n  If we do not act quickly to help the scientists and engineers at Los \nAlamos rebuild their lives there, some of them may take their insurance \nmoney and go to rebuild their lives in other places where they can find \nhigh-tech employment. That would be a terrible loss to this country's \nnational security. I believe that we have to especially worry about two \npopulations at the laboratory who may find it hardest to rebuild \nthere--the young scientists and engineers who have recently been hired \nat the lab, and the scientists and engineers who are nearing \nretirement.\n  The young scientist or engineer who has been at the laboratory for \nonly a few years has many other professional options in today's high-\ntech economy.\n  For most of them, working at Los Alamos pays considerably less than \nworking for the private sector. Many of these individuals may not be \nfully insured for their potential losses. If we face these younger \ninvestigators with a prolonged stay in temporary housing a substantial \ndistance from the laboratory, or if we ignore their uninsured losses, \nthey may wonder about our long-term commitment to their careers \nsupporting the nuclear security of this country. Already, there have \nbeen concerns that the recent attrition rate for these investigators \nhas been higher than the historical average.\n  Another population at risk for loss to the lab is typified by the \nsenior scientist or engineer who is close to retirement. It is hard for \nthese individuals to start all over again, when they face the prospect \nof a potential second starting-over when they retire in a few years. \nThese individuals are particularly needed over the next 4 to 5 years. \nThat is the time period during which we will have to make the \ntransition from a laboratory workforce with substantial experience in \ndesigning and conducting underground nuclear tests to a workforce that \nwill have to maintain our nuclear stockpile without nuclear tests. \nAccording to an analysis carried out last year for my staff, much of \nthe workforce at Los Alamos with substantial experience at the Nevada \nTest Site testing the primary components of nuclear weapons is aged 56 \nor older. The lab has an aggressive plan to capture and formalize their \nexpertise in computer models over the next 4 to 5 years. We need to \nvalidate the computer codes that will be used in the long-term to \ncertify the nuclear\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nweapons stockpile before these weapons designers with direct test \nexperience retire.\n  As far back as 1955, laws like the Atomic Energy Communities Act \nstated that the continued morale of nuclear defense laboratory \npersonnel ``is essential to the common defense and security of the \nUnited States,'' and that the federal government needed to maintain \nconditions in these communities ``which will not impede the recruitment \nand retention of personnel essential to the atomic energy program,'' as \nthe nuclear weapons program was then called. These principles are still \ntrue today. They indicate that we quickly move to restore the homes, \nthe community facilities, and the physical infrastructure of the \ncommunities around the laboratory.\n  In addition to the workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the \nCerro Grande fire is also threatening some of the most economically \nvulnerable citizens of northern New Mexico. These are the rural \nresidents and the Native Americans who depend critically on the land \nthat is being burned and its resources for their livelihood. I am \nparticularly concerned about the residents of the Santa Clara Pueblo \nIndian Reservation, who face the loss of their natural water supply and \nof numerous sacred and historic sites as the fire progresses. Native \nAmerican firefighters have been at the forefront of battling this \nblaze, and have been unstinting in their time and efforts to protect \nthe federal government's property and that of their neighbors. We need \nto make sure that they are not forgotten in any restitution and \nrecovery plan.\n  The Cerro Grande fire is one of several major fire disasters now \nfacing the State of New Mexico.\n  Down in Otero County, New Mexico, near the town of Cloudcroft, the \nScott Able fire in the Lincoln National Forest has burned over 21,000 \nacres. The fire was started last Thursday by a downed power line and is \nstill not contained.\n  In Otero and Lincoln Counties, the Cree Fire, which started May 7 \nfrom a campfire, has burned over 8,700 acres. It has cost over $1.7 \nmillion to fight this fire to date.\n  Up north in Mora and San Miguel Counties, the Manuelitas Fire in the \nSanta Fe National Forest, which also started last Thursday from an \nunknown cause, has burned approximately 1,400 acres. And yesterday, \nanother fire broke out and closed a five-mile portion of Interstate 25 \nnear Pecos, New Mexico.\n  We need to make sure that we provide the persons and communities who \nhave been damaged by these fires emergency relief and, where \nappropriate, compensation, as well.\n  All of these fires, taken together, illustrate the broader danger \nthat States like New Mexico face in this severe fire season from areas \nof our national forests and public lands that are very close to towns, \nbut in need of management of their vegetation to remove or reduce the \ndangers of wildfire and to improve the health of the forests. The \nForest Service has asked for funds for the past few years to support \nsuch activities. This kind of funding would reduce the risk to human \nlife and property while providing a source of local jobs in the rural \nWest. As part of the upcoming emergency appropriations, we need to make \nsure that we not only provide extra funds for fire fighting, but also \nfor the type of vegetation management, including thinning the forests \nof certain small-diameter trees, that will help prevent catastrophic \nfires near cities and towns in the West that are bordered by public \nforests.\n  I hope that all my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in \nmaking sure that the destruction caused by this fire is quickly \nremedied, and that the funds are rapidly made available to help prevent \nmore repeats of that destruction this spring and summer out West.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, it is clear now, and acknowledged by the \nPark Service and by the Secretary of the Interior, that the fire was \nstarted by the Park Service on May 4 --well over a week ago--and was \nset as a so-called controlled burn, which got out of control.\n  This is, unfortunately, not the only instance we know of right at \nthis current time where we have fires out of control which started as \ncontrolled burns. So we have a serious problem here.\n  Let me show you a couple of these photos that have been in the \nnewspapers in New Mexico and in some of the national newspapers to show \nwhat we are talking about.\n  As you can see from this photo, this is the smoke plume from the \nfire. From the photo, you can see the red. This is Los Alamos. This is \nthe State of New Mexico. This is the State of Colorado above, and then \nTexas and Oklahoma.\n  You can see this smoke plume extending to the east out of Los Alamos \nand out of New Mexico into Texas, into Oklahoma, and into Colorado. \nThat gives you some sense of the size of this conflagration we have \nbeen trying to put out as a result of this so-called controlled burn.\n  I have one or two other photos which I also would like to show, just \nto give you an idea. This is a picture of the perimeter. Last night the \nperimeter of this fire was 85 miles. The fire has now destroyed \nsomething over 44,000 acres. This photo shows the largest of the fires.\n  As Senator Domenici has said, we have other fires going on in our \nState. Those have also been devastating for those communities.\n  Let me just mention those and indicate that we hope that whatever we \ndo here will also provide relief for those communities as well.\n  The Cerro Grande fire is the largest in our State. But in Otero \nCounty, near Cloudcroft, we have the Scott Able fire which has burned \nover 21,000 acres. The fire started last Thursday by a downed power \nline.\n  In Otero and Lincoln Counties, the Cree fire was started May 7 from a \ncamp fire. It has burned nearly 9,000 acres.\n  Up in Mora and San Miguel Counties, we have another fire that was \nstarted last Thursday that has burned approximately 1,400 acres.\n  We have serious human tragedies resulting from each of these fires. \nWe hope we can get it all addressed.\n  The particular thing about this large Cerro Grande fire at Los \nAlamos, as Senator Domenici pointed out, is it was started by the \nGovernment. The laws we have passed, as I understand them, providing \nfor Federal assistance in the case of disasters, do not contemplate a \ncircumstance where the disaster was caused by Government action. They \nare generally disaster relief proposals and resources made available \nthrough those statutes, because the Government is stepping in to try to \nassist where there has been a hurricane or there has been an earthquake \nor there has been a flood or there has been a fire. Here we have all of \nthat, but we also have the extra overlay and responsibility that I \nthink comes with the fact that the Government set the fire.\n  Los Alamos National Laboratory was spared major destruction. That is \na very important fact. It was not spared totally. There have been some \ndamages. I hope we can see to it that those damages are repaired. But \nfortunately for the country, as well as for our State and the community \nof Los Alamos, the major facilities of the laboratories were not \nburned.\n\n  I do think this fire, though, reminds us of our national security \nassets located in Los Alamos. They are not just the facilities, and \nthey are not just the nuclear material or equipment that has been \ndeveloped there over many decades; the main asset we have there with a \nnational security significance to it is the scientists and engineers \nand other people who work at that facility.\n  For that reason, it is absolutely essential we step up, as Senator \nDomenici said, to make these people whole, do what can be done by way \nof resources at this point, to help them rebuild, help them get through \nthis period of turmoil, and get back to work on our very important \nnational security needs.\n  We have various distinctions in our State. One that I have always \nenjoyed is that we have more Ph.D.'s per capita in New Mexico than any \nother State in the Union. People say, well, that is an unusual \nstatistic. It is a statistic which relates directly to the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory and to the Sandia National Laboratory.\n  We have many extremely well-trained, well-qualified people working \nthere. These are people who have alternative careers they can pursue; \nthese are not people who need employment there. They could go to any of \na number of private firms and be compensated, probably substantially \nbetter\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nthan we are compensating them to do this very important national \nsecurity work.\n  We need to keep those people at our laboratory. We particularly need \nto keep those people, the young ones who have come in recently and \nthose who are near retirement but who have very valuable information \nand very valuable expertise, in our nuclear-weapons-related work.\n  I know there is an aggressive plan that the Department of Energy and \nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed for the next 4 to 5 \nyears to try to capture some of that expertise and ensure that we \nretain that before some of these people retire.\n  We cannot allow this fire and this disruption of activity in the \nlaboratory and in the community of Los Alamos to interfere with our \nability to keep that expertise at that laboratory. So that is an \nimportant reason why this needs to be done quickly, why we need to move \naggressively to deal with this.\n  Let me also mention the other populations in our State that have been \nvery adversely affected by the fire. One, of course, is the Santa Clara \nPueblo. If the fire continues--and it has already consumed some 10 \npercent of their reservation--it continues to threaten that pueblo and \nthe livelihoods of many of those people. We need to see to it that \nwhatever we are able to do benefits them and helps them to recover from \nthe devastating effects of this fire, as well as other individuals in \nRio Arriba County, Santa Fe County, and the community of Espanola.\n  All of those factors need to be taken into account. There is a long \nlist of needs that people will have and a long list of damages that \npeople in the communities involved and the businesses involved will \nhave suffered. I need to just say that, to my mind, we need to step up \nand accept responsibility. We, the Federal Government, we, the country, \nneed to step up and accept responsibility for making those people \nwhole.\n  These natural disasters can result in extended litigation and efforts \nby people to try to get compensated. We hope that can be avoided to the \nextent possible in this case, because we hope that we can get a \nsufficiently effective and coordinated and rapid response from the \nFederal Government to allow that to happen. So I hope very much that \nall of this occurs.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Levin, I ask unanimous consent \nthat following the remarks of Senator Biden, Senator Levin be \nrecognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the manager of the bill, I have been asked \nto object to that. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The senior Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Bingaman for his remarks and his \nobservations.\n  Mr. President, I've visited Los Alamos countless times during my \nyears of service in the Senate. I've been there for many celebrations, \ncelebrations of their immense contributions that have helped to \npreserve our national security and maintain our scientific leadership.\n  Well, I was there a few days ago, and it was no celebration. I \nwitnessed incredible devastation caused by the massive forest fire that \nis ravaging the area. Thousands of beautiful trees have burned and \nsmoke was rising everywhere. Hot winds were fanning new flames. \nThousands of acres of forest were devastated. The lives of many people \nwere shattered. Over 20,000 people had been evacuated, and were \nreceiving shelter with friends and in public areas. Many homes lay in \nruins, consumed by flames.\n  These are homes of people who have dedicated their lives to \npreserving our precious freedoms. They are true patriots. It only added \nto my heavy heart to know that the fire was caused by an ill-advised \n``prescribed burn'' in nearby Bandelier National Monument.\n  In the face of the tragedy, I was immensely impressed with the superb \nemergency services that were being provided. The State Governor spent a \nlong night in Los Alamos. The Red Cross set up shelters throughout the \nnorthern area. The Forest Service mobilized hot shot firefighting units \nand brought superb expertise, capabilities, leadership and coordination \nto this horrible situation. The FEMA Administrator was on site. The \nSecretary of Energy arrived with some of his key staff.\n  The local emergency personnel were doing wonderful work, trying their \nbest to safely cope with the immense challenge of protecting public \nsafety during a complex evacuation, while also ensuring that none of \nthe hazardous operations at the Laboratory caused additional concerns. \nThe evacuation of Los Alamos took only about half the time anticipated, \npartly because they had recently practiced an evacuation drill.\n  There have been many acts of heroism, in which emergency personnel \nperformed critical functions. Many of the lab personnel who manned \nemergency posts lost their homes in the fire, yet they continued at \ntheir stations to ensure the safety of others. People from throughout \nNew Mexico reached out to help their neighbors. Assistance to evacuees \nfrom Pojoaque, Espanola, Taos and Santa Fe, along with other \ncommunities throughout the State, has been heart warming. Community \nleaders of these areas, like Jake Villareal from Pojoaque Pueblo and \nRichard Lucero from Espanola, were some of the first to offer generous \nassistance.\n  Given the state of the devastation, it's amazing that there has been \nno loss of life, or even serious injuries. The fire burned over bunkers \nfull of high explosives--those bunkers provided the planned levels of \nprotection and there were no accidents. Laboratory buildings, which \nhouse hazardous operations, remained secure, thanks in large part to \nyears of careful planning. In fact, Laboratory leadership, under the \ndirection of John Browne, deserves accolades for assuring that the \nLaboratory did not compound the fire-related crises, and bringing the \nlaboratory through the events without significant loss of the \nfacilities they require to accomplish their mission.\n  In the near term, we need to care for the immense human dimensions of \nthe tragedy. We must ensure that people have adequate shelter, that \npublic health and safety are protected, that public services are \nrapidly restored, and that some semblance of normalcy can return to \ntheir lives. We need to provide assistance to people as they rebuild \ntheir lives and their houses.\n  In the longer term, we need to ensure that the town regains its \nvitality, which is essential for our national Laboratory to return to \nfull productivity. With the cessation of nuclear testing, the \nchallenges facing that Laboratory are even greater than in years past. \nNow we've asked their staff to assure that our nuclear deterrent is \nsafe, secure, and reliable--and do it without any nuclear tests. Our \nnation depends on that deterrent. We need these patriots to continue \ntheir work.\n  While I'd like to list the groups and individuals that have worked \ntogether to mitigate this catastrophe, that's really an impossible \ntask. I do want to especially thank President Clinton, FEMA \nAdministrator James Lee Witt, and regional FEMA Director Buddy Young \nfor their quick reaction to this devastating disaster. FEMA's \nassistance has and will continue to be critical in helping to make the \ncommunity whole again.\n  Up to this point, much of the focus has been on the tragedy facing \nthe Laboratory and the communities of Los Alamos County, but there are \nadditional dimensions to this horrible fire. It is still burning, and \nmay threaten other communities. In fact, it could burn for months, as \ndry fuel in these mountain areas is plentiful.\n  As we are speaking, the Abiquiu land grant has been voluntarily \nevacuated. Beautiful and sacred areas of the Santa Clara Pueblo are \nburning or are threatened. We must make the same assistance package \nbeing prepared for the Los Alamos community available in these other \nlocations, if this fire damages property there.\n  Last Wednesday, Governor Johnson requested that the President declare \na state of emergency in New Mexico, and President Clinton signed that \nrequest within hours. The emergency declaration triggered immediate \nassistance to Los Alamos, as well as Sandoval and Santa Fe Counties, \nand Rio Arriba County was added soon thereafter. The emergency \ndeclaration provided for short-term assistancem including funds for \nthings like: Food, water, medicine and other essential needs; shelters \nand\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nemergency care; temporary housing assistance; emergency repairs and \ndemolition; and emergency communications service and public \ntransportation.\n  Over the weekend, at Governor Johnson's request, the President \ndeclared parts of northern New Mexico to be a federal major disaster \narea. This triggers additional federal assistance from FEMA and other \nagencies for the following counties: Bernalillo, Cibola, Los Alamos, \nMcKinley, Mora, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, San Juan, San Miguel, Santa Fe, \nTaos and Torrance.\n\n  FEMA has only begun the process of assessing the damage, but the \nassistance will include funds to help individual families with rental \nhousing, hotel/motel costs and other living expenses. Federal aid also \nwill be available for county and city governments to help begin the \nprocess of rebuilding their infrastructure.\n  Thankfully, it is estimated that 98 percent of the homes destroyed or \ndamaged by the fire were insured. But, there are other effects this \nfire will have on the community, particularly the business community so \nheavily dependent on the Laboratory for its existence in Los Alamos. \nSBA will make available low interest loans to help small businesses pay \nfor their property losses and to cover cash flow shortages or working \ncapital deficiencies because of the fire's impact.\n  FEMA has completed its initial assessment of the situation in \nnorthern New Mexico, and I have been assured that all appropriate \nfederal agencies that can provide support will do so. FEMA will \ncoordinate these activities and work closely with local officials to \nimplement a comprehensive plan. No amount of money can replace many of \nthe things which have been lost during this devastating tragedy, but \nall available federal resources will be brought to bear to do the best \njob we can.\n  Over the next few weeks, we will begin to understand the types of \nassistance that will be required for the Laboratory and its staff to \nreturn to productive work. I stand ready to work with all of you to \nassure that those resources are provided swiftly and surely.\n  Unfortunately, FEMA may be called upon to assist other communities in \nNew Mexico, as my State is being devastated by a series of major fires. \nIn the southern part of New Mexico, there are fires comparable in size \nto the Los Alamos fire. My heart goes out to those people as well, as \nthey work to rebuild their lives.\n  I've joined a call within the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \ntogether with Chairman Murkowski and Senator Bingaman, to carefully \nestablish the chain of events that led to the horrific events \nassociated with the Los Alamos fire. The Government Accounting Office \nhas begun a detailed investigation. Even with the limited information \nwe have now, it appears clear that major human errors caused this fire. \nWe need to understand those errors and be sure they don't occur again. \nWe may, for example, need to reexamine the procedures for evaluating \nthe safety of ``controlled burns.''\n  It's also clear, even with the information we had last week, that the \nfederal government is responsible for this disaster. Thousands of \npeople were impacted by this mistake, and hundreds of those people have \nsuffered major financial losses. Those folks are plenty angry, and they \nhave every right to be furious. In Congress, we need to find ways to \nmake those folks ``whole'' again, as quickly and efficiently as \npossible, with an absolute minimum of red tape.\n  All our citizens owe a tremendous gratitude to the workers at Los \nAlamos. We won the Cold War because of their contributions. Today we \nenjoy our freedoms because of their dedication. We need their continued \ndedication to assure that those freedoms survive for our future \ngenerations. And they need our help to rebuild their lives and return \nto their vital missions.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of people to thank. I thank the \nPresident for acting expeditiously in declaring a national emergency. I \nthank James Lee Witt, the FEMA Administrator. He visited personally. He \nhas put one of his best directors in charge. I thank Buddy Young from \nFEMA, who is out there setting up the appropriate centers. Obviously, \nat the forefront throughout this entire disaster has been our \ndistinguished Governor, Governor Johnson. He probably knows more about \nit than any outsider today. He has spent untold numbers of hours, along \nwith his wife, finding out what was going on, making sure things were \ncoordinated and organized. I thank him in a very special way for all he \nhas done. There are many others to thank whom I will forget to mention \nand they are very important.\n  I think the people in this country ought to know this laboratory was \nvery well organized. It is the center of some very significant \nactivities that require expertise and require that we do things \nabsolutely right. They had an evacuation plan. It was followed to a tee \nand, believe it or not, with just four roads out of the mountains, all \nof these people went to other parts of our State 20, 30, 40, 50 miles \naway. That occurred without anything other than a mild jam up of \nautomobiles on a couple of occasions as they left. They are staying \nwith friends and neighbors everywhere. Motels offered the people from \nLos Alamos some very excellent, reasonably priced, accommodations and \nwere very generous in doing that. Now, people from Los Alamos are \nstarting to move back and we anxiously await their return. I have a few \ncomments for them.\n  Without a doubt, it is the people who make this laboratory great. It \nis imperative that in our efforts to make this community whole, we do \nso with as much dispatch as humanly possible. Let it not be a long, \ndragged out, protracted effort to focus our attention and resources on \nwhat the people are entitled to and need, and let's get it done. We \ndon't need any discouragement directed at those who are either new on \nthe job, with great scientific prowess, or those who have been there a \nlong time and are a part of the real nucleus of our nuclear and our \ndeterrent capability. We don't need to discourage them. They should not \nbe discouraged. We hope they come back and take up their jobs. Nobody \nshould lose anything because of this fire in terms of remuneration, or \npay, or the like. It is our responsibility.\n  As I indicated in my remarks, we have acts of God where lightning and \nother things burn our forests, and we have people in recreation areas \nwho make a mistake and start a fire. This one apparently was started by \nthe U.S. Government, although another department of Government, the \nPark Service, under the Interior Department; that is different from the \nDepartment of Energy that manages this laboratory.\n  Nonetheless, it seems to me that there are lawyers talking about \ntrying to get our constituents there to sign up with them so they can \nget remuneration. I am very hopeful, as Senator Bingaman has indicated, \nand as Congressman Udall from the district where this laboratory lies, \nwho spoke last night at an event. We ought to give our assistance in an \neffort to make people whole. We ought to do that quickly and make sure \nthe people understand they don't have to go through protracted \nlitigation and courts to get the compensation they are entitled to. We \nintend to make them whole. But obviously, there may be different \ndefinitions, depending upon what vantage point you take, as to what \n``making them whole'' means. But wherever you can measure property \nlosses such as a house, that which was in a house, personal property, \nautomobiles, and the like which might have been damaged or destroyed, \nit is pretty easy. We need to put somebody in charge. We owe the people \nfor what these destroyed assets were worth to them.\n\n  This isn't a town way up in the mountains. It is not going to be easy \nto build 400 new residences, if that is what people choose to do. It \nwill take some time. The Federal Government has a lot of resources that \nit puts to bear and focus in emergencies. They will all be there, and \nhopefully organized in such a manner so that people will not be \nfrustrated, and we will get on with this.\n  In the meantime, the process of controlled burns ought to be looked \nat thoroughly by Congress, but also the entire process of how we are \nmaintaining our forests and our national parks in terms of trees that \nare knocked down; blighted areas where we have timber standing that is \ntotally dry and dead; underbrush that is growing; pine needles that are \npiled up everywhere making a tinderbox out of some of our national \nmonuments, some of our national parks, some of our forests, and\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nsome of the Bureau of Land Management land. We have to take a look to \nsee what we should be doing about that.\n  Should we leave that independent kind of situation waiting around for \na fire of this magnitude or should we begin some orderly process of \ndoing some things that will clean it up a bit and make it a little more \nsafe? I opt for the latter.\n  I hope there will be some detailed hearings about that because I \nbelieve something should be done.\n  I understand the Senate is going into recess for the Republican and \nDemocratic lunches. But I am not in charge of that time, unless \nleadership wants me to do something in that regard.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to respond to the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico and his colleagues who have just spoken. All of us have \nwatched with great concern as this fire has caused such devastation in \nthe mountains of New Mexico and around Los Alamos.\n  I chair the Subcommittee on Forestry and Public Lands. For the last \ndecade we have known as a country that our forests are rapidly growing \nunhealthy, largely because we have not managed them as skillfully as we \nshould. In areas that are natural and left to be natural, we understand \nnot touching them. But where we have forests in what we call urban \ninterface today, where houses are built amongst the trees, there ought \nto be an aggressive effort to keep fuel loading down and to disperse \ntrees in such a way as to disallow these kinds of crises from \ndeveloping. It is happening now in New Mexico because of a major error \non the part of a Federal agency.\n  We literally have millions and millions of acres of forested public \nlands around this country in an unsatisfactory condition, as in the \nmountains of the great State of New Mexico, and one spark, one \nlightning strike, or one human match could cost millions of dollars, \nlose thousands of homes, and the land that it touches, it destroys for \na generation.\n  Oftentimes much greater environmental damage is done trying to put \nout these fires than an organized manner of managing the land, to \ncontrol fuel loading, and those types of things that are now evident in \nNew Mexico.\n  We will work with the Senators from New Mexico. Those hearings will \nbe timely. There should be a report out by this Thursday that will give \nus some indication of cause.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is absolutely right: There should be \nextensive hearings on how and why it happened. Are there other areas \nwhere this could happen across these United States?\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an article from the Albuquerque \nJournal that talks about a marvelous man, Alton J. Posey, 68 years old. \nEssentially, this 68-year-old retired man knew a lot about forests and \nmountains. That was his job. He went out to save his mountain house, \nwhich was his dream--a two-story log cabin in the mountains. He doused \nhimself with water, took his water hose, and stayed there and kept that \nhouse from burning while things burned all around him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the story explaining his life and what \nhe did be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is a little town named Weed, NM, \nwhich was hit by this fire. Terrible damage was done. It is on the \nother side of the State in the southern section.\n  There is a detailed Associated Press account by Chaka Ferguson that \nexplains the details about that small town and what happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senate in advance for the \ngenerosity that it is going to show, as it always does for those who \nsuffer a disaster in this country.\n  I want to say to New Mexicans that the Senate won't let you down this \ntime either. We are going to do what we have to do to organize it \nproperly, put it in the right hands, and make all of you out there in \nNew Mexico whole, rebuild that lab where it needs to be built, and make \nit safer where it ought to be safe so it can continue its marvelous \nwork in behalf of peace and freedom as it has done for so many decades.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Ex-Fireman Saves Home From Scott Able Blaze\n\n\n       retiree prevails over fire--one-man battle saves weed home\n\n                             (By Rene Romo)\n\n       Weed.--The Scott Able Fire was raging on Agua Chiquita Road \n     west of this tiny village, but 68-year-old Alton J. Posey was \n     determined to protect his house, a two-story log cabin he \n     built for his retirement.\n       With an old firefighter's helmet perched on his head and \n     his pants drenched with water, Posey used a garden hose to \n     battle flare-ups.\n       He managed to save his dream house, but at lest 15 other \n     houses and structures burned to the ground a few hundred \n     yards away in nearby Wayland Canyon and along Agua Chiquita \n     on Thursday night.\n       ``Everything at the end of the rainbow for me was at the \n     bottom of his hill,'' Posey said Saturday of his 11-acre \n     property, a preserve surrounded by blackened trees and \n     incinerated homes. ``At 68 years old, you're too old to start \n     again. And if a guy is determined and he knows he's right, \n     you can't whip him.''\n       Firefighters on Sunday had the 20,717-acre blaze, which cut \n     a swath about 20 miles wide from Scott Able Canyon east to \n     the Sacramento and Weed area, about 50 percent contained, \n     fire information officer Kris Fister said.\n       The fire was believed to have been sparked by a downed \n     power line in a 4-H camp about 16 miles south of Cloudcroft.\n       Fed by wind gusts, the fire churned across the Sacramento \n     Mountains in the Lincoln National Forest, covering nearly 20 \n     miles Thursday night and Friday morning.\n       Along Agua Chiquita, the fire left charred refrigerators \n     and well pumps standing amid aluminum siding twisted like \n     noodles. At some homes, trucks sat on their wheel rims \n     because the tires were roasted away.\n       Milder winds Saturday and Sunday limited the blaze mainly \n     to ground fires and gave more than 300 firefighters from \n     around the West a chance to build a perimeter and douse hot \n     spots with five helicopters and six air tankers.\n       According to a preliminary estimate, the Scott Able Fire \n     destroyed 20 residences, 16 structures such as garages and \n     sheds, and six automobiles.\n       Among those who lost houses in Wayland Canyon were two of \n     Posey's neighbors, Maggie Bailey and Weed postmaster Francis \n     Visser. Posey allowed them to stay in his home while they \n     figure out what to do next.\n       Bailey moved to the area from Wisconsin two years ago with \n     her truck-driver husband, who was on the road during the \n     blaze. Bailey said she lost a motorhome, a small cabin and a \n     motorboat. She managed to save two cars and her pets--a dog \n     and two cats.\n       ``I think I want to go back where there's more moisture,'' \n     a dazed Bailey said Saturday evening ``What can you do? \n     You just . . . do.''\n       Otero County sheriff's deputy Sgt. Jeff Farmer also lost \n     his home.\n       ``It's the little things you miss,'' said Farmer, who was \n     working a roadblock leading into Weed off N.M. 24 on \n     Saturday. He had been working almost nonstop since the fire \n     erupted Thursday evening. ``Yesterday morning, I didn't own \n     anything.''\n       Posey said ``it sounded like 10 trains'' when the blaze \n     roared down the mountainside behind his house, consuming 80-\n     foot-tall pine trees.\n       The former Artesia firefighter thoroughly drenched his log \n     cabin with a garden hose as the fire advanced Thursday. Later \n     that\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n     evening, heat all around the house caused the building to \n     issue a cloud of steam.\n       From about 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., Posey, working frantically and \n     alone, scrambled about his property dousing thumb-sized \n     embers with a bucket.\n       Flames burned a hole in the wall of a barn about 50 feet \n     from his home before Posey extinguished the flare-up.\n       Several times during the night, he said, he had to drop to \n     the ground to gulp air. And once during the evening, a wild-\n     eyed doe charged out of the burning forest and crashed into \n     him.\n       Posey said he refused three requests by local authorities \n     to evacuate but sent his wife and two neighbors off Thursday \n     evening. The goodbye became emotional when Posey told his \n     wife of 47 years, Carol, to take his dog, a blue heeler named \n     Ugly, with her.\n       ``I was just just wondering if I would ever see him alive \n     again.'' Carol Posey said Sunday, noting that she left her \n     home with nothing but medicine and her pets. ``It was a scary \n     time, I tell you what. You didn't have time to think. You \n     didn't have time to do anything.''\n       Alton Posey recounted their goodbye: ``I said, `Don't you \n     fret. This is the kind of hand I can play. I had a good \n     supply of water, a good pressure pump, and my old coat.' ''\n       Meanwhile, the 8,650-acre Cree Fire east of Ruidoso was 94 \n     percent contained as of early Sunday, and a single helicopter \n     doused hot spots. The fire is expected to be under control by \n     Wednesday.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                    Town Full of Stories After Fire\n\n                          (By Chaka Ferguson)\n\n       Weed, N.M.--Under a blue sky, with a row of apple trees \n     serving as an outdoor wedding chapel, newlyweds Chris Mydock \n     and Kendra Goss-Mydock proved why this mountain community, \n     population 20, is known to some of its residents as a town of \n     100 stories.\n       Two days earlier, a raging wild-fire ripped through the \n     Sacramento Mountains, burning at least two dozen buildings \n     about a mile from where the Mydocks consecrated their wedding \n     Saturday. When they took their vows, an evacuation order was \n     still in effect.\n       In the background, wisps of white smoke rose from the \n     hills. A helicopter hovered above, prepared to drop water on \n     remaining hot spots. Firefighters milled around, awaiting \n     orders.\n       But like life in this resilient community, the wedding went \n     on.\n       ``The pastor called us yesterday and asked us if we're \n     still on, and we said, `Yep, we're still on,''' said Goss-\n     Mydock, 31, a lifelong resident of Weed, as she posed for \n     pictures with her new husband before a sign that read ``Weed: \n     pop, 20''.\n       The communities that dot the Southern New Mexico mountains \n     have pulled together since a wild-fire erupted in a nearby \n     canyon Thursday and spread to more than 20,000 acres, \n     rivaling the bigger blaze in the north that scorched Los \n     Alamos.\n       The Mydocks wanted to share their wedding with the \n     community to help heal some of the pain caused by the fire's \n     destruction.\n       ``The people are really close to each other; it's like one \n     big family here. Everybody cares about everybody else,'' \n     Goss-Mydock said.\n       The preacher and his wife, who served as the witness, \n     attended the wedding. The Mydocks then had their reception \n     down a dirt road that bisects the community with patrons of \n     the Weed Cafe, a gathering place for residents seeking news \n     on the fire.\n       The family-run restaurant which also houses the community's \n     post office, stayed open during the tense days and nights of \n     the fire and the following evacuation, donating food and \n     other provisions to firefighters and evacuees. Some residents \n     ignored the evacuation and stayed put, others took up \n     residence with friends or relatives.\n       ``I stayed open to supply hot coffee to the people and \n     provide telephones,'' said Gary Stone, 45, who lives several \n     miles down the road in Miller Flats. ``I was making sure the \n     coffee was on and the doors were open.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S3981-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this weekend an estimated 750,000 \nmothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom March here in \nthe District. These women and men took the first step toward ending the \nepidemic of gun violence in our country.\n  Certainly, Congress needs to take the next step. It is intolerable \nthat commonsense gun safety legislation is stalled in a conference \ncommittee that has not met since August 5 of 1999. Twelve kids die a \nday from gun violence and we do nothing. We have more safety \nregulations for toy guns than for real guns, and we do nothing. We have \nwatched children shot in schools and day-care centers, but still we do \nnothing.\n  Yesterday, the Democratic Policy Committee held a hearing with \nmothers from the Million Mom March. At the hearing, I heard stories \nthat I must say will haunt me for a long time. I listened to a \nkindergarten schoolteacher talk about her horror when one of her \nseemingly innocent students, a kindergartner, brought a gun to school \nto kill a classmate. She remains afraid to teach and afraid for her \nstudents.\n  I listened to the mother of an aspiring high school graduate who was \ngunned down in front of his girlfriend's home while unloading \ngroceries. As she talked about her loss, and demanded Congress act, she \nsaid simply:\n\n       I don't want this to happen to any other mother, father, \n     sister or brother. I don't want anyone else to suffer like \n     this.\n\n  I listened to a mother whose oldest son was shot and killed by a \nneighbor in a sleepy town in California. She told us:\n\n       I came to the District to protect my son, Brandon, from gun \n     violence because he is the only child that I have left.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, what else will it take for us to act to stem \nthis domestic war of violence that is infecting every city and county \nin our beloved country? We cannot wait any longer for the juvenile \njustice conference to meet and act.\n  I was disappointed by comments made by the National Rifle Association \nwhen asked whether all of this effort, 750,000 people coming to \nWashington as peacefully as any group I have ever seen come, organized \nin a respectful way, telling their stories, as tragic as they are, with \nthe courage that I don't think I personally could muster, the personal \nstories of lost sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--the NRA was \nasked the question, Will this translate to political power? Their \nanswer:\n\n       It's one thing to say it. It's another thing to do it.\n\n  They understand political power. They have it. But I do think that is \nchanging. The landscape is changing, and it is changing dramatically. \nAs a South Dakotan who has been raised with guns all my life, who is \nproud to be a hunter--I have many guns myself--I will say without \nequivocation that it, too, is even changing in my home State.\n  Given the fact it has now been more than a year, given the fact that \nwe have not yet acted, given the fact that we ought to respond to all \nthose people who came to Washington with their courage and with what \nfew pennies they had to pay for their trips, I ask unanimous consent \nthat no rule XVI point of order lie against any gun-related amendment \nto the military construction appropriations. This would apply to \nRepublican or Democratic amendments.\n  Mr. BURNS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3148\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, therefore, send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3148.\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Since Mother's Day, May 14, 2000, an estimated 750,000 \n     mothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom \n     March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and were \n     joined by tens of thousands of others, in 70 cities across \n     America, in a call for meaningful, common-sense gun policy;\n       Since 4,223 young people ages 19 and under were killed by \n     gunfire--one every two hours, nearly 12 young people every \n     day--in the United States in 1977;\n       Since American children under the age of 15 are 12 times \n     more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other \n     industrialized countries combined;\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n       Since gun safety education programs are inadequate to \n     protect children from gun violence;\n       Since a majority of the Senate resolved that the House-\n     Senate Juvenile Justice Conference should meet, consider and \n     pass by April 20, 2000, a conference report to accompany H.R. \n     1501, the Juvenile Justice Act, and that the conference \n     report should retain the Senate-passed gun safety provisions \n     to limit access to firearms by juveniles, felons, and other \n     prohibited persons;\n       Since the one year Anniversary of the Columbine High School \n     tragedy passed on April 20, 2000, without any action by the \n     Juvenile Justice Conference Committee on the reasonable gun \n     safety measures that were passed by the Senate almost one \n     year ago;\n       Since continued inaction on this critical threat to public \n     safety undermines confidence in the ability of the Senate to \n     protect our children and raises concerns about the influence \n     of special interests opposed to even the most basic gun \n     safety provisions;\n       Since this lack of action on the part of the Juvenile \n     Justice Conference Committee and this Congress to stem the \n     flood of gun violence is irresponsible and further delay is \n     unacceptable; and\n       Since protecting our children from gun violence is a top \n     priority for our families, communities, and nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Determined, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the organizers, sponsors, and participants of the \n     Million Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand \n     sensible gun safety legislation; and\n       (2) Congress should immediately pass a conference report to \n     accompany H.R. 1501, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \n     Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, before the Memorial \n     Day Recess, and include the Lautenberg-Kerrey gun show \n     loophole amendment and the other Senate-passed provisions \n     designed to limit access to firearms by juveniles, convicted \n     felons, and other persons prohibited by law from purchasing \n     or possessing firearms.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.     . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE SECOND \n                   AMENDMENT, THE ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL FIREARMS \n                   LAWS, AND THE JUVENILE CRIME CONFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     protects the right of each law-abiding United States citizen \n     to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-\n     defense or recreation; and\n       (2) The Clinton Administration has failed to protect law--\n     abiding citizens by inadequately enforcing Federal firearms \n     laws. Between 1992 and 1998, Triggerlock gun prosecutions of \n     defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony \n     dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800, \n     despite the fact that the overall budget of the Department of \n     Justice increased 54 percent during this period; and\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997; and\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997; also\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997; plus\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n     institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm under section \n     922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite this federal \n     law, mental health adjudications are not placed on the \n     national instant criminal background system; also\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm; \n     it is also a Federal crime for convicted felons to possess or \n     purchase a firearm. More than 500,000 convicted felons and \n     other prohibited purchasers have been prevented from buying \n     firearms from licensed dealers since the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act was enacted. When these felons \n     attempted to purchase a firearm, they committed another crime \n     by making a false statement under oath that they were not \n     disqualified from purchasing a firearm; and, of the more than \n     500,000 violations, only approximately 200 of the felons have \n     been referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution; \n     and\n       (8) The juvenile crime conference committee is considering \n     a comprehensive approach to juvenile crime including:\n       (a) tougher penalties on criminals using guns and illegal \n     gun purchases;\n       (b) money for states to get tough on truly violent teen \n     criminals;\n       (c) a provision allowing Hollywood to reach agreements to \n     clean up smut and violence on television, in video games, and \n     in music;\n       (d) changing federal education mandates to ensure that all \n     students who bring guns to school can be disciplined; and\n       (e) a ban on juveniles who commit felonies from ever \n     legally possessing a gun and from possessing assault weapons, \n     and\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) Any juvenile crime conference report should reflect a \n     comprehensive approach to juvenile crime and enhance the \n     prosecution of firearms offenses, including:\n       (a) designating not less than 1 Assistant United States \n     Attorney in each district to prosecute Federal firearms \n     violations and thereby expand Project Exile nationally;\n       (b) upgrading the national instant criminal background \n     system by encouraging States to place mental health \n     adjudications on that system and by improving the overall \n     speed and efficiency of that system; and\n       (c) and providing incentive grants to States to encourage \n     States to impose mandatory minimum sentences of firearm \n     offenses;\n       (2) The right of each law-abiding United States citizen to \n     own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-\n     defense or recreation, should not be infringed.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be no \nfurther votes this evening. The next vote will occur at 1:30 p.m. on \nWednesday.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation in getting this \nagreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may ask the majority leader a \nquestion, the unanimous consent doesn't address this, but I assume the \n4 hours tonight would be equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Of course, it already notes it should be equally divided \ntomorrow. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. President, let me thank the majority leader for his willingness \nto proceed in this manner. This is what we had hoped we could achieve. \nI am delighted now that we have done so. This is far better than to go \nthrough the parliamentary motions that were being made. I appreciate \nthe patience and willingness on the part of everyone to accommodate our \ndesire to have this amendment and these votes. We will have them \ntomorrow, as we had hoped. I look forward to the debate tonight as well \nas tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield our 2 hours tonight on the Democratic side to \nSenator Boxer who will manage the time on my behalf.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while the time will be equally divided \ntonight--2 hours on each side that are required to discuss the pending \namendments--I want to emphasize again that there is another very \nimportant issue pending that everybody thought would be the subject of \ndebate this afternoon, and that is the language in the appropriations \nbill regarding Kosovo and how we will deal with our allies' involvement \nthere, and how we will deal in the future with the funding.\n  Some Senators may wish to take some time to speak on that issue. I \nalso encourage colleagues that we work toward getting a time agreement \ntomorrow afternoon on the Kosovo issue, have a reasonable time, but \nhave a focused, good debate and vote on that issue so we can complete \nthe military construction appropriations bill. We are getting far \nafield from getting our work done on the appropriations bills. We would \nthen go to the foreign operations appropriations bill. I encourage \nSenators to stay and make speeches tonight on these subjects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  May I ask the majority leader if he could tell us who is going to be \nhandling the time on his side of the aisle?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we don't have anybody designated yet. I will \neither be here to do it myself or we will designate somebody. There are \na number of Senators who have indicated a desire to be heard on this \nissue--Senator Sessions, Senator Craig, and others. But exactly when \ntonight or tomorrow, we will have to make that determination since we \njust had this agreement entered into.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for getting us \nto a place where we can in fact consider the Daschle amendment, which \nsimply says that on Mother's Day an estimated 750,000 mothers, fathers, \nand children united for the Million Mom March on The Mall in \nWashington, and they were joined by tens of thousands of others in 70 \ncities across America in a call for a meaningful, commonsense policy.\n  Essentially what this amendment says is that the organizers of the \nMillion Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand sensible \ngun safety legislation and that Congress should immediately pass a \nconference report which will include the meaningful, sensible gun laws \nthat were passed here in the Senate as part of the juvenile justice \nbill.\n  I had the privilege and honor of marching with so many American \nfamilies of so many diverse backgrounds and so many Americans of \ndifferent ages all united in a call for a safer America.\n  I am very pleased that my leader, Senator Daschle, has placed this \namendment before the body. I hope all Members will vote for it.\n  I see that the Republican side has responded with a litany of attacks \non President Clinton, which I think is most inappropriate. This should \nbe a time when we reach across the aisle and say we want safety for our \nchildren. I hope maybe they will reconsider.\n  Believe me when I tell you that the million moms and their families \nare not Democrats, Republicans, or independents; they are Americans. \nMany were touched by violence in their families and violence in their \ncommunities.\n  At this time, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, if \nhe would like to take up to 30 minutes to discuss these amendments. If \nso, I will now yield up to 30 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts \nwithhold?\n  May I have 1 minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her leadership \nand her advocacy on this issue.\n  I was so proud to march with her on The Mall with the mothers and the \nfathers and the good men who supported the women. We were proud. Why \nwere we proud? Because the people marching believed marching made a \ndifference. They thought if they could go out and march with their feet \ninstead of people marching with their money into these lobbying events \nthat are held here, they could make a difference. I thank the Senator \nfor responding to their marching feet.\n  I stand with her, along with the people who were there from Maryland. \nI congratulate her because we are making democracy work. If we don't \nmarch on this floor and pass this amendment, I really say to the voters \nof America, march into the voting booth and get a Congress that will \nrespond to marching feet instead of marching to millions of dollars.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Maryland. It was an honor to march \nwith her and to stand with her. She brings to the Senate a sense of \nreality for our families, our seniors, and our children. She fights for \nthem every day. She is fighting for them tonight.\n  With that, I yield up to 30 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two days ago, to honor Mother's Day, hundreds of \nthousands of mothers from across the United States marched on the \nnation's\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nCapitol, to insist that Congress do more to protect children from the \nepidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our country.\n  The Million Mom March has focused the attention of the entire country \non this critical challenge--and the question now is whether Congress \nwill at long last end the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun \ncontrol.\n  The National Rifle Association is not the Majority Leader of the \nUnited States Senate. It shouldn't be dictating our agenda. It's \nirresponsible for the Republican Senate leadership to stonewall every \nopportunity to enact responsible gun control legislation.\n  For many months, Democrats have continued to ask the Republican \nleadership for immediate action on pending legislation to close the \nloopholes in the nation's gun laws, but every request so far has been \ndenied.\n  Gun laws work. Experience is clear that tough gun laws in combination \nwith other preventive measures have a direct impact on reducing crime.\n  In Massachusetts, we have some of the toughest gun laws in the \ncountry.\n  We have a ban on carrying concealed weapons. A permit is required to \ndo so. Local law enforcement has discretion to issue permits, and an \nindividual must show a need in order to obtain the permit.\n  We have a minimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun. We have \nincreased penalties for felons in possession of firearms.\n  We require the sale of child safety locks with all firearms.\n  We have an adult responsibility law. Adults are liable if a child \nobtains an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself \nor any other person.\n  We have a Gun-Free Schools Law.\n  We have a licensing law for purchases of guns.\n  We have strict standards for the licensing of gun dealers.\n  We have a waiting period for handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 \ndays to obtain a permit.\n  We have a permit requirement for secondary and private sales of guns.\n  We have a ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials.\n  We have a requirement for reporting of lost or stolen firearms.\n  As Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans testified last year in the \nSenate Health Committee, ``Any successful approach to youth violence \nmust be balanced and comprehensive. It must include major investments \nin prevention and intervention as well as enforcement. Take away any \nleg and the stool falls.''\n  Commissioner Evans also stated that to be effective, efforts must be \ntargeted and cooperative. Police officers must be able to work closely \nwith churches, schools, and health and mental health providers. After-\nschool programs are essential to help keep juveniles off the streets, \nout of trouble, and away from guns and drugs. In developing an \neffective approach like this, Boston has become a model for the rest of \nthe country.\n  There are partnerships between the Boston Public Schools and local \nmental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health \nprofessionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in \norder to prevent violence by students. The Boston police work actively \nwith parents, schools and other officials, discussing incidents in and \nout of school involving students. The Boston Public Health Commission \npromotes programs by the Boston Police Department.\n\n  The results have been impressive. The success of Boston's \ncomprehensive strategy is borne out in these outstanding results:\n  From January 1999 through April 2000, no juvenile in Boston was \nkilled with a firearm.\n  In 1990, 51 Boston young people, ages 24 and under, were murdered by \na firearm. Last year, there were 10 such murders.\n  Reports from emergency rooms about firearm injuries are also down \ndramatically.\n  It's no coincidence that the firearm death rate in Massachusetts is \nsignificantly lower than the national average. We've taken strong and \neffective steps to protect our citizens, our children, and our \ncommunities.\n  When we compare states with tough gun laws to those that have weak \ngun laws, the differences are significant:\n  In 1996, across the nation, the number of firearm-related deaths for \npersons 19 years old or younger was 2 deaths per 100,000 persons.\n  In states that have the weakest gun laws, the number was \nsignificantly higher:\n  Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people--two and a \nhalf times higher than the national average.\n  Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three times \nhigher.\n  Idaho had 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three and a half \ntimes higher.\n  Mississippi had 9.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--four and a \nhalf times higher.\n  No other major nation on earth tolerates such shameful gun violence. \nAccording to a study by the Centers for Disease Control in 1997, the \nrate of firearm deaths among children 0-14 years old is nearly 12 times \nhigher in the United States than in 25 other industrial countries \ncombined.\n  Every day we fail to act, the tragic toll of gun violence climbs \nsteadily higher. In the year since the killings at Columbine High \nSchool in Colorado, 4,560 more children have lost their lives to \ngunfire, and countless more have been injured.\n  We intend to do all we can to see that the Senate votes on these \ncommon sense measures as soon as possible.\n  Today is a new dawn for gun control. On Sunday, finally, the \nimmoveable object we call Congress met the irresistible force of the \nMillion Mom March--and the immoveable object moved.\n  I believe that at long last, Congress will say no to The National \nRifle Association, and yes to the hundreds of thousands of mothers from \nacross the United States who marched on the nation's Capitol to demand \nan end to the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our \nchildren, our homes, our schools, and our country.\n  The Million Mom March focused the attention of the entire country on \nthis critical challenge. It is time--long past time--for Congress to \nend the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control.\n  We already know what needs to be done to reduce the irresponsible \nproliferation of guns and gun violence in communities across the \ncountry. This is not rocket science. We should close the gun show \nloophole. We should require child safety locks for guns. We should \ninsist on licensing for all handgun owners. We should take guns out of \nschools and let children learn in safe classrooms.\n  Enough is enough is enough is enough.\n  I am sure those Americans who have been watching the Senate now for \nthe last 2 hours wonder whether we are going to be able to take very \nmuch action on matters which they consider important to their families.\n  In this particular instance, the issue is whether we are going to \npass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--not even an amendment that would \nbe the basis for legislative action, but just an expression of the \nMembers of this body, as the Senator from California has pointed out, \neffectively commending the participants of the Million Mom March. They \nshould be commended for rallying to demand sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n  Congress should pass a conference report on violent juvenile offender \naccountability before the Memorial Day recess and include the \nLautenberg gun show provision which passed in the Senate, and other \nSenate-passed provisions to limit access to firearms by juveniles, \nconvicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from purchasing \nor possessing firearms.\n  That took just over 2 hours of the Senate's time primarily because of \nthe Republican leadership saying they were not going to permit the \nDemocratic leadership to go on record in the Senate this evening just \nfor the sense of the Senate commending the Million Mom March, and also \nasking that the Senate do what it already should do--that is, pass the \nviolent juvenile offender legislation out of conference where it has \nbeen for 7 months.\n  As a member of the conference committee, we met on two different \noccasions: on the opening occasion, and on the organization. And that \nwas it.\n  It has taken the Republican leadership 2\\1/2\\ hours to say that we \ncan vote on this tomorrow with their permission. They ought to get used \nto the fact\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nthat we are going to continue to press this issue--2 hours to get a \nsense of the Senate to say the mothers, the 750,000 moms who marched \nwith their daughters on Sunday--that they are to be commended. That is \ntroublesome, evidently, to the other side.\n  These moms came from all different parts of the country. Many of them \nhad never participated in any political process at all. They came here \nbecause they wanted the Congress of the United States to debate and \ntake action. They had different views about what specifically should be \nout there. But they had a common sense and a common purpose that we \nshould take some action. We are commending them for doing so. That \nevidently was unacceptable to the Republican leadership.\n  That is what we are facing here, for those who are watching this \nprogram tonight and who saw the march. In the last 2 hours we have been \nunable to get action. It is as clear as can be.\n  There has been objection, parliamentary maneuvering, and gymnastics \nusing the rules of the Senate to deny an expression that we ought to \ncommend the Million Mom March and that we ought to complete what is our \nresponsibility to complete; that is, the conference, and pass sensible \nand commonsense gun control. You would have thought we were repealing \nthe first amendment of the United States. That is what we are facing \nhere. It is so interesting for us to find that out at this time in this \nsession--the difficulty and the complexity we are going to have. But we \nare going to continue to pursue it.\n  I see my friend and our leader from California, Senator Boxer. I am \nglad to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I simply want to say to my friend that \neverything he said was true, except one small point. He said it has \nbeen 2 hours. It has been since 2 o'clock, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts. They delayed for 5 hours the simple vote to say to moms \nwho gave up their Mother's Day and came here: Thank you for what you \nare doing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  We have a short period of time remaining. As a member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we have responsibilities to \ntry to pass education legislation. We had seven votes over a period of \n5 days. That legislation was pulled. We are saying we don't have enough \ntime, we don't have enough time to consider this, although we had all \nday Friday where there were no votes and all day Monday where there \nwere no votes.\n  What we see now is that during the whole course of the afternoon, we \nwere denied the opportunity to have just an expression of the Senate.\n  As I mentioned, this resolution is a simple, straightforward measure. \nFact: Over 400 young people have been killed by gun violence since \n1997. Fact: In the year since the Columbine tragedy, the Senate and \nHouse juvenile justice conference has not taken action to ensure the \npassage of meaningful gun legislation. Fact: Our continued inaction \nposes a threat to public safety.\n  The sense of the Senate does only two things. It commends the \nparticipants of the Million Mom March and calls upon the conference to \npass the language of the Lautenberg measure on the gun show loophole \nthat has passed the Senate, and to take action that is sensible and \nresponsible.\n  I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to respond to an \nargument and to discuss some of the facts which are so compelling, \nparticularly about the children, because we as a country and as a \nsociety refuse to take action. The latest data released in 1999 shows \nin a single year--and this can't tell the story because for every \nstatistic, for every individual there is a name and a face behind \nthis--what has been happening: 4,205 children and teens were killed by \ngunfire--1 every 2 hours, nearly 12 a day; 2,562 were murdered by \ngunfire; 1,262 committed suicide using a firearm--more than 3 every \nday; 306 died from accidental shooting; 2,357 were white and 1,687 were \nblack; 629 were under 15; 191 were under 10; 84 were under 5 years of \nage; nearly 3 times as many children under 10 died from gunfire as the \nnumber of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. We know \nthat the American children under 15 are 12 times more likely to die \nfrom gunfire than children in 25 other industrial countries combined; \nhomicide is the third leading cause of death among children 5 to 14; \n61% of the 80,000 children killed by gunfire since 1979 were white; 36% \nwere black; children are twice as likely as adults to be victims of \nviolent crime, and more likely to be killed by adults than other \nchildren; white youths are six times more likely to commit suicide than \nblack youths although the suicide rate for black youths is up more than \n100 percent since 1980.\n  We do not believe this legislation is necessarily going to be the \nonly answer. We understand that. We do understand this is a step that \ncan be taken now to make a difference about the proliferation of \nweapons and the easy access to weapons.\n  Various studies and polls show the number of children who say how \neasy it is for them to acquire weapons in our country today. We want to \nreduce that availability and that accessibility. We understand there \nare legitimate issues with which we have to deal. I want to dispose of \na few of them. One has been the argument that has been raised that \nthere hasn't been a sufficient effort in the area of law enforcement.\n  Reading through our Republican sense of the Senate, they talk about \nlaw enforcement. It is an interesting fact that Republicans have cut \nback on the total number of agents who have been most involved in law \nenforcement--the ATF agents--over the last 15 years.\n  Back to the prosecutions and the important point which our Republican \nfriends ought to understand because their sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is basically flawed in what they say about the prosecutions: \nAlthough the number of Federal prosecutions for lower level offenders--\npersons serving sentences of 3 years or less--has dropped, the number \nof high-level offenders--those sentenced to 5 years or more--is up by \nnearly 30 percent. Do we understand that? If we are talking about the \nmore serious aspect of gun prosecutions, they are up by 30 percent.\n  I hope our Republican friends acknowledge their findings which are \nflawed in their presentation on this issue. At the same time, the total \nnumber of Federal and State prosecutions is up sharply. About 25 \npercent more criminals are sent to prisons for State and Federal \nweapons offenses than in 1992. The number of high-level offenders is up \nnearly 30 percent. The total number of Federal and State prosecutions \nis up 25 percent or more. The total number of prosecutions--local, \nFederal, and State--are up significantly.\n\n  We hear from the National Rifle Association that all that is needed \nis further prosecution under the law, but that is happening at the \npresent time. What we need is action over the proliferation of weapons. \nWe have tried in recent times on our side, with strong support, to make \nprogress regarding the proliferation of weapons.\n  Moving along to some of the other challenges that children are \nfacing, in November of last year in the Senate, the mental health bill \nwas passed unanimously, by Republican and Democrats alike. We are still \nwaiting over in the House of Representatives for the Republican \nleadership to call that up.\n  What does that bill do? That bill directly addresses the problems of \nviolence in children's lives. The first section of the bill provides \ngrants to public entities for programs in local communities to help \nchildren deal with violence. Community partnerships are created among \nlaw enforcement, education systems, mental health, and substance abuse \nsystems. These partnerships provide a comprehensive response to \nviolence, and include security, education reform, prevention, and early \nintervention services for mental health and substance abuse problems, \nas well as early childhood and development and social services.\n  Recognizing what is happening in many of our urban areas, I know in \nmy city of Boston, a third of the children who come to school each day \ncome from schools where there is abuse--physical abuse and substance \nabuse. Those children need help. They have problems. Those who are the \nstrongest supporters of eliminating the proliferation of weapons \navailable to children have been fighting for these kinds of efforts.\n  Nonetheless, our Republican leadership is opposed to all of our \nefforts and\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nrefuses to take action in those areas. It wasn't that long ago, in \n1995, when we tried to get the Center for Disease Control to have a \nsurvey of gun violence and our House Republican budget proposed a \nphaseout of the Center for Injury Control because it was just \ncollecting information about violence and guns in schools.\n  Not only are they opposed to trying to take direct action on the \nproliferation of guns, not only are they opposed, evidently--because \nthey are refusing to take up legislation to deal with some of the other \naspects of guns--but on the other hand, they are absolutely opposed to \neven permitting the Center for Disease Control, the premier \norganization in the world in terms of public health services, from \nhaving any collection of material on gun violence.\n  In 1996, the appropriation was cut by $2.6 million, the appropriation \nof the Center for Disease Control, for injury control. That is the \nexact amount CDC was spending to survey gun violence. Since then, the \nCDC found other ways to continue the survey of gun violence, but \nRepublicans have fought us every step along the way. That is what we \nare pointing out.\n  We are pointing out a number of things. First of all, if you can do \nsomething for effective law enforcement as well as prevention programs, \nyou can have a dramatic impact on violence in communities. I want to \nshow what has happened in my own State of Massachusetts where we have \npassed some of the toughest gun laws. We have a ban on carrying \nconcealed weapons. A permit is required to do so. Local law enforcement \nhas discretion to issue permits, and an individual must show a need in \norder to obtain the permit.\n  We have a minimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun.\n  We have increased penalties for felons in possession of firearms.\n  We require the sale of child safety locks with all fire arms.\n  We have an adult responsibility law. Adults are liable if a child \nobtains an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself \nor any other person.\n  We have gun-free school laws.\n  We have a licensing law for the purchase of guns. We have strict \nstandards for the licensing of gun dealers. We have a waiting period \nfor handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 days to obtain a permit. We \nhave a permit requirement for secondary and private sales of guns.\n  We have a ban on Saturday night specials, and we have a requirement \nfor reporting lost or stolen firearms.\n  What have been the results? In the city of Boston, we see what the \ndifference has been. In 1990, homicides of those 16 and under: 10 a \nyear. See how this has gradually been phased out as these measures have \nbeen passed, down to the year 2000 where, in the first 3 months of the \nyear, for youth homicides, we have not had one yet.\n  Does that mean something to anybody? Obviously we have had a very \npowerful impact. That is not just because of this legislation which has \nbeen enormously important, but we have also had a very effective \nprogram in prevention and intervention as well as enforcement. As \nCommissioner Paul Evans said, you have to have all the legs of the \nstool to be effective. Commissioner Evans also states:\n  To be effective, efforts must be targeted and cooperative. Police \nofficers must be able to work closely with churches, schools, health \nand mental health providers. Afterschool programs are essential to help \nkeep juveniles off the streets and out of trouble, away from guns and \ndrugs.\n  In developing an effective approach like this, Boston has become a \nmodel for the rest of the country. On this chart, here is the city of \nBoston: Firearm homicides, 50 a year in 1990, and now we are down, in \nthe year 2000, to 3 this particular year. That is because of tough laws \nwith effective efforts that include many of the different provisions we \nhave talked about here in our SAMSHA program: Working with troubled \nyouth; trying to work with children to deal with violence in their \ncommunities; community partnership among law enforcement, education, \nand mental health and substance abuse systems. Those have been local \nefforts--some supported by the States--that are effective. Prevention \nand tough laws; we are finding out the scores, the hundreds of children \nwho are alive today that I dare say probably would not be if we did not \nhave an effective effort against the proliferation of weapons as well \nas prevention.\n\n  There are partnerships between the Boston public schools and local \nmental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health \nprofessionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in \norder to prevent violence by students. Boston police work actively with \nparents, schools, and other officials discussing incidents in and out \nof schools involving students. The Boston Public Health Commission \npromotes programs by the Boston Police Department and the results have \nbeen impressive.\n  From January 1999 through April of 2000, no juvenile in Boston was \nkilled with a firearm. We ought to be able to at least debate this \nissue in the Senate. If there are those who take issue with what we \nhave represented tonight about the effectiveness of a strong prevention \nprogram in terms of proliferation weapons, and also a prevention \nprogram working with a range of different social services, come out \nhere on the floor and let's debate it and call the roll.\n  But, oh, no, the Republican leadership says. Oh, no, we are not even \ngoing to let you, over 5 hours, pass a resolution commending the \nMillion Mom March, or that we ought to get the bill out of the \nconference, where we have been for 8 months. Why is it they are so \nnervous about it? Why is it, when we have results that we are prepared \nto defend that can demonstrate we can save lives in this country, but \nthat we are denied the opportunity to do so? That is what is \nunacceptable. People are milling around saying: when are we going to \nend this evening? We have places to go. We have places to go--here on \nthe floor of the Senate. We have things to do, and that is here in the \nSenate. That is what we are elected for.\n  The leader, Senator Daschle, has outlined what we want to be able to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has another 9 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me point out, when we compare States with tough gun \nlaws to those that have weak gun laws--let's take a look at that. We \nare constantly told tough gun laws do not make any difference, they \nreally do not make any difference.\n  Listen to this. In 1996, across the Nation the number of firearm-\nrelated deaths for persons 19 years old or younger were 2 deaths per \n100,000. That is across the country, 2 deaths per 100,000. In the \nStates that have the weakest gun laws, the number was significantly \nhigher. Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000, 2.5 times \nhigher than the national average. These are, effectively, for children \nunder 19 years of age. Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per \n100,000, 3 times higher; Idaho, 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000, \n3.5 times higher; Mississippi, 9.2 firearms-related deaths per 100,000, \n4.5 times higher. No other nation on Earth tolerates such shameful gun \nviolence.\n  Where we have had effective laws and preventive programs we have \nreduction in the violence against children. Where we have weaker laws, \nwe see the expanded number of deaths of children in our country. There \nmay be other reasons for it, but come out here and defend it. We are \nprepared to debate these issues. But we are unable to do so because of \nthese magic words: ``I suggest the absence of a quorum.''\n  If you took away the words, ``I suggest the absence of a quorum,'' \nperhaps we could get some action around here. But we cannot and \ntherefore we are stymied, at least to date, although we will have some \nopportunities to get some expressions tomorrow, and we are going to try \nto get action on these measures before the end of the session.\n  We are prepared to insist that action be taken on these measures. I \nwill just conclude by reading some of the comments of children. These \nare the words of Columbine students who witnessed a horrible tragedy \nlast year. This is a quote from Valeen Schnurr:\n\n       The nights are always the worst. Inevitably, I find my \n     thoughts drifing into nightmares, terrifying images of the \n     library at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. The sound \n     of students screaming as explosive and gunshots echo through \n     the school; the burning pain of the bullets penetrating my \n     body; the sound of my voice professing my faith in God; \n     seeing my hands fill with my own\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\n     blood; and my friend Lauren Townsend lying lifeless beside me \n     as I try to wake her.\n       In the mornings when I look in the mirror, the scars I see \n     on my arms and upper body always remind me that it's not just \n     a nightmare, but the memory of a real event that will stay \n     with me for the rest of my life. The scars are a part of me \n     now, but they help me to remember that I've been blessed with \n     a second chance at life.\n\n  From Garrett Looney:\n\n       I've never been ashamed to be an athlete. I started playing \n     football when I was eight, and baseball and basketball too. \n     This spring, I'll run track. Sports have always been part of \n     me. *  *  *\n       I'd been in the library that day, about 11 a.m., making \n     some copies. Then I left with friends for lunch. We were \n     heading back to school and thought there was a bad wreck \n     because a fireman stopped us. We went to Clement Park, next \n     to Columbine, and saw a sea of kids running from the \n     building. We couldn't believe it. It's beyond me how two kids \n     could go that crazy *  *  *\n       A friend of mine, Corey Depooter was killed. I had one \n     [woodworking] class with him, and we did projects together. \n     It was hard going back to that class. The seniors on the \n     football team took memorial pictures of a columbine flower to \n     the victims' houses, including Mrs. Depooter's. She wanted to \n     know how we were doing and told us stories about Corey. That \n     was tough for me.\n\n  The list goes on, Mr. President. Here is Nicole Nowlen:\n\n       I was only at Columbine for seven weeks be fore (the \n     shooting). My parents are divorced, and I had been living in \n     Sioux Falls, S. Dak., with my mother and younger brother, \n     Adam. When my mom moved to California, I chose to live with \n     my dad in Colorado. *  *  *\n       On April 20, I was sitting alone at a table in the library \n     doing my math homework when this girl ran in and yelled. \n     ``There are guys with guns downstairs:'' I thought it was a \n     senior prank *  *  *\n       The time seemed to go in slow motion. And then they came \n     in.\n       I don't remember much until they got over into our area. I \n     could see John watching where they were walking. I was trying \n     to pick up expressions from his face, and I could hear them \n     walking over to this table full of girls next to us. I \n     remember this gun going off, and one of the gunmen saying, \n     ``Do you believe in God?'' And I remember thinking, ``These \n     people are sick.''\n  The stories go on.\n  We have had Paducah, KY. We have had Jonesboro, AR. We have had \nColumbine. Those who forget history are fated to repeat it. We have \nfailed to take action. America has witnessed these shootings over the \nyears. Every single day in cities, in communities, in rural areas, 12 \nchildren die. These are dramatic incidents which catch the heart, as \nthey should, and the soul of every American, and it is happening every \nsingle day.\n  We can make a difference. We can reduce these incidents. Perhaps we \ncannot eliminate them all, but we can reduce significantly the total \nnumber of children who are lost every day. We fail to reduce the number \nif we refuse to take action in this area.\n  I hope the Senate will go on record in support of the Daschle sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment. I hope this will just be the beginning. I know \nit will be for many of our colleagues, including my two dear friends, \nthe Senators from California and Illinois, who have been providing \nleadership for our Nation in this area. We are going to respond to the \nMillion Mom March. They asked for action. We committed ourselves to \ntaking action.\n  I look forward to working with them and others in making every effort \nwe possibly can to reduce the proliferation of weapons that should not \nbe available to children in this country. We can make a difference. I \nlook forward to working with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his remarks. I know \nhe watched with great pride while Kerry, Kennedy, Cuomo, and Kathleen \nKennedy Townsend spoke at the Million Mom March with hearts full. I \nknow the people who came to that march, particularly those who \nwitnessed and experienced pain, loss, and suffering have inspired \npeople across the country.\n  I say to my friend, before I yield time to my friend from Illinois, \nthat he is powerful on this issue. He is a powerful spokesperson for \nthe children of this Nation. I was so happy he chose to come over here \ntonight. It is late in the evening. I know we will work together, as so \nmany of us will on this side of the aisle, and hopefully a couple from \nthe other, in making sure those moms who gave up their Mother's Day for \na cause that is so important will be commended by this Senate. For \ngoodness' sake, will be commended. As Hillary Clinton said, they did \nnot care about the flowers; they did not care about the fancy dinners \nor breakfast in bed. They gave up their Mother's Day to march for \nsomething that was very important to them, more important than anything \nelse: the safety of their children and the safety of the communities' \nchildren.\n  I say to my friend, thank you for making this point over and over. \nThe other side seems to be fearful of these moms. Why don't they vote \ndown our resolution if they do not like it? No, they stalled 5 hours \nbecause they wanted the clock to tick, and they are not even here to \ndebate us on this amendment.\n  We voted out sensible gun measures. What are they afraid of, I ask my \nfriend from Massachusetts? Sensible gun measures passed the Senate--\nchild safety locks, background checks at gun shows, the banning of the \nsuperlarge capacity clips, a study to investigate how the gun \nmanufacturers are marketing to our children, and changing the age at \nwhich one can buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21. A few of them \ncrossed over, and this Senate voted for those measures.\n  Before my friend leaves, I want to ask him this question, and then I \nwill yield as much time as he would like to the Senator from Illinois. \nI wonder if my friend can explain to me, because he has been around \nhere a long time, of what are they afraid? Why don't they just vote it \ndown? Why don't they just say: No, we don't want to commend the moms; \nno, we don't want to bring these commonsense gun laws to the Senate? \nWhy are they using every parliamentary trick not to have to vote on \nthat?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator from California, it defies every \nlogical explanation. The alleged explanation is that we do not need \nthese additional laws; what we need is the enforcement of existing \nlaws; why waste our time on the floor of the Senate in considering \nthese measures because if we dealt with these other measures, our \nproblems would be resolved.\n  That is, of course, a flawed factual representation, as I mentioned, \nin terms of total prosecutions, and it is wrong in terms of fact, not \nonly, as I mentioned, in total prosecutions, but it is wrong in terms \nof what can be done in States across this country.\n  I thank the Senator from California for raising these questions this \nevening for Americans. The question is, At least, why can't we vote? \nWhy can't we vote? Why can't we have accountability? Why aren't they \nproud of their position? Why aren't they proud of their position and \nwilling to take a stand on it? That is what this office is about: \nmaking choices and decisions; exercising some judgment. Why constantly \ntry to frustrate the ability of Members to make some difference on \nthis?  I think that is the inexcusable position which hopefully the \nAmerican public will find unacceptable in the remaining weeks of this \nsession and, if not, then during the election.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and yield as much time as he will \nconsume to my friend from Illinois. If he is still going in 30 minutes, \nperhaps he would then wrap up in the next 15, and I would conclude this \nside's debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I salute my colleague from the State of Massachusetts. Senator \nKennedy has been the leader on so many issues throughout his political \ncareer. You can almost count on it: It is late at night--7:30 p.m. on \nthe Senate floor. Very few Senators are still around to debate this \nimportant issue. But Senator Kennedy, who has become legendary in his \ncommitment to issues in the Senate, stayed for this important debate. I \nam honored to share the floor with him. I am honored to share the same \nposition on this issue with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBoxer.\n  As Senator Boxer noted earlier, at the Million Mom March in \nWashington, there were several members of Senator Kennedy's family who \ncame and spoke about what gun violence has meant to them. America knows \nthat story. America knows it so well. America knows of the \nassassination of President John Kennedy, of the assassination of \nSenator Robert Kennedy, and all the tragedies that have befallen that \nfamily. We know it because they are so\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nprominent in the American culture and the American political scene. We \nknow, as well, that people with less prominent names, not that well \nknown, have endured gun violence on a daily basis.\n  At the end of the Million Mom March, in Chicago, a spokesman for one \nof the group's sponsoring it, the Bell Campaign Fund, brought a bell \nnear the stage and invited the families to come up and ring it if they \nhad lost someone to gun violence in their family.\n  At first they were hesitant to come forward; and then more started to \nmove forward. Finally, it became a long, long procession of young and \nold, of those who were not well dressed and those who were very well \ndressed, of rich and poor, of black and white and brown, of children \nand of the elderly. They came forward--hesitated--and rang the bell. \nThey had lost someone in their family to gun violence.\n\n  As you watched this procession go by, anyone observing it could not \nhelp but think there but for the grace of God go I; it can happen to \nany family in America.\n  A nation of 270 million people, and a nation of over 200 million \nguns, a nation where every day we pick up a newspaper, turn on the \nradio, or turn on the television, to hear of another gun death. The sad \nreality is that we have become inured to it. We have become used to it. \nWe think this is what life is like in the world. It is not. It is what \nlife is like in America-- in America, where we have failed to pass \nlegislation for gun safety, to make the neighborhoods and the schools, \nthe towns, and the cities across America safer places to live.\n  What calls our attention to this steady stream of information about \ngun violence is the most outrageous situations. For the last several \nyears, the most outrageous gun violence has occurred in America's \nschools:\n  In February, 1997, in Bethel, AK, a 16-year-old boy took a shotgun \nand a bag of shells to school, killing the principal and a student and \ninjuring two others.\n  On October 1, 1997, in Pearl, MS, a 16-year-old boy is sentenced to \nlife in prison for killing his mother and then going to his high school \nand shooting nine students, two of them fatally.\n  On December 1, 1997, in West Paducah, KY, three students are killed, \nfive others wounded at the high school; a 14-year-old student pleaded \nguilty--mentally ill--to murder.\n  On March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, AR--you will remember this one--four \ngirls and a teacher killed and 10 people wounded at a middle school, \nwhen two boys, aged 11 and 13, fired from a nearby woods. They \nliterally brought an arsenal of weapons and ammunition. They triggered \nthe fire alarm bell. The kids ran out of the classroom and they opened \nfire.\n  America, 1998:\n  On April 24 of that year, in Edinboro, PA, a science teacher is \nkilled in front of his students at an eighth grade dance. A 15-year-old \npleaded guilty.\n  On May 19, 1998, in Fayetteville, TN, 3 days before graduation, an \n18-year-old honors student opened fire at his high school, killing a \nclassmate who was dating his ex-girlfriend.\n  On May 21, 1998, in Springfield, OR, two teenagers are killed and \nmore than 20 hurt when a teenage boy opened fire at his high school, \nafter killing his parents.\n  On April 20, 1999--the news story of the year in America; you may not \nhave heard of the town before, but you know the name now--in Littleton, \nCO, two students at Columbine High School killed 12 of their classmates \nand a teacher and wounded 23 others before killing themselves.\n  That was supposed to be the gun tragedy that turned this issue \naround. Congress was supposed to wake up at that point and finally do \nsomething to protect America from gun violence.\n  Of course, we considered legislation on the floor of the Senate, and \nit was a long, painful debate. The bill finally came up before us, and \non a vote of 49-49--a tie vote--Vice President Gore came to this \nChamber, cast the tie-breaking vote, and we passed a gun safety bill \nwhich, under the Constitution, then went to the House of \nRepresentatives across the Rotunda.\n  Was this a radical bill? Was this something so outlandish  that we \ncould not expect the House of Representatives to consider it? I do not \nthink so. Forty-eight of my colleagues and myself believed it was a \nsensible gun control measure.\n\n  What did it say?\n  If you buy a gun at a gun show, we want to make sure you can legally \nown it.\n  If you have a criminal record, we do not want you to buy it.\n  If you are a child, we do not want you to buy it.\n  If you have a restraining order because of domestic violence or \nsomething else, we do not want you to buy it.\n  If you have a history of violent mental illness, we do not want you \nto buy a gun.\n  We want to check your background and make sure you do not have a \nproblem where you should not own a gun.\n  Is this a radical idea, keeping guns out of the hands of people who \nare criminals? The Brady law, which we passed in America, has kept guns \nout of the hands of hundreds of thousands of people such as those I \ndescribed. And you think to yourself: Come on now, somebody convicted \nof a murder surely is not going to walk into a Federal gun dealer and \ntry to buy a gun. Yes, they do it--time and time again.\n  Nobody said they were rocket scientists. They are people who were \ncriminals and want to be criminals again. They may not be very bright, \nbut they are smart enough to know they need another gun to pull off \nanother crime.\n  We stop them with the Brady law. But the Brady law does not apply to \ngun shows. Gun shows across America are a loophole; they are exempt. \nYou buy what you want at a gun show and nobody checks. Think about \nthat. Even the least intelligent criminal will figure that out: Go to a \ngun show and get your gun. Do not go to a dealer. The dealer is going \nto check it out, find out if you have a criminal record.\n  So we said, in this gun safety law, let's do a background check at \ngun shows. Let's apply this same law we apply to gun dealers. That is \nnot a radical idea. It is common sense.\n  Senator Kohl of Wisconsin had an amendment--part of this bill--that \nevery handgun in America would be sold with a trigger lock, a child \nsafety device.\n  It is interesting. We have many sportsmen and hunters in my family. \nThey are strong in the belief that this is their right to own a gun; \nand I do not dispute it. But they are also strong in the belief that \nthey never want their gun to harm anyone else, any innocent victim. \nThey certainly do not want their gun to harm a child. Now they are \nturning around and buying trigger locks. I am glad they are.\n  Senator Kohl says, from now on, every handgun sold in America will \nhave a trigger lock so that the parent who puts their gun up on the top \nshelf of the closet, thinking their little son or daughter will never \nfind it--they may be wrong, but the child may be safe because with the \ntrigger lock the child will not be able to fire the gun.\n  That is not a radical idea. That is part of gun safety. In fact, if \nthere had been trigger locks in Jonesboro, AR, maybe these kids could \nnot have taken the guns out in the woods, with an 11-year-old kid \nfiring away at teachers and classmates.\n  No. I think, quite honestly, we all believe that if you are going to \nexercise any right to own a gun, you should exercise the responsibility \nto store it safely, securely, and away from children.\n  That is part of the bill sent to the House, a bill which still \nlanguishes. Senator Feinstein of California has a provision that says \nyou don't need a huge ammo clip with literally hundreds of rounds of \nammunition for any sport or any hunting. So as you cannot manufacture \nthem in America, you should not be able to import them from overseas. \nThat doesn't sound radical to me. I don't know many people who need a \nhundred rounds to go out and kill a deer. As I have said many times, if \nyou need an assault weapon to kill a deer, maybe you ought to stick to \nfishing. But the fact is, Senator Feinstein's amendment was adopted as \npart of the bill.\n  We had an amendment by a Republican, Senator John Ashcroft of \nMissouri, that would limit who could buy semiautomatic assault \nweapons--certainly making sure that those under age of 18 cannot--and \nestablishing an age of 21. We had an amendment by Senator Boxer to have \nthe FTC and\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nthe Attorney General investigate whether gun companies were trying to \nattract young buyers, underage buyers, with their advertising.\n  That is it. I have just described the entire gun safety bill. Did you \nhear anything that is patently unconstitutional, so radical and \noutlandish that we should not consider it in America? I don't think so. \nIn that amendment, we have basic, commonsense efforts to make America \nsafer. I am not so naive as to believe that we are going to end gun \nviolence by passing this bill, but we think it will help. We certainly \nhave an obligation to help. We passed that bill in the Senate, sent it \nover to the House, and the National Rifle Association tore it to \npieces, passed a weak substitute, sent it to a conference committee \nwhere it has sat for 8 months, since Columbine High School. We have had \nall sorts of meetings on the floor of the Senate and in the House, all \nsorts of debates and committee meetings, all sorts of press \nconferences, and we have done absolutely nothing to make America safer \nwhen it comes to gun violence.\n  What do we have to show for it? Since Columbine High School, on May \n20, 1999, in Conyers, GA, a 15-old-boy opened fire in a high school \nwith a .357 caliber handgun and a rifle wounding six students.\n  On November 19, 1999, in Deming, NM, a 13-year-old girl was shot in \nthe head at school and died the next day. A 12-year-old boy was \narrested.\n  On December 6, 1999, at Fort Gibson, OK, a 13-year-old student fired \nat least 15 rounds in a middle school wounding four classmates. Asked \nwhy he did it, he said, ``I don't know.''\n  February 29, 2000, is one you won't forget. At Mount Morris Township, \nMI, a 6-year-old boy pulled a .32 caliber Davis Industry semiautomatic \npistol out of his pocket, pointed it at a classmate, turned the gun on \nKayla Rolland, a little 6-year-old girl, and fatally shot her in the \nneck.\n  That is America since Columbine. America, unfortunately, is very busy \nwith gun violence but, sadly, the Congress is not busy with legislation \nto reduce and end gun violence. So today, Senator Daschle came to the \nfloor with a suggestion, one which obviously did not set well with the \nRepublican majority. Senator Daschle suggested that we pass a \nresolution--and I want to read the language--that it is the sense of \nthe Senate that the organizers, sponsors, and participants of the \nMillion Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand sensible \ngun safety legislation, and Congress should immediately pass \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 1501--the bill I described, the \ngun safety bill--that includes all the provisions that I described, and \ndo so as soon as possible.\n\n  With those two suggestions, the Republican majority stopped the \nSenate for 5 straight hours. They would not have this Senate vote to \ncommend the organizers and mothers who participated in the Million Mom \nMarch, and they did not want this Congress to go on the record to pass \ngun safety legislation for 5 hours. They tried every parliamentary \ntrick they could to stop this, and then when they found we were \ndetermined to bring this to a vote, they finally relented at about 3 \no'clock. They said: All right, you can debate it a couple hours tonight \nand a couple hours tomorrow. That is why we are here.\n  I salute Senator Boxer of California. As you can tell, many Members \nof the Senate had other things they wanted to do. But she and I and \nSenator Kennedy and so many others believe that after we have seen what \nthose mothers went through to put together that march to come out and \nask us to pass sensible legislation, we owed it to them to be here this \nevening and speak to it.\n  Let me talk about two or three issues that will come up in this \ndebate. The National Rifle Association spent a substantial sum of money \nlast week on television in preparation for the Million Mom March. They \nran a lot of ads showing a member of their board of directors--a \nwoman--who articulated their point of view, as well as their personal \nhero, Mr. Charlton Heston. They said during the course of these ads \nthat what we need in America to reduce the killing of 12 or 13 children \na day is more education. They use something called Eddie Eagle, which \nis like Joe Camel, for the NRA. It is a little symbol they use to try \nto attract children's attention with it. They say if we have more Eddie \nEagle training in schools, we will have fewer gun deaths.\n  Well, this may surprise some, but I don't disagree with the NRA, to \nsome extent. If they are suggesting we should teach children that guns \nare dangerous and they ought to stay away from them, I salute that and \nagree with that. In a nation of 200 million guns, we should do that. \nMembers of my staff in Chicago and in Washington sit down with 4- and \n5-year-old children and explain to them that guns are dangerous. You \nhave to do it in America. Even if there is not a gun in your home, you \ndon't know where your child may be playing or whether their classmate \nis going to find a gun. You should tell them that. It is a reality.\n  But if the National Rifle Association thinks education of children to \nreduce gun violence means teaching kids to shoot straight, that is \nwhere I part company with them. I don't think kids should be handling \nfirearms. I think firearms should be in the hands of adults who \nunderstand the danger of a weapon. I go along with the National Rifle \nAssociation if they want to join us in educating children in school \nabout the danger of firearms. That makes sense. Maybe we can find some \ncommon ground on that.\n  The second thing the NRA tells us is we have all the laws we need. \nAll the States have laws, some of the cities have laws, and the Federal \nGovernment has all the laws it needs and, for goodness' sake, just \nenforce the law. This may surprise the NRA, but I don't disagree with \nthat either. We should enforce the laws. In fact, we find that when it \ncomes to the number of high-level firearm offenders, those sentenced to \n5 or more years, Federal prosecution of those offenders has gone up \n41 percent under this administration. The average sentence for firearm \noffenders in Federal court has increased by more than 2 years in that \nsame period of time. Enforcement is taking place. Should there be more? \nYes, and I will support that, too.\n\n  But let me tell you, there was an interesting vote on the floor. One \nof the Senators who opposed my motion on the floor is here this \nevening. When it came to enforcement, I asked those who are friends of \nthe National Rifle Association to put their votes where their rhetoric \nhappened to be. I asked them if they would join me in supporting \nPresident Clinton, who asked for 500 more agents at the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to investigate firearms dealers who were \nviolating the law and to make sure that we kept an eye on the people \nwho were selling the weapons, and a thousand more prosecutors and \njudges and others across America to prosecute the same gun laws. I \noffered the amendment on the floor, and one of the Senators, who is \nhere and is a member of the board of directors--or was--of the NRA, \namended it and said take out the part on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms, the 500 additional agents, and then we will vote for it.\n  So that really calls into question their sincerity when they say they \nwant more enforcement. It turns out a very small percentage of firearms \ndealers in America actually sell guns used in crimes. Most of them \nabide by the law. We want to stop the ones who violate the law. When I \ntried to put more agents at work to do that, I was stopped by a \nRepublican Senator who says he believes in the second amendment but \nwants enforcement but he would not vote for 500 ATF agents for more \nenforcement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think the Senator makes a very important \npoint here. When we call for sensible gun laws, the other side gets up \nand says we can handle it all with enforcement. Do you know what we \nsay? Excellent idea--enforcement and sensible gun laws. Let's join \nhands and do it all; that is what we need to protect our people. Yet as \nmy friend says, when he attempted to do just that, the other side found \nfault with it.\n  I want to ask my friend if he is aware of what the Republican \nAppropriations Committee did on the House side with a number of Capitol \nPolice officers? I know my friend is just as distressed. I discussed \nthis with him.\n\n  We lost two beautiful Capitol Police officers. What were they doing? \nThey\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nwere protecting the people in this building. They were protecting the \nMembers of the House and the Senate, and they were shot down in the \nprime of their lives. They have magnificent families. We went to a \nfuneral. We all cried. Republicans and Democrats cried tears. Now what \nhappens? The people who want the enforcement, what have they done on \nthe House side?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The House Appropriations Committee, barely 2 years after \ntwo Capitol policemen were killed protecting the Members of Congress \nand visitors in the Capitol Building, has proposed that we cut by 400 \nthe number of Capitol Police working at the Capitol. It is an \nincredible suggestion. We have doors leading into the office buildings \nand into the Capitol that literally hundreds, if not thousands, of \npeople pass through but where there is one security guard. Many believe \nthere should be two at these doors that are the busiest.\n  Instead of enhancing the Capitol Police so they can do their job and \nbe safe in doing it, the House Republican leadership called for cutting \n400 Capitol policemen. That does not sound like good law enforcement \nand vigorous law enforcement. Just the opposite is true. They are \nsuggesting, for more enforcement of the law, cutting back on the police \nafter we had the terrible tragedy right here in the Capitol not that \nlong ago.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The old expression is hackneyed now but ``actions speak \nlouder than words.'' I think when you stand up on the floor and you \nsay, ``More enforcement, more enforcement,'' then you cut 400 police \nofficers out of this Capitol Police Force, and you go to Senator \nDurbin's resolution on hiring more agents so we can crack down on the \ngun criminals, it doesn't add up. Something is not adding up here.\n  I have to say it is time we just spoke very directly about it. It is \nhard. It is hard to pick a fight, and it is hard to get into an \nargument and debate on the other side of the aisle because we don't \ncontrol this Senate. But we have our rights. Senator Durbin represents \na very large State. I represent a very large State. People sent us here \nnot to just sit back and do nothing but in fact to speak out.\n  I thank my friend, and he can continue for as long as he wishes \ntonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I also want to tell you that I think this issue is an important \nnational issue in this Presidential campaign because I think what you \nhear from two candidates is a clear difference when it comes to dealing \nwith sensible gun laws and gun safety.\n  Vice President Gore came to the Senate floor casting the deciding \nvote on the gun safety bill, which I mentioned earlier. He has \nsupported it publicly. He has spoken in favor of it. I believe it is \nfair to say he has supported the Brady law, he has supported the \nassault weapon ban, and he has supported efforts to have a waiting \nperiod so people do not in a high state of emotion go out and buy a gun \nand harm themselves or others. That is a matter of record. That is his \nposition.\n  On the other side, the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, has a much \ndifferent record. In his State, he signed into law a concealed weapon \nlaw which allows people to carry guns into churches and synagogues.\n  There are people who believe we will be a safer nation if everybody \ncarries a gun. I am not one of them. I happen to believe we are not a \nsafer nation when the couple is arguing across the restaurant and you \nhave to wonder whether or not someone is going to reach into their \npocket or purse and pull out a gun.\n  I don't happen to believe we are a safer nation whenever a policeman \nwho pulls a car over is doubly worried and concerned that that speeder \nmay have a gun in the glove compartment instead of the registration \nthey are apparently going after.\n  I don't believe we are a safer nation when people are carrying guns \nto public events, such as high school football games, or are taking \nthem into churches. I don't believe that makes America safer.\n  Governor Bush signed a law in Texas so people would have a right in \nthe State of Texas to carry guns around. That is his image of a safer \nAmerica; it is not mine. I am glad my State of Illinois has not passed \nsuch a law, and I hope we never do.\n  In addition, it appears that one of the problems the Republican Party \nhas with our gun safety bill is that we require background checks at \ngun shows. Which State has more gun shows than any other State in the \nNation? The State of Texas. The provision in the law--the loophole in \nthe Brady law--which said you don't do a background check at a gun show \nwas put in by a Democratic Texas Congressman. It is an important \nindustry, I take it, in the State of Texas to preserve these gun laws. \nIt may be the reason Governor Bush will not come out and support the \ngun safety law which passed in the Senate with Vice President Gore's \ntie-breaking vote.\n  Finally, the day before the Million Mom March weekend, Governor Bush \ncame on television and said: I tell you what we are going to do in \nTexas. We are going to make a lot of trigger locks available. We are \ngoing to buy a lot of them and give them away.\n  I am glad he is doing it. I think it is a nice thing to do. It is \ncertainly not a comprehensive attitude toward dealing with gun \nviolence. I would like to see more communities and States do that. But \ncertainly I would like to see Senator Kohl's amendment which requires a \ntrigger lock with every gun as part of a law of the land, so that when \nyou buy a handgun, it has a trigger lock and it has a child safety \ndevice. A once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-decade effort by a Governor \nin any State won't make any difference unless it is in a comprehensive \napproach,  as Senator Kohl has suggested.\n\n  It is interesting to note that when the Republican leadership is \nasked why they have failed in over 8 months to bring this gun safety \nlegislation to the floor, they in the majority and in control of the \nHouse and Senate say it is the Democrats' fault. That is a little hard \nto understand. In fact, it is impossible to believe.\n  I have been appointed to conference committees in the Senate in name \nonly where my name will be read by the President and only the \nconference committee of Republicans goes off and meets, adopts a \nconference committee report, signs it, and sends it back to the floor \nwithout even inviting me to attend a session. The Republican leadership \nmajority could do that at any moment in time. To suggest that somehow \nthe Democrats are stopping them from bringing a gun safety bill out of \ncommittee and to the floor just defies common sense. They are in \ncontrol. They have to accept responsibility for their actions.\n  Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican of Utah, is the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. He is the head conferee on the Senate side \nfor the Republicans on this conference on gun safety. My colleague from \nthe State of Illinois, Congressman Henry Hyde, chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee, shares that responsibility with him. And the two \nof them have a majority of votes in this conference committee. If they \nwanted to bring a gun safety bill forward, there is nothing the \nDemocrats could do to stop them from doing such. Yet they haven't done \nit. Eight months have passed, and more people have been shot and \nkilled.\n  Stories come out suggesting to us there is much more to it. Unless \nand until Governor Bush decides this is an important issue in his \nPresidential campaign, unless and until Governor Bush decides he is for \ngun safety, that bill is going to stay in that conference committee. \nThat is a simple political fact of life.\n  The Republicans on Capitol Hill don't want to embarrass their \ncandidate for President by bringing out a bill he opposes. So the bill \nsits in this conference committee. And 750,000 mothers across America \nrallied in 65 different cities saying to Members of Congress, Members \nof the House and the Senate: For goodness' sake, can you put party \naside for a moment and think about the safety of our children in \nschools? Can you put party aside for a moment and think about the \nsafety of our neighborhoods so that we believe kids can stand at the \nbus stop without worrying about a gang banger coming by and spraying \nbullets? Can you put partisanship aside and decide that we can all \nagree we want to have background checks at gun shows, and trigger locks \non handguns, and these huge ammo clips kept out of the country? Isn't \nit time Congress came together and agreed on\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\nthose basic simple things? The fact of the matter is, we have not, and \napparently under this leadership we cannot.\n  The National Rifle Association is boasting that their membership is \nhigher than ever. They love this, they say, because the more attention \nto this issue, the more people sign up for the National Rifle \nAssociation. More power to them. But I will tell you that if I had to \nput my political future with a group, it would be with the mothers who \nare marching and not with Wayne LaPierre and Charlton Heston. They \nrepresent the real feelings of families across America who understand \nthat gun safety is important and that it includes not just the passage \nof laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids, but it \nalso includes enforcement and it also includes education. All of it \ncomes together.\n  The folks who listen to the NRA and believe them think that you stop \nonce you talk about education and enforcement--that there is no reason \nto go beyond it. Yet we know better. We know those kids at Columbine \nHigh School got their guns from a gun show by a straw purchaser. We \nknow it could have been more difficult if we had passed a law in the \nSenate and if it had been signed by President Clinton.  We know that \nsome of those lives might have been saved. Sadly, that didn't occur.\n\n  Now we are faced with the reality of a legislative session that is \nmoving to the spending bills. It appears that the Republican leadership \nis not going to have its own agenda it wants passed but instead will \nmove to appropriations bills, and in so doing, give us a chance, at \nleast with sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, to continue to remind the \nMembers of the Senate and people across America that we have not done \nanything to make this a safer nation when it comes to guns.\n  I understand, I think, the feelings of some gun owners. They feel put \nupon, that all this debate somehow involves them. Some of them have \nwhat I think is a naive, if not a wrong, point of view that they should \nnot be inconvenienced in the ownership of their guns.\n  Let me suggest that we inconvenience a lot of people for a lot of \ngood reasons in America. I was inconvenienced this morning when I went \nthrough the airport. I had to go through a metal detector. It is an \ninconvenience. I expect, because I want to sit on the plane with peace \nof mind, to know that every effort has been made to keep those who \nwould create some terrorist environment off the plane. I am \ninconvenienced when I drive my car by the rules of the road of \nIllinois--thank goodness for the inconveniences--which require brakes \non my car and require me to stay on the right-hand side of the road and \nabide by the speed limit. It is an inconvenience I accept because I \nwant to bring my family home safely.\n  I think most gun owners are prepared to accept some inconvenience in \nlife if they know it means they can continue to use their guns legally \nand safely. In my home State of Illinois, it is a firearms \nidentification card; you have to apply to the Illinois State Police. \nThey do a background check on you. They give you a little card. You \ncan't buy a gun or ammunition in Illinois without that card with your \npicture on it.\n  I don't own a gun, but I applied for one of these cards. I wanted to \nknow how tough it was. It wasn't too tough: Fill out a questionnaire, \ngive them a little photo, they do a background check, send me my card, \nand I send them a few bucks every year to renew it. That is a device \nthat could be used on a national basis. It has been an inconvenience \nfor the gun owners of Illinois for 40 years now but not such a serious \ninconvenience that they cannot go out and enjoy sports that involve \nguns.\n  We are talking about minor inconveniences with major dividends for \nAmerica. Background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals \nand fugitives and stalkers and kids so we don't have the sad situations \nthat I recounted earlier in the schools and other places across \nAmerica, these are things of common sense. These are things which, \nfrankly, both parties should agree.\n  It is interesting to note that the Republican substitute to our \namendment commending the Million Mom March spends a full page or so \nblasting the Clinton administration for the inadequate prosecution for \ngun crimes. As I read earlier, the statistics don't back up some of the \nclaims they have made. Instead of commending the million moms who stood \nup saying, ``Make America safer,'' the Republicans have replied by \nblasting the first family. That is their idea--go after President \nClinton; don't stand up for the families across America who came  \ntogether last Sunday.\n\n  Then they say they want a juvenile crime conference committee report \nthat has a lot more than guns in it. Quite frankly, there are some \nthings they want with which I can agree. It is interesting they don't \ncall for the gun safety amendments which were adopted by the Senate. Of \ncourse, they close by repeating their belief that it is a right of each \nlaw-abiding citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, \nincluding self-defense or recreation, and that should not be infringed. \nI don't think it is an infringement to put a basic requirement to try \nto keep guns in the hands of those who will use them safely, rather \nthan those who would misuse them.\n  I thank my colleague from the State of California for her leadership \non this particular debate. I was happy to join her this evening. I look \nforward to joining her tomorrow when at least we will have a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution and an opportunity for a vote as to whether or \nnot we should finally tell this conference committee to get down to \nbusiness.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend leaves the floor, I want to ask him a \nquestion.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe Senator Durbin has the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Senator Durbin has the time and \ndid not yield to the Senator, so I recognize the Senator from Illinois. \nI thought he concluded his debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois yields to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is very brief. I have been touched reading some of \nthe comments that have come via the Internet on the Million Mom March \nweb site. I simply read two which I think indicate why the Democratic \nproposal commending the Million Mom March is so on target. It speaks \nfor so many people across America. I want to get a quick response from \nmy colleague to these two very brief statements.\n  A woman from Mount Royal, NJ, writes:\n\n       I wholeheartedly support the Million Mom March. I lost my \n     25-year-old son in November of 1999 to a self-inflicted \n     gunshot wound to the head. I firmly believe that he would \n     still be here today if there would not have been a gun \n     available to him. My prayers go out to all those who are \n     marching on Washington.\n\n  And Elizabeth from North Carolina writes:\n\n       Five years ago my sister was murdered by her ex-husband in \n     a courthouse that had no metal detectors. She had warned the \n     court of his threats and they took his guns away. But because \n     of the easy access to guns, he just went out and got another. \n     And he used it to kill her in front of their 6-year-old \n     child.\n\n  She says to the million moms:\n\n       God bless all of you for walking in this march and raising \n     awareness of the horrible problem we have with gun violence \n     on behalf of my sister and her child. I thank you all for \n     caring.\n\n  I say to my friend before he leaves the floor tonight--he has been so \ngenerous to share his tremendous wisdom--isn't the reason the \nDemocratic proposal, which praises the million moms for doing what they \ndid, makes sense because people such as these have felt so alone? Is \nthat my friend's perspective?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from California, I understand the \nsentiments expressed. Even in my own family, I have a sister-in-law who \nis interested in politics. We talk about it from time to time. She is \nthe mother of 10 children and I think 20-plus grandchildren--I lost \ncount. She decided when she heard about this Million Mom March that she \nwas going to be here in Washington on The Mall last Sunday. She called \nevery woman in the family and said: We are all going down on Metro \ntogether. They did.\n  The same thing happened with other people in my Chicago office. There \nwas a feeling of mothers across America that this was a special moment \nand\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nthat they were going to take time away from their families, away from \nwhat was their day, Mother's Day, and come down and be with so many \nothers.\n  I was in Chicago. I know the Senator from California was here in \nWashington and was touched by what occurred on The Mall gathering.\n  That is a sentiment growing in America. My Republican colleagues \nshould think twice about criticizing this resolution where we commend \nthese mothers who had the courage to come forward because they believe \nso passionately on this issue.\n  When it comes to the question raised by the other person who e-mailed \nor contacted your office about the accessibility of guns, they are \neasily acceptable. The District of Columbia has strong, strong, anti-\ngun laws in terms of ownership possession. Yet you go right across the \nbridge into Virginia or over the line into Maryland and you can \npurchase guns that end up coming right in to crime scenes here in \nWashington, DC.\n  It is naive to believe that State laws are going to control this \ntraffic in guns. In fact, when they did a survey in Illinois of guns \nconfiscated in crimes and their origin, where they were from--they \ntraced them with the gun numbers and such--they found the No. 1 State \nfor sending crime guns to the State of Illinois was the home State of \nthe majority leader of the Senate, the State of Mississippi. Of all \nplaces, Mississippi. Why? It is easier to buy guns there. They buy \nthem, they throw them in the backs of trucks and trunks of cars and \ntake off for Chicago or Boston or wherever it happens to be.\n  This steady trafficking, in many cases illegal trafficking of these \nguns, needs to be better policed, and we need to ensure we understand \nthat these guns move across borders at will. I would say to the Senator \nfrom California, the experience of the second lady who contacted you, \nwhen a person who was not supposed to have a gun had easy access, \nreally speaks to the issue of the proliferation of guns in America, and \ntheir easy access not only to the violent and the criminal but also \nkids.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I retain my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I want to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am compelled to speak at this point. I am \nreally disturbed about the direction the conversation--I will not call \nit a debate--is going. I think the American public needs to know what \nis going on here.\n  At the moment, the bill that is on the floor is the military \nconstruction appropriations bill--not gun control. You might be \nconfused, if you have been listening to the debate. We are on the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. This is the bill that \nprovides for the national security and promotes the national defense. \nThis is the bill that builds things for the military, to make sure we \nhave a strong military. This is the bill that builds the dormitories \nand the housing for our military people so they have the morale to stay \nin the military and do the job of protecting us.\n  We are debating the military construction bill. It is the bill that \ntakes care of some of the problems on military bases where there has \nbeen pollution. A lot of it we did not know was pollution at the time \nit happened, but we recognize the need to take care of the environment, \nand this bill takes care of the environment--if we can ever get around \nto it and get it passed. But it sounds as if we are having a gun \ndebate.\n  This bill, the military construction appropriations bill that we are \nconsidering, is the bill that handles our basic military construction \nneeds. It is not about schools. It is not about gun control. It is \nabout taking care of our military in a responsible and timely way. That \nis what is going to be happening with appropriations bill after \nappropriations bill after appropriations bill. We do 13 of them. It \ntakes us about a week to do an appropriations bill. It is tough to get \nthem done by October 1, when the next appropriation starts. It is  very \nimportant that we be expeditious in the work of the appropriations \nbills.\n\n  We have trouble passing appropriations every year. There is always a \nmini filibuster done on appropriations. My friends across the aisle \nwould prefer the President set the appropriations for this country. \nThat is not what the Constitution says. The Congress of the United \nStates sets the appropriations. We can do it, and we can do it in a \ntimely fashion, as long as there is not a filibuster.\n  Filibusters come in different forms. One of the filibusters you see \nis this gun control legislation that has been thrust into the military \nconstruction bill. Another form of it is putting 100 different \namendments down on an appropriations bill and expecting to be able to \ndebate each and every one. Those are all attempts to delay the \nappropriations process and put the process in the hands of the \nPresident. I want the American public to know that the responsible way, \nthe constitutional way, is for this Congress to pass a budget.\n  As to the debate we are having tonight, why didn't we just agree to \nhave a vote on the sense of the Senate and get on with the business of \nappropriations? This is a very important point. We cannot set new \nprecedent for people to be able to delay the appropriations process, \nand that is what we are talking about.\n  Last year we passed rule XVI. We made rule XVI valid again. The \npurpose of that process that we went through, a very difficult process, \nwas to say you cannot legislate on appropriations bills. You cannot do \nthat because we are not going to have every piece of legislation that \neverybody would like to have passed that they cannot get through the \nregular process brought up as a simple amendment to an appropriations \nbill and debated for hours and hours and hours. If we are going to get \nthe appropriations process done, it has to be according to the rules. \nWe had a rule, rule XVI, that said you could not legislate on an \nappropriations bill. It had been kind of set aside. Last year, we put \nit back into effect so we could expedite the appropriations process.\n  OK, there is a way around that. There is not anything that really \naddresses if you offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on an \nappropriations bill. Perhaps that is a way to back-door some of these \nother debates. We are not going to do it. We said you cannot legislate \non it, we are not going to let you back-door legislate on it at the \nmoment. That is what we are talking about here, a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment.\n  If I had my way, we would not do sense-of-the-Senate amendments. \nSense-of-the-Senate amendments are our opinion as reflected in time \ncrunches, which means they do not mean anything. They are used a lot \nbecause if somebody passes a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, you will \nhear them up here frequently saying: I passed that sense-of-the-Senate \namendment 100 to nothing, and that means the Senate wants it. What they \ndid was pass it 100 to nothing to get it out of the way so we could get \nto another issue, perhaps a real issue. The sense of the Senate does \nnot get negotiated with the House folks. It is just something we pass \nso we can feel good.\n  That is what this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is; it is something \nthat will make us feel good. There is violence in this country, and it \nis important to end violence. But we are not talking about whether or \nnot we are doing that. We are talking about whether we are going to \nhave an appropriations process that can be done responsibly, without \nall kinds of other issues being thrown into the process, willy-nilly, \nto hold up the process so the President can decide, with Congress, how \nthe appropriations are going to go. So earlier tonight you saw a lot of \nprocedural motions. Those were motions to make sure that the sense of \nthe Senate could be voted on, that a new precedent could be set for how \nwe are going to do appropriations bills around here. That is why we \nhave been so adamant at making sure there are votes. In order to get a \nvote on germaneness, we had to concede 8 hours of debate time. Instead \nof talking about military construction and getting the bill passed, \ncompleting the amendments to it--instead of that, we agreed\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\nwe would do 4 hours of debate on each of two amendments, so we could \nget to some votes.\n\n  You saw what happened earlier--endless quorum calls. Every time there \nwas one of those quorum calls, we did not have to go quite as formal. \nThe other side likes these filibusters to be a bit more subtle, so \ninstead we just have to do a quorum count. We had to actually show on \nthe lists up there that the people were here. It was not an actual \nvote. It only took about 7 minutes each time one of those procedural \nquorum calls was called. But it did not just delay 7 minutes; it kept a \nvote from happening. And that is the strategy: Filibuster the \nappropriations, put it in the hands of the President, set a new \nprecedent so we have additional opportunities to set it back.\n  It is about time Congress went to a biennial budget, a budget that we \ndo every other year so we do not get in this time crunch every year; so \nwe do not get under the gun and put things into appropriations that \nought not be there; so we can have the best possible debate every other \nyear and get the best possible biennial budget and appropriation that \nwe can and, in the in-between year, have a chance to see how the people \nare spending that money and making sure it is according to the way \nCongress appropriated it.\n  We have concentrated on guns in the debate tonight. As I have pointed \nout, the bill we are debating is military construction. Everyone that I \nknow is sensitive to the violence issue in this country. We need to do \nsomething about that violence. Since it has been brought up as the \nsingle solution being gun control, and the Democrats are willing to \nconcede that perhaps a little enforcement might help out and are using \nstatistics about a 40-percent increase in the amount of Federal \nenforcement that has been done--it is pretty easy if you only have 9 \none year to get 40 percent the next year, especially with the crew we \nhave to do the enforcement.\n  They ought to be embarrassed about the enforcement. Neither of these \nthings are the solution. We have to quit trying to treat the symptoms. \nWe have to get to the heart of violence, and the heart of violence is \nthat we lack a sense of community. We have lost a sense of community.\n  I am from Wyoming, and I get back to Wyoming almost every weekend. I \ntravel 300 to 500 miles around the State going to all kinds of towns--\nsmall towns, big cities. In Wyoming, the big cities are 50,000 people. \nOne can drive out of that city and see the whole city at one time. It \nis not another town running into another town into another town.\n  Some of the communities I visit are listed on the Wyoming highway map \nas having zero population. That really irritates the two people who \nlive there, but they are counted in the county population rather than \nthe city population. When my wife and I go to those towns, we call \nahead and talk to those two people and say: Can you invite a few of \nyour friends over so we can hear what is on your minds? When we get \nthere, there will be 20 to 30 people at that place ready to give their \nopinion because they have seen a lot of stuff on television with which \nthey do not agree. They have seen polls in which we believe, and they \nwant me to know the right way.\n  I challenge any other Senator to beat that percentage of attendance: \nzero population, 30 people. Give it a try. The average town in my State \nis 250 people. They turn out well, too. When I go to a town of 250, I \nusually get to talk with 80 percent of the people who are there. I do \nnot even know what size building I would have to have in Los Angeles to \ntalk to 80 percent of the people, but we can do that in Wyoming, and we \ndo.\n  They do not think handling the symptom of guns or enforcement is the \nanswer. They are a little distressed at the lack of sense of community. \nThey have a strong sense of community. They know their neighbors. They \ntalk to their neighbors regularly. They respect their neighbors, and \nthey have this community they can see. Wyoming is an example for the \nNation when it comes to community.\n  We are worried about it there, too. Television has made a tremendous \ndifference in this country. We are not trying to outlaw television. \nThat would cause the biggest uproar this country has ever heard. I can \ntell from some of the satellite TV and cable TV problems we have that \nit is the most important thing in the minds of many people in America.\n  What does television do? It turns everybody inward. Part of the time \nI was growing up, we did not have television. Then we got a black and \nwhite television set. I watched this tremendous progression of \ntelevision. It was a fascinating technology with fascinating new \ncapabilities.\n  Television has turned us inward. When I was growing up, there were \nnot many channels from which to select, but there were different \nprograms that different members of the family wanted to see. We had a \ndiscussion, a debate, a family decision on what we were going to watch. \nThere was interaction in the family. That is part of community.\n  Today we have the Internet. Not only can the child go to his or her \nown room and watch his or her own television set; they can go to their \nroom, and if they do not like what is on television, they can go on the \nInternet. Again, it is turned inward, perhaps a little more outward \nthan television because one can get into chatrooms.\n  I suggest to parents--and I know a lot are watching what  their kids \ndo with television and on the Internet--talking to somebody in a \nchatroom is not the same as talking to them in person. It is talking to \na computer game. It is talking to yourself with some interaction, and \nthat is turning us inward.\n\n  My daughter is a teacher. She is an outstanding teacher of seventh \nand ninth grade English in Gillette, WY. She has been a little \ndistressed over the last year at some of the things she has seen \nhappening even in Wyoming. I know it is nothing compared to what is \nhappening in the rest of the Nation. There was a knife incident in her \nschool, and she went through the entire enforcement process. It was a \nvery disturbing experience and maybe a reason at some point in the near \nfuture for her to quit teaching. It is a very difficult process.\n  I have talked with her about guns, violence, and what we can do about \nit. I have received a lot of good suggestions from her and the \nstudents. Again, we find this inward turning, this lack of community, \nthis lack of respect as being one of the big problems.\n  I am very proud of my wife. I have to mention her, too. This last \nweekend when I was in Wyoming, I went to the University of Wyoming and \nwatched her receive her master's degree. She has been working on that \nfor several years, while we have been in Washington, on the Internet \ntaking it from the University of Wyoming. It is very difficult, but it \nis a way one can pick up a degree no matter where in the world one is. \nEven when we were traveling, she could go online and make the class \ntimes she had to make. It was difficult but doable.\n  I congratulate her for her efforts. Her master's degree is in adult \neducation. She has done some teaching in high school before. One of her \nviews is that one of the things we ought to have in schools is a course \ncalled ``Life's Not Fair and What To Do About It.'' We are so busy in \nthis country giving people rights. We have the Bill of Rights, but we \nare giving out a lot of other rights. Unfortunately, I think we have \ngiven the kids of this country the impression that they have the right \nto everything for themselves, and if they do not get that right, they \ncan take it out on others.\n  There are a number of different ways they can do that. They can sue. \nIf they fall down and hurt themselves, it is not their fault anymore. \nIt is somebody else's fault and they have to concentrate on how much \nmoney they can get from them for themselves. Life is not fair. We have \nkids across this country who are saying life is not fair and I am going \nto hurt somebody because they have hurt me internally. In fact, they \neven kill people over that. Somehow we have to get the message out to \neach and every kid. We have lost a whole generation of kids. There is a \nwhole generation of them who have not had the message they are not \nsupposed to hurt other people, and they are definitely not supposed to \nkill them. That is a message we are missing.\n  I know the first thing a lot of people are going to do is jump up and \nsay: But we have all these working mothers now. If they did not have to \nwork, they could take better care of their kids. I\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\nam not going to let them off with that excuse.\n  We just had Mother's Day, and that ought to be the most special day \nin the world. We ought to listen to what every mother has in the way of \ninstruction--the mothers who marched and the mothers with whom we \ncelebrated.\n  One of the most important lessons is listen to your mother. My mom is \nin Washington right now. She has had a tremendous influence on my life, \nand she was a working mother. She and my dad had a shoe store, a small \nbusiness. If there are people who think owning a business is the easy \nway of life, they need to do a business plan and take a look at small \nbusiness. The only people who do not get off when they need to or want \nto are the people who own the business. They are the ones locked into a \nschedule. The people who work for them have more flexibility because, \nas a businessowner, you do not want them to quit and not have any help. \nIf you have your own business, you work interminable hours because it \nis everything you have. Until one has gone through the agony of \nfiguring out how to pay the bills in a small business, one really \ncannot appreciate what a small businessman goes through.\n  My mom worked at the shoe store. She did the books for the store and \nhad to spend a lot of time at it. So did my dad. But my sister and I, I \ndo not think, turned out too bad.\n\n  My sister is really the smart one in the family. She is a CPA. She is \nthe business manager for a school district in Sheridan, WY, and does \njust outstanding work. She understands numbers far better than I do. \nShe is the more capable one in our family.\n  But I am proud of my mother and the way she brought us up. And my \nwife, all of the time our kids were growing up, was a working mother. \nWe also had shoe stores. We also had to go through that pain and agony \nof making sure we could meet payrolls all the time and that we could \nget all the work done.\n  I am really proud of my kids. Her working did not destroy my kids. In \nfact, it may have aided my kids, as my mother working aided me.\n  It is very difficult to work and do all of those things and have \nspecial time with your kids. I really think that is the key --special \ntime. That does not have to be a whole day. In fact, I would challenge \nanybody to spend a whole day of special time, unless they are doing it \nin an entertainment mode, in which case they are looking at something \nelse other than their kids.\n  I would suggest that you have some family traditions. One of our \nfamily traditions, both when I was growing up and with my family, was \nto have one meal a day that you had together--not optional; not with \nTV--one meal a day together; one opportunity during that day to ask, \nwhat did you do, or what are you going to do, to compare notes, to find \nout and, most importantly, to show a little bit of concern for that \nchild or that spouse--a time that is uninterrupted, 5 minutes, 10 \nminutes--I do not know how long it takes you to eat but enough time to \ncompare notes just a little bit.\n  If you compare notes, I think it will drag out into a much longer \ntime than 5 minutes or 10 minutes.\n  Another part of this is a respect for neighbors and teachers. This is \npart of community, too. With community, you have to have some respect \nfor yourself, some self-responsibility. You also have to have respect \nfor your family. You have to have that willingness to work together \nbecause everything isn't going to work out in a family just the way you \nwould dream of it. Life is not fair in families, either. But families \nshow their strength by working together when things are difficult.\n  When I was growing up, we respected our neighbors. Our neighbors were \nable to say: Hey, I saw your boy. I didn't like what he was doing. No \npunishment was necessary because I changed immediately because I \nrespected that neighbor, too.\n  The same thing for teachers in the classroom. One of the things my \ndaughter does that I really like is, when she is teaching and she has a \nbig assignment that is supposed to be turned in, she calls the parents \nof those students who did not turn in the paper. It is a lot of extra \neffort.\n  The first time she did that, she called us, in tears. And she is near \ntears every time she does it. The reason she is near tears is because \nof the number of parents who say: So, what are you going to do about \nit? They put it back on her, as the teacher, when they have the \ncomplete control--or as much control as anybody has--of making sure \ntheir child does the work timely. It is part of community.\n  I got in trouble a little bit in Wyoming with some education things. \nAt one time I checked and found out Wyoming was spending--this has been \na few years ago--about $5,600 a student per year. I suggested that one \nof the ways we could improve education was if we charged tuition, and \nthen gave every kid a $5,600 scholarship to cover the tuition that we \ncharged.\n\n  And how did you earn the scholarship? All you had to do to earn the \nscholarship was show up, do your homework, and be good. Those are \npretty weak criteria for getting $5,600 a year. But those are some \nthings that we need in school. We need the kids to show up; we need the \nkids to do their homework; and we need them to behave so they are not \ndisrupting other people--pretty easy criteria. But that is part of that \nsense of community, again, that sense of knowing that the people you \nare going to school with have an equal right to learn.\n  When I have talked to a lot of the school classes--and we usually do \nthat on Fridays when we get to Wyoming--I have found that you want to \nphrase your questions on what needs to be done very carefully. If you \ndo not, what you get back from kids is: You are not doing enough for \nus: We need; we need; we need. That is not the solution either.\n  In St. Louis, one of the things they did there--this was not done \nprofessionally at all, as I understand; I read about it in a book on \ncommunitarianism, which is what I am talking about --in the book, they \nsaid in St. Louis they sent out a questionnaire to the kids in the \nschool and asked: What does our community need? What do you need? What \ndoes our community need? Which happens to be the right way to phrase \nthat question.\n  They also had a little spot on the survey of what needed to be done \nwhere they could list if they were willing to work on it, and how they \nwould work on it, and put their name and their address and their phone \nnumber. They expected a small return of these questionnaires. Instead, \nwhat they got was over 50 percent back, and over 50 percent of those \nhad signatures on them saying they were willing to participate. And the \ncity was smart enough to put them to work. They let them use the city \nhall for committee meetings and to go to work on the projects they \nsuggested the community needed. There was a huge decrease in vandalism. \nThere was a huge increase in caring for their fellow people.\n  The same book talks about Cincinnati. There they hired a professional \nto check and see why there was so much violence and so much \ndestruction. The conclusion of the report was: A broken window left \nundone leads to a door that is left undone that leads to a kid who \nfeels that nobody cares.\n  They are not interested in us having a bunch of debates back here in \na fancy sort of way that sets a whole bunch more laws in place.\n  I would like to be able to tell you I have the solution to violence \nand that I have the perfect law that will take care of the violence \nproblem in this country. But it isn't going to be done by law. You \ncannot make people behave. You have to have people who want to behave, \nto know that they are supposed to behave.\n  Something I also find when I talk to kids is that they believe the \nonly publicity out there is the publicity about the bad kids and the \nbad incidents.\n  We just had a Congressional Awards Ceremony in Cheyenne, WY. The \nCongressional Awards Program is something that we all ought to \nunderstand because everybody has the right to that program. The U.S. \nCongress gives out two kinds of awards. They give out the Congressional \nMedal of Honor; that is usually to adults who have done something \nfantastic to help our country and our way of life and democracy. We \nalso have the Congressional Awards. Those go to kids, kids who have \ndone something for other people, kids who have helped out in their \ncommunity, kids who have set goals and followed them, and the goals \nhave to include volunteer work.\n\n  We have quite a few kids sign up for that in Wyoming. In fact, in \nmost\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nyears Wyoming has more kids who get the gold medal than any other \nState. I did not say on a per capita basis. I want to make sure that \neverybody understands, in Wyoming we have 480,000 people. So sometimes \non a per capita basis it is pretty easy for us. We show up in all the \nbad statistics because one incident drives us to the top of the charts.\n  I want to mention that again. For congressional awards, in Wyoming we \nhave more kids who get a gold medal than any other State--flat out \nnumbers. About 3 years ago, there were 21 gold medals awarded in the \nUnited States. Fifteen of the kids receiving that gold medal were from \nWyoming. We are very proud of the program. But the thing we like the \nmost is kids say: We get good publicity for doing that. Good kids get \ngood publicity. The more publicity there is that way, the more people \nget in the program. So we always have the largest program.\n  I spoke at a Boy Scout Week dinner in Cheyenne. Lots of letters, \nagain, said: Thanks for saying good things about what we are doing.\n  I have gone on a lot longer than I anticipated going, and I \nparticularly apologize for it because we are debating military \nconstruction. That is the bill we are considering--military \nconstruction appropriations.\n  I have to tell you a little bit about the new dollar, the golden \ndollar, the Wyoming dollar. Yes, to have a new dollar in the United \nStates, it has to go through the Banking Committee. When they noticed \nwe were running out of the Susan B. Anthony coins, they passed a \nresolution to do a new dollar. And then the battle started.\n  The resolution said it would have the image of a real woman, and \nevery State has a number of women who are worthy to be on a coin. \nTrying to break the logjam, I nominated Sacajawea. She is a person of \ntremendous interest to the Presiding Officer because Sacajawea was born \nin Idaho. Sacajawea, of course, was kidnapped at a very young age in \nIdaho and taken to North Dakota. It was in North Dakota that she met up \nwith Lewis and Clark and went across the United States and helped them \nout by using the skills, talents, and language she had learned as a \nchild.\n  Without Sacajawea, the Lewis and Clark expedition would have fallen \nfar short of its goal. It might not have even made it back to Idaho. \nBut she helped with that. I love to go on and add that not only did she \nget to travel the entire West through that process, but even after the \nterritory expedition, it is with great pleasure that I can say she \nchose to spend her last years in Wyoming.\n  People who have seen the West usually like to stay in Wyoming, if \nthey possibly can. But kids in Kelly, WY, helped me promote Sacajawea \nand helped to get her on the coin. One of the schoolteachers wrote a \nsong about her. His dad wrote a book about her that we used as the \nevidence for her importance in the United States. Of course, we are \ncoming up on the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. So we \nare pleased that through the whole process, Sacajawea made it onto the \ncoin, along with her baby. It is a lookback, but a look to the future, \nand it is the first time we put a baby on a coin.\n  When we had the golden dollar celebration in Kelly, WY, the local \nbank--well, there is no local bank in Kelly. The nearest town is \nJackson, and the bank there arranged for an armored car to come to \nKelly, WY, with some of the dollars. I know it was the first time an \narmored car had been there. But the bank was also so kind as to invite \nsome of the kids from the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, \nwhich is where Sacajawea is buried, and also from the Fort Hall Indian \nReservation in Idaho. We just had a great day celebrating it.\n  One of the things I noted was that part of Indian tradition is a \nthing called ``dream catchers.'' They are circular to represent endless \ntime, and they have webs that go through them that would catch dreams \nand visions. It occurred to me that is a bit of what the dollar is; it \nis a dream catcher. It isn't any good just by itself. We call it the \ngolden dollar, and it has been pointed out that it doesn't have gold in \nit. It is colored gold, distinctly from the quarter. It has smooth \nedges so you can tell it from the quarter. But it is a dream catcher. \nYou have to use it in order to make a difference.\n  Kids understand that. They know that helping other people with their \ndreams makes one's own dreams come true. Sometimes that is done through \ndollars. I mention this because, again, we are in the appropriations \nprocess. That is where we deal with dollars--trillions of dollars. It \nis very important that we spend those dollars as well as possible. And \nwe are not going to get the process done if we are diverted onto a \nwhole bunch of sense-of-the-Senate amendments, which are used a few \ntimes by people who say, ``I got that through 100-0,'' or whatever the \nnumber is. Most of them pass 100-0 because the words on them don't mean \nanything, except a vocal display.\n  So I hope we can keep the discussion relevant and make sure we can do \nthe business of the United States--the dream catching of the United \nStates--and get our appropriations process done.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask if there are other speakers on \nthe other side this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe there is one other speaker on the \nRepublican side who wishes to speak. We may want to propound the \nnecessary language to close the Senate down, which would allow the \nSenator to complete her expressions for the evening.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do that, but I don't have the particular \nlanguage in front of me at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). It is not available yet. The \nSenator may continue with her remarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that. How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 39 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't intend to use the entire time. At \nthe appropriate moment, I will be happy to make that unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Wyoming I really enjoyed listening \nto him, and much of what he said I agree with. But I have to say that, \nas my friend explained the needs of our communities to be closer and \nthe needs of our children to be paid attention to and to be taught \nrespect and accountability and love, he is very right.\n  But I might say to my friend that every day in this country 12 \nchildren are cut down by gunfire. Most of them come from families who \nlove them, come from families who respect them, come from families who \nhave taught them the values of love and community and country.\n  So I say to my friend from Wyoming, who told some very tender stories \nabout how good most of the youth are in this country--and I agree with \nhim--a lot of those wonderful young people are being shot in schools \nand in churches. There seems to be no limit today on what can happen. \nSo he can speak about the need to be close with our families. He is \nexactly right. Most of us are. But for those who are alienated, who \ndon't have that love, why should the rest of the children pay the price \nand fear for their lives?\n  In some of our communities, if you ask those children, I say to my \nfriend, the sad reality, for whatever reason, is that they are afraid. \nMany of them know someone who has been cut down by gunfire.\n  So I say, yes, the world he paints is a world I want for every child \nin America--a loving family, the ability to feel secure, the ability to \nfeel responsibility, the ability to feel confidence. But also, I might \nadd, if we don't pass sensible gun laws--and my friend doesn't want any \nmore sensible gun laws--no matter what type of families our children \ncome from, they are not protected.\n  I also want to address the point of my friend from Wyoming on why we \nare doing this on the military construction bill. Over on the House \nside, I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how \nimportant that bill is. I want to make it clear to my friends that the \nDemocratic leader, Tom Daschle, didn't want to go this route. He asked \nunanimous consent to bring up the gun amendments that passed the Senate \nand are trapped in the conference committee, take them up immediately, \nand resolve them, and pass them in honor of the moms who\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\ngave up their Mother's Day to come here and express themselves.\n  The Republican side said no. They objected. So what choice did he \nhave but to offer up an amendment?\n  I say to my friend that the Republican leadership waited 5 full hours \nbefore they allowed us to be heard on the subject of sensible gun laws; \n5 full hours before we could offer our amendment and be heard on our \namendment which commends the moms for coming out on a day when they \ncould have had breakfast in bed, have gotten flowers, and been treated \nto dinner, to say thank you for being selfless as moms are. That is \nwhat you learn when you are a mom--how to be selfless.\n  As my friend pointed out, military construction is funded for 4 more \nmonths. We are not up against any clock--4 more months. Would it hurt \nus to take a few hours to pay tribute to those moms who worked so hard \nto organize that march of 750,000 strong, and thousands across the \ncountry adding up to more than a million moms? By the way, plenty of \ndads, too; plenty of grandmas; plenty of grandpas; plenty of daughters \nand sons. Would it hurt us? My God, in the 5 hours the Republicans \nstalled before we could get to this measure, we could have had the \ndebate and could have voted on it. Who is wasting time?\n  The Democratic leader said let's just take this matter up and vote it \nout. He would have agreed to a very short time limit. But, no, 5 hours \nof delay. So here it is 5 minutes to 9.\n  You know what. I am grateful we are taking this up. I am grateful \neven if it is late at night. Even if I have some other things to do, it \ndoesn't matter at all. We will take it up tomorrow as well. By the way, \nwe will take it up again, and we will take it up again, and we will \ntake it up again because too many people are dying in our country. How \nmany? Let's take a look.\n  We have a war at home. It is a war in our streets. It is a war in our \nschools. In Vietnam, we lost 58,168 of our people. This country came to \nits knees. We wanted to end the war. The vast majority of people \nthought it was a mistake. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \nmarched. And President Nixon ended the war in Vietnam. That is 11 \nyears.\n  Let's look at what happened in the last 11 years in our Nation--\n395,441 people have been shot down by gunfire. That is from the \nNational Census for Health Statistics.\n  We have a war here at home. It is shocking to look at that, isn't it? \nI find it so.\n  That is why we are going to come back again and again. It is not easy \nto be here late at night. But I think we are going to have to do that \nbecause we have to face it.\n  Let's look at murder by handguns compared to other countries. A lot \nof people say, well, this is just the way it is in a society that is \nfree. I would argue that Japan, Great Britain, and Canada are free \ncountries. They are our allies. They are democracies. By the way, in \nCanada, murder by handguns per 1 million population is .12 per 1 \nmillion; .51, 3.64 in Canada. And in the United States, it is 35.05.\n  What is wrong? My friend from Wyoming talked about lack of community. \nHe is certainly right on that point. But why is it always in this \ndebate either/or? Why don't we want to work on that issue of community, \nwork on those issues of respect for families, and work on those issues \nthat we have to work on--yes, in the media--and also face one fact, \nthat the only product in this country that has not one safety \nregulation is guns? Does that make sense to you?\n  In 1968, after the tragic assassination of Robert Kennedy--killed, \nshot down in the prime of life, who might have been our next President, \nshot down in the prime of life with an imported handgun--this Congress \nacted to ban Saturday night specials from being imported. As I \nremember, some of my colleagues who are still here on the other side of \nthe aisle voted for that. But guess what they didn't vote for. They \ndidn't vote to ban Saturday night specials from being made in America. \nSo if you try to import a Saturday night special, you can't do it. You \ncan't import a handgun. But guess what. They are made all over this \ncountry, particularly in my own home State. I am proud to tell you that \nrecently with a new California Legislature and a new Governor, we have \nbanned those Saturday night specials in California.\n\n  We are making progress. We are making progress. I am very proud of \nthat.\n  After Columbine High School, this Senate gathered, and all said we \nare going to work together. We passed five sensible gun laws. They are \nso modest. They are so sensible. They passed this Senate and closed the \ngun show loophole that allows criminals to go to a gun show and not \nhave to have a background check. It would have made a difference in \nColumbine. The woman who got the guns for those kids said so. It would \nban the importation of high-capacity clips which are used in \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. That is the Feinstein amendment. The \nfirst one is the Lautenberg amendment. Requiring child safety devices \nbe sold with every handgun is the Kohl amendment. It requires that the \nFTC and the Attorney General study the extent to which the gun industry \nmarkets to juveniles. That was my amendment. I will talk more about it. \nIt makes it illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic assault weapon to \nanyone under the age of 18. That was written by a Republican Member of \nthis Senate, Senator Ashcroft. Those amendments passed. And they are \nlanguishing in a conference committee that doesn't even meet.\n  On April 20, 1999, the Columbine High School shooting stunned \nAmerica. On May 11, a month later, the Senate begins debate on those \ngun measures. On May 20, just a month after Columbine, this Senate \npassed a juvenile justice bill by a vote of 73-25 that included those \nfive sensible gun control amendments that I talked about.\n  The Senate and House go to conference 3 months after Columbine, and \nguess what. That was July. There is one meeting of the conferees. Here \nwe are more than a year after Columbine and we have done zero, nothing, \nnada.\n  I am embarrassed to face my constituents. I was embarrassed to face \nthese marching moms and look them in the eye. It is not their job to \npass legislation. Hello. It is our job. It is not their job. It is our \njob. What are we doing? Nothing, zero, zip. I am embarrassed about \nthat. I am angry about that.\n  I tell you that there are a number of us who are not going to go away \non this point. We will be back here. That is why I say to the Presiding \nOfficer sitting in the Chair today that we chose to move forward on \nthis bill. We tried to get a separate resolution. We offered it. The \nRepublicans said no. I don't know, I just do not know why the fear is \nin this Chamber about voting this thing up or down. All we said is \ncommend the Million Mom March for what they did. It is the American \nway--standing up and being counted.\n  Moms attended who are Republicans, Democrats, Independents, some who \ndon't have any affiliation whatever with politics, many of whom are \nnever political. They want Congress to act. We do nothing.\n  I hope these moms continue to work on this matter, to connect this \npolitical process with the facts and the realities of the deaths that \ngo on day after day after day after day.\n  We had a hearing the day after the Million Mom March and an art \nteacher from Columbine spoke. With a trembling voice she told us what \nit was like to be in that library, to tell the kids: Go under your \ndesk. Call 9-1-1.\n  She said: I used to be in favor of no gun laws and now I am here \nasking you to act because I don't want anyone else to suffer in this \nway.\n  I talked about the five commonsense measures. I think the one that I \nwrote is very important. We learned when we looked at the cigarette \nindustry how they marketed to kids. We have to realize how the gun \nindustry is marketing to kids. Here is an ad in ``Gun World'': ``Start \n'em Young! There is no time like the present.'' Here is a child, \ndefinitely under 18. It is a toy gun that looks like a real handgun. \nNow, under the laws today you can't buy a handgun in a licensed dealer \nshop until you are 21 years of age and you can't buy it from anybody, \nincluding a gun show, until you are 18. Here is a young man: ``Start \n'em Young!\"\n  Let's take a look at what some of the gun people say about marketing: \n``. . .greatest threat we face is the lack of a future customer base. . \n.''; ``. . .we continue to look for every opportunity to reach young \npeople. . .''; ``Building\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nthe next generation of customers takes work and commitment. But it must \nbe done.''\n  Sound familiar.\n  Let's hear what the tobacco companies said in the documents we found \nthrough the lawsuits. We will hear how the tobacco company and the gun \ncompanies sound alike.\n  Tobacco company documents: ``If our company is to survive and \nprosper, over the long-term we must get our share of the youth \nmarket.'' ``Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular \ncustomer.''\n  This sounds very familiar.\n  Here are the gun companies: ``. . .greatest threat we face is the \nlack of a future customer base. . .''; ``. . .we continue to look for \nevery opportunity to reach young people. . .''\n  Are they trying to reach young people? I argue they are.\n  We no longer see Joe Camel. Because of the lawsuits, tobacco \ncompanies agreed to stop using a cartoon character to lure kids to \ntheir product. Well, here is Eddie Eagle. If all Eddie Eagle did was to \npromote safety, it would be one thing, but it is absolutely a way to \nget kids interested in guns at a young age. ``Start 'em Young!'' begins \nto take on new meaning.\n  Here is a photograph from a gun magazine. This child is 4 years old \nand he is watching an adult load a handgun-- ``Start 'em Young!\"\n  This is a very pressing issue. That is why we offered this amendment. \nWe thank the moms for coming here. We call on our colleagues to free \nthat juvenile justice bill and pass these laws.\n  My friend from Wyoming, in his opening remarks, said the people in \nhis State don't want any laws. Quoting him the best I can, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming said: You can't make people behave. We don't need a bunch \nof laws.\n\n  Let's take that to its logical conclusion. You can't make people \nbehave; you don't need a bunch of laws. OK. Should we have no laws \nagainst murder because you can't make people behave? Should we have no \nlaws against rape because you can't make people behave? Should we have \nno laws on the books that say if you drive a car you have to have a \nlicense?\n  And the NRA takes out an ad and says, by the way, licensing a car \ndoesn't save kids from getting hurt. They have to look both ways when \nthey cross the street.\n  There is another either/or strawman. Of course, you have to look both \nways when you cross the street. But if the driver didn't have to get a \nlicense and couldn't see and went up on the sidewalk, you would get \nkilled. So what is this either/or? You don't need laws to make people \nbehave? You want to repeal the laws for getting a license to drive? You \nwant to repeal the laws on registering a car? Yes, you can look both \nways, but if the guy's brakes don't work, you are hit. So we keep \nsetting up these either/ors. It is not about either/or. Look both ways, \nyes. But also make sure that your driver is licensed, the car is \nregistered, it is safe, he or she can see, can hear, and can drive.\n  With this refrain that laws can't make people behave, if you take it \nto its logical conclusion, we wouldn't have any laws at all. We \nwouldn't have a country that was a country of laws. That is, by the \nway, what makes America the greatest country in the world because we \nare a country of laws, not men; I add, we are a country of laws, not \nmen or women.\n  We have laws for safe toys; we have laws for safe products. We have \nthe safest products in the world. Not because people are wonderful. \nYes, some are; they would never make an unsafe product; they wouldn't \ndo it. But some people aren't wonderful and we have to protect our \npeople from those people who would make a shoddy product. Guess what. \nWe have the safest products in the world.\n  The only product that is not regulated that I know of is a \ndomestically produced handgun. If you try to import it, there are \nsafety standards. But not if you make it here.\n  I would say to my friend, I do not agree with him. If he does not \nthink laws make people behave, I don't know exactly what we are doing \nhere. We do pass laws every day to protect our people. Laws are the \nbedrock of a civilized society.\n  The NRA took out a full-page ad--the same one where they said when \nyou license a driver or register a car you do not make our kids any \nsafer--so I already think I addressed that. But they also basically \nsaid: What kind of mother would march? This is a political agenda.\n  I wish those NRA members who wrote that ad could have been at the \nMillion Mom March. I have been in politics all my life. I have to say, \nthese people were authentic American moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, \naunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, daughters. Do you know why they were \nthere? They said it: Enough is enough. Enough is enough. Many of them \nhad lost children, relatives; they feel the pain; they feel the hurt. \nThey are scarred forever. Many of them knew people who were injured, \nwho were paralyzed for life. Enough is enough. That is why they came. \nThat is why they marched. They could have stayed home, had their \nbreakfast in bed once a year for Mother's Day, but they chose not to do \nit. I am proud of them.\n  For the National Rifle Association to take out an ad condemning those \nmothers is an insult to the women of this country. By the way, they \nwere women from every political party imaginable, every age, every \nethnic group. It was the most amazing picture. People out there saying: \nEnough is enough.\n  They want us to act. So, yes, I think it is worth a couple of days of \ndebate in the memory of the almost 400,000 Americans shot dead by \ngunfire in the last 11 years. I think it is worth a couple of days of \ndebate to say, in the name of these 395,441 people, that we will take a \nfew hours; that we will commend the Million Mom March; that we will \nencourage them to keep on fighting for what they believe in--a safe \nAmerica.\n  Many years ago, when I first got into politics, I was involved in \ntrying to ensure that my children, who are now old enough to take care \nof me, had a safe future. We were embroiled in that Vietnam war for \nyears and years. There was a bumper strip that came out and a lot of \npeople put it on their cars. It said: Imagine peace. Because the war \nhad gone on so long it was hard to imagine what it would be like, not \nto have this divisive war, where Americans were arguing with one \nanother, where generations were having debates until most of the \ncountry came around and believed it was wrong.\n  I think we need to have a new bumper strip that says: Imagine an \nAmerica with no gun violence. Maybe every day we could think about what \nit would be like to put on the television set at night and not hear \nstory after story: A child goes to the zoo and shoots a gun and hurts a \nchild; a 6-year-old brings a gun to school and shoots a 5-year-old; two \nhigh school kids go into their high school and kill people randomly. \nEvery day 12 children die. Imagine what it would be like to turn on the \ntelevision at night and not have to hear these stories. God, what a \nwonderful thing it would be for our Nation.\n  I will say this. If we take the attitude that laws do not mean \nanything, then we are giving up. We could stand up here, as many nights \nas we could, and say how much we need to feel a sense of community and \nhow much mothers and fathers have to work with their children and how \nimportant it is that we respect each other and admire each other and \nlove each other and come together as a community--and, my God, we \nshould say that.\n\n  But we cannot stop there. Because the mothers who grieve for their \nchildren every day in America love their children and they gave their \nchildren values and their children went off to school and they never \ncame home. So you can stand here, day after day and say that it is \nabout a sense of community, and I will agree with every word that you \nsay. But that does not mean we do not have the responsibility to \nprotect the good children and the good families. We can do it. Five \nsensible gun laws that we have already passed here, seeing how we \nmarket to children, making sure we do not import those high-capacity \nclips, making sure that guns are sold with safety locks, making sure \nyou cannot buy an assault weapon until you are 18.\n  The bottom line is we can do it. The last one, of course, is closing \nthe gun show loophole. If you ask the woman who got those guns for \nthose kids at Columbine, she says it clearly: If I had to undergo a \nbackground check at the gun show, this whole thing would not have \nhappened.\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\n  So no one can get up here and say laws do not make a difference \nbecause I do not believe that. These people are telling us to pass \nthese laws. We are not all that smart here. None of us is. But if we \nturn our back on the people who have experienced this violence, the \nSarah Bradys, the Jim Bradys who beg us to pass waiting periods and \nbackground checks--if we turn our back on those Americans, I do not \nthink we deserve to be here, really. Maybe that is what this election \nin November is going to be all about. We are going to see how much \npeople really care.\n  I know it is late. The Senator from Alabama is here. I know he wants \nto talk. I know he is not going to agree with one thing I said--and \nthat is good because that is what this is all about. That is what it is \nall about. That is why I love the Million Mom March, because it is what \nthe country is all about: standing up and being counted, standing up \nand giving up Mother's Day to come out there and do what they think is \nright. We have a simple, simple opportunity for people to praise those \nmoms.\n  I am going to close by reading from Senator Daschle's amendment and \nhope my friends on the other side will join us and will vote for it:\n\n       Since on Mother's Day, May 14, 2000, an estimated 750,000 \n     mothers, fathers, and children united for the Million Mom \n     March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and were \n     joined by tens of thousands of others, in 70 cities across \n     America, in a call for meaningful, common-sense gun policy;\n       Since 4,223 young people ages 19 and under were killed by \n     gunfire--one every two hours, nearly 12 young people every \n     day--in the United States in 1977;\n       Since American children under the age of 15 are 12 times \n     more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other \n     industrialized countries combined;\n       Since gun safety education programs are inadequate to \n     protect children from gun violence;\n       Since a majority of the Senate resolved that the House-\n     Senate Juvenile Justice Conference should meet, consider and \n     pass by April 20, 2000, a conference report to accompany H.R. \n     1501, the Juvenile Justice Act, and that the conference \n     report should retain the Senate-passed gun safety provisions \n     to limit access to firearms by juveniles, felons, and other \n     prohibited persons;\n       Since the one year Anniversary of the Columbine High School \n     tragedy passed on April 20, 2000, without any action by the \n     Juvenile Justice Conference Committee on the reasonable gun \n     safety measures that were passed by the Senate almost one \n     year ago;\n       Since continued inaction on this critical threat to public \n     safety undermines confidence in the ability of the Senate to \n     protect our children and raises concerns about the influence \n     of special interests opposed to even the most basic gun \n     safety provisions;\n       Since this lack of action on the part of the Juvenile \n     Justice Conference Committee and this Congress to stem the \n     flood of gun violence is irresponsible and further delay is \n     unacceptable; and\n       Since protecting our children from gun violence is a top \n     priority for our families, communities, and nation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Determined, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the organizers, sponsors, and participants of the \n     Million Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand \n     sensible gun safety legislation; and\n       (2) Congress should immediately pass a conference report to \n     accompany H.R. 1501, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \n     Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, before the Memorial \n     Day Recess, and include the Lautenberg-Kerrey gun show \n     loophole amendment and the other Senate-passed provisions \n     designed to limit access to firearms by juveniles, convicted \n     felons, and other persons prohibited by law from purchasing \n     or possessing firearms.\n\n  It is very simple. It is a lot of nice and important words, but the \nbottom line is we commend those mothers for marching.\n  We agree with them that we should pass some modest gun laws that will \nstop our children from having access to firearms, that will keep us \nsafe from criminals having access to firearms, that will keep us safe \nbecause we will not allow mentally unbalanced people to have access to \nfirearms. That is all we are saying. We are not talking about stopping \npeople who are law abiding from having a gun if they want it as long as \nthey act responsibly. We are not talking about taking away anybody's \nguns. We are not talking about that at all. We are not talking about \nnot being able to hunt. No.\n  No matter what the gun lobby says to you, I say this: We are saying \nif you are responsible, fine, but if you are a criminal, you cannot \nhave a gun. If you are a child, you cannot have a gun. If you are \nmentally unbalanced, you cannot have a gun.\n  If we cannot pass laws that carry out those requests, then there is \nsomething wrong with us, there is something in this Chamber that is \nstopping us from doing what is right.\n  This is going to be a big issue in this Presidential election. It is \ngoing to be a big issue in the Senate and House races. As a matter of \nfact, we have a National Rifle Association first vice president saying:\n\n       With George Bush in the White House, we'll have a President \n     where we work out of their office.\n\n  Imagine a satellite office of the National Rifle Association in the \nWhite House. Please, we need to protect the people of this country, and \nwe need to do it by passing sensible gun laws and standing up in the \nface of powerful lobby groups, whether it is this one or any other one, \nbecause we should be the ones in the Senate who are free from that kind \nof special interest domination.\n  I pray that tomorrow when we meet--we have a few more hours of \ndebate--we will adopt the Daschle amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I yield back all my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. She is a most \neloquent spokeswoman for her point of view, and I do share many of her \nconcerns. I do believe this: Too many people are dying and we can do \nsomething about it.\n  I want to share tonight some of my ideas about what we can do about \nit. If we do the things I am talking about tonight, we can literally \nsave thousands of lives.\n  It is fair and accurate to say that as a direct result of the \nfailure--it is shocking, stunning to me--of the Clinton administration \nto enforce existing firearm laws, thousands of people have died who \notherwise would not have died. I say that as a person who spent 15 \nyears as a Federal prosecutor working as an assistant U.S. attorney for \n2\\1/2\\ years and almost 12 years as the U.S. attorney appointed to \nprosecute Federal criminal cases. In this body, we only deal with laws \nthat apply to Federal criminal cases, not State cases.\n  We can save lives, but ask anybody who is a long-time, good student \non the subject of crime in America, ``Do you think a law that would \nstop the sale of guns at gun shows is going to stop people from getting \nkilled?'' and they will laugh at you. This is not something that is \ngoing to have a serious impact on crime in America, but it does have \nthe capacity to seriously undermine a popular institution of gun shows \nbecause it delays for so long sales of guns and the gun show activities \nhave closed and people are gone. It just does not work well. People \nhave objected to that. That is where we are today.\n  I am frustrated, as I know the Chair is, because we are now back on \nthis issue. The bill before this body is a military construction bill. \nWe need to address certain matters of construction for our military \nbases and men and women in the service. We need to focus on that and \nget serious about it.\n  The majority leader, Trent Lott, knows what we have to do. We have 13 \nappropriations bills to pass. Are we going to every day have some other \ncontroversial, nongermane, irrelevant amendment brought forward \ndisrupting the flow of the Senate and keeping us from doing the job we \nwant to do? Is that what is going to happen? That is why he has stood \nfirm. No, we are going to stay on military construction; we do not need \nto be on the issue of gun laws today.\n  It is a tactic. I know the Senator is most eloquent, but she also \nsaid basically the truth. She said it was a political issue; the \nDemocrats want to use this in the fall. I suggest they are just playing \npolitics and not talking about matters that will make our streets safer \nand our schools safer. I will talk about those in a minute. Politics is \nnot what we need to be doing now.\n  The gun laws we debated in this body some time ago are, in fact, in \nconference. They passed this Senate. We passed a gun show law. \nVirtually everybody here voted for major restrictions on the gun show \noperations. The Lautenberg amendment was contested. Many believed the \nLautenberg amendment went too far and disrupted a favored institution \nin America--the gun\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nshow. We had a vote on it after a great debate, the thing the Democrats \nwant to continue, apparently. We had a 50-50 tie. The Vice President \nsat in the Presiding Officer's chair and, with great pomp and \ncircumstance, broke the tie in favor of the amendment, walked out here, \nand immediately had a press conference and accused those of us who did \nnot agree with his view on the details of this gun show law of not \ncaring about children, not caring about crime, being indifferent to \nmurder.\n  I was offended by that. I remain offended by that because I have \ncommitted a better part of my professional life to prosecuting \ncriminals and caring about crime and victims. I know them personally. I \npersonally tried approximately 100 gun cases myself, and under my \nsupervision hundreds of gun cases have been prosecuted. I think I know \nsomething about this. I want to share some thoughts about that today.\n  I start off by discussing some basic issues. I am delighted the \nmothers were in town. Most of all, they remind us that children, young \npeople, adults, family members, ourselves, are in danger in America \nbecause of violence and that this Nation needs to use the expertise, \nknowledge, skill, and scientific data to do what we can as a Congress \nto make this country safer. We can do that.\n  How can we reduce crime? How can we save children's lives? How can we \nsave adult lives? How can we make our communities safer? I have studied \nthis for 17 years as a prosecutor. I have read reports and studies of \nthe Department of Justice. I have observed personally and tried to see \nwhat was going on around me, and I want to share some things with you \nabout crime in America.\n  During the sixties and seventies, as the Chair mentioned so \neloquently in his remarks, crime in this country more than doubled. It \ntripled, maybe even quadrupled.\n  We had double-digit increases--15-, 17-, 18-percent crime increases--\na year in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a direct result, in my opinion, \nof a breakdown of discipline, a breakdown of family, an increase in \ndrug use, and a disconnect and a lack of respect for authority in \nAmerica.\n  Our leaders in our colleges and universities, they all said it was \n``cool,'' it was ``doing your own thing,'' it was ``seeking \nfulfillment,'' and you should not teach children to just always be \nautomatons and just follow orders; that they ought to be allowed to \nexpress themselves. They said people were not responsible for their own \nacts. They said crime was a product of finances; how much money you had \nwould affect whether you were a criminal or not--all kinds of things \nlike that.\n  People who are listening to me today, who lived during those times, \nknow I am not exaggerating. As a result, even though crime was going up \ndramatically, we had no increase really in the number of people in \njail. We had a belief afoot in the land, by many of our brightest \npeople, that jail did not work. They would say that putting people in \njail just made them meaner, that it was no good, we needed to treat the \nroot cause of crime, whatever that was, and we needed to increase \nwelfare spending and just give people more money; that we could just \nsort of buy them off. Then they would not riot, rob, steal, rape, and \nkill. I am telling you, that is basically what the deal was in the \n1960s and 1970s.\n  The critical point came when Ronald Reagan ran for President, and he \npromised he was going to promote law and order in this country. He made \na serious commitment; he was going to create a war on drugs. He did \nthat. He set about to appoint prosecutors, such as Jeff Sessions, in \nMobile, AL, and 94 others in the districts around this country. He told \nus to get out there and utilize the skills and abilities and laws we \nhad to fight crime.\n  This Senate and this Congress passed some extraordinarily effective \nand tough laws that had already passed a number of years earlier under \nPresident Nixon--a Speedy Trial Act that said cases had to be tried in \n70 days. That is so much shorter than what goes on in most State courts \ntoday. The Federal Speedy Trial Act of 70 days is a very firm rule, and \ncases are normally tried within 70 days.\n  In addition to that, in the 1980s, under President Reagan, they \npassed a law that eliminated parole. It said that whatever sentence you \ngot, you served it, virtually day for day. It eliminated parole, so a \ncriminal who was sentenced would serve the time the judge gave him. We \ncalled that ``honesty in sentencing.'' We said it was time to quit \njoking about giving someone 30 years and having them serve 6 and be \nright back out on the streets again, robbing and raping and doing other \nkinds of criminal activities. So we had the honesty in sentencing.\n  Then we had mandatory sentencing. Sentencing guidelines were set up. \nMinimum mandatory sentences were set forth under President Reagan and \ninto President Bush's term. Those sentences were very effective.\n  We had an expert group of judges, and others, who analyzed the kinds \nof crimes and helped establish the statutory range of guidelines for \njudges to sentence within. The mandatory minimums said, for example, \nregardless of what else may happen, if you carry a gun during any \ncrime, including a drug crime, you have to be sentenced for 5 years, \nwithout parole, consecutive to the drug crime or the burglary or any \nother crime you may have been sentenced for in Federal court.\n\n  So those are the kinds of things that happened. And the Federal \ncourts improved themselves dramatically.\n  During those 12 years I served as U.S. attorney, a major factor \ndawned on me. We were making some progress. Crime in America began to \ndrop in a number of the years--maybe a majority of the years under \nPresident Reagan's leadership. But it was not always down. In some \nyears it started up, or the crime did not drop enough. I wondered, what \ncould we do?\n  Many questioned whether these sentencing guidelines were working or \nnot. Then it dawned on me why we were not having the impact. It was so \nsimple as to be obvious to anybody who gave any thought to it. Federal \ncourt only tries 2, 3, 1 percent of all the crimes in America; 95, 97, \n98 percent of all crimes tried in America are tried in State courts, \nnot Federal. Even though the Federal court had set the example for the \nState courts, it could not itself, in effect, change the climate in \nAmerica.\n  Over the past number of years, State court systems have gotten fed \nup. They realized that the revolving-door mentality of just arresting \npeople, releasing them on bail, trying them 2 years later, letting them \nplead guilty to 6 months, and having them in a halfway house and then \nback on the streets, selling drugs, conducting crime, was not \neffective; and they passed all kinds of repeat dangerous offender laws.\n  You heard the ``three strikes and you're out'' laws passed in many \nStates. The third time you are convicted of a felony, you serve life \nwithout parole. All kinds of laws such as that were passed in virtually \nevery State in this country. They got tough and serious about crime in \nAmerica and said: We are not going to take it anymore. We are not going \nto allow people who threaten the lives of our children to be released \non the streets. And from 1990 to today, the prison population in \nAmerica has doubled--more than doubled.\n  Many people complain about it. They say to me: Jeff, we have too many \npeople in jail. That is just too many. Oh, this is awful.\n  One person told me one time: If we keep this up, everybody is going \nto be in prison. Of course, that is a joke. Everybody does not commit \ncrimes. Everybody does not rob, rape, shoot, and kill. No, sir. We have \ngotten serious about it. We focused on the repeat dangerous offender \nand did something about it.\n  The Rand Corporation, a number of years ago, did a very important \nstudy. In this study, they interviewed, in depth, people in prison all \nover, but I believe it was mainly in California. They interviewed lots \nof people in prison, in depth, for hours, about what their life was \nlike when they were out involving themselves in crime.\n  They found some amazing facts. They found that a significant number, \nalthough less than a majority of those in prison, were very much \ncriminally inclined, that they were committing as many as 300 crimes a \nyear. Three hundred crimes a year they were committing. It gave further \nimpetus to and further basis for these ``three strikes and you're out'' \nlaws and multiple-offender laws.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n  You might say: They would not commit 300 crimes a year, Jeff. They \nmust not be telling the truth. But listen to me. There are 365 days in \na year. Some of these criminals go out and knock ladies down, take \ntheir purses two or three times a night, break into cars, steal cars, \nbreak into houses, break into stores and office places multiple times \nin one night. Many of them are committing 200, 300 crimes a year; some \nof them more than that.\n\n  So we began to focus on that, and, since about 1990, we have had a \ndecline in the crime rate in America every year. This past year, we \njust had the announcement that the murder rate dropped 7 percent in \nAmerica. I was proud to see that.\n  They can have all the theories they want, but I tell you, there are \nnot that many people in my hometown of Mobile, AL, who are willing to \ncome out and shoot you. There are just not that many of them. And if \nyou identify them when they go out and start committing crimes, and put \nthem in jail, they are not going to be out there to shoot you, your \nfamily, your children, your loved ones. They are not going to be there.\n  I wish there were some way we could do something different. I wish we \ncould have a class for prisoners where they could take this class and \nin 6 months we could release them where they would not commit crimes.\n  You will hear of people who cite studies and say: Oh, this cures \npeople, and they do not ever commit crime again. Look at them closely. \nIf that were so, we would already be doing it. Trust me. Nobody would \noppose that. Nobody would oppose that. But for the most part they do \nnot work. They may help some--and I am not against these kinds of \nprograms--but, fundamentally, many people who are definitely criminally \ninclined will continue to be so.\n  So we made some big progress.\n  The city of Miami--many of you will remember the commitment President \nBush made when he went down there to head the task force in Miami when \nhe was Vice President. They were using automatic weapons, machine guns, \nMAC-11s, slaughtering people. Colombian gangs were operating almost at \nwill. They said they were going to do something about it. Over a period \nof years, Miami has been relieved of those kinds of violent shootings. \nYou almost never hear of a shooting with an automatic weapon in Miami \nanymore. It was brought to a halt.\n  By the way, it has been a crime since the days of Al Capone to have a \nmachine gun. In the midseventies, when I was an assistant U.S. \nattorney, we prosecuted every one of those cases where people had \nmachine guns, fully automatic weapons. So this idea that somehow we \nneed to pass laws to keep people from carrying AK-47s--and you hear \nthat all the time--it is already against the law to carry those \nweapons. It has been in the law for some number of years.\n  Boston, MA, a few years ago, was very concerned about the number of \nmurders in their town. They wanted to do something about it. My staff \nmembers went up and studied their program because we heard such good \ncomments about what they had done. They took young people seriously. \nWhen a young person got in trouble in the juvenile court in Boston, \nthey weren't only given probation and sent home. They had a police \nofficer and a probation officer--and they changed their hours; they \nworked from 3 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 o'clock at night, and the \npolice officer would go out with the probation officer, and if the \ncurfew was at 7 o'clock for young Billy, they knocked on Billy's door \nat 7 o'clock or 7:30 to see if he was home at night. If he wasn't home, \nsomething was done. Almost all of a sudden, they began to realize that \nthese people meant business. They really cared about them. If you care \nabout these young people, you will make sure they are obeying the rules \nyou give them.\n\n  They targeted gang members who were leading gangs and getting \ninvolved in criminal activities and told them: If you keep this up, you \nare going to serve big time in jail. They sent criminals away for long \nperiods. They broke up the gangs and they went a year without a single \njuvenile homicide in Boston.\n  I thought it was a good program. That is why, as chairman of the \njuvenile crime subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we put \nthat kind of effort into our juvenile crime bill that is now being held \nup in conference. That would have been supported financially by the \nFederal Government, encouraging other cities to do those kinds of \nthings that would reduce crime. But let me ask you, do you think we are \ngoing to save lives in Boston, MA, by passing a law to eliminate gun \nshows in America? It is not going to have anything to do with that \ncrime. So we need to do those kinds of things.\n  Another city that had an extraordinary success rate was Richmond, and \nI will talk about it in a minute.\n  So what do we do? We have a juvenile crime bill that is being held up \nin committee. Let me tell you precisely why it is being held up, the \nway I see it. The Senator from California indicates she sees it a \ndifferent way. Let me tell you the way I see it.\n  We had this strong--too strong, in my opinion--gun show amendment. It \ndid not have a majority of support in the Senate. The Senate tied 50/\n50. The Vice President came in here and broke the tie. Only 50 Members \nof this 100-Member body voted for that amendment. They voted for other \namendments that would be less strong and less damaging to the gun show \nactivities but at the same time tightening up the gun show situation. \nIt went to the House of Representatives, a coequal body. For a bill to \nbecome law, it has to pass the Senate and the House. The House, on a \nbipartisan basis--John Dingell, Democrat from Michigan, and a number of \nother Democrats--voted against it, killed the Lautenberg amendment by a \nsubstantial vote.\n  Now, Members of this body are saying the conference committee is \nsupposed to work out a bill and has to put in an amendment that was \nrejected in the House and had a tie vote in the Senate. You don't \nnormally do that. Why would we think the votes in those two Houses \nwould justify that? Surely not. That is not logical. So they are \nsaying, if you don't agree to put in this amendment that was rejected \nalready in the House, we are going to block the bill and keep trying to \noffer amendments here every day to see if we can't embarrass you \nRepublicans so we can have an election issue in November.\n  That is what it is all about. But it is frustrating our ability to do \nour work because we have a military construction bill on the floor. \nThat is what we need to deal with, taking care of that, not repeating \nthe same old arguments we have had with gun laws.\n  Let me tell you what I think ought to be done. In the juvenile crime \nbill, we have, I believe, $80 million for a project CUFF, Criminal Use \nof Firearms by Felons--just a title we came up with--that would provide \nspecial prosecutors in every U.S. attorney's office in America. It \nwould, in effect, step up dramatically the Federal enforcement of \ncriminal laws.\n  By the way, when I became a Member of this Senate 3 years ago, I \nstarted looking at the U.S. attorneys' statistics. I knew how to use \nthem. I reviewed them every year when I was a U.S. attorney. I pulled \nout the book. I was hearing from friends and people in the Department \nof Justice that this Department had allowed criminal prosecution to \ndecline markedly. I looked at the numbers to see if it were true. I was \nshocked to find that, under the Clinton-Gore administration, \nprosecutions of criminal gun cases dropped from 7,000 to around 3,500--\nnearly a 40-percent decline in the prosecutions of gun cases.\n\n  I was shocked because every day the President of the United States \nand Vice President Gore were out there saying: All you Senators and \nCongressmen who won't pass more and more restrictions on innocent law-\nabiding citizens who want to possess guns are for crime, death, \nslaughter, and shootings. You guys are no good. You are not worthy of \nrespect. You are just trash. You care about crime. You defend crime and \nyou don't believe in children.\n  Those are the kinds of things they were saying. At the same time, \nthey had the power and authority to prosecute criminals who were \nactually using guns in criminal activities, and the prosecutions had \ndropped 40 percent. A stunning thing. I didn't ignore it.\n  Nearly 3 years ago--within a year of my being in this office--I \nchallenged the Attorney General herself, Janet\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nReno, about these numbers. She brushed off the debate. A deputy \nattorney general came before the committee and had private meetings \nwhen he was coming around to meet Senators. In his testimony, I asked \nhim and demanded that they do better with the prosecutions of gun \ncases. The chief of the criminal division came by, as did two criminal \ndivision chiefs. I raised it with them. I had charts. I wrote an op-ed \nin 1998, or so, on this very subject, expressing my shock at this \namazing decline in prosecutions. The reason was that was a big deal for \nus. Under President George Bush, we were told to do something about \nthese gun cases. We were Federal prosecutors appointed by the President \nof the United States. All 94 U.S. attorneys were appointed by the \nPresident of the United States as part of the executive branch.\n  We had a project called Project Triggerlock. We had task forces with \nthe sheriffs and the chiefs of police in our area. We met and discussed \nhow to use these tough Federal laws for speedy trial actions with \nmandatory minimum sentences and no parole to crack down on violent \ncriminals.\n  I put together a newsletter. I called it Project Triggerlock News. I \nsent it to all of the chiefs of police and to all of the sheriffs in my \ndistrict. I sent it to the detectives and law enforcement officers who \nI knew were working on these kinds of cases. We showed example after \nexample of criminals who were carrying firearms, and whom we tried in \nFederal court with joint investigations and prosecutions, and they \nserved a long period of time in jail and were removed from the \ncommunity.\n  I couldn't believe an administration that came into office talking \nabout guns had abandoned this program. In fact, they had not totally \nabandoned it. Several years ago, the United States attorney in \nRichmond, VA, and the chief assistant who had been involved in these \ncases over the years got together with the chief of police in Richmond \nand determined to prosecute aggressively all Federal gun violations of \nexisting law in Richmond, VA. They called their project Project Exile. \nThey called it Project Exile because when they convicted them they got \n5 or 10 years without parole. They didn't go to the halfway house in \nRichmond. They were sent off to a Federal prison maybe hundreds of \nmiles away. They were gone, out of Richmond, away for long periods of \ntime without parole. They did this consistently and aggressively.\n  President Clinton's own U.S. attorney, his own appointee, testified \nthat they had achieved a 40-percent reduction in murder rate--a 40-\npercent reduction. They did one thing that we didn't do. They put ads \nout about it. They put up posters: Carry a gun, mandatory Federal jail \ntime. They were out to convince people that they better obey the law, \nand they had better not be misusing guns. They were successful at it. \nThey reduced murder rates 40 percent.\n  I asked Attorney General Reno if she was going to do something about \nthat. Well, we are just going to let each district do what they want \nto, she said.\n  Curiously, I had a hearing set. It was really remarkable to me. We \nhad a hearing on this matter. It was set for Monday morning. The \nadministration did not want us to have this hearing. They kept wanting \nto put it off. I had the U.S. attorney from Richmond, the chief of \npolice, and some experienced prosecutors testify about this kind of \nthing. I was amazed to turn on my radio on Saturday. What do you think \nthe President's radio address to the Nation was on? It was on Project \nTriggerlock, and Project Exile. He had the U.S. attorney from Richmond \nand the chief of police from Richmond in the White House with him while \nhe was doing the address. And he bragged on it, and said how good it \nwas.\n  About 6 weeks later, the Attorney General came up. I had heard that \nthey had not taken any action on it. They appointed some commission to \ntalk about it, and no directives had gone out. I asked her about it. I \nremember asking her how the President sent her directives. Did he send \nthem to her by writing or did she have to turn on the radio and listen \nto him? Because his exact words were, ``I am directing the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of Treasury to crack down on these kinds of \ncriminals.''\n\n  To my knowledge, they still have not made the kind of progress that \nthey should.\n  Do you see the hypocrisy here?\n  We have a plan in Richmond, VA, that I know as an experienced Federal \nprosecutor will save hundreds of lives and thousands of lives.\n  In the time this administration has been in office, I believe I can \nsay with confidence that thousands of people are dead today because \nProject Triggerlock was abandoned and this administration allowed crime \nprosecutions to plummet. That is a tragedy, and it is wrong.\n  But, at the same time, when they come up to me, and they want to \nregister handguns, or they want to close down gun shows, and if I don't \nvote for that, then I don't care about children, I don't care about \npeople getting shot and killed in America. It burns me up. I do not \nlike that. And why the media has not understood this fully is beyond my \ncomprehension.\n  They just continue to suggest that the only thing that counts in this \ncountry is whether or not you vote for further and further restrictions \nthat implicate and sometimes really go beyond implicating but, in fact, \nviolate the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nwhich guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. Somebody will say, \nwell, they don't like that. Well, that is our Constitution. Put it up \nin an amendment, big boy, if you want to change it. Let's see them \nbring forward an amendment to eliminate the second amendment. There is \nno consensus for that in this country. It is part of the heritage of \nthis country that people maintain firearms.\n  We didn't have these kinds of murder rates in the 1930s, the 1940s, \nand the 1950s when a higher percentage of Americans had guns than they \nhave today. I don't know of anybody where I grew up who didn't have a \nfirearm.\n  I say to you first and foremost, how do you reduce crime and murder \nand make our streets safer? Implement President Clinton's own Project \nExile. Mr. President, direct that it be done. See that the Attorney \nGeneral carries it out. Pass our juvenile crime bill which provides you \neven more money than you really need to carry out that project. I say \nyou don't need any more money because we didn't need it when I was U.S. \nattorney. Why can't you prosecute these gun cases? They are not hard to \nprosecute. Really most of them are quite simple, and 80 or 90 percent \nplead guilty. It is a good way to crack down on violence in America.\n  There is one more thing that I want to mention. We implemented the \nNational Crime Information Center--the NCIC--background check. That is \na computer-operated system. So if you go down to a gun store and \nattempt to buy a firearm, they can plug in your Social Security number, \ndate of birth, whatever, and they can run an NCIC check on your \ncriminal history to see if you are a convicted felon. Most of you may \nnot know it, but if you are a convicted felon, you can't possess a \nfirearm, period. You can't possess a shotgun, a rifle, or a pistol. Any \nconvicted felon in America, even if it is a fraud case with no violence \nin it, cannot possess a firearm. We used to prosecute a lot of those \ncases of a ``felon in possession.'' That is what we called them.\n  We found that in 13 months of this new NCIC system, 89,000 \nindividuals were rejected. They could not buy a firearm because they \nhad some problem. Many of them were felons.\n\n  I submit to you they have already filled out a form. I used to \nremember the number. I think it was 4477. On that form they filled out \nthey had to swear under oath they were not a convicted felon. That is a \ncrime. That is a false statement. Also, many of these people turned out \nto be fugitives from other criminal activities.\n  The BATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms--I have great \nfriends in BATF, and they do a good job--is not following up on these \ncases. They have prosecuted less than 1 percent of these 89,000 cases. \nProbably about two-tenths of 1 percent were actually prosecuted.\n  There are some serious criminals in that group. When those cases come \nin and are kicked out and people are rejected because of violence, they \nought to be investigated, and they ought to be prosecuted.\n  I think that would be a great way to identify criminals who are out \nto get\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nguns and are up to no good and are out on the street. There are straw \nmen who use false identities to buy guns. There are illegal sellers of \nguns. There are gun thieves who sell guns and pass them around the \nneighborhoods. Those kinds of people can be prosecuted, too.\n  If you do that, I have no doubt that crime will be reduced. There \nwill be less murders in this country and we could save lives by the \nthousands. That is what we need to do. That is where our focus needs to \nbe.\n  I hope those who came to the moms' march will cause us to focus on \nthe real causes of crime and how to really stop it. If we do, we can \nmake this country safer, we can save lives, and we can do what we are \npaid to do.\n  We need to quit playing politics. We need to get that juvenile crime \nbill up, voted on, and we need some compromise and support from the \nMembers of the other side.\n  Once we do that, we will begin to save lives in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4003-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LAMPTON O'NEAL ``TREY'' WILLIAMS III\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary young man who has persevered to overcome significant \nobstacles in his life and who, in spite of these obstacles, has \nexcelled. Lampton O'Neal ``Trey'' Williams III, of Hattiesburg, \nMississippi, exemplifies the qualities of courage, dedication, \ncommitment, and self-discipline that harken back to the days of this \ngreat nation's founding fathers who likewise employed these values to \novercome seemingly insurmountable adversity. With this graduation from \nthe Presbyterian Christian School in Hattiesburg on Friday, May 19, \n2000, I express my most heartfelt and warmest congratulations to Trey \non this extraordinary accomplishment.\n  As a deaf student, Trey has been saddled in life with a hardship that \nmany of us will never be forced to carry. Yet, from an early age, Trey \nrefused to allow his disability to overcome him and, instead, set out \nto conquer his disability. As a young boy, Trey was enrolled in The \nUniversity of Southern Mississippi DuBard School for Language Disorders \nwhere his eagerness, ability to learn, and refusal to yield to his \ndisability quickly warmed him to the hearts of all around him. During \nhis tenure at the DuBard School, Trey excelled in speech, lip reading, \nlearning language and academic skills. However, Trey's passion for \nlearning and his commitment to his education did not end there.\n  In 1992, having secured from the DuBard School the skills and \nabilities he would need to live a full and free life with his \ndisability, Trey took the noble and daunting step of enrolling in \nregular education classes at the Presbyterian Christian School in \nHattiesburg, Mississippi. Throughout his years at the Presbyterian \nChristian School Trey has continuously challenged himself and has \ndemanded only the best from himself. His motivation, self-discipline \nand character have earned Trey the highest praise from his teachers and \nthe respect of all who know him. And while Trey's forthcoming \ngraduation from the Presbyterian Christian School is a truly \nextraordinary achievement in and of itself, it is only part of the \nstory. As the result of his academic excellence and exceptional \naccomplishments over the past several years, Trey has earned a college \nscholarship. I have no doubt that Trey's strength of character and \ncommitment to his education will result in a college career marked with \nawards and honors only few can ever expect to achieve.\n  Mr. President, Trey's dedication, commitment and perseverance is \nunique and truly commendable. With his graduation on May 19, 2000, Trey \nwill receive a concrete representation of his years of perseverance--\nhis diploma. And while his accomplishments thus far deserve the highest \npraise and commendation, I have no doubt this young man's future will \nbe marked by even greater accomplishments. Trey's refusal to yield to \nhis disability and his determination to overcome it should serve as an \ninspiration and motivation to all of us. It is an example of what we \ncan achieve when we demand the most from ourselves. I want to extend my \nhighest congratulations to Trey on his graduation and wish only the \nbest for him in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4003-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4003-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MARINE COLONEL WAYNE SHAW'S RETIREMENT ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the debt we owe to the men and women who \nhave served in the U.S. Armed Forces is one that we will never be able \nto repay adequately. They sacrifice so much of themselves to defend our \nnation and its ideals, and ask for so little in return.\n  Today, I would like to focus the Senate's attention on one such \nveteran, who entered the United States Marine Corps more than a \nquarter-century ago. Colonel Wayne Shaw, who was a Marine for over 28 \nyears, retired recently and delivered a farewell address to his fellow \nofficers at Quantico, Virginia.\n  Colonel Shaw's address at Quantico was not your typical ``feel-good'' \nretirement speech. In it, he makes a number of observations about how \nthe Marine Corps has changed in recent years--and how, in his view, \nmany of those changes have weakened the Corps that, for the sake of our \ncountry and the world, needs to remain strong. Not a man to mince \nwords, Colonel Shaw lists in his speech a number of concerns he has \nabout the future of the Marine Corps.\n  Colonel Shaw does not question the future of the Corps because of any \ndisillusionment he may have about the institution. Rather, he questions \nthe future of the Corps because of his love for and devotion to it. \nColonel Shaw is certainly entitled--if anyone is--to critique the \nMarine Corps because of his unique commitment to this country for \nnearly three decades. I believe we owe it to Colonel Shaw and other \nveterans like him to pay heed to his words of warning and carefully \nconsider his suggestions to sustain the integrity of the U.S. Marine \nCorps. I hope each and every member of this chamber will do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Colonel Shaw's retirement address be \nprinted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        A Farewell to the Corps\n\n       (Remarks by Colonel Wayne Shaw, USMC, Quantico, Virginia)\n\n       In recent years I've heard many Marines on the occasion of \n     retirements, farewells, promotions and changes of command \n     refer to the ``fun'' they've had in the Marine Corps. ``I \n     loved every day of it and had a lot of fun'' has been voiced \n     far too often. Their definition of ``fun'' must be radically \n     different from mine. Since first signing my name on the \n     dotted line 28\\1/2\\ years ago I have had very little fun.\n       Devoting my entire physical and mental energies training to \n     kill the young men of some other country was not fun. \n     Worrying about how many of my own men might die or return \n     home maimed was not fun. Knowing that we did not have the \n     money or time to train as best we should have, was not fun \n     either. It was no fun to be separated from my wife for months \n     on end, nor was it fun to freeze at night in snow and rain \n     and mud.\n       It was not much fun to miss my father's funeral because my \n     Battalion Commander was convinced our peacetime training \n     deployment just couldn't succeed without me. Missing \n     countless school and athletic events my sons very much wanted \n     me to see was not much fun either. Not being at my son's high \n     school graduation wasn't fun. Somehow it didn't seem like fun \n     when the movers showed up with day laborers from the street \n     corner and the destroyed personal effects were predictable \n     from folks who couldn't hold a job. The lost and damaged \n     items, often irreplaceable family heirlooms weren't much fun \n     to try to ``replace'' for pennies on the dollar. There wasn't \n     much fun for a Colonel with a family of four to live in a \n     1200 sq. ft. apartment with one bathroom that no welfare \n     family would have moved into. It was not much fun to watch \n     the downsizing of the services after Desert Storm as we \n     handed out pink slips to men who risked their lives just \n     weeks before.\n       It has not been much fun to watch mid-grade officers and \n     senior Staff NCO's, after living frugal lives and investing \n     money where they could, realize that they cannot afford to \n     send their sons and daughters to college. Nor do I consider \n     it much fun to reflect on the fact that our medical system is \n     simply broken. It is not much fun to watch my Marines board \n     helicopters that are just too old and train with gear that \n     just isn't what it should be anymore. It is not much fun to \n     receive the advanced copies of promotion results and call \n     those who have been passed over for promotion. It just wasn't \n     much fun to watch the infrastructure at our bases and \n     stations sink deeper into the abyss because funding wasn't \n     provided for the latest ``crisis.'' It just wasn't much fun \n     to discharge good Marines for being a few pounds overweight \n     and have to reenlist Marines who were HIV positive and not \n     world-wide deployable. It sure wasn't much fun to look\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\n     at the dead Marines in the wake of the Beirut bombing and \n     Mogadishu fiascoes and ask yourself what in the hell we were \n     doing there. I could go on and on. There hasn't been much fun \n     in a career that spans a quarter century of frustration, \n     sacrifice and work.\n       So, why did you serve you might ask? Let me answer that: I \n     joined the service out of a profound sense of patriotism. As \n     the son of a career Air Force Senior NCO I grew up on \n     military bases often within minutes flying time from Soviet \n     airfields in East Germany. I remember the Cuban Missile \n     crisis, the construction of the Berlin Wall, the nuclear \n     attack drills in school and was not many miles away when \n     Soviet tanks crushed the aspirations of citizens in \n     Czechoslovakia. To me there was never any doubt that our \n     great Republic and the last best hope of free people needed \n     to prevail in this ultimate contest. I knew I had to serve. \n     When our nation was in turmoil over our involvement in \n     Vietnam I knew that we were right in the macro strategic \n     sense and in the moral sense, even if in the execution we may \n     have been flawed. I still believe to this day that did the \n     right thing. Many of our elite's in the nation today continue \n     to justify their opposition in spite of all evidence that \n     shows they were wrong and their motives either naive or \n     worse. This nation needed to survive and I was going to join \n     others like me to ensure it did. We joined long before anyone \n     had ever referred to service in the infantry units of the \n     Marine Corps as an ``opportunity.''\n       We knew the pay was lousy, the work hard and the rewards \n     would be few. We had a cause, we knew we were right and we \n     were willing when others were not. Even without a threat to \n     our Nation, many still join and serve for patriotic reasons.\n       I joined the Marines out of a sense of adventure. I \n     expected to go to foreign countries and do challenging \n     things. I expected that, should I stick around, my \n     responsibilities would grow as would my rewards. It was \n     exciting to be given missions and great Marines to be \n     responsible for. Finally, I joined for the camaraderie. I \n     expected to lead good men and be led by good men. Marines, \n     who would speak frankly and freely, follow orders once the \n     decision was made and who would place the success of the \n     mission above all else. Marines who would be willing to \n     sacrifice for this great nation. These were men I could trust \n     with anything and they could trust me. It was the camaraderie \n     that sustained me when the adventure had faded and the \n     patriotism was tested. I was a Marine for all of these years \n     because it was necessary, because it was rewarding, because \n     our nation needed individuals like us and because I liked and \n     admired the Marines I served with . . . but it sure wasn't \n     fun.\n       I am leaving active service soon and am filled with some \n     real concerns for the future of our Marine Corps and even \n     more so for the other services. I have two sons who are on \n     the path to becoming Marine Officers themselves. I am \n     concerned about their future and that of their fellow \n     Marines, sailors, airmen and soldiers. We in the Corps have \n     the least of the problems but will not be able to survive in \n     a sick DOD. We have gone from a draft motivated force to an \n     all-volunteer force to the current professional force without \n     the senior leadership being fully aware of the implications. \n     Some of our ills can be traced to the fact that our senior \n     leadership doesn't understand the modern Marine or service \n     member. I can tell you that the 18 year old who walks through \n     our door is a far different individual with different \n     motivations than those just ten years ago.\n       Let me generalize for a moment. The young men from the \n     middle class in the suburbs come in to ``Rambo'' for a while. \n     He has a home to return to if need be and Mom has left his \n     room unchanged. In the back of his mind he has some thoughts \n     of a career if he likes it or it is rewarding. The minorities \n     and females are looking for some skills training but also \n     have considered a career if ``things work out.'' They have \n     come to serve their country but only in a very indirect \n     way. They have not joined for the veterans Benefits \n     because those have been truncated to the point where they \n     are useless. No matter what they do, there is no way it \n     will pay for college and the old VA home loan is not \n     competitive either. There are no real veteran's benefits \n     anymore. . . . It is that simple, and our senior \n     leadership has their head in the sand if they think \n     otherwise. As they progress through their initial \n     enlistments, that are four years or more now, many \n     conclude that they will not be competitive enough to make \n     it a 20 year career or don't want to endure the sacrifices \n     required. At that point they decide that it is time to get \n     on with the rest of their lives and the result is the high \n     first term attrition we currently have to deal with. The \n     thought of a less than honorable discharge holds no fear \n     whatsoever for most. It is a paper tiger. Twenty years ago \n     an individual could serve two years and walk away with a \n     very attractive amount of Veterans benefits that could not \n     be matched by any other sector or business in the country. \n     We have even seen those who serve long enough lose \n     benefits as we stamped from weaker program to weaker \n     program. This must be reversed. We need a viable and \n     competitive GI Bill that is grandfathered when you enter \n     the service, is predicated on an honorable discharge and \n     has increasing benefits for longer service so we can fill \n     the mid grade ranks with quality people. We must do this \n     to stop the hemorrhage of first term attrition and to \n     reestablish good faith and fairness. It will allow us to \n     reenlist a few more and enlist a few less.\n       The modern service member is well read and informed. He \n     knows more about strategy, diplomacy and current events than \n     Captains knew when I first joined. He reads national \n     newspapers and professional journals and is tuned into CNN. \n     Gone are the days of the PFC who sat in Butzbach in the Fulda \n     Gap or Camp Schwab on Okinawa and scanned the Stars and \n     Stripes sports page and listened to AFN. Yet our senior \n     leadership continue to treat him like a moron from the \n     hinterland who wouldn't understand what goes on. He is in the \n     service because he wants to be and not because he can't get a \n     job in the steel mill. Three hots and a cot are not what he \n     is here for. The Grunts and other combat arms guys aren't \n     here for the ``training and skills'' either. He is remarkably \n     well disciplined in that he does what he is told to do even \n     though he knows it is stupid. He is very stoic, but not \n     blind. Yet I see senior leaders all of the time who pile \n     more on. One should remind them that their first platoon \n     in 1968 would have told them to stick it where the sun \n     doesn't shine. These new Warriors only think it. . . . He \n     is well aware of the moral cowardice of his seniors and \n     their habit of taking the easy way out that results in \n     more pain and work for their subordinates. This must be \n     reversed. The senior leadership must have the moral \n     courage to stop the misuse and abuse of the current force. \n     The force is too small, stretched too thin and too poorly \n     funded. These deficiencies are made up on the backs of the \n     Marines, sailors, airmen and soldiers. The troops are the \n     best we've ever had and that is no reason to drive them \n     into the dirt. Our equipment and infrastructure is shot. \n     There is no other way to put it. We must reinvest \n     immediately and not just on the big-ticket items like the \n     F-22. That is the equivalent of buying a new sofa when the \n     roof leaks and the termites are wrecking the structure.\n       Finally let me spend a minute talking about camaraderie and \n     leadership. I stayed a Marine because I had great leaders \n     early on. They were men of great character without preaching, \n     men of courage without ragging, men of humor without rancor. \n     They were men who believed in me and I in them. They \n     encouraged me without being condescending. We were part of a \n     team and they cared little for promotions, political \n     correctness or who your father was. They were well educated \n     renaissance men who were equally at home in the White House \n     or visiting a sick Marine's child in a trailer park. They \n     could talk to a barmaid or a baroness with equal ease and \n     make each feel like a lady. They didn't much tolerate excuses \n     or liars or those with too much ambition for promotion. \n     Someone once told me that Priests do the Lord's work and \n     don't plan to be the Pope. They were in touch with their \n     Marines and supportive of their seniors. They voiced their \n     opinions freely and without retribution from above. They \n     probably drank too much and had an eye for beautiful women as \n     long as they weren't someone's wife or a subordinate. You \n     could trust them with your life, your wife or your wallet. \n     Some of these great leaders were not my superiors--some were \n     my Marines. We need more like them at the senior levels of \n     Government and military leadership today. It is indeed sad \n     when senior defense officials and Generals say things on TV \n     they themselves don't believe and every service member knows \n     they are lying. It is sad how out of touch with our society \n     some of our Generals are.\n       Ask some general you know these ten questions:\n       1. How much does a PFC. make per month?\n       2. How big is the gas tank on a Hummvee?\n       3. Who is your Congressman and who are your two Senators?\n       4. Name one band that your men listen to.\n       5. Name one book on the NY Times best seller list.\n       6. Who won the last superbowl?\n       7. What is the best selling car in America?\n       8. What is the WWF?\n       9. When did you last trust your subordinates enough to take \n     ten days leave?\n       10. What is the leave balance of your most immediate \n     subordinate?\n       We all know they won't get two right and therein lies the \n     problem. We are in the midst of monumental leadership failure \n     at the senior levels. Just recently Gen. Shelton (CJCS) \n     testified that he didn't know we had a readiness problem or \n     pay problems. . . . Can you imagine that level of isolation? \n     We must fix our own leadership problems soon.\n       Quality of life is paid lip service and everyone below the \n     rank of Col. knows it. We need tough, realistic and \n     challenging training. But we don't need low pay, no medical \n     benefits and ghetto housing. There is only so much our \n     morality should allow us to ask of families. Isn't it bad \n     enough that we ask the service members to sacrifice their \n     lives without asking their families to sacrifice their \n     education and well being too? We put our troops on guilt \n     trips when we tell them about how many died for this country \n     and no hot water in housing is surely a small sacrifice to \n     make. ``Men have died and you have the guts to complain about \n     lack of medical care for your kids?'' The nation has been in \n     an economic boom for dam near twenty years now, yet we expect \n     folks in the military to live like lower middle class folks \n     lived in the mid fifties. In 1974 a 2nd Lt. could buy a \n     Corvette for less than his annual salary. Today, you can't \n     buy a Corvette on a Major's annual salary. I can give you 100 \n     other examples . . . An NROTC midshipman on scholarship got \n     $100 a month in 1975. He or\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n     she still gets $100 in 1999. No raise in 25 years? The QOL \n     life piece must be fixed. The Force sees this as a truth \n     teller and the truth is not good.\n       I stayed a Marine despite the erosion of benefits, the \n     sacrifices of my wife and children, the betrayal of our \n     junior troops and the declining quality of life because of \n     great leaders, and the threat to our way of life by a truly \n     evil empire that no longer exists. I want men to stay in the \n     future.\n       We must reverse these trends. There will be a new ``evil \n     empire'' eventually. Sacrifices will need to be made and \n     perhaps many things cannot change but first and foremost we \n     must fix our leadership problems. The rest will take care of \n     itself. If we can only fix the leadership problem. . . . \n     Then, I still can't promise you ``fun'' but I can promise you \n     the reward and satisfaction of being able to look in the \n     mirror for the rest of your life and being able to say: ``I \n     gave more to American than I ever took from America. . . . \n     and I am proud of it.''\n       Semper Fi and God Bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4005-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to speak about S. 2557, the \nNational Energy Security Act of 2000.\n  First of all, I want to thank the Republican leader, Senator Lott, \nwho pulled together a task force to address the serious problem of the \nlack of a national energy policy, and also Senator Murkowski, Chairman \nof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  From my viewpoint on the Task Force, I was representing a State that \nappeared to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine as Maine was one \nof the early Northeast states not only to bear the brunt of low oil \ninventories during this past winter that was 20 degrees below normal in \nJanuary, but a state that also experienced some of the highest prices \nin the country for home heating oil, kerosene and propane. Prices \ndoubled and remained high throughout the winter months only then to be \nfollowed this spring by the highest prices in over two decades at the \ngas pump. And, this week, prices at the pump are once again on their \nway up, jumping more than 12 cents overnight.\n  The entire episode has pointed out just how vulnerable--and \nunprepared--the Federal Government is when it comes to a workable \nenergy policy. As we found out, there was no short term policy to \nfollow. The Administration, as Secretary Richardson stated at an oil \ncrisis summit in Bangor last February, was caught napping. So, the goal \nof the task force was to come up with legislation that would decrease \nthe country's dependency on foreign oil to 50 percent by the year 2010 \nthrough the enhancement of the use of renewable energy resources and \nincludes the extension of tax credits for the production of energy from \nbiomass, including wood waste; increases eligibility to the federal \nWeatherization Program, an outreach program to encourage consumers to \ntake actions to avoid seasonal price increases through a summer fill \nand fuel budgeting program; and provides tax credits for residential \nuse of solar power.\n  The bill enhances domestic energy production oil by offering tax \nrelief for oil and gas produced from small marginal wells--wells that \nproduce less than 15 barrels a day--that have already been drilled but \nhave been capped when oil prices hit rock bottom over the past few \nyears. Bringing these marginal wells back into domestic production also \nhas the benefit of producing more U.S. jobs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill authorizes the Secretary of \nEnergy to establish a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve to be used when \nhome heating oil inventories fall dangerously low and prices escalate. \nThe Reserve would store two million barrels of refined home heating oil \nwithin a day's delivery to Northeast states if supplies run dangerously \nlow because of a sudden demand due to cold winter weather.\n  Mr. President, I would have liked to have been a cosponsor of S. \n2557, because we need a comprehensive policy and the National Energy \nSecurity Act was an effort to start down that road. I cannot, however, \nbecause the bill also calls for the opening up of the Arctic Coastal \nPlain, which would allow for oil and gas exploration and drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I continue to believe that ANWR \nshould remain protected and there are a number of other steps that can \nbe taken to increase or conserve our domestic supply.\n  Now that this legislation has been introduced, potential solutions to \nour Nation's energy policy--or lack of it--can at least be considered \nand debated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4005-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MONTANA'S LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Montana's Law \nEnforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty. These \nindividuals have given their lives protecting the innocent and I can \nthink of no more noble endeavor.\n  We have recently considered a resolution that will make May 15th a \nnational memorial day for peace officers. I think it is high time that \nthe nation joins Montana in setting aside time to honor our law \nenforcement officers. For the past twelve years Montana has celebrated \nthe dedication of its law enforcement officers on this day. I wish to \ncommend Terry Tyler and the other members of the Professional Justice \nCommunity of Montana whose hard work and sacrifice to preserve and \nrecognize the officers who have died in the line of duty are the best \nexamples of the ``Montana Spirit'' that I know so well. I was pleased \nto support that resolution as I am pleased to commend and commemorate \nthe Montana Law Enforcement Museum for its continuing commitment to \nhonoring our fallen law enforcement officers who placed public safety \nbefore their own.\n  Montana law enforcement traditions can be traced back to April 1863 \nwhen Henry Plummer became the state's first elected sheriff. Since that \ntime Montana's law enforcement officers have been charged with the \nprotection and defense of the public and our laws. In Montana, our \ncitizens enjoy a life style not marred by daily occurrences of gun \nviolence and crime. Our children do not feel threatened in our schools \nand it is commonplace to leave your door unlocked. I can think of no \ngreater testament to the hard work and dedication of our law \nenforcement officers and the people of Montana who support their \nefforts.\n  It is only right that we take a day to remember those who have died \nso that others may live in a safe and secure environment. It is an \nhonor and privilege to stand and recognize the efforts of these people \nand those who will not let their efforts go unnoticed. So, I wish to \nclose with gratitude for those individuals who have dedicated their \nlabors to a higher cause and who continually put their lives on the \nline to protect me and my family. On behalf of the state of Montana and \nthe Nation, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4005-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4005-S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LAW ENFORCEMENT SURVIVORS' EDUCATION BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in tribute to all \nthe men and women in law enforcement in this country. This week, May \n14-20, is National Police Week, set aside to honor the men and women \nbehind the badge. In 1962, Congress passed and President Kennedy signed \na joint resolution proclaiming May 15 of each year as Peace Officers \nMemorial Day and the calendar week of each year during which such May \n15 occurs as Police Week, ``in recognition of the service given by the \nmen and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect \nus through enforcement of our laws,'' from Public Law 87-726.\n  Sadly, between 140 and 160 law enforcement officers die in the line \nof duty each year. On average, 21,433 officers are injured in the line \nof duty each year.\n  In honor of the thousands of officers who have given their lives to \nprotect the people of this Nation, I am pleased to announce an \nimportant step that the Senate took yesterday in furtherance of a much \nneeded change in the current federal law. Last September I introduced \nS. 1638, a bill to expand the educational opportunities under the \nDeegan program, named after slain Federal officer Bill Deegan, for the \nfamilies of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. This \nbill honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our \ncommunities by making available Federal funds to those officers' \nspouses and dependent children in order to pursue secondary education.\n  Yesterday, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, the Senate \nunanimously passed S. 1638. I want to thank\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nthe Senate for taking this action, and urge the House to do the same.\n  I want to thank the co-sponsors of this bill--Senators Collins, \nGrams, Robb, Tim Hutchinson, Dodd, Abraham, Specter, Bryan, Gregg, \nHelms, and Biden. I am very pleased by the bipartisan support for the \nbill, and for the endorsements of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation and other law enforcement organizations.\n  This bill extends retroactively the benefits created under the 1992 \nlaw to the surviving spouses and dependent children of law enforcement \nofficials who were killed between 1978 and the current start dates of \nthe program.\n  It is important to extend these benefits back to the year 1978 \nbecause under the existing program, a large number of dependent \nchildren currently between the ages 8 and 21, those born between 1978 \nand 1992, are excluded from participating in the program merely because \ntheir parent was killed before 1992. Pushing back the date allows these \ndependent children, currently facing the prospect of paying for \nsecondary education in the often financially strained environment of a \nsingle-parent family, also to benefit from this program.\n  This goal is consistent with the intent of the original law: an \neffort to show our gratitude to the maximum number of dependent \nchildren of slain law enforcement officers.\n  This provision affects the families of an estimated 4,100 officers, \nincluding more than 60 in Missouri. The bill makes these spouses and \ndependent children eligible for up to $5820 a year for 4 years if they \nenroll in full-time study at an approved secondary school. In short, it \nhelps the loved ones of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in \ndefending the rest of us by allowing them to pursue their dreams to \nmove forward with their lives and continue their education.\n  On this occasion, I also want to thank a very important organization \nheadquartered in Camdenton, MO--the Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. \n[COPS]. COPS was organized in 1984 with 110 members. Today COPS' \nmembership is over 10,000 families. Concerns of Police Survivors, \nprovides resources to assist in the rebuilding of the lives of \nsurviving families of slain law enforcement officers.\n  Furthermore, COPS provides training to law enforcement agencies on \nsurvivor victimization issues and educates the public of the need to \nsupport the law enforcement profession and its survivors.\n  To help those families begin rebuilding their shattered lives, COPS \nis again hosting the National Police Survivors' Seminars as part of \nNational Police Week--the second day of this seminar is occurring today \nin Alexandria, VA. For 15 years, COPS' National Police Survivors' \nSeminars have provided survivors of law enforcement officers killed in \nthe line of duty the opportunity to interact with other survivors and \nhave access to some of the best mental health professionals available. \nI wish to thank COPS for the many programs that they operate in \naddition to the Police Survivors' Seminars, including scholarships, \npeer-support at the national, State, and local levels, ``C.O.P.S. \nKids'' counseling programs, the ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' Summer Camp, Parents' \nRetreats, trial and parole support, and other assistance programs.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of police \nofficers who protect the lives and property of their fellow Americans. \nBy the enforcement of our laws, these same officers have given our \ncountry internal freedom from fear and are responsible for helping our \nnation lower its crime rates again this year. These men and women, by \ntheir patriotic service and their dedicated efforts, have earned the \ngratitude of us all.\n  Officers who give their lives to protect our freedom leave behind \nfamilies that must cope with the terrible loss. When this tragedy \noccurs, we have an obligation to help the spouses and children of \nfallen heroes. One way to help is to offer the opportunity to pursue \ntheir education. I thank the Senate for supporting this bill, and urge \nthe House of Representatives to pass this legislation quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4006-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BURMA'S FORCED MILITARY SERVICE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on Monday, the Financial Times carried \na story headlined ``Burma Regime Has the Most Child Soldiers.'' As \nBurma drives toward a goal of a half million man army, more than 50,000 \nchildren have been forced into military service, with orphans and \nstreet children the most vulnerable.\n  These are the facts of life in Burma that no longer surprise any of \nus who follow the region closely. Forced labor, forced relocations, \narrests, detention, torture, even executions are more facts--repeated \nso often that it is easy to develop a tin ear to the unreal horrors \nthese words convey about daily life in Burma. Add words like hunger, \ndisease, and illiteracy--add unemployment, injustice and drug \ntrafficking, and you get the full picture of the misery the Rangoon \nregime has created.\n  As acute as Burma's pain is, this is not a day of mourning. Today is \na celebration of wisdom and courage--a tribute to Burma's citizens who \n10 years ago defied all risks and elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the \nNational League for Democracy [NLD] to lift the nation from a deep \nswamp of poverty, brutality and repression to the solid ground of \ndemocracy and prosperity.\n  The army may have stolen Burma's elections and her rightful past, but \nthey will not be allowed to diminish our faith nor discourage our \nservice to her future--to Burma's freedom.\n  For 10 years, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has honored the wisdom and courage \nof her constituents through countless acts of self-discipline, heroic \njudgment and profound humility. Treated with cruelty, especially during \nher husband's final days, her compassion has not withered. Imprisoned, \nisolated by house arrest, she finds strength to reach out for a \npeaceful, political dialog with her captors. Wounded with each report \nof a follower's detention or death, she does not scar with bitterness, \nshe does not retreat from her destined course--democracy.\n  Today, Senator Moynihan and I have introduced a resolution of support \nfor that destiny--for the restoration of democracy. Joined by Senators \nLott, Helms, Leahy, Ashcroft, Feinstein, Lugar, Durbin, Kennedy, \nSarbanes and Wellstone, we are honored to have the opportunity to pay \ntribute to those who persevere in the noble quest for Burma's liberty.\n  In particular, let me offer my appreciation to the Members and \nfriends of the NLD who work tirelessly for Burma's free future and, \nespecially the guardian angel of our common cause, Michelle Bohanna.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4006-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this week I join people in Wisconsin \nand across the nation in celebrating Taiwanese-American Heritage Week. \nThis week of celebration, from May 7 to May 14, honors the many diverse \ncontributions of over 500,000 Taiwanese-Americans in the\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nUnited States. These Americans have contributed significantly to our \nsocial fabric, making notable contributions as medical professionals, \nNobel Laureate scientists, business owners, human rights activists, and \nteachers.\n  While it is important to recognize the achievements of Taiwanese-\nAmericans in the United States, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week also \ngives us the opportunity to celebrate the success of democracy in \nTaiwan. Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, Taiwan has made \nconsistent strides toward becoming an open, democratic society where \nfreedoms are respected and the will of the people is observed. To the \ncredit of the many Taiwanese-Americans who fought to bring democratic \nprinciples back to the island, Taiwan is now a vibrant democratic \nmember of the international community.\n  With the recent election of opposition leader Chen Shui-bian as \nPresident, Taiwan has again reaffirmed its commitment to the open \nelectoral process that is the cornerstone of democracy. While this \nelection bodes well for the future of a democratic Taiwan, many \nchallenges remain. Taiwan must continue to resist internal anti-\ndemocratic forces, while also providing for its own security in a \nregion with too few democratic neighbors. However, I am confident that \nTaiwan will meet these challenges and continue to play a productive \nrole in the international community.\n  Mr. President, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week properly recognizes \nthe longstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. Once \nagain, I commend the accomplishments and on-going contributions of the \nTaiwanese-American community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4007-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ERUPTION OF MT. ST. HELENS\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I take the floor today to \ncommemorate one of the most significant events in the history of my \nstate--the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. On the 18th of May, 1980, Mt. \nSt. Helens exploded with the force of a 24-megaton atomic bomb, \nscorching 230 square miles of picturesque Northwest landscape and \ntriggered the largest known landslide in history, traveling at nearly \n200 mph to bury Spirit Lake and the Toutle River. Tragically, fifty-\nseven men and women lost their lives, over 200 homes and 180 miles of \nroad were destroyed and caused $3 billion in damages.\n  Since that horrific day, the great people of Washington state began \nthe long road to recovery. Today, I would like to recognize the \nastounding efforts of thousands of volunteers and donations from \ncountless companies that have succeeded in making Mt. St. Helens a \nplace where trees are growing at record speeds and animals are \nbeginning to thrive in their new home.\n  Mt. St. Helens is now a place where tens of thousands of visitors \nflock every year from around the globe to witness both the violent and \nhealing powers of nature. Local residents devastated by the eruption \nhave transformed their communities and now look to Mt. St. Helens to \nattract visitors and contribute to the local economy.\n  There is still, however, an enormous amount of work to be done to \nhelp Mt. St. Helens and the surrounding areas continue on this path to \nrecovery. The local communities' dedication to rebuilding \ninfrastructure and ecosystems, the creation of a renowned research \nfacility, and the construction of a world-class tourist attraction have \ndemonstrated the highest degree of responsiveness and resourcefulness.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers and the U.S. Forest Service for their achievements \nand commitment in bringing Mt. St. Helens back to life.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Chairman of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and a member of the Mt. St. \nHelens Institute Advisory Board, I am deeply committed to helping Mt. \nSt. Helens make the best possible recovery and to finding federal \ndollars to keep Mt. St. Helens accessible and enjoyable for all \nvisitors and to assist the surrounding communities in finding solutions \nto their many challenges.\n  I am confident that in the next twenty years the people of the \nNorthwest will make even greater strides in reviving the beauty of Mt. \nSt. Helens, making Washington state an even greater place to \nlive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4007-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4007-S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REFLECTIONS ON THE BOZEMAN DRUG COURT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ninnovative work of the Drug Treatment Court in Gallatin County, \nMontana.\n  Recently I worked for a day at the Drug Court, where I witnessed the \nprocess of evaluating drug court cases and determining who was \nfollowing the rules--and who was not.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I was very impressed and inspired by the \nwhole process--Judge Olson, his staff, the prosecutors, defense \nattorneys, parole and probation officer, counselors. And, most \nimportant of all, the people who have voluntarily decided to turn their \nlives around. This pilot project in Bozeman, Montana should be \nreplicated around the state and nation.\n  In the morning, I sat in on the briefing, where judges and all the \nparties involved in sanctioning defendants discussed--with compassion \nand sometimes frustration--their attempts to help these people get off \nand stay off of drugs and alcohol.\n  Their discussions centered not on punishment, but on finding common-\nsense ways to help these people addicted to drugs and alcohol find ways \nto improve their lives and be positive contributors to their \ncommunities.\n  And, sitting later in court, I saw the genuine and sincere attempts \nof the defendants to correct their lives and stay out of jail.\n  Judge Olson was remarkable. He mixed just the right amount of \ncompassion with tough love to help the defendants.\n  He counseled them, warned them, cajoled them, and told them he \npersonally would help them find jobs so they could stay ``clean.'' His \nwork is to be highly commended and copied throughout Montana.\n  The defendants also showed that they can beat drugs and alcohol. One \nmiddle-aged man told me later that the Treatment Court was the best \nthing that ever happened in his life. He had become clean for the first \ntime in 30 years. He owed his life to the Treatment Court. Now he is \ntrying to find ways to help other people.\n  The Treatment Court is a success story waiting to be copied. It is a \nway to keep people out of jail, off the streets and in a job.\n  Yes, some people slip up and don't abide by the rules. When they do, \nJudge Olson cracks down on them. But when they succeed, Judge Olson \npraises them, and shakes their hand.\n  His personal involvement in the lives of these people shows that \njustice does know compassion, that courts can be places where people \nheaded for jail can make a detour--and be given a chance to redirect \ntheir lives. Mr. President, I want to say that I was inspired by what I \nsaw last Friday in Treatment Court in Bozeman. And I want to help to \nfind funding for the Bozeman Treatment Court, as well as funding for \nsimilar courts throughout Montana.\n  Such an investment in people--in helping them become positive \ncitizens in their communities rather than burdens--will save us money--\nand lives--in the long run.\n  And I will also work hard to help the Treatment Court find funds to \nhelp defendants locate affordable housing, get a good education and \ngood jobs. What struck me, Mr. President, was that many of the \ndefendants suffered from a lack of education. My work day in \nTreatment Court reminded of the importance and power of education, as \nwell as the importance of creating good-paying jobs.\n\n  Along with families, they are the building blocks of a strong and \nhealth society, and help keep people off drugs and alcohol.\n  Count me a supporter of this successful program.\n  The treatment court idea embodies steps crucial to curbing the \ninfluence of drugs on our society.\n  Nationally, such treatment courts are a relatively new idea. The \nfirst drug courts were created in Florida in 1989, under the \nsupervision of Janet Reno.\n  She and others realized that the solution to the rising number of \ndrug related cases was not to increase the capacity of the criminal \njustice system--but to reduce the number of drug users.\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\n  The Gallatin Treatment Court is only seven months old. And while its \nfirst participants have yet to graduate, based on my experience I \nbelieve most will succeed.\n  Roger Curtiss, who works with the Drug Court and heads the non-profit \nAlcohol and Drug Services program of Gallatin County, told me how he \novercame his own drug addiction problems after being placed in a \nsimilar program.\n  I also learned what a dedicated and talented staff Roger has \nsupporting him in his efforts to reduce the scourge of drugs.\n  I remain committed to fighting illegal drug use in Montana. While I \nbelieve that treatment courts such as Gallatin County's will play an \nincreasing role in the fight against drugs, other steps must be taken.\n  In January I invited drug czar Barry McCaffrey to Montana for a \nconference. He spoke to dozens of Montanans about the challenge posed \nby methamphetamine and other drugs.\n  One experience sticks out in particular. At the town hall meeting we \nhad a man named Wayne approach the microphone to address the group. He \nfidgeted as he told his story about being addicted to meth for nearly \n20 years. He said, ``People don't understand the affect of this drug. \nIt tears the brains up. It rips the family apart. It has a hold that \nnever lets go.''\n  Mr. President, Wayne is not alone. Across Montana and rural America, \nmeth and other drugs are tearing families--and communities--apart.\n  In January the DEA reported that eighth graders in rural America are \n83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine than their urban \ncounterparts. And they are 104 percent more likely to use meth.\n  The bottom line is that drugs destroy lives and communities.\n  The solution to the ongoing fight against drugs will be found only \nthrough constant innovation of the type demonstrated by Gallatin \nCounty's Treatment Court and similar programs across the nation.\n  To that end I have introduced legislation to make Montana part of the \nRocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n  The bill would allow Montana to embark on an intensive, statewide \nmedia campaign and hire additional personnel for methamphetamine \nprosecution.\n  And because WHAT you know depends so much on WHO you know, the \nmeasure would establish a state-wide criminal intelligence network, \nallowing law-enforcement officials in all 56 counties to share \ninformation on criminal activity.\n  Mr. President, if I learned one thing from my meetings with the \nGeneral McCaffrey and last Friday's visit to the treatment court, it is \nthat there are many committed individuals fighting the drug problem.\n  The trick is to get them all together working to the same end: \ntreatment, prevention and law enforcement must all coordinate their \nefforts to fight the scourge of drugs.\n  We in Congress must do the same. At the end of last session the \nSenate passed legislation to fight meth, by beefing up law enforcement \nand treatment resources throughout the nation.\n  Both S. 486--sponsored by Senator Ashcroft--and an amendment to the \nBankruptcy Bill--sponsored by Senator Hatch--passed the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, both bills have languished in the House of \nRepresentatives. Neither has been acted upon, and the legislative days \nfor the 106th Congress are numbered. I urge my colleagues in the House \nto act now to strengthen resources in the fight against illegal drugs, \nmeth in particular.\n  Finally, I want to again recognize the efforts of the Bozeman Drug \nCourt and thank them for allowing me to witness their innovative and \ninspiring work first-hand.\n  Drug Court is an alternative, but it's not easy. For many it is just \nas difficult as serving time.\n  In fact, I witnessed one individual who, after continually breaking \nthe rules, was kicked out of drug court. Now he faces five years of \njail time.\n  But with our jails bursting at the seams and the drug problem \nmushrooming in rural areas, I believe the Drug Court is an effective \ntool in fighting the drug problem we face.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4008-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WLNS-TV IN LANSING, MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize WLNS-TV \nin Lansing, Michigan, a station which will celebrate its 50th \nAnniversary on May 18, 2000. For fifty years, Channel 6 has provided \nLansing residents with a wonderful mix of local and national news, \ncommunity events and information, and an assortment of entertaining and \ninsightful programming.\n  On May 1, 1950, WJIM-TV, Channel 6, signed on the air in Lansing, \nMichigan. The station was founded by Mr. Harold Gross, and for the next \nforty-four years he owned WJIM-TV. In 1984, Bakke Communications bought \nWJIM-TV, and changed the call letters to WLNS-TV. In 1986, the \nstation's current owners, Young Broadcasting of Lansing, Inc., \npurchased WLNS-TV.\n  Serving the Lansing community has always been, and remains, the first \nand foremost priority of WLNS-TV. Channel 6 covers 24 hours of local \nnews per week. It broadcasts Town Hall meetings on important community \nissues; political debates; major high school and college sporting \nevents; severe weather and school closing information; and regular \nannouncements highlighting important activities for hundreds of non-\nprofit organizations in the community.\n  As a C.B.S. affiliate, WLNS-TV is able to keep Lansing residents \nabreast of local as well as national and global events. In addition, \nChannel 6 offers C.B.S. entertainment programs and national sporting \nevents. For instance, when the Michigan State University Men's \nBasketball Team won the N.C.A.A. Championship this past season, Lansing \nviewers turned to WLNS-TV not only to watch the games, but also to get \nlocal updates on their favorite team and its players.\n  Mr. President, Channel 6 has been home to many prominent Lansing \npersonalities over the years, including Martha Dixon, hostess of the \ncooking show ``The Copper Kettle''; Len Stuttman, host of ``The Many \nWorlds of Len Stuttman''; Bill Dansby, news anchor and news director in \nthe 1960's; Howard Lancour, host of the children's show ``Alley Cat and \nthe Mayor,'' and a news anchor in the 1970's; and Jane Aldrich and \nSheri Jones, current news anchors who have 25 years of combined tenure \nat WLNS-TV.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the many people whose efforts over the years \nhave made this birthday possible. I think it is safe to say that the \nlong term success of WLNS-TV is representative of how much Channel 6, \nand its many employees, mean to the Lansing community. On behalf of the \nentire United States Senate, I would like to wish WLNS-TV in Lansing, \nMichigan, a happy 50th Anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4008-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4008-S4009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARVIN STONE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. U.S. News and World Report, in \nspeaking of the death of Marvin Stone, spoke of one man's ``superior \ncontribution''.\n  Marvin Stone contributed more than should be expected of someone who \nhad had a dozen life times and far more than anyone could have expected \nin a span of seventy-six years.\n  Marvin Stone, born in Burlington, VT, served in the Pacific in World \nWar II and then went on to become one of the most respected journalists \nin America.\n  My wife, Marcelle, and I have been privileged to know Marvin and his \nwonderful wife, Terry. I think with fondness not only of times together \nwith them, Marvin's sister, Marilyn Greenfield, and the many friends in \nBurlington, but also evenings with those far reaching conversations at \ntheir home in the Washington area.\n  Marvin took the time to call me when I was a brand new Senator, even \nthough he probably was at first curious about the oddity of a Democrat \nfrom Vermont. We became close friends and throughout two decades I \ncalled upon him for advice and insight. I knew the advice would come, \nnever tinged with partisanship but underlined with a great sense of \nhistory and his overwhelming integrity.\n  I can only imagine the void this leaves in the life of Terry, his \nwife of fifty years, of Jamie and Stacey and Torren and all his family. \nHe also leaves a great void in our country.\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nMarvin's legacy, though, is also one of example, and those, especially \nin the field of journalism, who follow that example, can also seek the \nrespect and the honor that he earned.\n  I ask that the US News World Report article be printed in the Record \nas well as the obituary in the Washington Post.\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, May 15, 2000]\n\n                  One Man's ``Superior Contribution''\n\n       Journalist Marvin L. Stone, who died of cancer last week at \n     76, played a transforming role a generation ago as the editor \n     of U.S. News & World Report.\n       In his decade of leadership, from 1976 to 1985, Stone was \n     responsible for U.S. New's editorial shift toward the center \n     from the more conservative views held by its founder, David \n     Lawrence. Stone expanded the magazine's coverage beyond its \n     traditional emphasis on politics and business to include \n     social, cultural, and educational issues. He introduced four-\n     color photography and changed the character of the editorial \n     staff by recruiting younger journalists, women, and minority \n     reporters. ``Ours is a magazine devoted to a singular ideal: \n     to report, clarify, interpret, and project the news--to put \n     people and events in perspective as objectively as humanly \n     possible,'' Stone once told a national convention of Sigma \n     Delta Chi, the journalism society, ``Put another way: to \n     provide information people can rely on, find useful, can act \n     upon.''\n       Born and raised in Vermont, Stone served in World War II as \n     an attack boat officer in the Pacific. He began his 40-year \n     journalism career as a police reporter for the Huntington \n     (W.Va.) Herald-Dispatch. As an International News Service \n     correspondent based in Tokyo, Vienna, Paris, and London, he \n     covered the Korean War and the French Indochina War and broke \n     the news that the Soviet Union had developed a hydrogen bomb.\n       To the moon. In 1961, a year after he joined U.S. News, \n     Stone covered the construction of the Berlin Wall. Later in \n     the 1960's, he reported on topics as varied as coal mining in \n     Kentucky and space shots to the moon. He authored the \n     Doubleday Science Series book Man in Space.\n       When Mortimer B. Zuckerman bought U.S. News in 1984, Stone \n     was holding two positions, editor of the magazine and \n     chairman of its parent company. After what we termed six \n     ``amicable'' months with Zuckerman, he resigned to become \n     deputy director of the United States Information Agency, a \n     position he held for four years. From 1989 to 1995, he was \n     the founding president and chairman of the International \n     Media Fund, an organization that encouraged a free press in \n     Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n       Zuckerman, chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S. News, said, \n     ``Marvin Stone was one of the giants of post-World War II \n     journalism. His talent as a reporter and an editor brought \n     him one of the great positions of journalism as the editor of \n     U.S. News & World Report. He extended his career by \n     outstanding service in the public arena. He was a great \n     friend and a great colleague. He shall be missed by all who \n     benefited from his wisdom and insight.''\n       In 1985, Ronald Reagan hailed Stone's 25 years with U.S. \n     News as a ``superior contribution'' to American journalism. \n     Said the president: ``You helped make the world's events and \n     our challenges just a little more understandable.''\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 2000]\n\n              Marvin L.

He became the \n     equivalent of editor in chief in 1976, and over the next nine \n     years, he propelled the magazine away from some of its \n     conservative editorial positions and added cultural features \n     and colorful layouts. He resigned in 1985, shortly after \n     Mortimer B. Zuckerman purchased the publication.\n       Among the changes Mr. Stone oversaw during his years at the \n     magazine were the addition of full-color photographs and \n     service stories about medical, scientific and social trends. \n     Mr. Stone, who considered himself conservative, told The \n     Washington Post in 1982 that he viewed his impact less as a \n     ``revolution'' than an ``evolution.''\n       Mr. Stone was deputy director of the U.S. Information \n     Agency from 1985 to 1989, followed by six years as president \n     and chairman of the International Media Fund, a Washington-\n     based, government-funded organization encouraging a free \n     press in Eastern Europe. After the fund went defunct in 1995, \n     he spent the next year in Europe on a Knight Foundation \n     journalism fellowship before retiring.\n       Marvin Lawrence Stone was born in Burlington, Vt., and \n     served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. He \n     graduated from Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., and \n     received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia \n     University.\n       He was a police reporter in Huntington before joining the \n     old International News Service wire agency in the 1950s, \n     where his assignments included the Korean War.\n       Mr. Stone was named to the Sigma Delta Chi journalism \n     society's Journalism Hall of Fame in 1990.

His memberships included Temple Rodef Shalom in \n     Falls Church, the Cosmos Club and the Military Order of the \n     Caribao.\n       He was the author of ``Man in Space,'' a 1974 booklet that \n     was part of a Doubleday science series.\n       Survivors include his wife of 50 years, Sydell ``Terry'' \n     Stone of Falls Church; two daughters, Jamie Faith Stone of \n     Falls Church and Stacey Hope Goodrich of West Melbourne, \n     Fla.; a son, Torren M.

She \nreturned to the Reid Professorship at Trinity in 1981, while continuing \nwith RTe on a part-time basis.\n  In 1987, Mary McAleese was appointed Director of the Institute of \nProfessional Legal Studies, which trains barristers and solicitors for \nthe legal profession in Northern Ireland. In 1994, she was appointed a \nPro-Vice Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast. Other appointments \nthat she has held include Director of Channel 4 Television, Director of \nNorthern Ireland Electricity, Director of the Royal Group of Hospitals \nTrust, and delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Trade and \nInvestment in Ireland and follow-up Pittsburgh Conference in 1996. She \nwas also a member of the Catholic Church delegation to the North in \n1996, the Commission on Contentious Parades, the Catholic Church \nEpiscopal Delegation to the New Ireland Forum in 1984, and was a \nfounding member of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.\n  On November 11, 1997, Mary McAleese was inaugurated as the eighth \nPresident of Ireland.

Mr. President, I rise today to express support for \nAmerican men and women serving overseas in our Armed Services. These \nmen and women are faced with difficult missions--made even more \ndifficult by the fact that they are serving far from home and loved \nones.\n  Despite these difficulties, the men and women of our armed forces \nhave met every expectation, fulfilled every mission, and upheld the \ntrust of the American people. This is especially commendable because \nover the last several years, our Armed Forces have been charged with \nrestoring peace and maintaining order in some of the most intractable \nconflicts around the globe.\n  Out of many service members, one individual I am proud to recognize \nis Army Staff Sgt. Travis Elliston. I am proud to say that he is a \nMontana native, from the town of Kalispell. Elliston is a squad leader \nwith Company B, 3rd Battalion, 504th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division \nfrom Fort Bragg, N.C.\n  During his time in Vrbovac, Kosovo, Elliston has shown the dedication \nand\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\ninnovation required in today's military.\n  The quality of his work is reflected in his own words. In a February \ninterview with Stars and Stripes Magazine, Elliston spoke about his \nwork with Vrbovac's residents--many of whom are just now returning \nafter fleeing their homes. Describing his work with town residents, \nElliston said, ``I try to put a smile on their faces and give them hope \nthat we will protect them.''\n  This protection has taken many forms. One Vrbovac resident told Stars \nand Stripes, ``Before Elliston came here, we locked all the doors. Now \nthat [Elliston] is here we leave the doors open every night because we \nfeel much more safe with him here.'' Elliston and the men and women \nserving with him have also been able to put an end to many killings, \nhijackings and kidnapings.\n  Elliston has also spearheaded measures to improve the quality of life \nin Kosovo. He has taken steps to facilitate the spread of news from the \noutside world to local residents and has even installed speed bumps to \nsolve the problem of speeding vehicles.\n  These are but a few examples illustrating the dedication and \ninnovation of Elliston and those serving with him. It is these \nqualities upon which our nation depends.\n  The same Vrbovac resident said of Elliston, ``The people in Montana \nmust be proud because he is a great man.'' I am here today to say that \nthe people of Montana are proud. We are proud of Elliston, and we are \nalso proud of all the other men and women who serve overseas. These \nsacrifice and dedication of these individuals must be recognized and I \ncall on my colleagues in the Senate to do so.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4010-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BOY SCOUT EAGLE SCOUT AND GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to give praise and \nrecognition to one of my fellow New Yorkers who has devoted his life to \nhelping heal the wounds of crime. Thomas Alessandro recently received \nthe Crime Victim Service Award from Attorney General Janet Reno. I rise \ntoday to echo that recognition and to briefly describe Mr. Alessandro's \ninnovation and tireless work in this field.\n  The Crime Victim Service Award was given to Mr. Alessandro as part of \nthe Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime's 20th annual \nobservance of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, held this year from \nApril 9 to April 15. This week of observance enables communities across \nthe country to recognize the millions of Americans who have felt the \nburdens of crime and those who have enabled them to navigate the \ndifficult and often complex path to justice. This highlights the \nefforts of Mr. Alessandro and other outstanding individuals by drawing \nattention to their cause, and praising all citizens of the Nation who \nwork toward this laudable ideal. As part of this week of recognition \nthe Attorney General awarded the Crime Victim Service award to Mr. \nAlessandro, four other individuals, four organizations and two \nfamilies. Mr. Alessandro was selected from 110 nominees for the award \nbecause of his outstanding progress and innovation in the field of \ncrime victim service, the highest federal award for service to victims \nof crime. Mr. Alessandro is a shining example of how our law \nenforcement officials should protect justice and help victims of \ninjustice seek healing.\n  Mr. Alessandro has dedicated the last 22 years of his life to the \nservice of crime victims. One of his most astounding innovations was \nthe development of the Victims Aid Services into a comprehensive \nprogram addressing the needs of all crime victims who come to the New \nYork County District Attorney's Office. Additionally, Mr. Alessandro \nforged many public and private sector partnerships to strive toward the \ngoal of justice. Among these partnerships and organizational \nenhancements, he established a counseling department and created a \nchild victim specialist division. These additional tools allow the New \nYork District Attorney's Office to protect the rights of victims not \nonly in the form of conviction of criminals, but also in the form of \nhealing the emotional scars of the victim especially the young victim. \nThis second step is essential to making this society healthier and \nsafer. The counseling staff is now made up of certified clinical social \nworkers who provide individual and group therapy for victims. It is my \nhonor to rise in recognition of this great man who actualizes this \nideal.\n  In addition to counseling services, Mr. Alessandro has directed the \ndevelopment of new technology to increase the efficiency and \navailability of victim services, including protection order tracing and \nvictim notification systems. He has forged partnerships with private \nsector organizations, including the AT Cell Phone Project, which, \nalong with additional services, provides crime victims with 911 \nprogrammed cell phones for use in emergencies.\n  Mr. Alessandro's commitment to the needs of crime victims does not \nstop when he leaves the office.

Mr. President, I take the floor today to honor one \nof the oldest and top community colleges in the great state of \nWashington. In honor, of their 75th Anniversary, I would like to say a \nfew words about this fine academic institution.\n  Centralia College serves the citizens of Southcentral Washington, \noffering outstanding community service programs and a high quality of \nstudent life. Centralia College, however, extends beyond traditional \ninstruction of its students and participates in the greater-Centralia \ncommunity, providing residents with informative and interesting public \nlectures, art shows and cultural events. Clearly, Centralia College is \nan integral part of the surrounding community.\n  Students at Centralia College study a variety of disciplines from \naccounting and nursing to computer and forestry technology, receiving a \nwell-rounded education that will prepare them for a bright and \nchallenging future.\n  Furthermore, Centralia College offers students an international \nexperience. Students have the opportunity to study in a number of \nforeign countries or learn from the many international students that \nattend Centralia College. I applaud Centralia College for its \ncommitment to expanding its students' horizons and exposing them to new \nideas and different ways of life.\n  The faculty at Centralia College are extremely dedicated to giving \ntheir students a balanced education and emphasize the importance of \ncritical thinking skills, writing, oral and visual communication as \nwell as fostering in their students a sense of resourcefulness and \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\n  I believe that the faculty's continuous hard work and dedication to \nthese goals has made their students successful and contributing \ncitizens of Washington state. Education is more than merely memorizing \nfacts and Centralia College teaches its students vital problem solving \nand communication skills that will lead our country in the new \nmillennium and give them a solid foundation to help Washington state \ncontinue in its prosperity.\n  I wish Centralia College another successful 75 years. It is \ninstitutions like Centralia College that make Washington state one of \nthe best places to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4011-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nA DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED THE ``CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY \n   COMMISSION ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2000''--A MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 104\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit today for immediate consideration and prompt \nenactment the ``Consumer Product Safety Commission Enhanced Enforcement \nAct of 2000.'' This legislative proposal would increase the penalties \nthat the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) could impose upon \nmanufacturers, distributors, and retailers of consumer products who do \nnot inform the CPSC when the company has reason to believe it has sold \na product that does not meet Federal safety standards or could \notherwise create a substantial product hazard. The proposal would also \nimprove product recalls by enabling the CPSC to choose an alternative \nremedy in a recall if the CPSC finds that the remedy selected by the \nmanufacturer is not in the public interest.\n  Under current consumer product safety laws, manufacturers, \ndistributors, and retailers of consumer products are required to inform \nthe CPSC whenever they have information that one of their products: (1) \nfails to comply with a CPSC product safety standard; (2) contains a \ndefect that could create a substantial product hazard; or (3) creates \nan unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. After a company \nreports this information to the CPSC, the CPSC staff initiates an \ninvestigation in cooperation with the company. If the CPSC concludes \nthat the product presents a substantial product hazard and that a \nrecall is in the public interest, the CPSC staff will work with the \ncompany to conduct a product safety recall. The sooner the CPSC hears \nabout a dangerous product, the sooner the CPSC can act to remove the \nproduct from store shelves and inform consumers about how to eliminate \nthe hazard. That is why it is critical that companies inform the CPSC \nas soon as they are aware that one of their products may present a \nserious hazard to the public.\n  Unfortunately, in about half the cases involving the most significant \nhazards--where the product can cause death or serious injury--companies \ndo not report to the CPSC. In those cases, the CPSC must get safety \ninformation from other sources, including its own investigators, \nconsumers, or tragically, from hospital emergency room reports or death \ncertificates. Sometimes years can pass before the CPSC learns of the \nproduct hazard, although the company may have been aware of it all \nalong. During that time, deaths and injuries continue. Once the CPSC \nbecomes aware of the hazard, many companies continue to be \nrecalcitrant, and the CPSC staff must conduct its own independent \ninvestigation. This often includes finding and investigating product \nincidents and conducting extensive laboratory testing. This process can \ntake a long time, which means that the most dangerous products remain \non store shelves and in consumers' homes longer, placing children and \nfamilies at continuing risk.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission can currently assess civil \npenalties against companies who fail to report a dangerous product. \nCriminal penalties are also available in particularly serious cases. In \nfact, in 1999, the CPSC assessed 10 times the amount of civil penalties \nassessed 10 years ago. But, even with this more vigorous enforcement, \ntoo many companies still do not report, especially in cases involving \nserious harm.\n  This legislative proposal would enhance the CPSC's civil and criminal \nenforcement authority. It would provide an added incentive for \ncompanies to comply with the law so that we can get dangerous products \nout of stores and consumers' homes more quickly.\n  My legislative proposal would also help to make some product recalls \nmore effective by allowing the CPSC to choose an alternative remedy if \nthe CPSC finds that the manufacturer's chosen remedy is not in the \npublic interest. Under current law, a company with a defective product \nthat is being recalled has the right to select the remedy to be offered \nto the public. My proposal would continue to permit the company to \nselect the remedy in a product recall. My proposal would also, however, \nallow the CPSC to determine--after an opportunity for a hearing--that \nthe remedy selected by the company is not in the public interest. The \nCPSC may then order the company to carry out an alternative program \nthat is in the public interest.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission helps to keep America's \nchildren and families safe. This legislative proposal would help the \nCPSC be even more effective in protecting the public from dangerous \nproducts. I urge the Congress to give this legislation prompt and \nfavorable consideration.\n                                                  William J.

A bill for the relief of Vijai Rajan; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\nPRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION GRANTING UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO VIJAI \n                                 RAJAN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to grant United States citizenship to Vijai Rajan. Ms. Rajan is a \ntwenty-four year old permanent resident from India whose naturalization \napplication was denied because of physical disabilities that make it \nimpossible for her to take the oath of allegiance.\n  Ms. Rajan has lived in the United States since she was four months \nold. Her sister, Inbhu, was born in Cincinnati and is an American \ncitizen by right of her birth in the United States. Her father Sunder \nRajan became a naturalized citizen in 1980. But Ms. Rajan's mother \nShakunthala, was not naturalized until 1994, just after Vijai's 18th \nbirthday. If both parents had become citizens before Rajan turned 18, \nshe would have automatically qualified for citizenship.\n  Unfortunately, due to this peculiar circumstance, the law now \nrequires that Ms. Rajan undergo the rigors of the regular \nnaturalization process, including taking the oath of allegiance, before \nshe can become a United States citizen.\n  An anomaly in the law has resulted in Ms. Rajan being left out of her \nfamily's American dream, for no other reason than because her physical \ndisabilities prevent her from taking the oath of allegiance. Ms. Rajan \nsuffers from cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, seizures, and Crohn's \ndisease.\n  American citizenship is the most visible sign of one's attachment to \nthe United States. The naturalization process, including the oath of \nallegiance, should be credible, and it must be accorded the formality \nand ceremony appropriate to its importance. I would not support any \nsteps that would detract from the meaningfulness, solemnity, and \ndignity of this time-honored tradition.\n  In 1952, when Congress codified the requirements for becoming an \nAmerican citizen, it required that the oath contain five elements: (1) \nsupport for the Constitution; (2) renunciation of prior allegiance; (3) \ndefense of the Constitution against all enemies; (4) true faith and \nallegiance; and (5) a commitment to bear arms or perform noncombatant \nservice when required.\n  I believe these principles should remain intact. But I also believe \nthat we should carry out these ideals with compassion and sufficient \nflexibility that persons who are so severely disabled, like Ms. Rajan, \nare not automatically disqualified from becoming U.S. citizens.\n  I believe the case of Vijai Rajan is compelling and warrants \nCongress' immediate consideration. Moreover, I am aware that there are \nother cases in which a physical disability has prevented an otherwise \nqualified person from becoming an American citizen. I intend to work to \nenact legislation that will give the Attorney General the discretion to \nact on such compelling cases without having to resort to a private act \nof Congress.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this private \nlegislation on behalf of Vijai Rajan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2560.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce four bills \nwhich will suspend the duties imposed on certain chemicals that are \nimportant components in a wide array of\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\napplications. Currently, these chemicals are imported for use in the \nUnited States because there are no known American producers or readily \navailable substitutes. Therefore, suspending the duties on these \nchemicals would not adversely affect domestic industries.\n  These bills would temporarily suspend the duty on the following:\n  Mesamoll (alkyl sulfonic acid ester of phenol);\n  Vulkalent E/C (N-phenyl-N-((trichloromethyl)thio)-benzenesulfonamide\n  with calcium carbonate and mineral oil);\n  Baytron M (3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene); and\n  Baytron C-R (iron(III) toluenesulfonate).\n  These chemicals are used in the manufacturing of a number of products \nincluding, but not limited to, solvents, PVC coated fabric, medical \napparatus, rubber products for automobile hoses, circuit boards, and \nother electronic goods.\n  Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit \nthe consumer by stabilizing the costs of manufacturing the end-use \nproducts. Further, these duty suspensions will allow U.S. manufacturers \nto maintain or improve their ability to compete internationally. I hope \nthe Senate will consider these measures expeditiously.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide tax incentives for the construction of \nseagoing cruise ships in United States shipyards, and to facilitate the \ndevelopment of a United States-flag, United States-built cruise \nindustry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    all american cruise act of 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed to \npromote growth in the domestic cruise ship industry and at the same \ntime enable U.S. shipyards to compete for cruise ship orders. The \nlegislation would require that at least two U.S.-built ships be ordered \nfor each foreign-built ship permitted to operate in the U.S. market, \nand provide tax incentives for U.S. cruise ship construction and \noperation.\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n  Current law prohibits non-U.S. vessels from carrying passengers \nbetween U.S. ports. As such, today's domestic cruise market is very \nlimited. The cruise industry consists predominantly of foreign vessels \nwhich must sail to and from foreign ports. The vast majority of cruise \npassengers are Americans, but most of the revenues now go to foreign \ndestinations. That is because the high cost of building and operating \nU.S.-flag cruise ships and competition from modern, foreign-flag cruise \nships have deterred growth in the domestic cruise ship trade.\n  By some estimates, a single port call by a cruise vessel generates \nbetween $300,000 and $500,000 in economic benefits. This is a very \nlucrative market, and I would like to see U.S. companies and American \nworkers benefit from this untapped potential. However, domestic ship \nbuilders and cruise operations face a very difficult, up-hill battle \nagainst unfair competition from foreign cruise lines and foreign \nshipyards. Foreign cruise lines, for example, pay no corporate income \ntax. Nor are they held to the same demanding ship construction and \noperating standards imposed on U.S.-flag vessel operators. Foreign \ncruise lines are also free from the need to comply with many U.S. labor \nand environmental protection laws, and U.S. health, safety, and \nsanitation laws do not apply to the foreign ships.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to level the \nplaying field between the U.S. cruise industry and the international \ncruise industry. It requires that at least two U.S.-built ships be \nordered for each foreign-built ship permitted to operate on a temporary \nbasis in the U.S. market, and provide tax incentive for U.S. cruise \nship construction and operation. For example, it provides that a \nshipyard will pay taxes on the construction or overhaul of a cruise \nship of 20,000 gross tons or greater only after the delivery of the \nship.\n  Under my bill, a U.S. company operating a cruise ship of 20,000 grt \nand greater may depreciate that vessel over a five-year period rather \nthan the current 10-year depreciation period. The bill would also \nrepeal the $2,500 business tax deduction limit for a convention on a \ncruise ship to provide a tax deduction limit equal to that provided to \nconventions held at shore-side hotels. The measure would authorize a \n20-percent tax credit for fuel operating costs associated with \nenvironmentally clean gas turbine engines manufactured in the U.S., and \nalso allows use of investment of Capital Construction Funds to include \nnot only the non-contiguous trades, but also the domestic point-to-\npoint trades and ``cruise to nowhere.''\n  Finally, the bill provides that a foreign-built ship may be brought \ninto the U.S. trades only after the owner or buyer of such vessel has \nentered into a binding contract for the construction of at least two \ncruise ships of equal or greater size in the U.S. The interim foreign-\nbuilt ship must be documented in the U.S. The contract must require \nthat the first ship constructed in the U.S. be delivered no later than \nfour years from the date of entering the binding contract with the \ndelivery of a second ship within five years, and that the foreign-built \nship must exit the U.S. trade within 12 months of the delivery of the \nlast ship, provided there is no longer than a 24-month elapse between \ndelivery of second and subsequent ships, should the contract provide \nfor construction of more than two ships.\n  Mr. President. I truly believe that this legislation would jumpstart \nthe domestic cruise trade, benefit U.S. workers and companies, and \npromote economic growth in our ports. I strongly urge my colleagues to \njoin me in a strong show of support for this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2566. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \ngrant the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \nregulate tobacco products, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  national youth smoking reduction act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nYouth Smoking Reduction Act, along with my colleague, Senator McCain. \nThe purpose of this bill is to diminish the number of children who \nstart to smoke or use other tobacco products, while at the same time \ntrying to reduce the risk such products pose to adults who make the \nill-advised--but legal--choice to use these products.\n  Mr. President, each day, more than 3,000 kids become regular smokers. \nThat's about one million per year. Currently more than 4 million \nchildren 12 to 17 years old smoke. Sadly, more than 5 million children \nalive today will die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses, unless \ncurrent trends are reversed.\n  Adults almost always start smoking as children. According to a 1994 \nSurgeon General report, nearly 90 percent of adults who smoke took his \nor her first puff at or before the age of 18. Moreover, youth smoking \nis on the rise! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \ndetermined that smoking rates for students in grades 9 through 12 \nincreased from 27.5 percent in 1991 to 36.4 percent in 1997. In my own \nstate of Tennessee, 38 percent of all high school students smoke \ncompared to just 26 percent of Tennessee adults.\n  Mr. President, we should all be alarmed by these statistics. Before \nmy election to the United States Senate, I was a heart and lung \ntransplant surgeon. I have held hundreds and hundreds of lungs in my \nhands that were ravaged by years of smoking. I've performed hundreds of \ncoronary artery bypass heart operations to repair damage accelerated by \nsmoking. When you've seen the damage that cigarettes can cause to the \nhuman body, it is a powerful motive to find a way to try to prevent \nchildren from ever starting the habit. After all, as the statistics \nsuggest, if you keep a child from smoking, he'll probably never start \nas an adult.\n  Many factors account for a child's decision to smoke. One concerns \nthe easy access of tobacco products to our nation's youth. For too \nlong, cigarettes have been readily available to those who are too young \nto purchase them legally, whether through vending machines or by \npilfering them from self-service displays.\n  Another heavily-researched factor is the role that advertising has in \nstimulating children to smoke. According to a 1995 study published in \nthe Journal of the National Cancer Institute, teens are more likely to \nbe influenced to smoke by cigarette advertising than they are by peer \npressure. In 1994 the CDC determined that 86 percent of children who \nsmoke prefer Marlboro, Camel and Newport--the three most heavily \nadvertised brands--compared to only about one-third of adult smokers. \nWhen advertising for the ``Joe Camel'' campaign jumped from $27 million \nto $43 million, between 1989 and 1993, Camel's share among youth \nincreased by more than 50 percent, while its adult market share did not \nchange at all.\n  There have been efforts made during the last decade to curb and \neliminate children smoking. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration \npromulgated a rule which would have reduced youth access to tobacco by \nbanning most cigarette vending machines and requiring that retailers \nverify the age of all over the counter sales. The rule would also \naddress advertising to children by restricting advertising within 1,000 \nfeet of schools and playgrounds, restricting outdoor ads and ads in \npublication with a significant teen readership to black and white text \nonly.\n\n  The rule was controversial, particularly some of the advertising \nrestrictions. It was made even more controversial by the fact that many \nin Congress did not believe that FDA had ever been given the authority \nto regulate tobacco.\n  During the 105th Congress, Senator McCain introduced S. 1415, the \ntobacco settlement bill, which was a comprehensive response to the \nlandmark tobacco settlement of 1997. As part of that bill, I drafted \nprovisions which set up a framework for the FDA to regulate tobacco. \nThe tobacco settlement bill did not pass the Senate, which killed my \neffort during the 105th Congress to have FDA regulate tobacco in an \nattempt to keep the product away from children.\n  Thus, Congress has never delegated to the FDA the authority to \nregulate tobacco. On March 21, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \nFDA lacked any authority to regulate tobacco\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nproducts. It was obvious to the Court that Congress never intended for \nthe FDA to treat tobacco products as drugs subject to regulation under \nthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n  The National Youth Smoking Reduction Act, which we introduce today, \nwould for the first time give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco.\n  This authority would not flow from treating nicotine as a drug and \ntobacco products as drug delivery devices. That's what the FDA has \nalready tried to do, by trying to force tobacco products under Chapter \n5 of the existing Act. To me, this is like taking a square peg and \ntrying to put it in a round hole; it just doesn't fit. Chapter 5 calls \non the Secretary to determine whether the regulatory actions taken will \nprovide reasonable assurance of the ``safety and effectiveness'' of the \ndrug or the device. Well, clearly, tobacco is neither safe nor \neffective, as those terms are understood in the Act. We know that \ntobacco kills. That has clearly been demonstrated over the last 35 \nyears. You can talk about the effectiveness of a pacemaker or a heart \nvalve or an artificial heart; you can talk about those devices as being \nsafe and effective. You really cannot apply that standard to tobacco. \nTherefore, instead of taking tobacco and ramming it through the drug \nand device provisions, I felt it was important to look at the unique \nnature of tobacco, and regulate it under a new chapter, which we \ndesignate as Chapter 9. This gives FDA the flexibility to create a new \nstandard that was appropriate for tobacco products.\n  Chapter 9 requires manufacturers to submit to the FDA information \nabout the ingredients, components and substances in their products. It \nempowers the FDA to set performance standards for tobacco products, by \nwhich FDA can try to reduce the risk posed by these products. It gives \nFDA the power to regulate the sale, distribution, access to, and \nadvertising of tobacco products to try to prevent children from \nsmoking. It also gives the FDA the power to revise and improve the \nwarning labels contained on tobacco product packages and advertising. \nLast, it gives FDA the power to encourage tobacco manufacturers--who \nprobably know more about the products than even FDA's scientists--to \ndevelop and market ``reduced risk'' products for adults who are regular \nusers of tobacco.\n  In short, our bill represents a powerful, initial grant of authority \nto the FDA to regulate tobacco.\n  We think the bill, as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the \nneed to promote the public health and the recognition that adults may \nlegally choose to smoke. I very strongly believe that, should Congress \nact to give FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, this \nlegislation will be the template.\n  Six years ago, I was saving lives as a heart and lung surgeon. I saw \nthe ravages of tobacco in the operating room. The people of Tennessee \nelected me to use common sense to advance the public good. I submit \nthat crafting a comprehensive approach to keep children from smoking is \na chance for the Senate to save lives through the exercise of common \nsense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this important \nlegislation aimed at reducing youth smoking. This legislation addresses \nthe void in federal regulatory authority over tobacco left by the \nrecent Supreme Court ruling that FDA has no current power to regulate \ntobacco products.\n  Dr. Frist provided excellent guidance and leadership on FDA authority \nin 1998. In this legislation he is continuing that role by proposing \nlegislation which I believe can gain support of enough of our \ncolleagues to actually make this the law. Right now FDA has no \nauthority whatsoever. While I supported the even more stringent \nmeasures proposed in 1998, I concur with Senator Frist that our chief \nresponsibility this year is to pass legislation which will actually \nresult in reductions in the number of kids smoking. We should pass this \nlegislation and see results, not simply talk for several more years \nabout how much more we would like to do.\n  The statistics on youth smoking are clear and alarming: 3000 kids \nstart smoking every day; 1000 of them will die early from smoking \nrelated disease; and one of three adolescents is using tobacco by age \n18.\n  We're not talking about kids who sneak a cigarette out of their \nmother's purse. According to a Surgeon General's report 71 percent of \nyouth smokers use tobacco daily, but 90 percent of lifetime smokers \ntake up the habit before the age of 18--the legal age to buy tobacco \nproducts in every state in the union--so if we can limit the number of \nkids smoking, we will eventually decrease the number of adults smoking.\n  Specifically, what the legislation will do is:\n  1. FDA will oversee ingredients in tobacco products to ensure that \nthey are adulterated with ``putrid'' or ``poisonous substances,'' and \nmay regulate the manufacturing process to require the sanitary \nconditions one would normally expect in dealing with agricultural \nproducts.\n  2. It includes the very stringent and specific warning labeling \nrequirements from the 1998 legislation. FDA will have the authority to \nrevise and enforce labeling requirements, and to ensure that tobacco \nproducts are not misbranded or misrepresented to the public.\n  3. FDA will serve as the clearinghouse for information about tobacco \nproducts, the ingredients used by manufacturers, and will approve new \nproducts and formulas to ensure that they protect public health.\n  4. FDA will have the authority to establish advertising and access \nlimitations designed to ensure that kids are not the target of \nmarketing by tobacco companies, and to prevent kids from easily \nshoplifting or buying cigarettes.\n  5. It provides a mechanism for lower risk tobacco products to be \ntested, reviewed and approved.\n  6. It allows FDA to regulate tobacco products and nicotine to \ndecrease the harm caused by them as much as feasible.\n  What the legislation does not do is permit FDA to ban tobacco \nproducts directly, or indirectly. That authority remains with Congress. \nThere are an estimated 40-50 million smokers in this country, and it is \nneither practical nor in the public interest to vest that authority \nwith a federal agency which is unaccountable to the public at large. We \ndo not gain by driving current smokers to black markets. It is better \nto regulate tobacco products to prevent them from becoming worse and to \nfocus on decreasing the number of kids who take up smoking or using \nchewing tobacco.\n  The legislation also does not raise prices--it does not raise taxes. \nNo new government programs or agencies are created. No liability issues \nare addressed. This is simple and straightforward legislation to give \nthe FDA authority to regulate tobacco products and to promulgate \nregulations to prevent advertising, marketing and access for kids.\n  The legislation does not permit a broad ban or control over \nadvertising. Instead, it vests authority with FDA to regulate \nadvertising aimed at kids. This limitation allows FDA sufficient \nauthority to address Joe Camel type advertising, while providing the \nbest opportunity for success against constitutional challenges.\n  While I strongly advocate against kids smoking, I recognize that it \nis the right of an adult to make a stupid choice--to smoke--knowing of \nthe consequences. This legislation protects that right. It provides a \ndelicate balance between protecting a person from himself, and letting \neach individual make individual choices, and suffer the consequences of \nthose choices.\n  This legislation will draw attacks from both sides--from those who \nthink the bill is too stringent, and from those who think the \nlegislation does not go far enough. I say to my friends on both sides, \nthis is a reasonable and practical solution to a serious problem. I \nurge an end to the posturing and a dedication to making sure that we do \nnot leave this session without providing FDA with some authority over \ntobacco products. I pledge to both sides that I will work with them to \nrefine the language, to address their legitimate concerns. But, we will \nhave gained nothing if we allow this to become the political football \nthat it became two years ago.\n  Make no mistake, this is not perfect legislation. I would like to do \nmore. But I think it is more important to move forward with this very \ngood proposal than to wait for some distant time, if ever, when we can \npass a perfect bill.\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\n  This legislation is a major step in the right direction. I think we \ncan get enough support to pass it. I support its early consideration \nand action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER.\n  S. 2567. A bill to provide Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance \nto State and local governments, to amend the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965, the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \nAct of 1978, and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly \nreferred to as the Pittman-Robertson Act) to establish a fund to meet \nthe outdoor conservation and recreation needs of the American people, \nand for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n                   conservation and reinvestment act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier today, I introduced in the Senate \na bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday, May 11--\nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000. I introduced the bill \nand asked that it be put on the Senate calendar for one simple reason. \nI believe that the fastest way to pass legislation to protect our \nnational lands legacy is to take up where the House left off last week.\n  I know that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been \ntrying for many months to get a lands legacy bill, and I commend the \nefforts of Senator Bingaman, Senator Landrieu and others. But I am also \naware of the great differences of opinion on the Committee. I \npersonally support the Bingaman bill, which is similar to legislation I \nintroduced last year, the Resources 2000 Act. Some Senators support the \nLandrieu bill. Others oppose both approaches.\n  Thus, it may not be possible to get a strong bill out of the Energy \nCommittee this year. And, Mr. President, we are running out of time. \nThere are probable fewer than 60 working days left in the 106th \nCongress. So that is why I have asked that the House bill be placed on \nthe Senate calendar, so that at any time the Majority Leader can take \nit up and place it before the Senate.\n  The House bill isn't perfect. I would like to see further changes. \nBut it would be a good start for the Senate. We must not let this \nsession of Congress end without passing this critical legislation to \nprotect our natural heritage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Kerry, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2568. A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food \nand Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       youth smoking prevention and public health protection act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \ngive the Food and Drug Administration board authority to regulate \ntobacco products for protection of the public health. With the recent 5 \nto 4 decision by the Supreme Court rejecting FDA's claim that it had \nauthority to regulate tobacco products under current law, it is now \nessential for Congress to act. We cannot in good conscience allow the \nfederal agency most responsible for protecting the public health to \nremain powerless to deal with the enormous risk of tobacco, the most \ndeadly of all consumer products.\n  The provisions in this bill are identical to those in the bipartisan \ncompromise reached during Senate consideration of comprehensive tobacco \ncontrol legislation in 1998. Fifty eight Senators supported it at that \ntime. That legislation was never enacted because of disputes over \ntobacco taxation and litigation, not over FDA authority.\n  This FDA provision is a fair and balanced approach to FDA regulation. \nIt creates a new section in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of \ntobacco products, with standards that allow for consideration of the \nunique issues raised by tobacco use. It is sensitive to the concerns of \ntobacco farmers, small businesses, and nicotine-dependent smokers. But, \nit clearly gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth \nsmoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product.\n  I had hoped to be introducing this bill with the same bipartisan \nsupport we had for this FDA provision in 1998. Unfortunately, we have \nnot been able to reach agreement. I believe the changes in the 1998 \nlanguage now being proposed by Republicans will undermine the FDA's \nability to deal effectively with the enormous health risks posed by \nsmoking. This concern is shared by a number of independent public \nhealth experts who have reviewed the proposed Republican changes and by \nthe FDA officials who would be responsible for administering the law. \nThe bipartisan compromise agreed to in 1998 is still the best \nopportunity for Senators to come together and grant FDA the regulatory \nauthority it needs to substantially reduce the number of children who \nstart smoking and to help addicted smokers quit. Nothing less will do \nthe job.\n  The stakes are vast. Three thousand children begin smiling every day. \nA thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced diseases. \nSmoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the nation \ntoday. Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans each \nyear. That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents, alcohol \nabuse, illegal drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, and fires combined. Our \nresponse to a public health problem of this magnitude must consist of \nmore than half-way measures.\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends five billion dollars a year to \npromote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways designed to \ntempt children to start smoking, before they are mature enough to \nappreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry knows that \nmore than 90% of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time \nthey reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the \nInstitute of medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the \nsubstantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people \nto use tobacco products. If we are serious about reducing youth \nsmoking, FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising \ndesigned to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children. \nThis legislation will give FDA the ability to stop tobacco advertising \nwhich glamorizes smoking from appearing in publications likely to be \nread by significant numbers of children.\n\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give \nthe youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA \nthe immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new \nstatute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nwill be more explicit in their description of the medical problems \nwhich can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the authority to \nchange the text of these warning labels periodically, to keep their \nimpact strong.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. \nNo one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under \noath before Congress as recently as 1994 that smoking cigarettes is not \naddictive. Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through \nthe discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public health. Over forty \nmillion Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible \npublic health official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban \nwould leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug \ndependency. FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help \naddicted smokers overcome their addiction, and to make the product less \ntoxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA \nmust have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from \ncigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nThis legislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced \nrisk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nCongress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating \ntobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs to \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren--to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors--to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction--to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them--and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  The 1998 compromise we reached in the Senate is still the right \nanswer. We cannot allow the tobacco industry to stop us from doing what \nwe know is right for America's children. I intend to do all I can to \nsee that Congress enacts this legislation this year. The public health \ndemands it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2569. A bill to ensure and enhance participation in the HUBZone \nprogram by small business concerns in Native America, to expand \neligibility for certain small businesses on a trial basis, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                 hubzones in native america act of 2000\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today with \nSenators Kerry, Campbell, Murkowski, Stevens, Daschle, and Baucus will \nexpand economic opportunity in some of the most stubborn areas of \npoverty and unemployment in the entire country. It will do so by \nexpanding the HUBZone program to ensure that Indian Tribal enterprises \nand Alaska Native Corporations are eligible to participate.\n  The HUBZone program, enacted in 1997, directs a portion of Federal \ncontracting dollars into areas of the country that have been out of the \neconomic mainstream for far too long. HUBZone areas, which include, \nqualified census tracts, poor rural counties, and Indian reservations, \noften are relatively out-of-the-way places that the stream of commerce \npasses by. They tend to be low-traffic areas that do not have a \nreliable customer base to support business development. As a result, \nbusiness has been reluctant to move into these areas. It simply has not \nbeen profitable, without a customer base to keep them operating.\n  The HUBZone Act seeks to overcome this problem by making it possible \nfor the Federal government to become a customer for small businesses \nthat locate in HUBZones. While a small business works to establish its \nregular customer base, a Federal contract can help it stabilize its \nrevenues and remain profitable. This gives small business a chance to \nget a foothold, and provides jobs to these areas. New business and new \njobs mean new life and new hope for these communities.\n  The HUBZone Act seeks to restart the economic engine in these \ncommunities and keep it running. Small business is the carburetor that \nmakes that engine run smoothly. If a community seeks to attract a large \nbusiness, often with expensive tax concessions and promises of public \nworks, that community can find itself back where it started if that \nlarge business becomes unprofitable and closes its plant. However, if a \ncommunity attracts a diversified base of small businesses its overall \neconomic development does not stop just because one or two of those \nbusinesses close. That is why small business must be a central part of \nany economic development strategy.\n  Unfortunately, when we wrote the HUBZone Act three years ago, we \naccidentally created a technical glitch that excludes Indian Tribal \nenterprises and Alaska Native Corporations. These businesses must play \na central role in improving life in rural Alaska and on Indian \nreservations. That is why we are here to propose a solution to this \nproblem.\n  In the HUBZone Act, we specified that participating small businesses \nmust be 100 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. However, \nsince citizens are ``born or naturalized'' under the Fourteenth \nAmendment, ownership by citizens implies ownership by individual flesh-\nand-blood human beings. Corporate owners and Tribal government owners \nare not ``born or naturalized'' in the usual meanings of those terms. \nThus, the Small Business Administration found that it had no authority \nto certify small businesses owned wholly or partly by Alaska Native \nCorporations and Tribal governments.\n  Although the legal logic of that view seems sound, the outcome is \nnot. It certainly is not what we intended. On many reservations, \nparticularly the desolate, isolated ones in western State, the only \ninvestment resources available are the Tribal governments. Excluding \nthose governments from investing in their own reservations means, in \npractical terms, excluding those reservations from the HUBZone program \nentirely. Similarly, Alaska Native Corporations have the corporate \nresources that are necessary to make real investments in rural Alaska, \nto provide jobs to Alaska Natives who currently have no hope of getting \nthem.\n\n  That is why we are here to propose a legislative fix. In putting \ntogether this bill, we have sought to follow three broad principles.\n  First, no firm should be made eligible solely by virtue of who they \nare. We should not, for example, make all Alaska Native Corporations \neligible solely because they are Alaska Native Corporations. Instead, \nAlaska Native Corporations and Indian Tribal enterprises should be \neligible only if they agree to advance the goals of the HUBZone \nprogram: job creation and economic development in the areas that need \nit most.\n  Second, our legislation should seek to conform to existing Native \nAmerican policy and not allow the HUBZone\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nprogram to be used as a back door to change that policy. Some folks \nwould like to change Alaska Native policy so that Alaska Natives \nexercise governmental jurisdiction over their lands, just like Tribes \nin the Lower 48 do on their reservations and trust lands. However, the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 deliberately \navoided that approach, and our legislation here simply recognizes \nexisting practice in ANCSA.\n  The third principle underlying this bill is that Alaska Natives and \nIndian Tribes should participate on more-or-less equal grounds. It is \nimpossible to have exact equivalence because the Federal relationship \nwith Alaska Natives is not equal to the relationship with Indian \nTribes, and also because Alaska is a very different State from the \nLower 48. However, ANCSA provided that Alaska Natives should be \neligible to participate in Federal Indian programs ``on the same basis \nas other Native Americans.''\n  Mr. President, with these principles in mind, we have finally come to \nthe end of a long negotiation on these issues. This bill represents the \noutcome of that discussion, and it is a long step forward. I have a \nsection-by-section discussion of the bill, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. The bill amends the definition of ``HUBZone \n     small business concern'' to include small businesses owned by \n     one or more U.S. citizens (current law), Alaska Native \n     Corporations and their subsidiaries, joint ventures, and \n     partnerships as defined under ANCSA, and Tribal enterprises. \n     Tribal enterprises refers to those wholly owned by one or \n     more Tribal governments, and to those partly owned by Tribal \n     governments if all other owners are small businesses or U.S. \n     citizens. Some Tribal governments have also created holding \n     companies to do their business for them, so they can waive \n     sovereign immunity against those companies without waiving it \n     against the Tribe itself. Small businesses owned by these \n     holding companies would also be eligible.\n       Section 2. This amends the definition of ``qualified \n     HUBZone small business concern'' to indicate what each of the \n     ``HUBZone small business concerns'' must do in order to \n     advance the goals of the program and be qualified. Small \n     businesses in general must have a principal office in a \n     HUBZone, and 35% of their employees must reside in a HUBZone \n     (current law). This is also the underlying policy that would \n     apply to Alaska Native Corporations if the pilot program \n     described below were to become inactive; however, it is not \n     likely that Alaska Native Corporations would be able to \n     participate in the HUBZone program on this basis, for the \n     reasons in the discussion of the pilot program, below. Having \n     this as the fallback position in case the pilot program is \n     suspended, however, keeps Alaska Native Corporations and \n     small businesses in Alaska on the same footing. In this way, \n     a uniform standard will be in force in Alaska for all program \n     participants, either under the pilot program or under this \n     section. This prevents unnecessary confusion and complexity.\n       Tribal enterprises would be required to have 35% of their \n     employees performing a HUBZone contract either reside on an \n     Indian reservation or on any HUBZone adjoining a reservation. \n     This allows Tribal enterprises to use a place-of-performance \n     standard similar to Alaska Native Corporations in the pilot \n     program, below. However, it is slightly more restrictive than \n     the rule that applies to small businesses in general, whose \n     employees may come from any HUBZone to meet the 35% \n     threshold. Since Tribal enterprises are government-owned \n     entities (owned wholly or partly by Tribal governments), this \n     provision limits their scope to the reservations governed by \n     their respective owners.\n       The language about HUBZones ``adjoining'' a reservation is \n     also comparable to existing language in the Indian Education \n     Act that refers to activities ``on or near'' a reservation, \n     so the idea has a precedent in other Indian policy areas.\n       In each of these cases, a firm added to the definition of \n     ``HUBZone small business concerns'' has a corresponding \n     obligation imposed on it to be ``qualified.'' They have to do \n     something in a HUBZone to participate.\n       The final component of this section is the ``HUBZone Pilot \n     Program for Sparsely Populated Areas.'' This attempts to \n     address concerns that small businesses in Alaska, as well as \n     Alaska Native Corporations, are likely to face insurmountable \n     practical problems that prevent their participation in the \n     HUBZone program even if they are eligible on paper. Most of \n     the useful HUBZones are in rural areas (Anchorage has just a \n     handful of qualified census tracts, and two of those tracts \n     are military installations), but rural areas tend not to have \n     large residential populations and have little infrastructure \n     to support contract performance. Thus, Alaska Native \n     Corporations tend to be headquartered in Anchorage, and 50% \n     of the Native population lives in Anchorage, where HUBZones \n     are few. This makes it unlikely that an Alaska Native \n     Corporation would be able to meet the general HUBZone \n     program's criteria of having a principal office plus 35% of \n     their employees in a HUBZone.\n       Other small businesses in Alaska are likely to confront \n     these same problems of population patterns and lack of \n     infrastructure that affect the Alaska Natives--and unlike the \n     Alaska Natives, regular small businesses will have fewer \n     corporate resources to call upon to overcome those problems. \n     It also makes sense administratively for all of Alaska to \n     have the same set of basic rules for the program at any \n     given time. Thus, the bill includes a three-year pilot \n     program providing that HUBZone participants must have \n     their principal office in a HUBZone in Alaska or 35% of \n     their employees must reside in a HUBZone in Alaska or in \n     an Alaska Native village in Alaska or 35% of the employees \n     working on a contract awarded through the HUBZone program \n     must do their work in a HUBZone in Alaska. This creates a \n     rule unique to Alaska. HUBZone participants in Alaska \n     would not need to meet all three criteria, just one of \n     them.\n       Under the pilot language, firms could relocate their \n     principal office to comply, or else they could hire 35% of \n     their employees from HUBZones. If neither of those is do-\n     able, they would have a third option, of having 35% of their \n     employees working a specific HUBZone contract do so in an \n     Alaska HUBZone.\n       However, since this does represent a relaxing of the \n     current HUBZone criteria, it is important to be on guard \n     against the possibility of relaxing the rules too much. Thus, \n     the pilot program has a cap. If more than 2% of the nation's \n     small business contract dollars are awarded to Alaska in any \n     fiscal year, the pilot would shut down for the next fiscal \n     year. Alaska Native Corporations and Alaska small businesses \n     would then fall back on the underlying, current-law criteria \n     of having a principal office in a HUBZone and 35% of their \n     employees residing in a HUBZone.\n       Section 3. The definitions of Alaska Native Corporation and \n     Alaska Native Village are the same as in ANCSA. The \n     definition of ``Indian reservation'' refers generally to the \n     definition of ``Indian country'' at 18 U.S.C. 1151, with two \n     exceptions. It excludes lands taken into trust in any State \n     where a Tribe did not exercise governmental jurisdiction on \n     the date of enactment (unless the Tribe is recognized after \n     the date of enactment). It also excludes land acquisitions \n     that are not within the external boundaries of a reservation \n     or former reservation or are noncontiguous to trust or \n     restricted lands as of the date of enactment. Since \n     reservation and trust areas are deemed HUBZones without any \n     explicit test of economic need, a Tribe could otherwise \n     purchase a plot of land in a prosperous area, have it placed \n     into trust status, and have it deemed a HUBZone. Using scarce \n     economic development resources like the HUBZone program, on \n     areas that are already developing without such assistance, is \n     not the highest and best use of those limited resources. \n     However, this definition would still allow Tribes to continue \n     current practices of trying to acquire lots, within their \n     reservations, to eliminate the ``checkerboard'' pattern of \n     reservations that have plots within them not owned by the \n     Tribe; it also allows Tribes to expand existing trust areas.\n       Finally, the definition of ``Indian reservation'' provides \n     a special rule for Oklahoma, which was all reservation at one \n     time. If all of Oklahoma were to be deemed a HUBZone, the \n     program benefits would flow to businesses in their current \n     locations, without requiring job creation in distressed areas \n     of Oklahoma. This would be corporate welfare, not economic \n     development. To avoid this problem, the definition focuses \n     the HUBZone program on Oklahoma lands currently in trust or \n     eligible for trust status under existing regulation.\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nHUBZones in Native America Act of 2000. This bill is designed to \nclarify eligibility requirements and enhance participation by Native \nAmerican-owned small firms seeking certification in the Small Business \nAdministration's Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) \ngovernment contracting program. The bill also sets up a temporary pilot \nprogram for Alaska Native Corporations under the HUBZone program.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, I was a \ncosponsor to the HUBZone legislation when it was enacted into law as \npart of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The original \nbill language, because of some peculiarities in Native American and \nAlaska Native law, inadvertently exempted some Native American-owned \nfirms located in economically distressed areas from participating in \nthe HUBZone program. This bill is designed to make those firms eligible \nto participate.\n  The HUBZone program, Mr. President, is designed to help qualified \nsmall businesses located in economically distressed areas--inner \ncities, rural areas, and Native American tribal lands--secure \ncontracting opportunities with the Federal government. The\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\nprogram is also designed to create jobs in these areas by requiring \nthat firms hire 35% of their workforce from economically distressed \nareas.\n  According to the SBA, there are currently 1171 small businesses that \nare eligible to participate in the HUBZone program, and 114 of these \nare Native American-owned, 11 of which are located in the state of \nAlaska. This bill should provide the vehicle for more Native American-\nowned firms to become eligible.\n  Mr. President, Native Americans are one of the groups that the SBA \npresumes to be socially and economically disadvantaged for purposes of \ntheir Section 8(a) and Small Disadvantaged Business contracting \nprograms. Unfortunately, Native American tribal areas have not been \nable to share in the remarkable economic growth that our country has \nenjoyed for the last few years. It is my hope that this bill, with its \ntechnical corrections to the HUBZone program, will in some part, \nprovide greater economic opportunities in these areas that continue to \nsuffer high levels of unemployment and desperately need this \nhelp.\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \nfellow chairman Senator Bond in introducing the HUBZones in Native \nAmerica Act of 2000.\n  The act is designed to make sure that federal procurement dollars are \ntargeted to the areas that are most in need of an economic boost. These \nareas are called ``historically underutilized business zones'' and \nunder the Act, Indian reservations are defined as ``historically \nunderutilized business zones''.\n  Tribal economies continue to be among the most depressed and \neconomically stagnant in the country. Though some well-situated tribes \nare benefiting from gambling, most tribes and Indian people live in \nThird World conditions.\n  In the 106th Congress, the emphasis of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs has been that of Indian economic development. The ultimate goal \nfor Native economies is self-sufficiency. Programs, such as this, \nbridge the gap between Native economies and private enterprise.\n  On May 10, 1999, the Committee on Small Business and the Committee on \nIndian Affairs held a joint hearing on the implementation of the \nHUBZones Act of 1997 and its impact on Indian communities.\n  During that hearing three main issues were aired that are remedied by \nthe amendments we introduce today:\n  Eligibility of Indian Lands in Oklahoma; Eligibility of Indian Lands \nin Alaska; and Eligibility of Tribally-owned enterprises.\n  The original intent of the HUBZone program was to re-target existing \nfederal contracting dollars into America's distressed communities, \nincluding Alaska Native and Indian communities. The changes reflected \nin the HUBZones in Native America Act of 2000 build on the original \nintent of the Act, and make further steps to ensure that Alaska Native \nand Indian communities fully participate in this competitive program. I \nlook forward to perfecting the obstacles that remain.\n  I am hopeful that the legislation introduced today will encourage \nlong-term economic growth in Native communities by expanding business \nopportunities and job creation activities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senators Bond, Kerry, \nCampbell, Murkowski, Daschle, and Baucus, in introducing this bill. I \nwant to focus on a few specific portions of this bill that would be \nbeneficial to Alaska. this bill contains a provision to create a pilot \nprogram for small businesses in qualified areas of Alaska. The pilot \nprogram contained in this bill would alter the requirements for Alaska \nsmall Businesses to quality as HUBZone participants.\n  The current HUBZone Program, as designed by the chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Bond, is a good tool for getting \ncontracting dollars into distressed geographic areas and neighborhoods. \nA HUBZone is an area that is (1) located in a qualified census tract, \n(2) a qualified ``non-metropolitan county'' that is not located in a \nmetropolitan statistical area, and in which the median household income \nis less than 80 percent of the non-metropolitan state median household \nincome, or an area that has an unemployment rate that is not less than \n140 percent of the statewide average unemployment rate for the state in \nwhich the county is located, or (3) lands within the external \nboundaries of an Indian reservation. The current HUBZone program \nrequires a small business to be located in one of these designated \nareas while also requiring at least 35 percent of the business' \nemployees to live in a HUBZone. This helps get dollars circulating into \nareas of the community that have not enjoyed the economic growth of the \nlast 10 years.\n  The Alaska Pilot Program contained in this bill will modify the \nrequirements to allow a small business to qualify as a HUBZone \nparticipant if they meet only one of the following conditions: Either \n(1) they have their principle place of business in a HUBZone, or (2) at \nleast 35 percent of their employees live in a HUBZone, or (3) at least \n35 percent of the employees working on a qualified contract perform the \nwork in a HUBZone. Rather than requiring a small business to meet all \nof the requirements for HUBZone contracts, this Alaska Pilot Program \nwill allow small businesses in Alaska to compete for HUBZone contracts \nby fulfilling only one of the requirements. This should be beneficial \nfor the communities and neighborhoods who have missed out on growth of \nthe 1990's. In addition, it could mean more jobs for Alaskans and more \nmoney circulating into the Alaskan economy.\n  The bill also fixes technical problems that kept Alaska native-owned \nfirms from being able to participate in the HUBZone program. This will \nallow Alaska native-owned small businesses an opportunity to broaden \ntheir business activities in the state while also contributing \neconomically to their local communities and shareholders.\n  I would like to note that in providing benefits to native \ncommunities, this bill would not change Indian law, nor the State of \nAlaska's exclusive jurisdiction over lands in Alaska.\n  I thank the members of the Small Business and Indian Affairs \nCommittees who worked on this issue and for their willingness to take \ninto account the unique circumstances in Alaska. I believe this program \nwill help Alaska's economy to move forwarded and will afford hard \nworking small business owners in Alaska new opportunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2570.

A bill to provide for the liquidation or reliquidation of \ncertain entries of athletic shoes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               DUTY DRAWBACK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECYCLING\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to help \nretain a unique environmental recycling program launched by Nike, a \nhome-grown Oregon business, which involves recycling running shoes \nrather than dumping them in a landfill. The bill would resolve an issue \non which the U.S. Customs Service has taken inherently conflicting \npositions: whether a duty drawback can be claimed on an item that has \nno commercial value and is no longer an item in United States commerce \nbut which is recycled rather than destroyed. I believe recycling should \nbe promoted and not punished, and that is what this legislation does.\n  Under existing U.S. Customs law, an importer is entitled to import \nduty drawback on products that are returned to the importer because \nthey are defective. The point of this provision is to safeguard against \nan import duty being imposed on a product that does not end up in \nUnited States commerce. Customs law and regulation ensures that a \nproduct will not end up in U.S. commerce by requiring that the product \nbe completely destroyed to the extent that the product has no \ncommercial value, or that it be exported from the United States. In \ncertain cases Customs has allowed duty drawback: for example, alcohol \nsalvaged from destroyed beer and malt liquor which was sold as scrap \nrather than dumped as waste was accorded duty drawback.\n  Consistent with Customs' requirements, for a number of years Nike \ndestroyed the shoes and placed them in a landfill. This amounted to \nthousands of tons of non-biodegradable shoes being dumped in landfills. \nBecause shoes are not biodegradable, Nike developed a new, more \nenvironmentally-sustainable way to dispose of the defective shoes by \nchopping them into small pieces, called ``re-grind,'' and giving the \nregrind without charge or compensation to manufacturers of sport \nsurfaces. The re-grind became part of playground, basketball and other \nsurfaces that was used primarily for charitable purposes in poor urban \ncenters around the country. The program, called the ``Re-Use A-Shoe,'' \nis one of the many initiatives Nike has undertaken to incorporate \nenvironmental sustainability into its operations.\n  The issue Customs has been grappling with is whether the re-grind is \n``destroyed with no commercial value'' so as to qualify the destroyed \nshoes for duty drawback treatment. For several years Customs granted \nthe re-grind shoes duty drawback, but a Customs audit team recently \ndetermined that the re-grind was not ``destroyed,'' as it had \ncommercial value for court manufacturers and Customs recommended \nretroactive denial of Nike's drawback claims, totaling $11.6 million. \nBecause Customs had already refunded the drawback, the audit team \nrecommended that Nike repay the $11.6 million to Customs.\n\n[[Page S4024]]\n\n  It is clear from Customs' decisions that an article is considered \ndestroyed when it has been rendered of no commercial value and is no \nlonger an article of commerce. In this case, the defective footwear, \nonce shred, is valueless and of no commercial interest to anyone. Even \nwhen the shredded material is subsequently processed by Nike to recover \nsome material of limited use, the recovered material is not saleable to \nanyone and therefore has no commercial value.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that the position taken by the Customs \naudit team is not consistent with the intent of the duty drawback \nprovision. There is no commercial value to Nike in the re-grind; the \nshoes have been destroyed. Nike gives the product to the manufacturer \nwithout charge or compensation, and the manufacturers have confirmed \nthey would not pay for the material. I have copies of letters from each \nof the manufacturers attesting to the fact that they would not pay for \nthe re-grind and that it is not commercially viable. It appears that \nthe Customs audit team believes a more desirable outcome is to have \nNike dump some 2 million pairs or 3.5 million pounds of shoes into a \nlandfill rather than recycle the destroyed material. The outcome is the \nsame: the shoes no longer have commercial value, nor are they a product \nin U.S. commerce. It would seem to me there is no public policy benefit \nin forcing Nike to dump the shoes in a landfill; but that there is much \nto be gained from recycling millions of pairs of shoes that would \notherwise be dumped in a landfill.\n  The legislation I am introducing today resolves the question in favor \nof recycling, in favor of the environment and in favor of a rational \nduty drawback policy. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 113\n\n       Whereas in 1988 thousands of Burmese citizens called for a \n     democratic change in Burma and participated in peaceful \n     demonstrations to achieve this result;\n       Whereas these demonstrations were brutally repressed by the \n     Burmese military, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives;\n       Whereas despite continued repression, the Burmese people \n     turned out in record numbers to vote in elections deemed free \n     and fair by international observers;\n       Whereas on May 27, 1990, the National League for Democracy \n     (NLD) led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won more than 60 percent of \n     the popular vote and 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in \n     the elections;\n       Whereas the Burmese military rejected the results of the \n     elections, placed Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of \n     members of the NLD under arrest, pressured members of the NLD \n     to resign, and severely restricted freedom of assembly, \n     speech, and the press;\n       Whereas 48,000,000 people in Burma continue to suffer gross \n     violations of human rights, including the right to democracy, \n     and economic deprivation under a military regime known as the \n     State Peace and Development Council (SPDC);\n       Whereas on September 16, 1998, the members of the NLD and \n     other political parties who won the 1990 elections joined \n     together to form the Committee Representing the People's \n     Parliament (CRPP) as an interim mechanism to address human \n     rights, economic\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\n     and other conditions, and provide representation of the \n     political views and voice of Members of Parliament elected to \n     but denied office in 1990;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly and Commission \n     on Human Rights have condemned in nine consecutive \n     resolutions the persecution of religious and ethnic \n     minorities and the political opposition, and SPDC's record of \n     forced labor, exploitation, and sexual violence against \n     women;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union Council of \n     Foreign Ministers have similarly condemned conditions in \n     Burma and officially imposed travel restrictions and other \n     sanctions against the SPDC;\n       Whereas in May 1999, the International Labor Organization \n     (ILO) condemned the SPDC for inflicting forced labor on the \n     people and has banned the SPDC from participating in any \n     ILO meetings;\n       Whereas the 1999 Department of State Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices for Burma identifies more than 1,300 \n     people who continue to suffer inhumane detention conditions \n     as political prisoners in Burma;\n       Whereas the Department of State International Narcotics \n     Control Report for 2000 determines that Burma is the second \n     largest world-wide source of illicit opium and heroin and \n     that there are continuing, reliable reports that Burmese \n     officials are ``involved in the drug business or are paid to \n     allow the drug business to be conducted by others'', \n     conditions which pose a direct threat to United States \n     national security interests; and\n       Whereas despite these massive violations of human rights \n     and civil liberties and chronic economic deprivation, Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the NLD have continued to \n     call for a peaceful political dialogue with the SPDC to \n     achieve a democratic transition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States policy should strongly support the \n     restoration of democracy in Burma, including implementation \n     of the results of the free and fair elections of 1990;\n       (2) United States policy should continue to call upon the \n     military regime in Burma known as the State Peace and \n     Development Council (SPDC)--\n       (A) to guarantee freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, \n     freedom of speech, and freedom of the press for all Burmese \n     citizens;\n       (B) to immediately accept a political dialogue with Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD), \n     and ethic leaders to advance peace and reconciliation in \n     Burma;\n       (C) to immediately and unconditionally release all detained \n     Members elected to the 1990 parliament and other political \n     prisoners; and\n       (D) to promptly and fully uphold the terms and conditions \n     of all human rights and related resolutions passed by the \n     United Nations General Assembly, the Commission on Human \n     Rights, the International Labor Organization, and the \n     European Union; and\n       (3) United States policy should sustain current economic \n     and political sanctions against Burma as the appropriate \n     means--\n       (A) to secure the restoration of democracy, human rights, \n     and civil liberties in Burma; and\n       (B) to support United States national security \n     counternarcotics interests.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and I rise \ntoday to submit, along with several of our distinguished colleagues, a \nresolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of free and fair \nelections in Burma.\n  On May 27, 1990, the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi, won a majority of the parliamentary seats in the \nelections. This was a great victory for the champions of democracy and \nhuman rights in Burma. However, the Burmese military arbitrarily \nannulled the results and arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of NLD \nmembers. Others were forced to flee, and the people's freedoms of \nassembly, speech and the press were severely restricted.\n  Today, the steady erosion of human rights continues under the heavy \nhand of the military regime known as the State Peace and Development \nCouncil (SPDC). This resolution calls upon the SPDC to guarantee basic \nfreedoms to its people; accept a political dialogue with the NLD and \nother Burmese political leaders; and to comply with human rights \nagreements and resolutions emanating from such bodies as the United \nNations General Assembly, the European Union, and the International \nLabor Organization.\n  The struggle in Burma is not over. The 1999 Department of State \nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for Burma identifies more \nthan 1,300 people who continue to suffer as political prisoners.

My amendment would provide a \ndemonstration program for incentive grants for local school districts \nto develop minimum weekly requirements for physical education.\n  More than a third of young people aged 12-21 years do not regularly \nengaged in vigorous physical activity, and the percentage of overweight \nyoung Americans has more than doubled in the past 30 years.\n  More and more Americans are obese--more than 30 pounds overweight. In \n1991, only four states had populations more than 15 percent of which \nwere overweight. In 1998, the number of states with more than 15 \npercent overweight residents rose to 43.\n  Lack of exercise is a matter of death. Poor diet and exercise are the \nsecond leading cause of death in the United States. Only tobacco causes \nmore deaths. Lack of exercise contributes to 300,000 deaths in a year \nin the U.S.--more than alcohol, infectious agents, or guns. The \nimmediate and long-term impact of our poor health habits is staggering, \ncosting the nation more than $100 billion per year. If our young people \ncontinue to be inactive, the cost to the nation down the road will be \nastronomical. That long-term cost can be prevented, or at least greatly \ndiminished, through regular physical activity and good nutrition.\n  Lifelong health-related habits, including physical activity and \neating patterns, are normally established in childhood. Habits are hard \nto change as people grow older. We need to convince young people early, \nbefore health-damaging behaviors are adopted, to pursue a disciplined \nlife with regular exercise.\n  My amendment--the PEP bill--will provide our schools an ideal \nopportunity to make an enormous, positive impact on the health of our \nnation. Every student in our nation's schools should have an \nopportunity to participate in quality physical education.\n  Children need to know that physical activity will help them feel \ngood, be successful in school and work, and stay healthy. Education in \nsports activities provides important lifelong lessons about teamwork \nand dealing with defeat. The lessons of sports may help resolve some of \nthe problems that lead to violence in schools.\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\n  The trends for physical education have not been good. Daily \nparticipation in Phys Ed dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 27 percent \nin 1997. Budgets for physical education are cut first. Only one state \nin the U.S. currently requires physical education.\n  Sports and healthy body help produce a healthy mind. 47 percent of \nFortune 500 executives were in the National Honor Society--95 percent \nparticipated in school athletics. Healthy, active kids grow into \nhealthy, active leaders.\n  There is a great support for the PEP Act. Many of my colleagues have \nbeen contacted by constituents expressing their support for the return \nof physical education to schools. This is not a new program--physical \neducation was a regular part of school for decades. 72 percent of \nAmericans surveyed would support legislation for physical education. \nThis amendment creates a 5-year demonstration project to provide an \nopportunity to prove the impact of physical activity in schools on our \nyoung people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LOTT AMENDMENT NO. 3150\n\n  Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2251, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE SECOND \n                   AMENDMENT, THE ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL FIREARMS \n                   LAWS, AND THE JUVENILE CRIME CONFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     protects the right of each law-abiding United States citizen \n     to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-\n     defense or recreation; and\n       (2) The Clinton Administration has failed to protect law-\n     abiding citizens by inadequately enforcing Federal firearms \n     laws. Between 1992 and 1998, Triggerlock gun prosecutions of \n     defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony \n     dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800, \n     despite the fact that the overall budget of the Department of \n     Justice increased 54 percent during this period; and\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997; and\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997; also\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997; and\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm \n     under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite \n     this federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed \n     on the national instant criminal background system; also\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm; \n     it is also a Federal crime for convicted felons to possess or \n     purchase a firearm. More than 500,000 convicted felons and \n     other prohibited purchasers have been prevented from buying \n     firearms from licensed dealers since the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act was enacted. When these felons \n     attempted to purchase a firearm, they committed another crime \n     by making a false statement under oath that they were not \n     disqualified from purchasing a firearm; and, of the more than \n     500,000 violations, only approximately 200 of the felons have \n     been referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution; \n     and\n       (8) The juvenile crime conference committee is considering \n     a comprehensive approach to juvenile crime including:\n       (a) tougher penalties on criminals using guns and illegal \n     gun purchases;\n       (b) money for states to get tough on truly violent teen \n     criminals;\n       (c) a provision allowing Hollywood to reach agreements to \n     clean up smut and violence on television, in video games, and \n     in music;\n       (d) changing federal education mandates to ensure that all \n     students who bring guns to school can be disciplined; and\n       (e) a ban on juveniles who commit felonies from ever \n     legally possessing a gun and from possessing assault weapons, \n     and\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) Any juvenile crime conference report should reflect a \n     comprehensive approach to juvenile crime and enhance the \n     prosecution of firearms offenses, including:\n       (a) designating not less than 1 Assistant United States \n     Attorney in each district to prosecute Federal firearms \n     violations and thereby expand Project Exile nationally;\n       (b) upgrading the national instant criminal background \n     system by encouraging States to place mental health \n     adjudications on that system and by improving the overall \n     speed and efficiency of that system; and\n       (c) and providing incentive grants to States to encourage \n     States to impose mandatory minimum sentences of firearm \n     offenses;\n       (2) The right of each law-abiding United States citizen to \n     own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-\n     defense or recreation, should not be infringed.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/16/senate-section/article/S4028-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
