FLUET\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am deeply honored this morning to have had \nFather Gregoire Fluet provide us with the opening prayer in this \nsession of the Senate. It is a particular pleasure because Father Fluet \nis not just a resident of Connecticut but he is my parish priest. So \nthis morning is a moment of particular pride to welcome him to the \nSenate.\n  Father Fluet is someone I have known now for a number of years. We \nmet each other when Father Fluet was the pastor of St. Joseph's Church \nin North Grosvenordale, CT. I used to, on an annual basis, speak at the \ncommunion breakfast of the Knights of Columbus, something which I \nenjoyed immensely and did for more than 20 years. It was a wonderful \nexperience. The community would get together and Father Fluet would say \nmass and participate in the breakfast afterwards. We had a wonderful \ntime over many, many years.\n  Then, to my wonderful surprise, on the retirement of my dear friend \nand pastor, Father Henry Dziadosz--unfortunately, we just lost \nMonsignor Dziadosz, a wonderful human being--Father Fluet was assigned \nto my home parish in East Haddam, CT, a section of Moodus, CT. You have \nto be very careful; it is really East Haddam. The people of my town \nwould appreciate the distinction I am making here.\n  Father Fluet is a wonderful man, a spiritual leader; he has counseled \nand advised me on numerous occasions. He has a wonderful background in \nhistory. He is a teacher. He taught at St. Bernard's High School in the \ndiocese of Norwich. He also was a curate at the parish in Lyme, CT. He \njust received his doctorate in New England studies, the history of New \nEngland.\n  In addition to being a great spiritual leader, he also has a deep \ninterest in the history of this country and particularly the history of \nNew England.\n  It is truly an honor to welcome my good friend, my pastor, to this \nwonderful Chamber. We are deeply honored that he is here. We welcome \nhim immensely. We thank him for his wonderful words this morning. I am \nconfident that the parish of Saint Bridget of Kildare, my home parish, \nis going to be blessed for many years to come with the wonderful \nspiritual leadership of Father Fluet. He has a wonderful mother who I \nhave gotten to know. She is in a little ill health, but we are praying \nfor her this hour as well. She is a woman of deep, strong French \nbackground, a delightful person to be with as well.\n  Senator Lieberman, who was just here and wanted to stay to greet \nFather Fluet but had a hearing to run off to, wanted me to express to \nFather Fluet his deep admiration and respect and extend his words of \nwelcome as well this morning.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S4973-5", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am happy to be in the Chamber this \nmorning to address the issues that are going to be considered before \nthe Congress this week.\n  One of the most important issues that I found in my home State of \nIllinois, and I think can be found in virtually every State in the \nUnion, is the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. They are \ntelling us, the people who do this for a living, that when they ask \nfamilies across America what is one of the major issues you are going \nto look to when it comes to electing the President of the United States \nor electing a Member of Congress, one of the major issues that comes \nforward is the prescription drug benefit. It is understandable because \nthe Medicare program, as good as it is--in fact, it has been there for \n40 years as the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled--\ndoes not have a prescription drug benefit. You would not buy a health \ninsurance plan for your family today that didn't include one because \nyou never know when you are going to be subjected to an illness that a \ndoctor will need to treat with an expensive prescription drug. They can \nbecome very expensive. It is not uncommon to spend $50, $100, even \nseveral hundred a month to maintain a certain drug that keeps you \nhealthy.\n\n  When we constructed Medicare, we didn't put a prescription drug \nbenefit in the plan. That was 40 years ago. Today, seniors are finding \nthemselves extremely vulnerable. They will go to a doctor and say: I \nhave a problem. The doctor says: I know just the thing; here is a \nprescription. They will find out they can't afford to fill the \nprescription. So a lot of seniors on limited, fixed incomes, make a \nhard choice and say, I may not be able to take this prescription or \nmaybe I will fill it and only take half. The net result, of course, is \nthat the senior doesn't get well, doesn't get strong. In fact, they can \nsee their health deteriorate simply because they can't afford to fill \ntheir prescriptions.\n  The irony, of course, is that if a senior can't buy the drugs they \nneed to stay healthy and they end up in the hospital, guess what. The \ntaxpayers step in and say Medicare will pay for that. In other words, \nif someone gets sick because they don't have prescription drugs, we \nwill pay for it. If seniors have to go to the hospital, taxpayers pay \nfor it.\n  We on the Democratic side believe that we need to do two things. We \nneed to put a prescription drug benefit in Medicare that gives to \nsenior citizens and the disabled peace of mind that when they need \nthese prescription drugs, they will have help in paying for them. That \nis something everyone expects from a health insurance plan. It should \nbe the bottom line when it comes to Medicare, as well.\n  The Democratic side has been pushing this literally for years. We \nbelieve that is something this Congress should have done a long time \nago. Sadly, we have had no cooperation, none whatever, from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. They do not believe this is a critical \nand important issue. We have tried our very best to bring this issue to \na vote on the floor. We have tried both in the House and the Senate. \nThey have blocked us every single time.\n  Who would oppose a prescription drug benefit? On its face, why would \nanybody oppose that? It will help seniors. It will mean they will buy \nprescription drugs.\n  There is another issue. If we just passed a prescription drug benefit \nand did not address the pricing of drugs, the system would clearly go \nbankrupt in a hurry. In other words, if the drug companies can continue \nto raise their prices--as they are doing now almost on a monthly \nbasis--and we say we will pay whatever they charge, no program will \nlast.\n  We have to combine with the prescription drug benefit program a \npricing program, as well. Americans know this. I go to senior citizen \ngatherings in my State and they understand what is going on in the \nworld. They know if they happen to live in the northern part of the \nUnited States and can drive across the border into Canada, they can buy \nexactly the same drug--made in the United States, by the same company, \nsubject to the same Federal inspection--for a fraction of the cost. \nWhat costs $60 for a prescription in the United States costs $6 in \nCanada because the Canadian Government has said to American drug \ncompanies: If you want to sell in our country, we are not going to let \nyou run the prices up. There is a ceiling. You have to keep your prices \nunder control. We will make sure you don't gouge the customers in \nCanada.\n  We don't have a law such as that in the United States. Therefore, the \nseniors in this country pay top dollar for prescription drugs. People \nin Canada, people in Mexico, people in Europe, get the same drugs from \nthe same companies at a deep discount. I might add, as well, in this \ncountry the health insurance companies bargain with the same drug \ncompanies, saying, if you want to have your drugs prescribed by our \ndoctors in our plan, we will not let you keep raising the prices on \nthem. Of course, that is part of the reality.\n\n  Every group in America has a price mechanism, a price competition, \nexcept for the most vulnerable in America--the senior citizens and the \ndisabled on Medicare. They pay top dollar for prescription drugs. When \nthey can't pay it and they can't fill the prescription, they can't \nmaintain their health as they should.\n  We believe, on the Democratic side, that we need a prescription drug \nbenefit plan. We need to also address the question of pricing to make \nsure these drugs are affordable, so that the drug companies treat \nAmericans at least as fairly as they treat Canadians. I don't think \nthat is unreasonable.\n  Many times, we taxpayers, through the National Institutes of Health, \nhave put the money on the front side of research to find these drugs. \nThe drug companies profit from the research, as they should, but they \nalso have an obligation to the people of the United States to price \nthese drugs fairly.\n  We have an obligation to create a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. But this has been a one-sided discussion to this date. The \nDemocrats have pushed this plan, and the Republicans have resisted it.\n  Lo and behold, the people on the Republican side of the aisle have \ndecided to start asking American families, what do they think is \nimportant? I have in my hand polling data provided to the Republican \nconference in the House of Representatives. They went on to find in the \ncourse of their polling that they have been dead wrong on this issue, \nthat the American people consider this to be one of the most important \nissues in America today and in this election. The Republicans, in \nresisting the Democratic plan, have missed the most important issue for \nseniors and their families.\n  What are they proposing? They want to change it in a hurry. They \ndon't want to come on board and work out a bipartisan plan based on \nwhat the Democrats have been pushing for, for\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\nyears. No. Their plan is to come forward with a so-called prescription \ndrug plan that buys them enough time to get through the election, a \nplan that is a sham and a phony, a plan that does not address the real \nneeds for prescription drug benefits for seniors. They are not offering \nprescription drugs. They are offering sugar pills. They are offering \nplacebos. That will not keep America healthy.\n  As you read the things they have recommended to the people involved \nin this on the Republican side of the aisle, they say one of the things \nyou have to do is make sure you keep talking about this issue, make \nsure you empathize and tell people how much you feel for this issue.\n  It isn't ``feel good'' politics that Americans need. They need \nresults. They need a bipartisan plan that really does help seniors. In \nthe next few days, if you see, as we expect, this presentation by the \nRepublican leadership in Congress that they have finally discovered the \nprescription drug benefit issue and they have finally come up with a \nplan, you have an obligation, as I do, to ask them to prove it will \nwork, prove it will make certain that senior citizens who need help in \npaying for prescription drugs get that assistance. Make certain it \nisn't a phony that is just buying time until the election.\n\n  If you hear the Republican leadership, new-found convert to this \nissue, coming up with rhetoric that we haven't heard for years, don't \nbe surprised. Their polling data has told them they are dead wrong, the \nDemocrats are right on this issue and the Republicans have missed the \nboat.\n  It is our obligation in Congress to work with those people who have \nbeen involved on this issue for years, to make certain that any \nprescription drug benefit plan is real, it addresses the needs of \nseniors and disabled across America, it is affordable, and it will work \nto maintain the quality of care we expect in this country.\n  These health care issues will turn out to be the biggest issue in \nthis Presidential campaign. Yesterday, the Supreme Court decided again \nthat managed care companies don't have an obligation to their patients \nto find out that they get the best quality care as doctors recommend. \nTheir obligation is to profit and bottom line because of existing \nFederal law. On this case, as well, on prescription drug benefits, the \nfamilies across America are the ones who are vulnerable.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for again putting this issue of \nprescription drugs into context.\n  I am sure my friend would agree it isn't unusual for political \nparties to take polls. However, I think what my friend is trying to \nsay--and I hope every American can see this document I am holding in my \nhand, this poll. This so-called ``research,'' done with the Republicans \nover on the House side, is a document that says it all. It is the most \ncynical document I have ever seen since Newt Gingrich had the same \nthing done when he took over the House, when they told the Republicans \nwhat words to use, not what bills to pass, not what would make a good \npiece of legislation to help the millions of Americans who need help, \nno, but how to get them reelected and kowtow to their friends in the \ninsurance business, the HMOs, and so on. If the American people could \njust read this document, things would change around here. I am hoping \nthey will read this document.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [A Presentation to the House Republican Conference, June 8, 2000]\n\n             A Prescription Drug Plan for Stronger Medicare\n\n              (By Glen Bolger, Public Opinion Strategies)\n\n\n                passing a bill is a political imperative\n\n       Prrescription drug coverage is one of the Democrats' ``Four \n     Corners: offense for winning back the House--along with \n     health care, education, and Social Security.\n       We have a good messages on the other issues.\n       It is imperative that Republicans hang together on this \n     issue and pass a bill. It is helpful if we can be bi-partisan \n     in our approach.\n       On a list of 18 issues that might decide how people plan to \n     vote for president, ``helping elderly Americans get access to \n     prescription drugs'' might appear to be a mid-tier issue as \n     ``only'' 73% say it is one of the most important/very \n     important in deciding how they might vote.\n       However, the issue has enormous appeal for Democrat \n     candidates:\n       Democrats enjoy a huge generic advantage as the party best \n     perceived as being able to handle this issue.\n       The prescription drug issue allows the Democrats to not \n     only mobilize key sub-groups that are part of their political \n     base, but the issue also is of importance to key sub-groups \n     who are ``up for grabs'' in the 2000 election.\n       Of course, chief among these ``up for grab'' sub-groups are \n     seniors who rank this issue in the top three or four that \n     they say will determine their vote.\n\n\n             Top issues for the 2000 Presidential election\n\n\n                                                                Percent\nPreserving Social Security and

They don't believe it is in \n     financial danger--they perceive that claim to simply be a \n     scare tactic.\n       Democrats will want to position Republicans as allied with \n     the pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies against \n     senior citizens. That's a positioning you need to \n     aggressively reject.\n       Upset seniors don't believe politicians (especially \n     Republicans) understand how important and concerning this \n     issue is to them. Message: ``I care'' (but say it better than \n     that). It is more important to communicate that you have a \n     plan as it is to communicate what is in the plan.\n\n\n                    key points from the focus groups\n\n       The main concern seniors have with a prescription drug plan \n     is the impact on cost. Many seniors know the medicinal \n     equivalent of HMO horror stories--they know other seniors who \n     have to choose between paying for food or for prescription \n     drugs.\n       ``Republicans aren't doing anything to help seniors.''\n       Seniors like the idea of a voluntary plan, and do NOT want \n     to lose their own plan. They also want to have choices.\n       Catastrophic coverage is very important to communicate. \n     Even seniors who currently have a good plan are worried about \n     what might happen down the road.\n\n\n                       democratic attack messages\n\n       We tested multiple messages for the Democrats to attack \n     Republicans on this issue. Here are the most salient attack \n     messages:\n       ``Republicans are putting more seniors into HMOs. HMOs \n     provide terrible care, and this isn't fair to seniors.''\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\n       ``Republicans are in the back pocket of HMOs, insurance \n     companies, and pharmaceutical companies. Republicans are out \n     to protect these special interests, not the real interests of \n     senior citizens.''\n       Don't ignore these charges.\n\n\n                      messages to attack democrats\n\n       The Democrat plan has some potentially fatal weaknesses:\n       It is politicians and Washington bureaucrats setting drug \n     prices.\n       It is a one-size-fits-all plan that is too restrictive, too \n     confusing, and puts the politicians and Washington \n     bureaucrats in control.\n       It will take most seniors out of the good private drug \n     coverage they have today.\n\n\n                           phrases that work\n\n       Too many senior citizens are forced to choose between \n     putting food on the table and being able to afford the \n     prescription drugs they need to stay alive. In our great \n     nation, this is morally wrong.\n       We must take action to strengthen Medicare by providing \n     prescription drug coverage for all seniors so nobody gets \n     left behind.\n       While ensuring that all Medicare recipients have access to \n     prescription drug coverage, we must make sure that our senior \n     citizens also maintain control over their health care \n     choices.\n       We should not force seniors into a federal government-run, \n     one-size-fits-all prescription drug plan that's too \n     restrictive, too confusing, and allows politicians and \n     Washington bureaucrats to make medical decisions.\n       Our plan gives all seniors the right to choose an \n     affordable prescription drug benefit that best fits their own \n     health care needs.\n       Our plan protects low-income seniors by giving them \n     prescription drug coverage, and offers ALL other seniors a \n     number of affordable options to best meet their needs and \n     protect them from financial ruin.\n       By making it available to everyone, we're making sure that \n     no senior citizen or disabled American falls through the \n     cracks.\n       Because our plan is voluntary, we protect seniors already \n     satisfied with their current prescription drug benefit by \n     allowing them to keep what they have, while expanding \n     coverage to those who need it.\n       We will not force senior citizens out of the good private \n     coverage they currently enjoy--that's why our plan gives \n     individuals the power to decide what's best for them.\n       A stronger Medicare with prescription drug coverage is a \n     promise of health security and financial security for older \n     Americans and we're working to ensure that promise is kept. \n     America's seniors deserve no less.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend if he has read the page that says ``Focus \ngroup findings.'' Again, focus groups aren't unusual. You bring people \ntogether and ask them to respond. I ask my friend about a couple of \nthese points.\n  They say: Upset seniors don't believe politicians, especially \nRepublicans. They don't believe that, especially Republicans, \nunderstand how important and concerning this issue of prescription \ndrugs is to them.\n  This pollster, I am sure, made a lot of money to produce this \ndocument for my friends on the other side says. The pollster says:\n\n       Message: I care.\n\n  That is the message he wants Republicans to make:\n\n       I care (but say it better than that). I care (but say it \n     better than that).\n\n  Then he says:\n\n       It is more important to communicate that you have a plan as \n     it is to communicate what is in the plan.\n\n  What I want to say to my friend is this. After reading this, I expect \nthey are going to come up with some phony deal that looks like a \nprescription drug plan. My friend has made a point: If that plan does \nnothing to make these prescription drugs affordable, what does it do \nfor our people other than turn them off?\n  I say to my friend, he knows people in this country are going to \nCanada to get prescription drugs. He discussed that. I know some are \ngoing on the Internet and trying to get drugs from Mexico, prescription \ndrugs, because they cannot afford them here.\n  The ultimate question, after making my comments, is this. This \ndocument goes through the fact that the Democrats are doing really well \non these issues. Do you know why? Because the American people know we \nhave a real plan on this. They don't think we are perfect because \nnobody is perfect, but we have a plan on this. The Republicans know \nthey are going to lose this election unless they get a plan. So they \ntell their people to use certain expressions.\n  Can my friend share with us some of his expressions? It says: How to \ntalk about this issue. Our friends on the other side are told how to \ntalk about the issue, what expressions to say in addition to ``I \ncare.'' Maybe my friend will share some of that with the people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to. I say to the Senator from California, this \nis not unusual. I don't want to mislead people. Democrats take polls as \nwell. We took polls years ago and found out that families really cared \nabout the issue, and we came up with a plan, and literally for years we \nhave been trying to bring this issue to a vote in the Senate and House \nof Representatives. The Republican leadership has stopped us. They \nstopped us because the drug companies want to continue to make the \nmoney from the seniors and others across this country who pay top \ndollar for their prescription drugs.\n\n  So as we pushed this, year after year, we could never find \ncooperation on the Republican side of the aisle. The deathbed \nconversion we are witnessing here now reflects the fact that an \nelection is looming and the Republicans understand they are in a bad \nposition. They have taken a position that is unpopular, unwise, and \njust plain wrong.\n  Take a look at some of the polling data: Preserving Social Security \nand Medicare is the top issue in the Presidential election campaign.\n  Stopping insurance companies from making health care decisions is the \nNo. 2 issue in the Presidential campaign, according to Republican \npolls.\n  They have been on the wrong side on both of these. In addition, the \nNo. 2 issue for the Republicans in terms of the Presidential election \nis helping elderly Americans get access to affordable prescription \ndrugs. Now that they realize they are wrong on the issue and it is \ngoing to be a major issue in every campaign, they are rushing to come \nup with a strategy.\n  The American people don't want a political strategy; They want a law \npassed that will help these families. They understand these seniors go \ninto their pharmacies on a daily basis and make a life-and-death \ndecision about filling a prescription drug. The Republicans have said \nin this polling document that they have to attack the Democrats. That \nis part of this. Say you have a plan, even though you don't tell people \nwhat it is, and then turn around and attack the Democrats. Say it is \npoliticians and Washington bureaucrats who are trying to set drug \nprices.\n  That language is straight out of the pharmaceutical companies' own \nplatform on this issue. They don't want to have their prices affected. \nWhen the prices are in any way controlled or regulated, you have a \nCanadian situation where Canadian citizens pay a fraction of what we \npay in the United States for the same drugs. So create this image, \naccording to the Republican strategy, in the minds of Americans, that \nanytime we talk about pricing, it is just too much of Washington \nbureaucrats and politicians.\n  Then they say attack the Democrats plan as a\n\n       a one-size-fits-all plan that is too restrictive, too \n     confusing, and puts the Washington bureaucrats in control.''\n\n  The one-size-fits-all language is because the Democrats believe this \nshould be a universal plan so people really have a chance to receive \nhelp in paying for prescription drugs. You will find the Republican \nplan cuts off people at levels where, frankly, they are vulnerable and \ncannot afford to pay for prescription drugs. It also says: Attack the \nDemocrats and say most seniors will be taken ``out of the good private \ndrug coverage they have today.''\n  Let me concede something. About a third of seniors do have good \nprivate drug coverage, a third have mediocre coverage, and a third have \nno protection at all. I think we can take that into account. But the \nbottom line is, if you happen to be a fortunate senior because, for \nexample, you worked for a company with a union that gave you good \nhealth care benefits when you retired, that is good for you. I have met \nthose folks. But so many others, two out of three, do not have that \nbenefit. We want to make sure everybody in America is protected. Take a \nclose look, a careful look, at the Republican alternative. You are \ngoing to find they leave literally millions of seniors behind.\n\n  The drug companies want it that way. They don't want prices affected. \nThey don't want a major plan. They believe they can create some kind of \ninsurance protection for the seniors. I can tell you pointblank, \ninsurance\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\ncompany executives have met with us and said already the Republican \nproposal will not work. That is the bottom line.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The other interesting number here is that the Republicans \nhave found out, much to their chagrin, that Democrats have a 34-percent \nadvantage--in the Republicans' own poll here--on improving the access \nto affordable health care and a 33-percent advantage on prescription \ndrugs. So they take this information but they don't say, You know what, \nthe Democrats are right on these issues. Let's go over to their side of \nthe aisle. Let's call on President Clinton. He has been talking about \nprotecting Medicare and so has Vice President Gore, and prescription \ndrugs. Let's work together now.\n  They don't do that. They set out a document here that instead of \nsaying: We just found out President Clinton is right; We just found out \nthe Democrats have been right; We have just found out that Al Gore is \nright when he says we need a Medicare lockbox. So maybe they cross the \naisle? Maybe they come over here and visit us, we join hands, and go \ndown the aisle together here and cast some votes for the people for a \nchange? No. That is not the way they see it.\n  They get this information and they basically do what my friend \nsuggested. They are going to use the right words. They are going to \nattack us, they are going to scare people, and they are going to go \nhome and say they have done something.\n  I hope every American family can see this document today. In a way, I \nfeel badly about it because it will build cynicism, but I will say \nthis: The information in this document could be used to do the right \nthing. It is quite unfortunate that our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, instead of taking this information, recognizing they are \nwrong and joining us and President Clinton and Vice President Gore, \nthey are going to create a sham plan for prescription drugs. They are \ngoing to say they are protecting Medicare while doing nothing. Sadly, \nthe American people will lose, unless they make some changes around \nhere.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from California, this phrase says it \nall. This is the advice given by the pollsters and consultants for the \nRepublican leadership when it comes to the prescription drug issue. It \nhas already been made part of the Congressional Record, but it is there \nfor the world to see, and I want to quote one line and one line only to \ntell you what the bottom line message is:\n\n       It is more important to communicate that you have a plan as \n     it is to communicate what is in the plan.\n\n  If you talk about the cynicism people feel about politicians and \ncampaigns, that hits the nail on the head. In other words, don't \ndescribe it, don't tell people what it is going to do for families \nacross America, just tell them you care, tell them you have a plan. \nThat is the thing I think turns people off the most.\n  If the Republicans have a better idea, for goodness' sake, come \nforward with it. Let's debate it. That is what this is supposed to be \nabout.\n  We have a plan. We are willing to debate it. We are willing to stand \nup for it on the floor. I believe in it. I will campaign for it in \nIllinois and any other place. But to come up with an idea, a few words \nto try to gloss over this so people forget before the election what \nthis is about, is really a mistake.\n  Here is something else I want to note in the Republican consultants' \ndocument to the Congressional Republican leadership:\n\n       Prescription drug coverage is one of the Democrats' ``Four \n     Corners: offense for winning back the House--along with \n     health care, education and Social Security.\n\n  That is a quote directly. Yes, it is true. I would say that pollster \nhas really hit the nail on the head. This is exactly what we are trying \nto do. We are trying to focus this election campaign, not on negative \nslam ads, not on personal attacks, but on four basic issues. For \ngoodness' sake, we are willing to stand up and say this is what our \nvision of America will be. We look at this country and we feel blessed. \nWe live in one of the greatest nations in the history of the world.\n  We feel doubly blessed that we are living in such good times for most \nAmericans. This is a period of economic prosperity unparalleled in our \nhistory. One cannot find this long a string of good economic progress \nin the history of the United States.\n  Who can take credit for it? First and foremost, Americans and \nfamilies can take credit for it because they work hard every day. They \nstart the businesses. They teach the kids. Those things have paid off. \nThat is where the credit belongs, first and foremost.\n  From a policy viewpoint, credit also has to be given to those people \nwho make good decisions when it comes to our economy. We made a good \ndecision in the Senate and in the House as well in 1993 when President \nClinton said: The first thing we will do is reduce the deficit. Once we \nbring that deficit under control, we think the economy will move \nforward.\n  We could not get a single Republican in the House or the Senate to \nvote with us on that. Only the Democrats voted for it and Vice \nPresident Gore, sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair, cast the tie-\nbreaking vote to reduce the deficit and move us forward. And it worked.\n  Critics on the other side of the aisle, a Republican Senator from \nTexas, said this was going to create an economic disaster for America. \nHe has a little egg on his face today because for 7 years it has \ncreated just the opposite: economic prosperity. That was a good \ndecision.\n  Tough decisions from the Federal Reserve Board regarding interest \nrates, for example, have kept inflation under control.\n  We are moving forward. We believe on the Democratic side that we \ncannot stand back and say we deserve election and reelection because of \nall the good things we did in the past. That is not good enough. If any \nparty deserves election or reelection, it is because they learned the \nlessons of history and they have a vision of the future.\n  The vision tells us to take the surplus we are generating in our \nTreasury and pay down the national debt, a debt of almost $6 trillion \nthat cost us taxpayers $1 billion a day in interest payments. That is \nright, the payroll taxes they are taking out of your paycheck and \ntaking away from businesses and families across America to the tune of \n$1 billion a day do not educate a kid, they do not buy anything to \nenhance the security of America. That money is used exclusively to pay \ninterest on old debt.\n  Think about it. We are paying interest on the debt for things we \nbought years ago that we have already built and maybe have used. We on \nthe Democratic side believe that the fiscally prudent thing to do, the \nresponsible thing to do is to take our surplus and reduce that $6 \ntrillion debt. I want to say to my kids and my grandson: The best \nlegacy I can leave you is less of an American debt so that you do not \nhave to carry my burdens into your generation.\n  I believe that makes sense, and that is what Vice President Gore has \nstood for: To reduce America's national debt and to strengthen Social \nSecurity and Medicare as we do that to make sure those two systems are \nthere for years to come.\n  If we just stop at that point, we would not be doing enough. We have \nto have a vision for this next century and ask, What decisions can we \nmake as leaders of Government in Washington today to create \nopportunities for tomorrow?\n  It comes down to the four basic issues already identified by the \nDemocrats and acknowledged by the Republicans.\n\n  First, health care in America. It is disgraceful in America that we \nstill have tens of millions of people who have no health insurance. \nThink about their vulnerability: an accident, an illness, and all the \nplans they have made for their life just fall apart. They have medical \nbills they cannot possibly pay. People are in a vulnerable position \nbecause we have not addressed health care in America. We believe we \nneed to address health care when it comes to not only coverage of \nhealth insurance but prescription drug benefits for the elderly and \ndisabled under Medicare and, most basically to make sure medical \ndecisions are made by doctors and not by insurance companies.\n  Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in an \nimportant\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\ncase involving an HMO, a managed care company, in my State of Illinois \nat the Carle Clinic. A woman called the Carle Clinic in Bloomingdale, \nIL, and reported she was having pains in her stomach. They said: We \nwould like to examine you. Why don't you come in in 8 days.\n  Before she could go to the clinic her appendix burst, and she went \nthrough a terrible situation and a terrible recuperation in the \nhospital.\n  She came to learn that this plan, as so many other managed care \nplans, actually rewarded doctors financially if they showed more profit \nfor the company as opposed to providing quality health care. The bottom \nline was making money. The bottom line said let the lady wait at home \nfor 8 days and see if she still complains instead of bringing her into \nthe office for an examination.\n  She sued them. She said: I thought I could trust you. I thought that \nwas the bottom line when it comes to the health insurance company. The \nbottom line was profit, and it was made at my expense. I paid for it in \na hospital stay.\n  The Supreme Court said: You cannot do anything about it. Congress \npassed legislation that said managed care companies can do that and you \ncannot sue them. Your right against these companies is extremely \nlimited. That is a Federal decision.\n  That is a decision that should be changed. That is one Democrats have \npushed for on Capitol Hill for years and the Republican leadership has \nblocked it. These insurance companies are making big dollars. They are \nbig special interest groups. They are big players on the Washington \npolitical scene. They do not want anybody changing these rules. That is \nwhy they have resisted, and that is why we have done literally nothing \nin the Senate and the House to deal with these abuses.\n  Education: Can anyone think of anything in the 21st century more \nimportant than education in America? I cannot. We are going to have a \ndebate in the near future on trade. It is a hot issue. There are many \nwho believe globalization and free trade are part of America's future, \npart of the future of the world. To resist trade is to resist gravity: \nIt is going to happen.\n  The question is, How will we respond to it? Many workers are \nconcerned that if there is expanded trade, they might lose their jobs. \nCompanies will take their plants and move them overseas, and folks who \nhave good jobs today will not have them tomorrow. Shouldn't we as a \nnation acknowledge that, whether the jobs are lost to trade or \ntechnology? Shouldn't we be putting in place transition training and \neducation so workers do not have to fear this inevitable change in the \neconomy?\n  We are not hearing any suggestions on this from the Republican side. \nThey do not believe there should be a Federal role when it comes to \neducation and training. They talk about it being State and local. It \nhas been historically, but we have had Federal leadership that has made \na difference on these issues. We believe on the Democratic side we \nshould continue to do that.\n\n  I will tell my colleagues about another related issue. We know from \nthe best companies in America that the single biggest problem they have \ntoday is not estate taxes; it is not a tax burden under the code. The \nsingle biggest problem they have today is jobs they cannot fill with \nskilled workers.\n  I hear that in Illinois everywhere I go. I was in Itasca yesterday \nwith the Chamber of Commerce. That is their concern as well. We have to \nacknowledge the fact there are good paying jobs unfilled in America \nbecause we do not have skilled workers to fill them.\n  What do we do about it? Wait for the market to create an answer? I \nhope we will do more. In 1957, when the Russians launched Sputnik and \nwe were afraid we were going to lose the space race, this Congress \nresponded and said: We will respond as a nation. We will create the \nNational Defense Education Act. We are going to encourage young people \nto get a college education to be scientists, to be engineers, to \ncompete with the Russians. We did it. It was an investment that paid \noff handsomely. We created an engine for growth in the American economy \nthat not only made certain the private sector had the people they \nneeded but also sent a man to the Moon and so many other achievements \nunparalleled in the history of the world.\n  Why are we not doing the same thing today? Why are we not \nacknowledging we need to make an investment at the Federal level to \nhelp pay for college education so kids have a chance to become \ntomorrow's scientists and engineers, leaders of the 21st century so we \ndo not have to import computer experts from India and Pakistan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S4978-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4978-S4980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of \nSocial Security. Last week I got up toward the end of our time and did \nnot have a chance to talk about the issue, but I briefly mentioned my \nstrong admiration and support for Gov. George W. Bush's courageous and \nbold proposal in offering to the American public an opportunity to meet \nthe Social Security crisis head on and deal with it in a responsible \nway through investment as a way to try to bridge the gap that now \nexists in the Social Security system--``the gap'' meaning not enough \nmoney coming in to pay benefits down the road once the baby boom \ngeneration begins to retire.\n  I have been out for the past 4 years talking about this issue and \nhave talked in front of every conceivable group you can imagine. \nYesterday I was in Harrisburg, PA, talking to the State AARP about \nSocial Security and the importance of having politicians face up to the \nissue and explain to the American public how we are going to fix the \nproblem.\n  The problem is very simple. Right now, there are about 3.3 people \nworking for every retiree on Social Security. Social Security is a pay-\nas-you-go system. So those 3.3 working people have to pay enough in \nSocial Security tax to pay for the benefits to that 1 retiree.\n  Just to give you a comparison, back in 1950 we had 17 workers paying \ninto the system for every 1 retiree. That is why, in 1950, we had a \npayroll tax of 2 percent on the first $3,000 you earned, because there \nwere 17 people paying and you could pay a relatively low rate of \ntaxation to pay for the benefits. Now you pay 12.4 percent of every \ndollar you earn, up to, I believe it is, $72,000.\n  So it is a dramatic increase in taxes that has occurred because we \nwent from 17 workers to every 1 retiree to 3.3 workers to every 1 \nretiree. In the next 20 years, we will go from 3.3 workers to every 1 \nretiree, to around 2 workers or maybe even a little less than 2 workers \nto every 1 retiree.\n  It is pretty obvious what is going to have to happen. We are going to \nhave to make a change in the system because the current flow of revenue \nfrom 3.3 workers to support 1 retiree will be dramatically reduced when \nyou only have 2 workers. You cannot keep the current rate of taxation \nand support that 1 retiree.\n  So the question is, What do we do about it? Do we wait, knowing it is \ngoing to happen? Everybody who is going to be working 20 years from now \nhas been born, and everybody who is going to retire in 20 years from \nnow has been born. So we know what the demographics are going to look \nlike. The question is, What are we going to do about it?\n  There are three things you can do to fix the Social Security problem \nand only three things. There are only three things you can do.\n  No. 1, you can do what we have done 20-some times in the past; that \nis, increase taxes, from what started out as 2 percent on the first \n$3,000 to now 12.4 percent on up to $70,000 of income. So you can \nincrease taxes.\n  The second thing you can do is reduce benefits. We have done that in \nthe past, too. We raised the retirement age. We adjusted some of the \nbenefit numbers. You can reduce benefits.\n  How much would we have to do of either raising taxes or cutting \nbenefits? According to the Social Security trustees, the actuaries \nthere, we are looking at a payroll tax increase, if we wait 15\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nor 20 years--which is what some here at the national level, the Vice \nPresident, for example, and some on the other side of the aisle have \nsuggested; that if we wait, everything is going to be fine, that there \nwill be no problem for another 30 or 35 years. Just wait. What if we \nwait? If we wait 20 years to fix this problem, we are looking at a \npayroll tax increase of roughly 40 percent, going from 12.4 to about an \n18- or 19-percent payroll tax for the next generation.\n  So if you are a politician today and you do not plan on being around \n20 years from now, I guess the answer of waiting is a pretty good \noption: Put it on to the next group of politicians and the next \ngeneration of people, and let them pay those taxes. They may say: ``As \nfor me, I would rather just get elected and not make any tough \ndecisions and not have to tell anybody about what pain is going to be \nin the future because under my watch there will not be any.'' That is \nthe kind of leadership we do not need in America, in my opinion. But \nthat is an option.\n  The first option is to increase taxes dramatically down the road. The \nsecond option is to cut benefits. By the year 2035, I think it is, \nSocial Security taxes coming in will cover about 70 percent of what is \nneeded to be paid out in benefits. So what does that tell you? We will \nhave to cut benefits by about a third; that if we do not increase \ntaxes, then we will have to cut benefits by a third. I suspect you will \nnot find one vote in the Senate to do that today. And I do not believe \nyou will find any votes in 20 years to do that. So that option is \npretty much off the table, I suspect.\n\n  So those are the two options that are available, unless you take the \nthird option. This is where Governor Bush has come out. I give him a \nlot of credit for doing so. The third option is investment, increase \nthe rate of return on the money that is actually going into the system \nnow to make up the shortfall in the long run. This is not a view that \nis a partisan viewpoint; this has broad bipartisan support in the \nSenate.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle believe in personal retirement \naccounts. Even more Members on the other side of the aisle and the \nPresident agree with investment where the Government actually takes the \nmoney and invests it.\n  So there are two kinds of investments. We can do it two different \nways. The way I suggest and Governor Bush suggests is that every \nindividual get a portion of their payroll tax to be put in a personal \nretirement account, which they own, they control, they invest, but they \ncannot touch until they retire. That is how I suggest the investment be \ndone: The individual owning it, the individual investing it, the \nindividual controlling it.\n  The President's suggestion, in two of his budgets in this current \nterm of office, is that, yes, a portion of Social Security trust funds \ncan be invested, but the Government invests it. There would be no \nindividual ownership. It would be Government ownership. The Government \nwould invest a portion of the Social Security trust funds in stocks and \ncorporate bonds. Why? The President pretty much gave the same speech I \nam giving where he said there are three options: You can increase \ntaxes, cut benefits, or invest; and the President chose investment.\n  The President, in his budget, chose investment. But the investment he \nchose was the Government ownership of that investment. We choose \ninvestment and say the individual should own the investment, and the \nindividual should benefit from the investment; that the Government \nshould not ``benefit'' from the investment.\n  There are a whole host of reasons the Government should not own \ncorporations or stocks. We already regulate corporations. We tax \ncorporations. Now we have gotten in the business of suing corporations. \nWe should not also own them. That is the Government owning the means of \nproduction. For those of you who have not been in your political \nscience class recently, the Government owning the means of production \ncomes right out of the books of Karl Marx. We do not need the \nGovernment of the United States owning corporations.\n  By the way, I think most Americans believe very strongly about that, \nthat Government ownership of stocks and bonds is not something that is \nparticularly desirable, but the idea of investment is desirable.\n  The biggest criticism I hear from the Vice President, and the critics \nof Governor Bush's idea, is that this is a ``risky scheme.'' Contrast \nthat with what their proposal is. Their proposal has, I would agree, \nless risk and more certainty. I would agree with that. There is less \nrisk and more certainty. The certainty, though, is not a particularly \ndesirable one. The certainty is we will have to raise taxes or cut \nbenefits.\n  So you can argue that the Gore plan is less risky, is much more \ncertain. We will have to raise taxes or we will have to cut benefits, \nor do a little of both. So in that respect there is certainty. But it \nis not certainty that I think the American public is looking for.\n  He suggested the Bush plan is risky because it involves investment. I \ndid not hear that criticism of the President's plan to invest in the \nequities market. He did not criticize his own President's plan when he \nsuggested that money from Social Security should be invested in the \nequities market. I guess some believe it is not risky if the Government \ninvests it, but it is risky if you do. I am not too sure that holds a \nlot of water. Either investment in the market is risky or it is not \nrisky.\n  Sure, obviously, there are risks in investment in the market. But \nevery other retirement system in America is financed through \ninvestment. The people who are doing basically pretty well in America \nhave 401(k) plans and IRAs and Keogh plans and other plans where they \ntake money that they are earning. Here in the Federal Government, \nFederal employees have a thrift savings plan, all of which is invested \nin stocks and bonds. And we use the miracle of compound interest, over \ntime, to be able to then afford to pay the benefits for those retirees \nonce they hit retirement. Every person who is doing pretty well in \nAmerica has one of those plans at their disposal. It is the folks who \nare not doing so well who don't get a piece of the American pie. What \nthe Vice President is saying is: For you folks who have these plans, \nthat is OK; we think that is a good idea.\n\n  In fact, you will find the Vice President and others who are opposing \npersonal retirement accounts for Social Security are at the same time \nencouraging people to go out and develop 401(k)s and invest and save \nfor retirement; that it is a good idea. ``So if you have your own money \nand you make enough money, we encourage you to invest it. But if you \nare low income and you can't put money aside, we don't want you to have \na piece of this. We don't want you to have your own personal retirement \naccount within Social Security. We are just going to reserve that for \npeople who have enough money to do it on their own. We will allow you \nto participate in the growth of the American economy, in the increase \nin the markets and economy, in the dynamism of the American dream that \nis going on in our capital markets today. If you have money, you go \nahead and participate, and we will encourage you. We will provide tax \nincentives for you to do that. But if you are lower income and you are \nmaking ends meet and all you have for your retirement is Social \nSecurity, sorry, we will not allow you. It is too risky for you to do \nthis.'' How paternal; how discriminatory.\n  What we support is to give every working American a very small piece \nat first. Maybe in years to come it will be larger, but at first a very \nsmall piece of the American pie, 2 percent, 3 percent of every dollar \nthey earn for low and middle-income people to be put in a personal \nretirement account for them to invest; so as America grows and \nprospers, they won't be sitting on the sideline watching the rich get \nricher while they do not prosper from the growth in America. That is \ncruel.\n  We have an opportunity to reach out to moderate and low-income \nindividuals and allow them to participate in the American dream of \nownership, of investment, of participating in the growth of America, \nnot just their own growth with respect to their wages. I think it is a \ntremendous opportunity. It is the first and biggest chance to bridge \nwhat I see as one of the biggest problems facing America today, which \nis the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country.\n  I will never forget back in 1992, then-candidate Clinton would talk \nabout the\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\ndecade of greed of the 1980s, how the rich got richer and the poor \ndidn't get it. ``The 1980s, under Reagan, was the decade of greed.'' We \ndon't hear President Clinton talking about that now. Does anybody ever \nwonder why he doesn't talk about that anymore? The reason he doesn't \ntalk about it anymore is because during the 1990s, the rich got far \nricher than they did in the 1980s, and the poor didn't do that much \nbetter than they did in the 1980s. In fact, the gap between the rich \nand the poor widened more in the 1990s than it did in the 1980s. If the \n1980s was the decade of greed, the 1990s, under the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, was the decade of supergreed.\n  Why did that happen? It is pretty obvious why it happened. It \nhappened because those who were wealthy, who owned and invested as the \nmarkets went up, as the value of assets went up, their income went up. \nTheir wealth went up. If you are a worker who doesn't have wealth, \ndoesn't have savings, doesn't have investment, then your wealth only \ngoes up by the wage increase you get, which is 3 or 4 percent. So while \nthe NASDAQ goes up or the Dow Jones goes up 10, 15, 20 percent or \nhigher, your wages go up here at the bottom 2 or 3 percent, the gap \ngrows.\n  One-third of all income in this country comes from investment. Yet \nthe average person in America, someone right in the middle, has a total \nsavings of $1,385. Half of America or more is left behind.\n  What we want to do with personal retirement accounts for Social \nSecurity is say to those Americans: Welcome to the American economy; \nparticipate in the American dream of growth and ownership of \ninvestment. With that, we will not only fix Social Security, but we \nwill begin to do something that is fundamental, which is to bridge the \nwealth gap in America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair advise the Senate with \nregard to the standing order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, America awakened in the last 24 hours to \nanother very distressing disclosure of an alleged breach of security \npractices at the Los Alamos Laboratory, again relating to what is the \ngreatest threat every hour, every minute of the day to this Nation; \nthat is, from nuclear weapons. We are not here to prejudge any facts at \nthe moment.\n  From the standing rules of the Senate, rule XXV, I read:\n\n       The Committee on the Armed Services has jurisdiction over \n     national security aspects of nuclear energy.\n\n  Clearly, this problem falls within our domain. As chairman, in \nconsultation with the ranking member, we will move very swiftly. We \nwill establish a hearing date as soon as we can to develop those facts \nthat can be publicly disclosed and such facts as must remain \nclassified. The Armed Services Committee has dealt with this issue for \nover a year. In the authorization last year, we had a hard fought \ndebate on this floor about establishing a new entity within the \nDepartment of Energy. Indeed, we did it. It was signed into law, and it \nis ready to go.\n  Our committee also has jurisdiction over the nominees to head this \nnew entity. I refer the Senate to item 1010 in Nominations, Gen. John \nH. Gordon, United States Air Force, to be Under Secretary for Nuclear \nSecurity, Department of Energy. That was May 24.\n  I am writing a letter to the majority leader today and, indeed, to \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, asking that this nomination be \nbrought up immediately. There are allegations that certain Senators \nthink that the law that was passed last year has to be changed. That is \na matter that can be brought up before the Senate at any time. But I do \nnot think this Nation should sit 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day longer on the \nnomination of this outstanding American, who has impeccable \ncredentials, to take over this whole problem of security in the \nDepartment of Energy and is waiting to do so. Let us act on this \nnomination. I am certain the distinguished majority leader, in \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, will move to see that this is \ndone at the earliest opportunity. I hope it is done today.\n  I will advise the Senate later today with regard to the hearing of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  This is a matter of serious concern. At the hearing, we intend to \ncall Secretary Richardson, General Habiger, who is the Chief of \nSecurity Operations, and Mr. Ed Curran, Chief of Counterintelligence. \nIt may or may not be a counterintelligence matter. We don't want to \nprejudge the facts. But action is needed by this body, first on the \nnomination, and then to look into this situation. There is nothing that \nposes a greater threat to the United States of America, indeed, to our \nallies, than that from nuclear weapons.\n  It is ironic. This particular alleged security breach is basically in \nthe same location of the previous incident involving Wen Ho Lee, as I \nunderstand it, probably the same floor, same corridor. We have \ntestimony in the record, which I will add to the record, of the \nSecretary of Energy, who has appeared repeatedly before the committees \nof the Congress. This incident is clearly on Secretary Richardson's \nwatch; let there be no mistake about that. He has repeatedly advised \nthe Congress that he has put in place such regulations and other \nmeasures as to protect the United States, protect this Department from \nsuch alleged security breaches it faces this morning.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking after consultation, of course, with the \nmajority leader's office and Senators Domenici and Kyl, who have worked \nwith me on this matter for some 18 months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S4980-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the unanimous \nconsent agreement that we are now operating under in the Senate means \nthat I am next in order to offer an amendment.\n  Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is to offer an amendment at 10:40.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment which I will offer shortly \ndeals with a very unique situation. We certainly control the building \nof computers in the United States. We are the great superpower. We are \nalso the superpower of computer development. But in spite of that fact, \nabout 60 percent of the computers manufactured in the United States are \nsold overseas. Only 40 percent of the computers manufactured in this \ngreat country are sold internally.\n  The problem is there is now a provision requiring a 180-day review \nperiod to sell a computer, meaning that we are slowly but surely losing \nour ability to control the computer market. Why is that?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me \nfrom the Information Technology Industry Council which represents \ngenerally the technology industry.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to let you know that ITI \n     strongly supports legislative relief addressing the current \n     180-day waiting period whenever US computer export thresholds \n     are updated. ITI is the leading association of U.S. providers \n     of information technology products and services. ITI members \n     had worldwide revenue of more than $633 billion in 1999 and \n     employ an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States.\n       We are grateful for your efforts to secure relief in the \n     defense bills currently before the Senate and wanted you and \n     your colleagues to know we anticipate that votes pertaining \n     to computer exports will be included in our annual High Tech \n     Voting Guide. As you know, the High Tech Voting Guide is used \n     by ITI to measure Members of Congress' support for the \n     information technology industry and policies that ensure the \n     success of the digital economy.\n       ITI has endorsed your legislation (S. 1483) to shorten the \n     Congressionally mandated waiting period to 30 days. While we \n     strongly support our country's security objectives, there \n     seems no rationale for treating business-level computers that \n     are widely available on the world market as inherently more \n     dangerous than items being removed from the nation's \n     munitions list--an act that gives Congress just 30 calendar \n     days to review.\n       Computer exports are critical to the continued success of \n     the industry and America's leadership in information \n     technology. Computers today are improved and innovated \n     virtually every quarter. In our view, it does not make sense \n     to have a six-month waiting period for products that are \n     being innovated in three-month cycles. That rapid innovation \n     is what provides America with her valuable advantage in \n     technology, both in the marketplace and ultimately for \n     national security purposes--an argument put forth recently in \n     a Defense Science Board report on this very subject.\n       As a good-faith compromise, ITI and the Computer Coalition \n     for Responsible Exports (CCRE) backed an amendment to the \n     House-passed defense authorization bill that established a \n     60-day waiting period and guaranteed that the counting of \n     those days would not be tolled when Congress adjourns sine \n     die. The House passed that amendment last month by an \n     overwhelming vote of 415-8.\n       Further, as you know, the current provision in law was \n     understandably aimed at protecting the highest performing \n     computers from being exported to countries of particular \n     foreign policy concern. Yet, just last year, a late threshold \n     adjustment coupled with the six-month waiting period led to \n     American companies Apple and IBM being effectively denied the \n     ability to sell single-processor personal computers in some \n     markets because technology has advanced so rapidly that \n     yesterday's supercomputers had literally become today's \n     personal computers.\n       We have been heartened in recent weeks by the bipartisan \n     agreement that the waiting period must be shortened. The \n     Administration has recommended a 30-day waiting period. The \n     House, as mentioned above, endorsed a 60-day waiting period. \n     And Gov. George W. Bush has publicly endorsed a 60-day \n     waiting period as well in recognition that commodity \n     computers widely available from our foreign competitors \n     cannot be effectively controlled.\n       We thank you for your strong and vocal leadership in this \n     matter and look forward to working with you and other \n     Senators to achieve a strong, bipartisan consensus on this \n     and other issues critical to continuing America's \n     technological pre-eminence.\n           Best regards,\n                                                  Rhett B. Dawson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, they set forth the problem in this letter. \nAmong other things, this letter says:\n\n       . . .the current provision in law would understandably be \n     aimed at protecting the highest performing computers from \n     being exported to countries of particular foreign policy \n     concern. Yet just last year, a late threshold adjustment \n     coupled with the 6-month waiting period, led to American \n     companies, Apple and IBM, being effectively denied the \n     ability to sell single-processor personal computers in some \n     markets because technology has advanced so rapidly that \n     yesterday's supercomputers had literally become today's \n     personal computers.\n\n  It wasn't many years ago that I went to the fifth floor of the Clark \nCounty Courthouse in Las Vegas. I took a tour of the fifth floor. On \nthe entire fifth floor of this big building was a big computer that \nhandled all of the processing for Clark County. The temperature had to \nbe perfectly controlled. That floor is now gone. It is used for other \nthings. That same processing of information can now be accomplished \nwith a computer the size of a personal computer.\n  I was able, fortunately, to work with Congress and obtain a \nsupercomputer for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. We had a big \ncelebration. At that time, the computer was very large. It was probably \nthe size of two of these Senate desks. That supercomputer is now 10 \nyears old. A supercomputer today is not a big piece of equipment.\n  We are living in the Dark Ages. We have to change the law.\n  In an effort to compromise, the House established a 60-day waiting \nperiod. It passed by a vote of 415-8.\n  We worked very hard to get a bill in the Senate. We have been \nstymied, quite frankly.\n  There has been a bipartisan effort by Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Johnson, and I. We worked very hard last year.\n  The amendment that I am going to offer today is cosponsored by \nSenator Bennett of Utah, a Republican. This is not a partisan issue. It \nshouldn't be. But it is being held up for reasons that are so \nantiquated. The cold war is over. There is no need to have this \nlegislation stymied. We are hurting the American manufacturing base.\n  We are going to get letters from the Chamber of Commerce. Literally \nall business in America wants this to pass. But in the Senate, two or \nthree people are holding this up and preventing it from moving forward.\n  As I indicated, this amendment has the broad support from the high-\ntech industry.\n  I would bet, if we get a chance to vote on this, that 90 Senators \nwill vote for it.\n  This amendment will shorten the congressional review period for high-\nperformance computers from 180 days to 30 days.\n  On the Appropriations Committee alone, just to pick out one \ncommittee, Senators Bennett, Murray, and Gorton are cosponsors of this \nlegislation introduced in the Senate, and there will probably be more \ntoday.\n  We are operating, as I have said, under cold-war-era regulations. If \nwe want to remain the world leader in computers and the high-tech \narena, we must make this change immediately.\n  As I have indicated, I worked for the past year to try to get an \namendment up so we could do this. We started debate on one measure. It \nwas pulled from the floor. The congressional review period is six times \nlonger than the review period for munitions.\n  If there is a company that wants to sell rockets, tanks, warships, or \nhigh-performance aircraft under the foreign military sales program, it \nrequires a 30-day review period. But if you want to sell a laptop \ncomputer such as the one I have in my office, you have to wait 6 \nmonths. In that period of time, American industry could not meet the \ndemand. We are falling behind. Manufacturing is already beginning in \nother places. We don't have a lock on how to manufacture computers. We \nare ahead of the world right now.\n  I repeat that 60 percent of the computers we manufacture in the \nUnited States are sold outside the United States. The review period for \ncomputers is six times longer than for selling to another country a \nbattleship, a high-performance aircraft, or a rocket.\n  In February, the President, at the urging of Members of Congress, \nproposed changes to the controls on high-performance computers, the so-\ncalled MTOPS, but because of the 180-day review period, the changes \nhave yet to be implemented. The U.S. companies are losing foreign \nmarket share to many different entities. This is a bipartisan effort, \nand we should pass it. We are stifling U.S. companies' growth.\n  Last week, I had a meeting in my office with a number of CEOs of big \ncompanies--IBM, Compaq, and others. This is their No. 1 agenda item. It \nis the base of their business. They make computers, and they want to be \nable to sell them. A strong economy and a strong U.S. military depend \non our leadership. U.S. companies have to be given the opportunity to \ncompete worldwide in order to continue to lead the world in \ntechnological advances. Our export regulations are the most stringent \nin the world, giving foreign competitors a head start, to say the \nleast.\n  U.S. industry faces stiff competition as foreign governments allow \ngreater export flexibility, placing America at a greater disadvantage. \nMany of the manufacturers have no export controls. The current export \ncontrol system interferes with legitimate U.S. exports because it \ndoesn't keep pace with technology. The MTOPS level of microprocessors \nincreased fivefold from 1998 to 1999. This is the speed of computers \nfor my base description.\n  From 1998 to 1999, there has been a fivefold increase. Today's level \nwill\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nmore than double in 6 months because they are introducing something \ncalled the Intel Itanium chip. In a period of 2 years, there is going \nto be a tenfold increase in the ability of these microprocessors. New \nexport controls will not take effect until the completion of the \nrequired 6-month waiting period. By then, the thresholds will be \nobsolete and American companies will have lost considerable market \nshare again to foreign markets. The current export control system \ndoesn't protect U.S. national security.\n  The ability of American defense systems to maintain technological \nadvantages relies increasingly on the U.S. computer industry's ability \nto be on the cutting edge of technology. We need to move forward with \nthis legislation. Protection of capabilities and technologies readily \navailable in the world market is, at best, unhelpful for maintenance of \nmilitary dominance and, at worst, counterproductive, according to the \nfinal report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Globalization \nSecurity that came out in December of last year.\n  It doesn't make sense to impose a 180 waiting-day period for products \nwith a 3-month innovation period that are available for foreign \ncountries. We have to keep changing.\n  Right now, American companies are forbidden from selling computers in \ntier III countries, while foreign competitors are free to do so.\n  The removal of items from export controls imposed by the munitions \nlist, such as tanks, rockets, warships, and high-performance aircraft, \nrequires a 30-day waiting period. We need to put our priorities in \norder; 180 days is too long. It is way too long.\n  The new Intel microprocessor will be available very soon, with \ncompanies all over America already signed on to use this \nmicroprocessor. Foreign countries have signed on to using it, including \nHitachi and Siemens. They will be so far ahead of us in sales to other \ncountries that we will never catch up unless we change this law.\n\n  The most recent export controls announcements made by the \nadministration on February 1 will therefore be out of date in less than \n6 months.\n  Lastly, a review period, comparable to that applied to other export \ncontrol and national security regimes, will still give Congress \nadequate time to review national security ramifications of change in \nthe U.S. computer export control regime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. There is no doubt in \nmy mind that this amendment would pass overwhelmingly. I hope the \nmanagers of this bill will allow this amendment to go forward. It would \nbe too bad if we were stymied, once again, from allowing something that \nhas the overwhelming support of the American people, including the \nAmerican business sector, whether they are in the computer industry or \nnot. It has the total support of the computer industry. It also has the \nsupport of Members of Congress, as I have indicated. It passed the \nHouse of Representatives overwhelmingly. The vote was 415-8. In the \nSenate, it will get 90 votes. It would be a shame that a point of \norder, some technicality, would prevent the Senate from going forward \non this legislation. This is a Defense appropriations bill. There could \nbe no finer vehicle to consider this amendment. I hope some \ntechnicality does not prevent me from having this voted upon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3292\n\n (Purpose: To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance \n                               computers)\n\n  Mr. REID. I send the amendment to the desk on behalf of Senators Reid \nand Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 3292.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. ADJUSTMENT OF COMPOSITE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE.\n\n       Section 1211(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1998 (50 U.S.C. App. 2404 note) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence, by striking ``180'' and \n     inserting ``30''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end, the following new sentence: ``The \n     30-day reporting requirement shall apply to any changes to \n     the composite theoretical performance level for purposes of \n     subsection (a) proposed by the President on or after January \n     1, 2000.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to raise a point of \norder that this amendment contains legislative matter and therefore is \nin violation of rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nlegislation on appropriations and is in violation of rule XVI.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Therefore, the amendment is not in order; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of the Members of the Senate, we \nhave a list now of the amendments that have been reviewed by the \nParliamentarian and have an indication of those that violate rule XVI. \nIt is our intention to raise rule XVI for those amendments that are in \nviolation of rule XVI. We do have a list that the staff says we may \nmodify so they are not in violation of rule XVI, which we would then be \nwilling to accept, if the sponsors are willing to accept the \nmodification.\n  There are other amendments that have been offered that are not in \nviolation of rule XVI that we intend to oppose. For those, I urge \nSenators to have their staffs discuss these amendments with the staff \nof Senator Inouye and myself. It is my understanding we are in \nagreement on the position on these amendments that we find \nunacceptable, even though they are not in violation of rule XVI.\n  I do think we can proceed in a very rapid fashion to determine how \nmany votes we will have today if Members will state whether or not they \nare going to accept our modification. If they accept the modification, \nwe will put them in a managers' package that we will offer around 11:30 \nas being acceptable under the unanimous consent request we obtained \nyesterday, to give the managers the right to modify amendments to make \nthem acceptable under rule XVI.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from California is now going to \noffer an amendment. Could I inquire of the Senator if she intends to \nask for a vote on this amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared to accept the amendment of the Senator. \nDoes she still want a vote?\n  Mrs. BOXER. On the medical privacy?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I need to think about it for a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alaska will yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We now have 61 amendments not subjected to rule XVI, 25 \nDemocrat, 36 Republican amendments. We want to make sure the majority \nunderstands we will do everything we can to cooperate with the \nmajority. We would like to move this bill along as quickly as possible \nand get back to the Defense authorization bill at an early time. But I \nsuggest, as I have indicated, there are more Republican amendments than \nDemocratic amendments. We are going to do what we can to work on this \nside. I have spoken to Senator Inouye and he has indicated the two \nmanagers would accept a number of these amendments. Throughout the day \nwe will work on these to see what we can do to move this bill along. I \nhope the same will happen on the Senator's side if we are to complete \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my distinguished friend, the Democrat whip, we \nhave reviewed these and there are a series on both sides. It is true \nthere are more on our side than on the Democratic side that we intend \nto oppose, but the majority of the ones we would oppose are subject to \nrule XVI.\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\n  Mr. REID. None of the 36 are subject to rule XVI, I say to the \nmanager of the bill. Regarding the 36 Republican amendments, the \nParliamentarian has preliminarily indicated they are not subject to \nrule XVI. We, through the efforts of the staffs, working with the \nParliamentarian, believe there are some 35 or so amendments that are \nknocked out because of rule XVI. But we do have 61 remaining, 36 \nRepublican and 25 Democrat.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to say I have a 5-page list and \nI didn't have 2 pages in front of me. The Senator is right. We are \nworking on those now, to notify Members on our side that we will oppose \nthe amendments as listed on the basis we do not feel we can accept them \nbecause of the provisions of the existing bill and because of the \navailability of funds.\n  We will proceed to do just as the Senator has indicated. If Members, \nhowever, will accept our modifications--the Senator is aware of the \nmodifications list? We again repeat, if they accept our modifications, \nalthough we oppose the amendments in the present form, we will include \nthem in the managers' package. We hope to get a reply back from \nMembers. Of course, Members have the right to offer their amendments \nand request a vote of the Senate. We are indicating, regarding those \nthat we have not put on the acceptable list, we will oppose those \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. We will also try to work with the manager of the bill to \nmake sure we have people available to offer these amendments so there \nis not a lot of time in quorum calls.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3363\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the privacy of an individual's medical records)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, is recognized to call up an amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call amendment No. 3363.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3363.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL RECORDS.\n\n       None of the funds provided in this Act shall be used to \n     transfer, release, disclose, or otherwise make available to \n     any individual or entity outside the Department of Defense \n     for any non-national security or non-law enforcement purposes \n     an individual's medical records without the consent of the \n     individual.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe anyone who listens to us will \nagree this issue of privacy of medical records is really moving to the \nforefront of American public discourse. I think we all believe certain \nthings should be private. Certainly our medical records should be \nprivate unless we are very willing to discuss them or have them \ndiscussed. I am very pleased Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye support \nthis amendment, and having received assurances they will work for it in \nthe conference, I am not going to ask for a recorded vote. But I think \nit is a breakthrough that the managers have accepted this amendment.\n  I wish to make a point here about privacy of medical records. The \nDepartment of Defense is no better or no worse than any other Federal \nagency because all the Federal agencies have been going by the rules \nthat were set forth in 1974. I do not know how old you were in 1974, \nMr. President, but it was a long time ago. That is when we wrote the \nrules surrounding privacy, the Privacy Act of 1974, that really govern \nall the rules of privacy surrounding Federal employees, be they in the \nmilitary or in the nonmilitary.\n  A cursory reading of the Privacy Act of 1974 will make your hair \nstand on end. It governs the privacy of medical records, but it says \nthat no one can get your record unless you give prior written consent \n``unless''--and here is the part you have to hear:\n\n       Unless the records are disclosed within an agency to a \n     person who needs it in the performance of the job.\n\n  So anyone can get your record if they decide they want to see it as \nthey do a job performance. Then it says an agency can get your record \nwithout your approval if it is for a routine use specified in the \nFederal Register. They can get your record, and listen to this, give it \nto the Census Bureau with your name attached: Barbara Boxer, this is \nher medical record. The Census Bureau needs your record so they can \ncarry out a census survey. Maybe they want to find out which Federal \nemployees had what disease. They can get those records for the census \nfor statistical purposes, but they say the records would not be \nindividually identifiable, so I suppose that is OK.\n  Listen to this. The National Archives can get your record without \nyour permission if your record has a sufficient historical value. So I \nsay to the Presiding Officer, maybe someone in the National Archives is \ninterested in his dad, the great Senator who preceded him, because they \nfeel his records have sufficient historical value. That is absurd; they \ncould get them if the agency released them.\n  Then there is a big loophole:\n\n       * * * because of a compelling circumstance affecting the \n     health or safety of an individual.\n\n  Imagine, someone decides there is a compelling circumstance to know \nany Senator's or any employee's or any clerk's disabilities, what \nmedicines they are on. Oh, they can get it if there is a compelling \ncircumstance. That is not defined. Congress can get your record. \nCongress has a right to get the record of every clerk sitting here, any \nperson in any Federal agency, without their consent. Talk about Big \nBrother or Big Sister, as the case may be. They have the right to find \nout anybody's record, their medical record. What a stunning revelation \nthis is, to read the 1974 Privacy Act.\n  How about this one? The General Accounting Office, the GAO, doing a \nstudy--and we know we ask them to do many studies--can, in fact, get \nthe record of any Federal employee with their name attached.\n  A consumer reporting agency can go ahead and get that information.\n  So here we have the Privacy Act of 1974. I have gone through it. Out \nof the 12 provisions, the exceptions, only 2 of them make sense. They \nhave to do with criminality, but everything else makes no sense.\n\n  I am very pleased Senators Stevens and Inouye understand this. I say \nto my friend from Alaska, under the Privacy Act that applies today, it \nis not just the military; it is all Federal agencies. I am just doing \nit here because this bill came out first. The DOD is absolutely no \nworse than any other agency. They are just following the Privacy Act of \n1974. It is chilling to see how Congress can get an individual's \nmedical record with their name attached or how the Census Bureau can \nget an individual's medical record with their name attached, without \napproval.\n  In our amendment we simply say that, in fact, an individual needs to \ngive permission, unless it is for a national security or law \nenforcement purpose. Then we say: Fine, you give up your rights in that \nparticular case.\n  Again, I am pleased; we are breaking fine new ground. We should apply \nwhat we are doing here to every agency. I will do that, by the way, on \nevery appropriations bill I can because this is absolutely critical.\n  I am delighted we are going to have a voice vote on this. I would \nlike to have it accepted. A voice vote will be fine. This is not a \ncomplicated issue. This is a question of people in the military having \npeace of mind, knowing their records are secure. I will go away very \npleased on this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct in \nregard to the defense operations. I do note the exemption, where \nnecessary, in the interest of national security. There are situations \nin which a commander has to know the medical conditions of people whom \nthey might dispatch. That exception makes it acceptable for the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  However, I do not think we are going to proceed with having a piece-\nby-piece amendment to the Privacy Act on the appropriations bills. This \nis very much acceptable on this bill. With the conditions that are \nbeing applied, it is a step in the right direction.\n  I urge the Senator from California not to consider a piece-by-piece \namendment to the Privacy Act on these appropriations bills as they come \nthrough because this Senator is not going to\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\nsupport that. It becomes legislation on an appropriations bill on other \nmatters, I can say that.\n  With regard to military records, it is an entirely different \ncircumstance. Military records are part of the Department of Defense \noperation, and this is a step in the right direction. I am happy to \naccept the amendment on that basis.\n  I know of no other agency that has access to the medical records of \nthe individuals who are employed by the agency as this one does. The \nDepartment of Defense does, and I think the Department of Defense will \nwelcome this guidance. I am pleased to accept it on that basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3363.\n  The amendment (No. 3363) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will not offer amendment No. 3309 which \nwas a backup amendment in case I was unsuccessful. I will be offering \nthis when it is appropriate, not when it is inappropriate. I am \nabsolutely delighted. I make the point, this is the first time we \nprotected medical records. I could not be more pleased. I thank the \nmanagers for their support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are awaiting additional amendments. \nDoes the Senator from California intend to offer amendments Nos. 3310 \nor 3311?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do plan to offer amendments Nos. 3310 \nand 3311, but I need a little more time to get all my ducks in a row on \nthem. I will be back as soon as I can do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3346\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for an additional payment from the surplus to \n                        reduce the public debt)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Voinovich, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3346.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY\n\n\n                       bureau of the public debt\n\n      gifts to the united states for reduction of the public debt\n\n       For deposit of an additional amount into the account \n     established under section 3113(b) of title 31, United States \n     Code, to reduce the public debt, $12,200,000,000.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank Senators Voinovich, Grams, and \nEnzi for agreeing to cosponsor this particular amendment.\n  As everybody in the Senate knows, I have been working for some time \nto put a plan before the Senate that would pay down the debt over a \nperiod of time. I have always been a strong proponent of paying down \nthe debt. I believe Congress needs to live within its own spending \nrestraints.\n  In 1961, Congress established within the Department of Treasury the \nBureau of the Public Debt. It is an account for citizens to repay the \npublic debt. Our amendment relates to the surplus from fiscal year \n2000. The surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office has been \nprojected to be $26.5 billion; that is over and above what was provided \nfor when we passed the budget last year.\n  There was an emergency resolution that provided for some spending, so \nwe have already spent part of the $26.5 billion: $14.3 billion went to \nreversing the payday delays and moving appropriation spending back into \nfiscal year 2000, which was a procedural issue early on in the year. It \ntook $7.2 billion to do that. We took $5.5 billion for agriculture \nrelief and $1.6 billion for natural disaster relief, Kosovo, and \nassistance to the Government of Colombia for drug relief. That totals \n$14.3 billion. That leaves $12.2 billion that has not been obligated \nthat is going to be surplus in this year's budget.\n  We have another estimate that will be coming in later on in the year. \nVery likely, there will even be additional dollars at some point in \ntime over and above the $12.2 billion on which the Senate can make a \ndecision. Basically, what we are asking with this amendment is that the \n$12.2 billion ought to go towards paying down the public debt. It is \nbased on figures released by the Congressional Budget Office, and it is \nwithin the budget resolution that was passed earlier this year. It \ntakes care of emergency spending needs.\n  I am asking Members of the Senate to support me in helping to pay \ndown the debt. In recent years, we have had an unprecedented amount of \nsurplus. The surplus has illustrated the importance of showing some \nfiscal restraint. Actually, the budget resolution we passed earlier, in \nboth the House and Senate, is an agreement between the House and the \nSenate to stay within certain spending parameters. This falls within \nthose guidelines. The only enforcement mechanism is our willingness to \nlive by our own rules.\n  We are saying with this amendment that we ought to live by the \nagreement that was earlier arranged between the House and the Senate, \nand passed. And if there is any spending, instead of increasing \nspending, we ought to be paying down the debt.\n  The emergency spending is not counted for under the budget caps or \nthe 302(b) allocation. In my view, the spending privilege that we had \nin the past years has been abused. We have spent more and not worked \nhard enough to hold down and stay within the caps.\n  The increased spending may ultimately threaten the Social Security \nsurplus. We have all talked about how important it is to save Social \nSecurity. I have been of the view that if you pay down the debt, you \ncan free up resources so that we can work at Social Security reform in \nfuture years. Obviously, it is not going to happen this year.\n  In my view, we cannot, in good conscience, continue to spend when we \nhave such huge obligations that are facing us in future years, \nparticularly in Social Security trust funds. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, again, has scored this as a no-cost transfer.\n  The amendment appropriates $12.2 billion to an already existing \naccount at the Bureau of Public Debt, which we set up in past years for \ntaxpayers to pay into because this Congress thought it was important to \nthe American taxpayers.\n  I am saying to the American taxpayer that you have shown a commitment \nto want to pay down the public debt. Members of the Senate and the \nHouse need to carry forward with their desire and their commitment and \nshow an equal desire to pay down the public debt. This transfers money \naway from spending and locks it into debt owed to the public.\n  New estimates will be coming later on in the year and promise to \noffer similar opportunities for dedicating more of the fiscal year 2000 \nmoney to repay debt owed to the public.\n  I have an article that was written by Peter B. Sperry of the Heritage \nFoundation entitled ``Making Sure Surplus Revenue Is Used To Reduce The \nNational Debt.'' I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Heritage Foundation Backgrounder, June 13, 2000]\n\n    Making Sure Surplus Revenue Is Used To Reduce the National Debt\n\n                          (By Peter B. Sperry)\n\n       Although most Americans assume that a federal budget \n     surplus in any year is automatically used to reduce the \n     national debt, or at least the debt held by the public, this \n     actually is not the case. The U.S. Department of the Treasury \n     must implement specific financial accounting procedures if it \n     is to use a cash surplus to pay down the debt held by the \n     public. If these procedures are not followed, or if they \n     proceed slowly, then the surplus revenue just builds up in \n     the Treasury's operating cash accounts.\n       This excess cash could be used in the future to further \n     reduce the debt, but only if it\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\n     is protected from other uses in the meantime. Until the \n     excess cash if formally committed to debt repayment, Congress \n     could appropriate it for other purposes. Consequently, the \n     current surplus will not automatically reduce the publicly \n     held national debt of $3.54 trillion unless Congress acts now \n     to make sure these funds are automatically used for debt \n     reduction and for no other purpose.\n       There is a parallel to this in household finance. When a \n     family with a large mortgage, credit card debt, and several \n     student loans receives an unexpected financial windfall, it \n     usually deposits the funds in a checking account and takes a \n     little time to consider how best to allocate the revenue--\n     whether to refinance the mortgage, pay off credit cards, or \n     establish a rainy day fund. Meanwhile, the family's debt \n     remains, and will not be reduced until the family formally \n     transfers funds to one or more of its creditors. If the \n     family does not take some action in the interim to wall off \n     the cash, it often ends up frittering away the money on new \n     purchases, and the debt remains.\n       The federal government faces a similar situation. Surplus \n     revenues are accumulating in the Treasury Department's \n     operating cash accounts faster than the Bureau of the Public \n     Debt can efficiently dedicate them to reducing the public \n     debt. Consequently, surplus balances in these accounts have \n     reached historic levels, and they are likely to accumulate \n     even faster as the size of the surplus grows. Unless Congress \n     takes formal action to protect these funds, they are \n     available to be used or misused at any time in the \n     appropriations process. Fortunately, the House soon will \n     consider a bill (H.R. 4601) that would protect the budget \n     surplus from being raided by appropriations until prudent \n     decisions can be made about its use.\n\n\n                    why debt reduction needs a boost\n\n       Thanks to unexpected budget surpluses, the U.S. Department \n     of the Treasury issued less new debt than it redeemed each \n     year. It conducted several ``reverse'' auctions to buy back \n     old high-interest debt. And it successfully reduced the \n     amount of federal debt held by the public in less than three \n     years by $230 billion, from $3.77 trillion in October 1997 to \n     $3.54 trillion in April 2000. Chart 1 clearly shows that its \n     efforts have been successful and impressive.\n       [Charts not reproducible in the Record.]\n       Despite this effort, the Treasury still is awash in cash. \n     Examining the Treasury Department's monthly reports over this \n     same period (see Appendix) reveals that, after accounting for \n     normal seasonal fluctuations, the closing balances of its \n     operating cash accounts have grown dramatically and, more \n     important, the rate at which cash is accumulating in them has \n     accelerated. The linear trend line in Chart 2 shows both \n     the growth in the closing balances in the cash accounts \n     and the projected growth under current conditions. \n     Essentially, if no provisions are made to protect these \n     balances, in August 2002--two months before the midterm \n     elections--appropriators would have access to almost $60 \n     billion in non-obligated cash.\n       Unfortunately, even this projection may be too \n     conservative. Examination of month-to-month changes in the \n     closing balances indicates that the rate of cash accumulation \n     has started to accelerate, which will cause the closing \n     balances to grow even faster. The trend line in chart 3 shows \n     that the amount of positive monthly change in closing cash \n     balances has, after accounting for normal fluctuation, \n     increased since October 1997, and cash balances could start \n     to increase by an average of $20 billion per month within two \n     years.\n       The Treasury Department faces extraordinary cash management \n     challenges as it attempts to repay the debt held by the \n     public steadily and without destabilizing financial markets \n     that depend on federal debt instruments as a standard of \n     measurement. By protecting accumulated cash balances from \n     misuse, Congress could provide the Treasury Department with \n     the flexibility it needs to do its job more effectively.\n\n\n                treasury's limited debt management tools\n\n       The Treasury relies on three basic debt management tools to \n     reduce the debt held by the public in a controlled manner.\n     Issuing less debt\n       As old debt matures and is redeemed, the Treasury \n     Department issues a slightly smaller amount of new debt in \n     return, thereby reducing the total debt held by the public. \n     This is the federal government's most cost-effective and \n     preferred method of debt reduction. However, it is not a \n     simple process to determine how much new debt should be \n     issued. If the Treasury Department returns too much debt to \n     the financial market, it misses an opportunity to retire \n     additional debt. If it returns too little to the markets, the \n     cost of federal debt instruments will rise, driving down \n     their yields and disrupting many private-sector retirement \n     plans.\n     Reverse auctions\n       The Treasury Department periodically conducts reverse \n     auctions in which it announces that it will buy a \n     predetermined amount of specific types of debt instruments \n     from whoever will sell them for the best price. This method \n     quickly reduces debt held by the public, but it can be \n     expensive. Investors holding a T-bill that will be worth \n     $1,000 in 20 years may be willing to sell it for $995 if they \n     need the money now and believe that is the best price they \n     can get. However, if they know the Treasury Department has \n     made a commitment to buy a large number of T-bills in a short \n     period of time, investors may hold out for $997--a premium of \n     $2 million on every $1 billion of debt the Treasury \n     Department retires.\n     Purchasing debt instruments\n       The Treasury Department can use private-sector brokers to \n     purchase federal debt instruments on the open market without \n     having it revealed that the client is the federal government. \n     This method is slow, but it allows the Treasury Department to \n     take advantage of unpredictable fluctuations in financial \n     markets to buy back federal debt instruments for the best \n     possible price. This method must be used carefully and \n     discreetly to avoid having investors, upon realizing that the \n     true buyer is the federal government, hold out for higher \n     prices.\\1\\\n\n\n                why timing and flexibility are important\n\n       The Treasury Department needs time and flexibility to use \n     debt management tools effectively. It often will need to \n     allow large balances to accumulate in the operating cash \n     accounts while it waits for the opportunity to buy back \n     federal debt instruments at the best possible price. If these \n     balances are unprotected, they may prove irresistible \n     temptations for appropriators with special-interest \n     constituencies.\n       A prudent Secretary of the Treasury would not risk \n     disrupting financial markets by recklessly reducing the \n     amount of new debt issued each year, but might increase \n     the number and size of reverse auctions to ensure that \n     surplus revenues are used for debt reduction rather than \n     remain available to congressional appropriators. The \n     taxpayers would, at best, pay more than necessary to \n     retire the federal debt, and they might find that \n     appropriators have spent the surplus before it could be \n     used to pay down debt\n\n\n                    making debt reduction automatic\n\n       Fortunately, Congress has the opportunity to ensure that \n     the Treasury's large cash balances are not misused in the \n     appropriations process. The U.S. House of Representatives \n     will soon consider H.R. 4601, the Debt Reduction \n     Reconciliation Act of 2000, recently approved by the House \n     Ways and Means Committee. This legislation, sponsored by \n     Representative Ernest Fletcher (R-KY), is designed to give \n     the Treasury Department the time and flexibility it needs to \n     use debt management tools most effectively. It would protect \n     the on-budget surplus revenues collected during the remainder \n     of fiscal year (FY) 2000 and appropriate them for debt \n     reduction by depositing them in a designated ``off budget'' \n     Public Debt Reduction Account.\n       Although the surplus revenues could still cause an increase \n     in cash balances, the cash would be dedicated in the Debt \n     Reduction Account rather than in the Treasury Department's \n     operating cash account. Appropriators would be able to \n     reallocate these funds only by first rescinding the \n     appropriation for debt reduction in legislation that would \n     have to pass both houses of Congress and gain presidential \n     approval. Once surplus revenues are deposited in the Debt \n     Reduction Account, appropriators would have very limited \n     ability to increase spending without creating an on-budget \n     deficit, which many taxpayers would perceive as a raid on the \n     Social Security trust fund.\n       H.R. 4601 would effectively protect the surplus revenues \n     that are collected during the remainder of FY 2000; moreover, \n     it serves as model for how Congress should allocate \n     unexpected windfalls in the future. It does not preclude tax \n     reform because it is limited to the current fiscal year and \n     therefore affects only revenues that have already been \n     collected or that will be collected before any tax reform \n     legislation takes effect. Nevertheless, once the Debt \n     Reduction Account is established, Congress could continue to \n     appropriate funds to the account at any time. Consequently, \n     Congress would retain the option to reduce revenues through \n     tax reform and still have a mechanism to prevent unexpected \n     surplus revenues, once collected, from being used for any \n     purpose other than the debt reduction.\n       H.R. 4601 would give the Treasury flexibility to use its \n     debt reduction tools in the most effective manner. Surplus \n     revenues deposited in the Debt Reduction Account would remain \n     available until expended, but only for debt reduction. The \n     department would be able to schedule reverse auctions at the \n     most advantageous times, make funds available to brokers \n     buying back debt on the open markets, or decrease the size of \n     new debt issues--depending on which mechanism, or combination \n     of tools, proves most cost effective.\n\n\n                        how to improve h.r. 4601\n\n       Although H.R. 4601 demonstrates a real commitment of \n     members of the House to fiscal discipline, the legislation \n     could be improved. Congress should consider requiring the \n     Secretary of the Treasury also to deposit all revenue \n     received from the sale of Special Issue Treasury Bills (which \n     are sold only to the Social Security Administration) in the \n     Debt Reduction Account. This would preclude the possibility \n     of any future raids on the Social Security trust fund.\n       Congress should also consider adding language to H.R. 4601 \n     to automatically appropriate future real (rather than \n     projected) surplus revenues to the Debt Reduction Account. \n     This would allow Congress the flexibility to implement tax \n     reforms while also guaranteeing that surplus revenues, once \n     collected, could be used only for debt reduction.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Many Americans assume that if surplus revenues are not used \n     for spending or tax\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\n     cuts, they automatically reduce the national debt. Indeed, \n     this has become an unstated premise in discussions of fiscal \n     policy, whether in the press, academia, or Congress. \n     Unfortunately, the premise is incorrect.\n       To make the premise true, the Treasury Department should be \n     able to make specific provisions for retiring debt. If it is \n     not given the power and obligation to do so, the surplus \n     revenues accumulating in its operating cash accounts will be \n     subject to misuse by appropriators. Congress has an \n     opportunity and obligation to give the Treasury Department \n     the time and flexibility it needs to utilize its debt \n     management tools effectively when it considers H.R. 4601. \n     This bill offers an effective first step toward the goal of \n     making sure that budget surpluses do not disappear in new \n     spending programs.\n\n\n                       What Is the National Debt?\n\n       The national debt consists of Treasury notes, T-bills, and \n     savings bonds that were sold to raise cash to pay the ongoing \n     operational expenses of the federal government. National debt \n     held by the public consists of debt instruments sold to \n     anyone other than a federal trust fund, such as the Social \n     Security trust fund. Most federal debt held by the public is \n     owned by state and local governments, pension plans, mutual \n     funds, and individual retirement portfolios.\n       Most investors consider federal debt instruments to be cash \n     equivalents that pay interest, and they are strongly \n     motivated to hold them until maturity--up to 30 years in the \n     case of T-bills. Many institutional investors, particularly \n     pension funds, are required to maintain a certain portion of \n     their portfolio in cash equivalents, and they depend on the \n     federal government to issue new debt when their old \n     investments mature and are redeemed. In addition, many \n     lenders, particularly mortgage companies, use the market \n     price of federal debt instruments as a measurement device to \n     determine appropriate rates of return on alternative \n     investments. These lenders rely on the federal government to \n     maintain enough federal debt in circulation to make this \n     measurement valid.\n\n                                APPENDIX\n\n

Treasury.\n\n                                 Endnote\n\n       1. There is no way to know whether this particular debt \n     management tool is being used by the Treasury Department at \n     the time. If such knowledge were available, it would \n     demonstrate a lack of discretion that would make this tool \n     ineffective.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think Senator Voinovich is going to be \non the floor shortly. I would like to be briefed on what our time \nrestraints are. How much time do we have on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limitation. We have the usual \nunanimous consent agreement to recess at 12:30 for the policy \nluncheons.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Allard, in offering this amendment. It is an important \namendment if we are ever going to make a dent in our tremendous \nnational debt.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I am thrilled that the United States is in \nthe midst of the greatest economic expansion in the history of our \nnation. It has provided opportunity and prosperity for millions of \nAmericans.\n  However, even with all of our good fortune, we cannot ignore the \ntremendous debt that we owe, and we certainly cannot allow the booming \neconomy to blind us to this reality.\n  For nearly a year and a half now, Mr. President--throughout my \nservice in this body--I have made it my mission to remind my colleagues \nof the size of our national debt. Right now, the debt of the United \nStates of America stands at $5.7 trillion. Right now, it costs us more \nthan $224 billion a year to service that debt--which is more than $600 \nmillion a day in interest costs alone.\n  Thirteen cents out of every Federal dollar goes to pay interest on \nthe national debt, at a time when 16 cents goes for national defense, \n18 cents goes for nondefense discretionary spending and 53 cents goes \nfor entitlement spending. We currently spend more on interest to the \nnational debt than we spend on Medicare.\n  I agree with General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General \nDavid Walker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee last year, said:\n\n       This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future \n     generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today \n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  That is a wonderful quote.\n  We should also listen to other experts, such as CBO Director Dan \nCrippen, who, earlier this year, testified before the Senate Budget \nCommittee that ``most economists agree that saving the surpluses, \npaying down the debt held by the public, is probably\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nthe best thing that we can do relative to the economy.''\n  And then there is Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has \ntestified that ``my first priority would be to allow as much of the \nsurplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From an \neconomic point of view, that would be, by far, the best means of \nemploying it.''\n  Logic dictates that the money we are spending for our debt interest \npayments could be better spent elsewhere, and in my view--as well as \nthe experts' view--the sooner we can pay down that debt, the sooner we \nwill be able to use tax dollars where they are most needed.\n  In other words, if we pay down the debt and get rid of the interest, \nwe can use that money to reduce taxes or to address some of the \npriorities that we continue to talk about every day on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  That is why I believe our top fiscal priority should be reducing the \nnational debt. It is the best thing we could do with our on-budget \nsurplus. And as I have said a number of times on the Senate floor, if \nfamilies and businesses use their surplus cash to pay off debts, then \nour Nation should do the same thing.\n  If I have big credit card debt, or if I am in business and I owe \ndebt, and I have an opportunity to pay off that debt, most families and \nmost businesses would do so.\n  It is also interesting to note that if you look at the companies \ntoday on the New York stock exchange, the ones whose values have held \nup are those companies that do not have a substantial amount of debt. I \nthink we know that if families in America were in the same position we \nare in, they would pay off that debt and get rid of that interest cost.\n  The amendment that Senator Allard and I propose would take the first \nstep in putting us on a course of fiscal responsibility.\n  According to the latest estimates put forth by the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO), the United States is projected to achieve an on-\nbudget surplus of $26 billion in fiscal year 2000.\n  We are talking about fiscal year 2000 money. For my colleagues who \nwant to cut taxes, we are talking about the on-budget surplus for the \nyear 2000. We can't use it to reduce taxes. The only thing we can do \nwith it is to spend it or use it to pay down the debt. There is no \nother alternative. We have already set aside $14 billion in the budget \nresolution to pay for military operations in Kosovo, natural disaster \nrelief in the U.S., Colombian drug eradication assistance, and other \nsupplemental spending.\n  Under the Allard-Voinovich amendment, the remaining $12 billion on-\nbudget surplus would be applied towards debt reduction, not more \nspending. In addition, when the CBO releases its re-estimates of the FY \n2000 on-budget surplus in July, Senator Allard and I intend to offer \nanother amendment that will allocate any additional on-budget surpluses \nto debt reduction.\n  I remind my colleagues that this money can't be used to reduce taxes. \nIt can only be spent. We want to get it off the table before it is \nspent.\n  Of the $26 billion on-budget surplus that we have today, $22 billion \nof that is overpayment into Part A of Medicare. This extra money we \nhave is Medicare money that has been paid into Part A.\n  The concern that I have is if we don't pay down the national debt \nwith whatever on-budget surplus we achieve, Washington will spend the \nmoney. Ever since the CBO first projected we would have a budget \nsurplus back in 1998, Congress and the administration have looked for \nevery possible way to spend the money.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, if you include the supplemental \nappropriations, fiscal year 2000 discretionary spending will increase \nby $37 billion, a 6.4 percent increase over fiscal year 1999. When \ncompared to the Consumer Price Index, that is nearly three times the \nrate of inflation. This is tremendous growth in Government spending. We \nhave to stop it. We have to put a lid on our spending.\n  Our amendment strikes a fair balance that allows us to use a portion \nof the on-budget surplus for debt reduction instead of just spending \nthe entire on-budget surplus for the sake of spending. We have to show \ndiscipline and use our on-budget surplus to pay down our debts.\n  I am proud we have worked in the last couple of years in the Senate \nto rein in spending. I believe we must use whatever on-budget surplus \nthat we have to pay down the debt. When we reduce the national debt, we \nsend a positive signal to Wall Street and Main Street. Lowering the \ndebt encourages more savings and investment, the kind that fuels \nproductivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest \nrates, which is a real tax reduction. In addition, it ensures we won't \nreturn to deficit spending.\n  If we can't at this time with the economy booming do something about \nreducing the national debt, we will have missed a golden opportunity. \nWe will have said to the young people of this country: We don't care \nabout your future; we are going to let you pay for those things that we \nweren't willing to pay for or do without during the last number of \nyears.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I compliment the Senator from Ohio for his hard work on \nthis particular issue. It is a pleasure to work with the Senator on \nlooking at fair alternatives to pay down the debt. This is important to \nfuture Americans.\n  People ask, how will it affect me personally? If you buy a new car, \nthe Government is not competing with you for that money; or if you go \nto pay for college education, the Government is not competing with you \nfor that money; if you buy a home, the Government is not competing with \nyou for that money. It tends to hold down interest rates. That means it \ncosts less. It costs less to get a college education, costs less to pay \nfor your home, and it costs less to buy a new car.\n  It is important not only to the security of this country, but to \nAmericans individually.\n  I thank Senator Voinovich from Ohio for his steadfastness in fighting \nthis issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him and the other \ncosponsors on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this bill becomes effective on October 1 \nof this year. I am pleased to accept the amendment. It will affect the \nbudget surplus that is in effect at that time.\n  We accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3346) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3304, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: To set aside $43,000,000 for research, development, test and \n  evaluation for the extended range conventional air-launched cruise \n                   missile program of the Air Force)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I call amendment No. 3304 and send a \nmodification to the desk that I believe has been cleared by both sides, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself and \n     Mr. Bond, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Breaux, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3304, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 109 of the substitute, between lines 11 and 12, \n     insert the following:\n       Sec. 8126. Of the total amount appropriated by this Act for \n     the Air Force for research, development, test and evaluation, \n     up to $43,000,000 may be made available for the extended \n     range conventional air-launched cruise missile program of the \n     Air Force.\n\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is one of the amendments we have \nindicated, under the authority we received yesterday, Senator Inouye \nand I have modified, and, as modified, we are prepared to agree with \nthe Senator and ask for him to proceed on that basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his continuing \nsupport for this amendment and his continuing support for our national \ndefense. I also thank my cosponsors, Senators Bond, Conrad, Landrieu, \nand Breaux.\n  This amendment will provide an additional $23 million, bringing the \ntotal to $43 million, for the development of an extended-range cruise \nmissile, which is the successor to what is known as the CALCM, the \nConventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile.\n  The Defense authorization bill contains $86.1 million for this \nproject. This amendment increases the appropriation to half of the \nauthorized amount. According to the Air Force and their officials, this \nnew total, $43 million, is needed to start this program.\n  This cruise missile will be launched from the B-52 bomber to \naccurately strike strategic targets deep inside enemy territory without \nsignificant risk to our pilots or our planes. It will provide the Air \nForce its only air-launched, long-range, all-weather, precision weapon \nwith a range of over 600 miles. I believe this amendment has been \napproved by both sides, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir support.\n  It is important we have this kind of capacity. We have found that our \nability to have precision capacity for striking the enemy is very \nimportant to the maintenance of our own independence and the protection \nof our own fighting individuals in our Armed Forces. I am grateful for \nthe cooperation in this respect, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to offer with \nmy colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, an amendment which \nincreases the appropriation for a new, more advanced cruise missile for \nthe B-52 from $20 million to $43 million.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the B-52 is the sole carrier of the \nConventional Air Launched Cruise Missile [CALCM], a conventional \nvariant of the nuclear-capable Air Launched Cruise Missile [ALCM]. Our \nnation has relied on the CALCM in all recent conflicts and it has \nbecome the weapon of choice for theater commanders. The CALCM offers \nrange, payload, and accuracy that are superior to any other \nconventional stand-off munition in service today, including the Navy's \nTomahawk.\n  A year ago, as Operation Allied Force was underway, we had a \ntremendous problem. The United States had expended more than 200 CALCMs \nagainst Iraq and Yugoslavia and we had less than 100 remaining.\n  I asked the Pentagon what they were going to do about this situation \nand they recommended that we convert the remaining, ALCMs not needed by \nthe United States Strategic Command for nuclear missions to CALCMs. I \nwas pleased to work with the Air Force and the defense committees to \nsecure funding to do just that. Today, the remaining unneeded 322 ALCMs \nare being converted to CALCMs.\n  However, conversion will only give us around 400 CALCMs, and to meet \nfuture threats our nation will require around 1,000 of these missiles. \nIn May 1999 I was informed that there was no plan to make up the \nshortfall.\n  I went to Senators Warner and Levin, the chairman and ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee, and asked them to adopt my amendment \nrequiring the administration to come up with a plan to replace the \nCALCM. That amendment passed on May 27, 1999, and I was pleased to have \nmy friend from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, as an original cosponsor.\n  The result of the Air Force's study was inclusion in General Ryan's \nunfunded priority list of $86.1 million in fiscal year 2001 and $689.7 \nmillion throughout the future years defense plan for research and \ndevelopment and production of more than 600 extended range cruise \nmissiles (ERCMs), also referred to as extended range CALCMs (CALCM-\nERs). The ERCM will offer all of the advantages of the CALCM and \ndramatically extend its range, to beyond 1,000 miles.\n  I am pleased that both the Senate and House Defense authorization \nbills fully support General Ryan's request for $86.1 million in Fy01. \nHowever, the Senate Defense appropriations bill provides only $20 \nmillion and the House Defense appropriations bill includes no funding.\n  Consequently, I am very pleased that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member of \nthe Defense Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, have agreed to support the \namendment that Senator Ashcroft and I have brought to the floor today. \nThis amendment will increase the ERCM appropriation to $43 million, \nenough for the Air Force to begin work on this important program during \nthe coming fiscal year.\n  A quick start to ERCM program will ensure that the B-52 remains \nrelevant and our nation retains the capability to strike vital targets \nwith tremendous accuracy at long range in the coming years. I \nappreciate the cosponsorship of Senators Bond and Breaux and look \nforward to continuing to work with Senator Ashcroft, the Senate's \ndefense committees, and the Air Force to make the ERCM a reality.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member again for their support, and \nyield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3304), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, section 8118 of H.R. 4576, a bill making \nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2001, and for other purposes, refers to the National \nCenter for the Preservation of Democracy. What is the National Center \nfor the Preservation of Democracy? What is the rationale and purpose of \nthe National Center for the Preservation of Democracy?\n  I will do my best to respond to the above questions.\n  The history of America demonstrates the vision and intent of its \nFounding Fathers when framing the Constitution. As a living document \nthe Constitution has proven over time its capacity to meet the changing \nneeds of the United States, ensuring the protection of all of its \npeople. The story of Americans of Japanese ancestry represents a \ncomplete lesson of democracy in action and exemplifies the American \ndream. From immigration in the late 1800s, to issues of citizenship in \nthe early 1900s, to the incarceration of citizens and the heroics of \nJapanese-American soldiers during World War II, and to redress in the \n1980s, the Japanese-American story is about the struggles and victories \nof individual freedoms in the United States. Through their experiences, \nJapanese-Americans have validated all that is possible and all that is \nright with our constitutional guarantees. The Japanese-American story \ncelebrates the triumphs of American democracy.\n  The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be \nheadquartered in the renovated and transformed Historic Building of the \nJapanese-American National Museum in Los Angeles, CA. The Historic \nBuilding is a National Historic Landmark as designated by the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation. This space will keep alive and teach \nabout a remarkable time in U.S. history, a period of shame and \nsacrifice and insult that ended with a burst of glory demonstrating the \nmajesty of our government to recognize its errors and make a public \napology and some restitution.\n  The Japanese-American story illustrates the splendor of the United \nStates and the magnificence of the Constitution. Since their initial \nimmigration in the late nineteenth century, Japanese-Americans have \nbelieved\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nstrongly in the American dream and have sought to make America their \nhome. Although confronted by prejudice and discrimination, Japanese-\nAmericans have utilized that very democratic process in the spirit \nintended by the Framers of the Constitution. The story of Japanese-\nAmericans is about democracy in action.\n  Like other immigrants, Japanese journeyed to the United States \nseeking opportunity and dreams of a better life. From the moment they \narrived in the late nineteenth century, however, they were confronted \nwith social prejudice and discriminatory laws already in place. The \nNaturalization Act passed by Congress on March 26, 1790, which \nrestricted naturalization to ``free white men,'' was unavailable to \npersons of Japanese ancestry. Designated as ``aliens ineligible for \ncitizenship'' (the only racialized group so defined until 1952), \nJapanese immigrants were rendered as perpetual aliens, a condition that \nprevented their full enjoyment of life, liberty and property. \nNonetheless, the Issei--Japanese immigrants--courageously maintained \ntheir belief in America and moved forward to establish their new lives \nin the United States. More than that, through hard work and \nperseverance, Japanese enterprise prospered in the face of \nindifference.\n  Without citizenship, Japanese immigrants were subject to alien land \nlaws, which prohibited ownership of land by ``aliens ineligible for \ncitizenship.'' Although denied full participation as Americans, \nJapanese immigrants consistently sought, through non-violent legal \nefforts, to undo the intent of discriminatory laws through public \ncampaigns, litigation, and other peaceful strategies. Their hopes in \nbecoming citizens were further hindered, however, when on November 13, \n1922 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Ozawa case, definitively \nprohibiting Japanese immigrants from become naturalized citizens on the \nbasis of race. Moreover, the future of the Japanese in the United \nStates was further restricted when President Calvin Coolidge signed the \nImmigration Law of 1924, which was based on race and omitted Japanese \nfrom the quota system.\n  When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, America was \nstunned and angered. For Japanese Americans, who had been subject to \ndiscrimination because of their ancestry, the whole world turned dark. \nHowever, as the United States confronted the threat of fascism in Asia \nand Europe, American democracy itself was put to a challenge and, for \nJapanese Americans, it fell short. Because they ``looked like the \nenemy'' and were thought to be a military threat, 120,000 individuals \nof Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom were American born citizens, \nwere excluded from the West Coast, forcibly removed, and incarcerated \nin concentration camps. These prison camps were at first operated by \nthe Army, and then the War Relocation Authority. This event has become \nthe largest violation of constitutional rights in American history.\n  For Japanese-American males, the beginning of the war was especially \nhumbling and painful as the Selective Service designated them as, IV-C, \nenemy aliens. Although they were loyal to the United States, these \nAmerican born citizens were rendered ineligible to enlist in the armed \nservices. Nonetheless, when the government announced the formation of \nthe 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated unit of Japanese-\nAmericans, thousands of young Japanese-American men enthusiastically \nvolunteered to serve. Stigmatized by the classification as enemy \naliens, they were eager to prove their loyalty to the United States. \nGovernment officials were surprised by the overwhelming response. While \nfamily and friends were incarcerated behind barbed wire, the soldiers \nof the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, \nas well as the Military Intelligence Service fought and died for the \nUnited States and for the preservation of democracy with no guarantee \nthat their civil rights would be restored. There service demonstrates \nthe ultimate in patriotism and love of country.\n  In 223 days of combat, the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team became one of the most decorated units in United \nStates military history. Among the many awards and decorations received \nby the men of the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team are 20 Congressional Medals of Honor, 354 Silver Star \nMedals, 33 Distinguished Service Crosses and over 3600 Purple Heart \nMedals. Their distinguished record includes the rescue of the ``Lost \nBattalion'' and participation in the assault that cracked the Gothic \nLine of Nazi strongholds. Affirming the unending truth that loyalty to \none's nation is not modified by racial origin, these soldiers fought \ntwo wars, one for democracy overseas and the other for racial \ndiscrimination back home in the United States. As President Harry \nTruman said, ``You fought not only the enemy but you fought prejudice--\nand you have won.'' Indeed, these brave and courageous young men \nbelieved that their sacrifices would make life better not only for \nJapanese-Americans but for all Americans. The privileges of democracy \nthat Americans enjoy today are the result of the blood shed by these \nAmerican heroes. The sacrifices of officers and men of the 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team, the 100th Infantry Battalion, the Military \nIntelligence Service, and others have helped to make America a more \ndemocratic nation, and their valiant service continues to be a source \nof pride for all Americans.\n  In response to their heroic achievements, President Harry Truman \nchallenged ``Keep up the fight and we will continue to win and to \nassure that this republic stands for what the Constitution says it \nstands for: the welfare of all of the people, all of the time.'' Many \nmembers of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team took President Truman's \nwords to heart. Several soldiers went on to fight for democracy through \ntheir service as elected officials while others continued to serve in \nthe armed forces. Eventually Japanese-Americans went on to fight in the \nKorean War and later the Vietnam War. Unlike Japanese-American soldiers \nduring World War II who, after being designated as ``enemy aliens,'' \nserved to prove their loyalty, Japanese-American soldiers in the Korean \nwar and the Vietnam war served in the Armed Forces as Americans, full-\nfledged citizens of the United States. Without the need to prove their \nstatus as Americans, the reason for these courageous men to serve was \npurely for the love of country.\n  Inevitably, the impact of the heroic service of Japanese-American \nsoldiers during World War II went on to enhance the civil liberties of \nall Americans. In 1948, segregation in the armed services ended in \nlarge part from the efforts of the 442nd and in 1952 the Walter-\nMcCarran Act made all races eligible for naturalization and eliminated \nrace as a bar to immigration. Thus, Japanese immigrants, many of whom \nwere parents of World War II veterans, were able to finally attain \ntheir citizenship as Americans.\n  One of the more magnificent examples of American democracy at its \nmost powerful form is the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, \nsigned into law by President Ronald Reagan, in which the United States \nrecognized its grave and fundamental injustice of violating the civil \nliberties of its own citizens. Advanced by many Japanese-American war \nveterans, the law makes a formal apology and provides token restitution \nto former internees. No other country in the world can make the claim \nof acknowledging and apologizing for its mistakes--a point that further \nillustrates the grand majesty of the United States. More importantly, \nto demonstrate its commitment of assuring that similar events do not \nhappen, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 provided funds to educate all \nAmericans about the lessons from the incarceration.\n  While $50 million was authorized in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 \nfor educational purposes, the appropriations were significantly reduced \nbecause of the lack of funds available to pay the eligible individual \nclaimants. The Civil Liberties Public Education Fund received only $5 \nmillion to fulfill its congressional mandate to educate the public \nabout the lessons learned from the incarceration. With limited funding, \nthe education of the exclusion, forced removal, and incarceration of \nJapanese-Americans during World War II was dramatically compromised and \nthe government's commitment to educating the public has yet to be \neffectively fulfilled. The National Center\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nfor the Preservation of Democracy established in the Historic Building \nof the Japanese-American National Museum will achieve that objective.\n  Through their efforts since the late 19th century, Japanese-Americans \nhave secured the civil rights of all Americans, contributing to the \nmost basic tenets of America's foundational ideals and promises--of \nlife, liberty, and property. Although clearly denied many of those \nfreedoms at various times throughout history, Japanese-Americans \nconsistently sought, through non-violent legal efforts, to secure \nConstitutional guarantees and the promise of the American dream. With \nthat, they deepened and enriched the meaning of the American identity--\nthe notion of who is an American--and the rights, privileges, and \nobligations that comprise the Republic's very core.\n  The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be \nassisted by the Japanese-American National Museum in the examination of \nthe rights and freedoms of Americans in the United States through the \nJapanese-American experience. Because its mission is dedicated to the \nstudy, preservation, and interpretation of democratic issues, the \nNational Museum maintains extensive expertise that will enable the \nNational Center for the Preservation of Democracy to:\n  Develop and exhibit nationwide programs about the issues of \ndemocracy;\n  Have ready access to significant collections relating to these \nissues, especially the legacy of Japanese-American military service, \nincluding artifacts of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and other \nmilitary units;\n  Benefit from the relationships established and maintained by the \nNational Museum, especially with federal institutions and related \ncommunity organizations; and\n  Provide a dynamic visitor experience in a historic building.\n  The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will be created \nas a dedicated space where visitors can learn about the enduring \nfragility and ultimate success of individual and constitutional rights. \nThe headquarters will be established in a renovated and transformed \nhistoric building provided by the Japanese American National Museum.\n  Some of the historical highlights of the building, which was \nconstructed in 1925, include:\n  Served as the first Buddhist temple in Southern California and as a \ncenter for social and religious life for the immigrant community;\n  Site where priests, who lived in the building, were arrested without \ndue cause immediately following the bombing of Pearl Harbor;\n  Used as one of the sites where the Army instructed ``aliens and non-\naliens of Japanese ancestry to assemble for transportation to Santa \nAnita Racetrack, which had been transformed into an Assembly Center;\n  Served as a storage site for personal articles that could not be \ntaken by those forced to leave; and\n  Served as a hostel for many returning from camp and had no where to \ngo.\n  The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will provide \neducational programming that includes exhibitions, media arts \npresentations, public programs, conferences, and civic dialogue/public \nforums. The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy will:\n  Present a permanent, audience-focused exhibition addressing American \ndemocracy through the Japanese-American experience, including the \nmilitary service of Japanese-Americans (in World War I, World War II, \nthe Korean war, and the Vietnam war);\n  Maintain and pursue key civil and military materials for a \ncomprehensive collection;\n  Create and esttablish new opportunities for civil and military \nresearch, especially through collaboration with federal institutions \nsuch as the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution to make \ndocuments more accessible;\n  Conduct education and public programs examining democracy in action; \nand\n  Produce educational media arts productions that present and interpret \nrelated issues of democracy for broad national and international \nbroadcast and distribution as well as for on-site exhibitions.\n  I respectfully believe that the National Center for the Preservation \nof Democracy is most worthy of our support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the pending business is the \nBoxer amendment, with 4 minutes equally divided\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the chairman for his graciousness. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote affirmatively on this. I hope we can get a very \noverwhelming vote.\n  My amendment simply protects children at the Department of Defense \nhousing or playgrounds, day-care facilities, schools, from poisonous \nand toxic materials. It is consistent with the DOD guidelines. Frankly, \nit seems to me we should all support it. Basically, the guidelines say \nthey will stay away from these poisons when they do routine spraying.\n  We ought to codify this because there is a little bit of ambiguity. I \nam very proud of the Department of Defense in so many areas that deal \nwith children. For example, child care centers at the Department of \nDefense are the best in the world, truly, and certainly are a model for \nso many other child care centers in our country. However, it did take \nsome horrible mistakes before that was straightened out. We don't want \nto have a horrible mistake, a mistaken spraying. We want to make sure \nit is done right.\n  I am very pleased that the EPA is supporting this amendment. They \nhelped with it. We spoke a number of times with Colonel Driggers who \nsaid he believed this was, in fact, consistent with the DOD written \nguidelines. It could be that they would rather not have us do this. I \nthink it would be good for this Senate to go on record stating that for \nroutine spraying against pests in these areas, let's use the less toxic \nmaterials. If there is an emergency, an outbreak of something horrible \nsuch as encephalitis, we make room for that. We certainly have a clear \nexception in emergency situations. We are talking about routine \nsituations.\n  We have seen Administrator Browner, with bipartisan support, ban some \nof the very harsh pesticides. I think we can work very well together in \na bipartisan way to stop the routine spraying of these dangerous \ntoxins.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last evening I did offer to accept this \namendment. It does have some problems, and in conference we will try to \nwork out those problems.\n  I do believe that the use of pesticides approved by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should be assured so that military \nchildren and those on military bases can have the same protections, \nprotecting the food supplies of the commissaries and populated \nfacilities on a military base. I think the preparation of homes, for \ninstance, before they are occupied certainly requires the type of \nspraying approved by the EPA.\n  We will make certain there is full protection for those in the \nmilitary. As I understand it, this is an amendment that is designed to \nprevent the use of the pesticides that would not be subject to approval \nby the EPA. I intend to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, we are awaiting the offering of other \namendments on the Defense appropriations bill. There is no order, as I \nunderstand it, agreed upon between the leaders for another amendment to \nbe offered at this time. So for any Senator who has an amendment to \nthis bill, this is a good time to come and offer the amendment. We can \nhave a debate on it.\n  The leadership has announced--at least the Republican leader has \nannounced he wants to complete action on this bill tonight. To do that, \nwe are going to have to make progress with the amendments. There are \nseveral pending amendments on both sides. So we urge Senators to come \nand cooperate with the managers of the bill so we can dispose of this \nlegislation by the end of this session tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have done a pretty good job on our \nside of the aisle. We literally only have a handful of amendments left. \nI think you should spend more time urging Members on your side of the \naisle. We only have one amendment that is going to take any amount of \ntime. The Senator offering that amendment has been tied up in hearings \nall day and has been unavailable.\n  Senator Boxer has offered three amendments. She has said she will be \nback in an hour to offer her last one. As I say, we have just a few \namendments. So I think if you can get rid of a lot on your side, we \nmight be able to make some more progress. We are literally down to \nmaybe seven or eight amendments on our side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his explanation \nand his cooperation with the managers in the handling of the bill. We \nare equal opportunity expediters here. We want to expedite action on \nboth sides of the aisle. I am sure the Senator understands that.\n  So we are working hard to try to get Senators to come to the floor \nnow to continue the presentation of amendments, if they have them, on \nthe bill.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The total amount appropriated by title III for \n     procurement is hereby reduce by $1,000,000,000.\n       (b) There is hereby appropriated for the Department of \n     Education for the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2001, \n     $922,000,000 to enable the Secretary of Education to award \n     grants under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this Defense appropriations bill before \nus is a $3 billion increase over the administration's request. It is \nalmost $20 billion more than we appropriated last year. Although for \nthe past 2 years we have been focused on the readiness crisis--I think \nan important focus--the largest increase this year is not for personnel \nor operations or maintenance but for the procurement of weapons. This \nbill increases the amount of money for procurement of weapons almost 11 \npercent over last year. Let me just remind my colleagues that at the \nend of the cold war, a somewhat different era, this appropriations \naltogether is 2.5 times the military budgets of Russia and China and \nthe six countries deemed to be the greatest threats to our Nation.\n  At a time when others recognize that the potential military threats \nto national security have declined dramatically, we have not. At a time \nwhen others want to put more emphasis on not just military readiness, \nwhich we must have, but other diplomatic solutions, multilateral \nefforts, we have not.\n  What I am doing in this amendment altogether is calling for a \ntransfer across the board from this additional money for procurement, \nthe 11-percent increase--a budget, again, that is $3 billion above what \nthe President himself requested. I am saying we ought to take about \n$922 million, not quite $1 billion --I am trying to keep this amendment \nconsistent with budgetary rules--and transfer that to education for \nkids. It is not a lot of money, but it would make a huge difference. \nPart of what I am talking about is basically a transfer of a little \nless than $1 billion from the Pentagon to the Department of Education, \nspecifically focused on the title I program.\n  By transferring to title I this $1 billion, which ends up to be about \n$922 million after taking into account the costs of this reduction, \nthis amendment is one step toward restoring some Federal funding for \neducation that I think is very consistent with the definition of \nnational security.\n  I define national security as, for sure, military readiness. But I \nalso define national security as the security of our local communities. \nThat includes making sure we do the very best by our children. That \nincludes making sure that we as a nation do everything we can to live \nup to our national vow of equal opportunity for every child.\n  This amendment is all about our priorities. I look at the budget and \nI see a mismatch between some of our national ideals and goals in the \nspeeches we give of what we say we care about and our actual spending \npriorities. The Senate committee reported out an education bill that \nwould increase overall appropriations for education by $4.65 billion \nfrom fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001. At the same time, the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill increased spending by $20 \nbillion-- Education, $4.65 billion; Department of Defense, $20 billion.\n  We lead the world in our spending on defense, which is fine, but at \nthe same time, we rank tenth in the world when it comes to education \nspending. Over the past 20 years, the Department of Education share of \nthe Federal budget has shrunk from 2.5 to 2 percent. During the same \ntime, the Federal share of education dollars has shrunk from 12 cents \nto 7 cents on the dollar. This is not the direction in which we need to \nbe moving.\n  People we represent in our States are focused on education. They \nthink we ought to be doing better. I understand full well, I say to my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, much of K-12 is State government \nspending. But we can be and should be a real player in certain decisive \nareas. We should be putting much more into early childhood development \nso children come to kindergarten ready to learn. We should be doing \nmuch better by way of funding the IDEA program. There is probably not a \nschool board or school district in the country that does not believe \nthis is an unfunded mandate, where they are called upon to meet \nchildren's special needs or called upon to support children with \nspecial needs but they do not get the Federal funding to which they are \nentitled.\n\n  The other critical program is the title I program. Actually, there is \nnot a more important program than title I. We had an amendment to \ndouble the authorization for title I, part A, to $15 billion. Senator \nHarkin was one of the leaders on that. It passed the HELP committee \nwith the support of every Democrat and every Republican Senator, but I \nthink we were only able to raise the appropriation by several million \ndollars, as I remember it, I say to my colleague Senator Harkin.\n  I want to transfer $1 billion to the title I program, and I want to \ntalk about why. But first of all, when it comes to our priorities, when \nit comes to our commitment to education as opposed to just a commitment \non the Pentagon budget, let me remind my colleagues, in a recent \nbipartisan poll: 60 percent of the American people say we spend too \nlittle on education; 40 percent of the people in our country say \neducation should be the top funding priority in this year's budget; 75 \npercent of the American people say they would be willing to pay higher \ntaxes to improve education; and 83 percent of Americans say we should \nequalize funding across districts, even if it means we should transfer \nfunds from wealthy to poor districts.\n  It is absolutely amazing, the support that is out there. The title I \nprogram is a key investment, and we ought to be doing much better. \nTitle I provides assistance to students who face the greatest \neducational barriers. They are the students whose parents have not had \nthe educational opportunities or the luck in their life that many of us \nhave had. Many of their parents are illiterate. Many of the parents of \nthe students are poor. These are the students struggling to meet \nacademic challenges. These are the children, the most vulnerable \nchildren, who need and deserve the support. Title I is used to fund the \ntypes of programs for these kids, for just such youth. We know they \nwork.\n  As an example, 100 percent of major city schools use title I funds to \nprovide professional development and new technology for students. We \nhave been saying on the floor of the Senate and back in our States that \nthe most important thing we can do to improve education is to have good \nteachers. That also includes good teachers for these children who are \nin the title I program.\n  We have been talking about the digital divide. We have been saying it \nis not right that in this country, those school districts, those \nwealthy communities, can be wired; they have access to the best \ntechnology. Those students will be equipped and they will be ready to \ndo well. Students who come from poor districts and come from lower-\nincome families, in those lower-income districts with less property \nwealth, they do not have access to this kind of technology. Title I \nmoney is used for that. Mr. President, 97 percent of the major city \nschools use title I money to support afterschool activities.\n  We have been through this debate. You can go to any neighborhood. I \ndo\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nnot think, I say to Senator Harkin, it is just in the cities. I think \nit also applies to the smaller towns and rural communities. You can \ntalk to the religious community; You can talk to the law enforcement \ncommunity; You can talk to parents; You can talk to teachers; You can \ntalk to support staff; You can talk to youth workers; They will all \nsay: We need to have some positive programs and activity and support \nfor kids after school, especially when many of them go home and both \nparents are working. We need to do that. Ninety percent of these \nschools use title I funds to support family, literacy and summer school \nprograms, and 68 percent use title I funds to support preschool \nprograms. Title I has shown some strong success, despite its \nunderfunding.\n\n  I point out to my colleagues that this amendment is a matter of \npriorities.\n  Again, there is an 11-percent increase in procurement, $3 billion \nmore in this budget than the administration even asked. I am not \ntalking about readiness programs. I am talking about a different world \nin which we live. When are we going to reorder some of our priorities \nand put just a little bit more of this investment in our children? When \nare we going to do better by children in our country?\n  Right now this title I program--which can be so important for \neducational development, can be so important in making sure these kids \nget the help they need, can be so important in making sure their \nparents become literate so they can help them read at home, can be so \nimportant for afterschool programs, can be so important in trying to \nmake sure that when these kids come to kindergarten they are ready to \nlearn--right now we fund the title I program at a 30-percent level. \nThat is to say, over 70 percent of the kids who could benefit do not \nbenefit because there is no money. In my State of Minnesota, in our \ncities, after you get to schools that do not have 65 percent of the \nkids who are low income but only have 60 percent of the kids who are \nlow income, they do not get title I money whatsoever because we have \nrun out of funds.\n  Yet consider this: The largest gains in test scores over the past 30 \nyears have been made by poor and minority students. One-third to one-\nhalf the gap between affluent whites and their poor minority \ncounterparts has closed during this time--again because of the special \nhelp from the title I program.\n  A study by the Rand Corporation linked these gains to title I and \nother investments in these programs that give these kids more \nassistance. The final report of the ``National Assessment of Title I'' \nby the U.S. Department of Education showed that the NEAP, National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, scores for 9-year-olds in the \nNation's highest poverty schools have increased over the past 10 years \nby 9 points in reading and 8 points in math. The Council of Greater \nCity Schools shows that 24 of the Nation's largest schools were able to \ndecrease the number of fourth grade title I students achieving in the \nlowest quartile by 14 percent in reading and 10 percent in math in part \ndue to the support of title I dollars.\n  In my State of Minnesota, for example, the Brainerd Public School \nDistrict has a 70- to 80-percent success rate in accelerating students \nin the bottom 20 percent of their class to the average of their class \nfollowing 1 year of title I-supported reading programs.\n  This is a successful program that directs resources to the poorest \nschool districts in America. Forty-six percent of title I funds go to \nthe poorest 15 percent of all schools in our country, according to a \nGAO report. Seventy-five percent of title I funds go to schools where \nthe majority of children are poor, according to the U.S. Department of \nEducation report.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that title I has increased \nfunding to schools serving poor children by 77 percent, and yet we fund \nthis at about one-third of the level that is needed and it is \nunconscionable.\n  Yesterday I was in New York City. I went to a school, P.S. 30, in the \nMott Haven community in the south Bronx, one of the poorest communities \nin the United States of America. I went there because I have such great \nrespect for the work of Jon Kozol. Jon Kozol wrote a book called \n``Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a \nNation.'' Now he has written another book, ``Ordinary Resurrections.'' \nIt is a book full of hope. It is about three children and it is about \nthis special school. The principal's name is Miss Rosa, Aida Rosa, who \ncame from Puerto Rico 3 years ago. Her friends keep telling her to \nretire, but this woman will not give up on these children.\n\n  When one visits such a school, part of the trip is inspiring and part \nof it is indignation swelling inside, which is why I am here.\n  It is inspiring that Miss Rosa will not give up on these kids. I say \nto my colleagues, not one child in the classes I visited was white. Not \none child I met comes from a family with an income over $10,000 a year. \nThere are families in America--maybe some of our families--who spend \nthat much on one vacation. These children come from families with \nincomes of less than $10,000 a year. They are Latino Latina. They are \nAfrican American. They are poor. About 30 percent of these children \nsuffer from asthma. One can see the pumps they carry because they have \nthese asthma attacks. Thirty to 35 percent of these children suffer \nfrom asthma. It is no wonder. There is an incinerator a block away. The \nair is so polluted. This happens in a lot of poor communities.\n  Miss Rosa does not give up on these children, the teachers do not \ngive up on these children, and Jonathan Kozol does not give up on these \nchildren. My point is it is inspiring, but these children could do much \nbetter if we would get the resources to the schools.\n  In my state of Minnesota, it is the same thing with Jackson \nElementary School in St. Paul. I can think of elementary schools, \njunior high schools, and high schools I have visited. I visit a school \nevery 2 weeks in my State. Over and over what these teachers say and \nwhat these principals say is: We are doing our best. Do not give up on \nany of these children. We know what works. We make sure when these \nchildren come to school they know they are loved. We hold them to high \nstandards and expect them to do well. Never give up on them. Make sure \nthat teachers are free to teach, and make sure we have an environment \nthat emphasizes education and does not sell one child short.\n  We sell these children short. I do not understand our priorities. I \ndo not understand why our commitment to education is such a small \npercentage of our Federal budget.\n  I do not understand how we can take a program such as the title I \nprogram--which is so important for low-income children and could make \nsuch a positive difference in their lives, would get more resources to \nsome of these schools and some of these men and women who are teachers \nand principals and should be famous for the work they do--and fund it \nat a 30-percent or 35-percent level. I do not think it does any harm to \nwho we are or what we are about as a nation to take less than $1 \nbillion out of the procurement budget across the board and put it into \nthe title I program.\n  We ourselves, as I said, in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, voted to double the amount of money for title I. \nYet we barely added any additional dollars to this critically important \nprogram.\n  The Nation's poorest schools are dramatically underfunded, they are \ndramatically understaffed, and they are dramatically under resourced. \nTitle I helps get some of those resources to these communities. If \ntitle I was fully funded, Minnesota would receive about $160 million \nmore to educate needy students and almost 240,000 more students could \nbe served. I am on the floor of the Senate to fight for these children \nin my State. Whatever the final vote is, if I can speak for a program \nthat could make a difference in the lives of 240,000 more students in \nthe State of Minnesota who are low-income kids, then I am going to do \nso, whether there is 1 vote for this amendment or whether there are 100 \nvotes for this amendment.\n\n  I do not understand our priorities. Whatever happened to our national \nvow of equal opportunity for every child? How can we be talking today \nabout how we are going to have tests and we are going to hold everybody \naccountable, but we do not make sure these children have the same \nopportunity to do well on these tests?\n  Why are we not investing in the achievement and the future of all the\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\nchildren in our country? It is heartbreaking to visit these schools. It \nis inspiring but, at the same time, I come back to the Senate and say \nto myself: What can I do? When I visit these schools and meet these \nkids in any given class--yesterday I said to a lot of the teachers, to \nMiss Rosa, and others in the Mott Haven community in south Bronx, New \nYork City: In the State of Minnesota--they did not believe it--in the \ncities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, we have many of the same \npopulations.\n  The majority of our students are not white, Caucasian. In any given \nclass, kids come from homes where different languages are spoken. Four \nor five different languages are spoken in the homes from which these \nkids come. There are some 90 different languages and dialects that are \nspoken in children's homes in Minneapolis and 70 in St. Paul. These \nchildren are also disproportionately low income, and they need the \nadditional support if they are going to make it. It would seem to me we \nought to make sure of that.\n  I am heavily influenced by the work of Jonathan Kozol. I love \nJonathan's work over the years. He said something in his book that I am \ngoing to say on the floor of the Senate in my own words because I do \nthis all the time. I will come to the floor of the Senate, and I will \nsay: Come on, less than $1 billion to the title I program, which is so \nunderfunded in all of our States and, I say to my colleague from \nMontana, the rural communities.\n  I made a big mistake of not talking about greater Minnesota or rural \nAmerica. We do not have the funding. Every teacher and every \neducational assistant and every principal and every parent who cares \nabout education in these communities will tell you they do not have the \nfunding and that we should do better.\n  But here is my point today. I could come out here on the floor and \nsay: With this additional money for title I, if we make the investment \nin these children, who are, by definition, low-income children, then we \nwill save money later on because fewer of them will drop out of \nschool--and that is true--and we will save money because fewer of them \nwill turn to alcohol and drugs--and that is true--and we will save \nmoney because they will be more economically successful and more \nproductive--and that is true--and we will save money by investing a \nlittle more money in the title I program because fewer of these \nchildren will wind up dropping out of school and ending up in prison--\nand that is true. But you want to know something. We ought to spend \nthis additional money, $1 billion, or a little less than $1 billion, in \ntitle I for another reason: Many of these children are little children; \nThey are under 4 feet tall, and we should be nice to them. We should \ncare about them. We should get some resources into these schools, even \nif it is not in our self-interest. We should do it because it is the \nright thing to do. That is why we should do this.\n\n  Forget all the arguments about investment and how it will help our \neconomy. I came out here earlier and said: We should consider this in a \nnational security framework. No. I scratch everything I said, though \nkeeping it in the Congressional Record. We should transfer this small \namount of money from this Pentagon budget to the title I program \nbecause we should care about these children. We should care about them. \nWe should be nice to them. We should want them to do well.\n  Many of them come from neighborhoods with some pretty difficult \ncircumstances in their lives. I say to my colleagues, you might have \nwanted to spend a little time in the Mott Haven community yesterday. It \nis incredible, some of the difficult conditions in which children not \nonly survive but flourish. Why don't we just give them a little more \nassistance?\n  I really believe this is an important amendment. I want to again \nsummarize for my colleagues a little bit of what I am trying to say. \nAgain, please remember that it is one thing to talk about a readiness \ncrisis. The big increase was in procurement. Less than a $1 billion cut \nin procurement is hardly anything when it comes to the Pentagon budget. \nThis appropriations bill is $3 billion more than the administration's \nbudget request.\n  This year, the education bill has an overall appropriation for \neducation of $4.65 billion--an increase. At the same time, the Pentagon \nbudget goes up $20 billion.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, I think this is an important \namendment. All of us know of the title I program. All of us know the \ndifference it can make in children's lives. All of us say we care about \nthese children. This is an opportunity to basically match our vote with \nour rhetoric. This is, I will admit, a reordering-of-priorities \namendment on a small scale because, after all, this is $3 billion the \nadministration didn't want. This bill is close to $300 billion. Can't \nwe take $1 billion of this and do a little bit better by way of title \nI?\n  I will not end my remarks because I want to wait to hear what my \ncolleagues say. But I will kind of finish up this part of my statement \nwith a point that I do not like to make but I believe strongly about. \nSo I am going to do it. I will say, some of my colleagues that I see on \nthe floor--Senator Inouye and Senator Burns--and Senator Inouye I \nespecially believe I know well and know what he cares about--I do not \nthink this applies to either one of my colleagues, regardless of how \nthey vote; it can't because I know what Senator Inouye, in particular, \nis about. But, in general--so let me say this is not exactly just in \nrelation to this amendment--I find that people in politics, in both \nparties, will relish having a chance to have a photo taken of them \nreading with a child. We are all for the children, and we say they are \n100 percent of our future, but we are a dollar short when it comes to \nmaking the investment in their lives.\n\n  In particular, the unfinished agenda is poor children in America. It \nis incredible, but we have some 14 million poor children in our country \ntoday with its booming economy. Many of them, disproportionately, are \nof color. Many of them are in our inner cities. Some are in our inner \nsuburbs, and some are in our rural areas. Many of the parents of these \nchildren didn't have the money to put them into the best developmental \nchild care. They didn't have the great prekindergarten teachers. Some \nchildren did. And their parents--a single parent or both parents--are \nboth working long hours. They don't have the money.\n  They can't spend $10,000, $12,000, $14,000 a year for great child \ncare. They come to kindergarten behind. They have not had some of the \nbenefits that come from a family where your parents have more of an \neducation and a much higher income. But you want to know something. I \nsaw it yesterday in P.S. 30. I saw it yesterday in the Mott Haven \ncommunity. I see it in Minnesota. Those children have the most \nbeautiful eyes. They have the greatest determination. They are full of \nexcitement and they are full of hope. They believe in the American \ndream, even though they never say it that way. By the time they are in \nhigh school, most of it is gone. I think we ought to be doing better. I \nthink these children ought to figure into our priorities.\n  We all know the title I program is vastly underfunded. It is an \nembarrassment. Can't we at least put another $922 million in this next \nyear? Can't we do a little bit better by these children?\n  Mr. President, for now, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS.

(a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended for the purchase or modification \n     of high mobility trailers for the Army before the Secretary \n     of the Army has determined that the trailers have been \n     thoroughly tested as a system with the High Mobility \n     Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles that tow the trailers, satisfy \n     the applicable specifications, are safe and usable, do not \n     damage the vehicles that tow the trailers, and perform the \n     intended functions satisfactorily.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     obligated or expended for the modification of Army High \n     Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles to tow trailers before \n     the Secretary of the Army has determined that, with respect \n     to the towing of trailers, the vehicles have been thoroughly \n     tested as a system, satisfy the applicable specifications, \n     are safe and usable, are not damaged by the towing of the \n     trailers, and perform the intended functions satisfactorily.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proposing a very simple amendment. \nAll it says is the Department of Defense thoroughly test its trailers \nand the trucks that pull them before they spend more money to modify \nthem or to buy new ones.\n  I understand there is a rule XVI point of order against the \namendment. So I will ask that it be withdrawn. But I wanted to take the \ntime to at least let Senators know about and become aware of a very \ninteresting problem in the Department of Defense which I think is \nindicative of some larger problems that we have in terms of testing and \nmaking sure that our weapons systems actually work before we spend our \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars to buy them.\n  For the next several minutes, I would like to tell the story of the \nArmy trailers and why this amendment basically just says we ought to \ntest them to make sure they work before we buy them.\n  You would think this would be common sense. But 6,550 trailers that \nthe Army has purchased for more than $50 million are sitting in storage \nright now. That is right, 6,550 trailers are now in storage because the \nArmy never bothered to make sure they worked. The fact is that this \namendment, which I think is necessary, says a lot about how waste and \nabuse continues to thrive at the Pentagon. I get nervous about some of \nthese skyrocketing procurement budgets when I think about how some of \nthe money gets thrown away. Let's go through the story of the trailers.\n  Most of what I am about to relate is in a GAO report, which I \nrequested last year and which was published last year.\n  In the 1980s, the Pentagon decided it needed some trailers. I am \ntalking about trailers that you load up with equipment, goods and \nstuff, and you pull them behind a truck. In 1980, the Pentagon decided \nthat it needed some trailers for its high mobility multipurpose wheeled \nvehicles, otherwise known to all of us as humvees. That is all these \nare--trailers to be pulled behind some all-terrain trucks. I wouldn't \nthink that would be too difficult. The Army found that the older M101 \ntrailers they had were unstable with the humvees. So they set out to \nbuy some new trailers. In 1993, they signed a contract for $50.6 \nmillion to buy 7,563 new trailers.\n  In 1995, after a couple of years, they tested the trailers and found \na serious problem. The trucks, as it turns out, were never designed to \npull trailers. When they tested the trailers, the rear crossmembers of \nthe trucks tended to crack. They refer to this as ``catastrophic \nfailure.'' Despite this problem of the trucks' rear crossmembers \ncracking, the Army decided that the trailers had successfully completed \ntesting.\n  You may wonder: How could that possibly be? Well, it was because they \nmet the contract performance requirements. Mind you, they didn't work. \nThey destroyed the trucks that pulled them. But they met the contract \nperformance requirements. So the Army agreed to pay the contractor for \nthe trailers and to pay for the modifications that would be needed. You \nwould think in the contract specifications they would have said that \nthe trailers should not damage the trucks pulling them. But evidently \nthey didn't.\n  Then in late 1996, the Army faced a dilemma. The contractor was more \nthan a year behind schedule in delivering them, and the Department \ndecided not to buy more trailers in fiscal year 1997--not because they \ndidn't work, which they didn't, but because they said they were now a \nlower priority.\n  In the contract that the Army negotiated, there was an escape clause \nwhich provided that during the fourth and fifth years, if the Army \ndidn't want any more trailers, all they had to do was pay $1 million in \nliquidated damages and they would be out of the contract. Did the Army \npay the $1 million and get out of the old contract? No. They \nrenegotiated the contract and extended it another year. Not only that \nbut the Army also agreed to pay the increased costs of the contractor \nand agreed also to increase the profit margin of the contractor in \nspite of the poor performance of these trailers. The net result was a \n57-percent increase in the cost of the trailers. Instead of getting the \n7,563 trailers for $50.6 million, which was agreed upon in the \ncontract, the Army ended up getting 6,700 trailers for $57 million--$6 \nmillion more for 900 fewer trailers.\n  That is not the end of it. From there, the story continues downhill.\n  In 1997, the Army modified the truck crossmembers--the one that was \ncracking all the time, and the bumpers--so the trucks could pull the \ntrailers. But as they were modifying the truck, the trailer drawbar \nbroke. They discovered that the drawbar design had no margin of safety; \nit bent every time the humvee went over a bump. Nonetheless, since the \nArmy had already accepted the design, the Army figured it was their own \nproblem and they let the contractor off the hook.\n  The Army continued to accept more of these trailers that they \ncouldn't use. They couldn't use them. So the contractor kept making \nthem and the Army kept accepting them; and they just put them in \nstorage.\n  In 1998, they tested the trailers a third time with a new steel \ndrawbar.\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\n But now they found that the new, stiffer drawbar damaged the brakes on \nthe trailers and again damaged the trucks.\n  In 1999, they made more modifications and tested the trailers a \nfourth time. Again, the trailers didn't work. Meanwhile, the units \nstill don't have the trailers they have needed for more than a decade.\n  Now, the Army thinks they finally have the solution. They will use \nthe steel drawbar on the trailers. They will install a more durable \nbrake actuator on the trailers, and they will modify the trucks with \nreinforcement for this towing pintle. But they haven't even tested \nthese modifications yet. So they don't even know if they will work.\n  Furthermore, their ``conservative cost estimate'' for the \nmodification is $22 million.\n  Let's add it up. We were going to pay $50 million. We have already \npaid $57 million. Now we are going to pay $22 million on top of that. \nThat would pay to modify only 6,700 trucks, one for each of the \ntrailers.\n  I can only assume that the Army does not want to dedicate a truck for \neach trailer. That means the Army will have to modify all 19,564 trucks \nthat are in the units to get the trailers. The 22 million they want is \nonly for 6,700 trucks. But they are going to need another 13,000 trucks \nmodified.\n\n  So are we looking at another $44 million, maybe another $50 million \non top of it? I don't think they will dedicate one truck to each \ntrailer. That would be foolish. I don't think we are through with the \nprice increases yet. Somewhere down the line, the Army says, they will \nneed another 18,412 high mobility trailers on top of the 6,700 they \nalready have.\n  This is a story of mismanagement, a story of misprocurement, a story \nof whacky contracts, a story of piling one mistake upon another, a \nstory of letting contractors off the hook, all at the expense of \ntaxpayers and the expense of readiness and mobility for our troops in \nthe field.\n  My amendment simply requires that before we dump more money down this \nrathole, before we modify the trailers and trucks or buy more trailers, \nwe test them. We test the final product to see if it will meet the \nrequirements for the all-terrain vehicles that are pulling them. We \nshould make sure that they work, that they are safe, that they don't \ndamage the truck, and that they can perform their intended mission.\n  I don't know when the end is in sight. We have already spent $57 \nmillion. They want another $22 million. That is $79 million. If they \nare going to modify all the trucks, we are probably looking at another \n$44 million on top of that, and they say they want 18,000 more of them. \nI don't know if there is an end in sight. Whether $57 million or $79 \nmillion or $100 million, that may not in a $300 billion budget for \ndefense seem to be a lot but it is a lot of money to me. It is a lot of \nmoney to the taxpayers in my home State of Iowa.\n  I am afraid it is a symptom of a larger problem. If we cannot design \na simple trailer that works, and test it adequately, how can we expect \nto build an advanced fighter plane that works or a missile defense that \nwill hit a bullet with a bullet?\n  We never seem to learn our lesson. Today we are buying 10 F-22 \nfighter planes, the most advanced and most expensive in the world, even \nthough they haven't been fully tested and have shown problems in the \ntests that have been done. We are talking about spending $1 billion a \nyear for national missile defense, even though it has had only two \nflight tests--one lucky strike and a near miss--and has never been \ntested against countermeasures that it would surely face.\n  If we are going to spend all this money, the public should at least \ndemand weapons that work. My amendment would set that demand in writing \nfor the trailers. I am not getting into the fighter planes and missile \ndefense. I am only talking about simple trailers, so that never again \nwill we pay three times for trailers--once to buy them, again to store \nthem, and a third time to try to make them work right.\n  I wanted to take this time to talk about the trailer problem. I have \nbeen involved in this for some time. I think it is indicative of a \nlarger problem. We should make sure we test all of our systems, make \nsure they work and are safe and meet the requirements we need before we \nshell out our taxpayers' dollars to buy them.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3355 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Having said that, I understand there is a rule XVI point \nof order against my amendment, so I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3355) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3366, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we now back to the \nWellstone amendment numbered 3366?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Wellstone \namendment.\n  I think it would be the height of irresponsibility to reduce this \ndefense budget by $1 billion, for any purpose. Obviously, for the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which has not yet been \nreauthorized, there will be billions spent--correctly so--for the \nimprovement of the education of our children. To withdraw the funds \nfrom the Department of Defense and put money into a bill that has not \nyet been reauthorized, I think would be shirking our responsibility to \nsupport our troops in the field and make sure they have the equipment \nthey need to do the job we are asking them to do.\n  Whether it be the missile defense system, the F-22, the F-16, the \nships that we need so badly, or whether it is a quality-of-life issue, \nwe are trying to increase the pay levels and the quality of housing for \nour military. We are trying to provide the health care that is deserved \nfor the people in the service and for their families.\n  Where would we take the $1 billion? Which part of our military budget \nthat is already underfunded would we withdraw? I think it is very \nimportant we continue to finish this bill, that we allocate the \nresources we need to stop the flight from our military that we see \noccurring as we speak. We are having a very hard time retaining the \ngood people who are serving in the military. They are leaving the \nmilitary. They are leaving the military for a variety of reasons, some \nof which we can do something about: pay, types of housing, health care, \nand making sure they have the training and the equipment they need to \ndo the job we are asking them to do. We need to make sure we do retain \nour best people.\n  Second, I think it is very important we let potential recruits know \nwe are going to take very seriously these quality-of-life issues. That \nis exactly what this bill, the underlying appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of Defense, is designed to do.\n  I object to any reduction of the Department of Defense bill to \nreallocate resources to other areas that have already had their budgets \napproved by this Congress. We have set the levels of spending in \nCongress. We have allocated money for the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We have allocated money for all of the other agencies to \nbe able to do their jobs. We need to set up a firewall in defense. We \nneed to say we are going to put the money into defense to keep our \nsecurity in this country.\n  If we start adopting amendments such as the Wellstone amendment that \nwould start taking $1 billion out and allocating it to some other \ncause, I think we would be walking away from our responsibility to \nstrengthen our national defense. When we are 6,000 below the \ncongressionally mandated troop strength level, as we are today, I think \nit is most certainly the responsibility of Congress to say, why do we \nhave 6,000 fewer troops than we have allocated to do the job of keeping \nthe security of the United States? I think once we determine the cause, \nwe need to address that cause and we need to correct the problem. The \nway we do it is to make sure we are fully funding the equipment, the \ntraining, and the quality-of-life issues for our military personnel. We \nare asking them to do a pretty tough job. We need to give them the \ntools to do it.\n  I am very fortunate to be able to visit so many of our troops around \nthe world. I am very privileged to be on the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee and, before that, on the Armed Services Committee. I have \nvisited our troops in Saudi Arabia, Italy, Bosnia, Kosovo, Germany, as \nwell as, of course,\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nthroughout the United States of America. It lifts your heart to go to a \nbase or to an outpost and talk to our military personnel. They are \ndedicated. They believe in our country. They believe in what they are \ndoing. They are out there and they are going to do the job given to \nthem to do.\n  In the 7 years that I have been in the Senate and have made it a \npoint to visit our troops wherever they may have been, I have never yet \nmet one who did not inspire me, who did not make me believe that the \nsecurity of our country was being handled by these young people and \nthese generals and these admirals. They are dedicated and they are \ndoing a terrific job. But it is the responsibility of Congress, it is \nthe responsibility of the Senate, it is the responsibility of this body \nto make sure every one of those young men and women out in the field, \nwho are patrolling as we speak, who are walking along the lines between \nKosovo and the former Yugoslavia, who are in Bosnia trying to keep \nBosnia in a peaceful condition, who are in the deserts of Saudi Arabia \nright now, or in Kuwait, trying to keep some stability in the Middle \nEast, get the support and the equipment and the training they need to \ndo the job.\n  If we start voting for amendments that take $1 billion out of an \nalready short defense budget and start allocating that to other \nprograms--worthy programs, but we have already set the spending \nlimiting for those programs--we would be shirking our responsibility to \nsupport those who are supporting us. That is why I oppose the Wellstone \namendment and why I hope this Senate will take the responsible action \nand reject any effort to take $1 billion out of the funds for the \ndefense budget. It has emergency money in it to replenish the coffers \nwhere we have taken from the basic defense budget to fund the \npeacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. It is essential we get on \nwith our responsibility and reject the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from California \nhas an amendment. Senator Harkin is joining her. I would like to see if \nwe can get a time agreement on this amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthe time be limited to not more than 45 minutes on each side. Is that \nagreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the manager of the bill \nwould be kind enough to notify the Senate when there will be some \nvotes. We have about an hour and a half now on this amendment, if all \ntime is used, and there then would be two votes; is that correct? I \nthink that is what the leaders are talking about.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I do not \nanticipate using the full amount of time on our side. I understand \nthere has been one amendment put aside. I hope to have the votes occur \nsomewhere around 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Then after that, it is my understanding the bill is in the \nprocess of being able to be wound up?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we still have the procedure to follow to \napply rule XVI to the amendments that have not been withdrawn. We are \ncompiling that list now. As soon as this amendment is finished, we will \ndo that. The Senator would understand, I am sure, that some Senators \nmay wish to appeal that or deal with it in some way. I hope not. We \nhope to conclude the rule XVI procedure and then vote at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3311\n\n(Purpose: To strike Section 8114 regarding Operational Support Aircraft \n                           Leasing Authority)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3311.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3311.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8114.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers. I have had a few \namendments. I think this one is not one they support. They have been \nvery supportive of my others. I am very proud that the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, has once again teamed up with me. We have been the \nteam on this particular subject for awhile.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, I served on the Armed \nServices Committee. It was a great honor to do so. There is nothing \nmore important than our national security. What I found was that we \nwere wasting many dollars. I thought we had cured some of those \nproblems. For awhile I really didn't bring these issues before the body \nbecause I was convinced we were moving in the right direction. \nSuddenly, I am afraid, we see a reversal.\n  For example, in this bill, the military asked us for $3 billion less \nthan the committee actually voted out. This particular bill that is \nbefore us is $3 billion more than the Defense Department requested. Why \nwould we do that? Why would we not go along with what they say they \nneed, and why would we pad this particular area, our national defense? \nAnd why do I say that? Because if we look through the bill, we will \nfind instances of waste.\n  We understand why this bill is padded when we particularly look at \none area that Senator Harkin and I joined forces on last year. That is \nthe area of operational support aircraft. These are aircraft used for \ntravel by the upper echelons of the military. What we do with our \namendment is strike the section that allows nine of these operational \nsupport aircraft to be leased. In this bill, they are not specified as \nwhat they are, how much they each cost. We know nothing except that the \nArmy can have three, the Navy can have three, and the Marine Corps can \nhave three.\n  What do I suspect they are going to do with this? I think we have to \nlearn from history and look back to last year's Defense appropriations \nbill. I offered an amendment with Senator Harkin then that would have \nstruck this same exact language that was used by the Air Force to lease \nsix operational support aircraft. Senator Harkin and I lost that fight. \nI thought we made a valiant effort, but we are back for this reason: A \nlot has happened since Senator Harkin and I brought this matter before \nthe body.\n  First, we know the Air Force plans to lease the most luxurious jets \nthere are, despite the fact we had people here telling us they weren't \ngoing to lease these big, beautiful jets; they were going to go \nsmaller.\n  Let's take a look at the Gulfstream. It is pretty slick. We are told \nif one were to buy this, it costs $50 million a copy--luxurious travel. \nThe Air Force has leased six. The Air Force took the same language they \nhad in the appropriations bill last year and leased six of these.\n  Let's take a look at the interior of this plane. Senator Harkin has a \nlittle different view. It is beautiful. This plane is used by \nbillionaires. This plane is used by the top echelon of wealthy people \nin this country. We wonder why this bill has been padded with $3 \nbillion. I think it is to do things such as this that, with all due \nrespect, were not spelled out in this bill.\n  If I were to read--I don't have time because I have agreed to a tight \ntime limit--the language, all one would know about it is, it is the \nsame as was put in for the Air Force. But they couldn't find anywhere \nlisted a Gulfstream. Yet last year we were told, at this very same time \nin the debate, that the Air Force was not going to go for these \nGulfstreams: ``There is nothing in this language that says that.'' Yet \nthat is, in fact, what they did.\n  We were right last year, and it is costing taxpayers a fortune to \nlease these jets. Let me say, it is cheaper to buy them than to lease \nthem.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a New York Times \narticle that discusses the fact that it is actually cheaper to lease \nthese jets than to buy them.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 11, 1999]\n\n       NATO Spending Bill Includes Executive Jets for 9 Generals\n\n                            (By Tim Weiner)\n\n       An urgent request from the Air Force is buried in the \n     multibillion-dollar emergency bills that will finance NATO's \n     air war in Yugoslavia.\n       Smart bombs? F-16 fighters?\n       Not exactly. The Air Force wants to lease Gulfstream \n     executive business jets to ferry four-star generals around \n     the world. The cost could run to half a billion dollars over \n     a decade.\n       The Air Force is asking for top-of-the-line Gulfstream V's \n     to replace the Boeing 707's, some as much as 30 years old, \n     that transport nine of the nation's top military commanders.\n       The Gulfstreams can fly eight passengers nonstop for 7,500 \n     miles, wrapping them in sweet silence and comfort, the \n     company says.\n       The Air Force already has two Gulfstream V's for the very \n     highest Government officials. Moguls from the movies and \n     Microsoft fly them. Why not the military's most powerful \n     commanders, men like Gen. Wesley Clark, who is running NATO's \n     air war?\n       So the Pentagon and the Senate Appropriations Committee \n     chairman, Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, worked \n     out a deal that would let the Air Force lease six Gulfstreams \n     for the military's nine unified and regional commanders-in-\n     chief, Congressional staff members said.\n       Those in the Air Force and in Congress who support the \n     request--none of whom would be quoted by name--say leasing \n     could be cheaper than maintaining the 707's. And the \n     Gulfstreams cost less than the planes some of the commanders \n     originally sought: a fleet of Boeing 767's, which run upwards \n     of $100 million each.\n       The new fleet would give the commanders ``the capability to \n     travel within the full length of their theaters or to \n     Washington, D.C., without an en route stopover,'' the Air \n     Force said in a ``fact sheet'' submitted to Congress two \n     weeks ago to underscore the commanders' needs.\n       Only one of the nine commanders-in-chief, or Cincs, General \n     Clark, is based overseas. The others work in Virginia, \n     Illnois, Colorado, Nebraska, Hawaii and Florida, where three \n     of them have headquarters. But with the United States playing \n     the role of the world's sole superpower, their \n     responsibilities are global, the Pentagon says.\n       The Air Force noted that the Gulfstream V is ``the single \n     aircraft most capable of performing the Cinc support role, at \n     significantly reduced costs.''\n       One new Gulfstream was included in this year's Pentagon \n     budget. But the Gulfstream V can carry only a small \n     contingent. So the Air Force said it might also consider two \n     Gulfstreams and four specially equipped 737-700's, which \n     carry at least 126 passengers in their commercial \n     configuration.\n       The Senate's emergency spending bill includes a measure \n     aiding Central American hurricane victims, which is where the \n     leasing arrangement originated. The measure goes to \n     conference on Tuesday with the $13 billion measure passed by \n     the House last week.\n       The Gulfstream measure includes only the legal authority to \n     sign a lease--no money. It does not mention the money at all.\n       But the leasing deal, if carried out, could cost $476 \n     million or more over 10 years, according to Air Force \n     documents and Congressional staff members.\n       It would actually cost less to buy each of the nine \n     commanders his own Gulfstream V--$333 million. But that might \n     be a harder sell, said a Congressional staff member working \n     on the Senate's still evolving emergency bill.\n       ``You don't want to look like you're buying the Cincs \n     executive jets,'' he said.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. First of all, we are not buying them. We are leasing \nthem, and that costs money. If we were to buy these nine, it would cost \na half a billion dollars. I am embarrassed to say it. That amount of \nmoney could put 5,000 police on the streets. That amount of money could \ndouble the number of children we have in afterschool. That amount of \nmoney could take care of a lot of veterans' health care.\n  The other plane that is in the same category is called Bombardier. It \nis made in Quebec. I don't have a photo of it. It is just as luxurious, \njust as expensive. It goes for about the same. I say to my friends who \nwant to make sure our generals have what they need: Why do we have to \ngo to the top of the line?\n  If the answer comes back that we are not necessarily doing that and \nwe are not spelling it out, then why not preclude them from going to \nthe top of the line? Two things have happened that are important since \nthis debate last year.\n  No. 1, those who said the Air Force would never buy the top of the \nline were proven wrong. We said they would do it, and they will leased \nthese top of the line jets.\n  No. 2, Senator Harkin, Congressman DeFazio, and I wrote to the \nGeneral Accounting Office. Because we respect our friends who said \nthese operational support aircraft were necessary, we said to the GAO, \nwhich is our investigative arm, Will you do a study? They did. Guess \nwhat they titled this study. The title of this study comes back: \n``Operational Support Airlift Requirements are not Sufficiently \nJustified.''\n  Let me reiterate sort of the partridge and the pear tree about why we \nshould strike this language. Last year, we were told they needed the \naircraft. Here is the GAO report, the investigative arm of Congress, \ncoming back saying we do not need any more right now because we don't \nknow what we have. I will share the quotes from that study.\n  Second, the Air Force proved they were going to go to the top of the \nline. This is the same exact language. After all, I guess if the Air \nForce has it, the Army needs it, the Marines, and the Navy, then we are \ngoing to allow them to have the same latitude.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nCalifornia has 45 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Presiding Officer let me know when I have used \n20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the results of this GAO study.\n  GAO report: ``Operational Support Airlift Requirements are not \nSufficiently Justified.''\n\n       The processes that DOD uses to identify its requirements \n     for operational support airlift have a number of weaknesses \n     that make it difficult to assess whether the current \n     inventory meets the wartime needs.\n\n  That is one statement. We will go through the statements with you.\n  The next statement:\n\n       Although DOD directive 4500.43 states that operational \n     support airlift requirements should be based solely on \n     wartime needs, the methodology that DOD used in 1995 and 1998 \n     does not draw a clear link to the scenario for two major \n     regional conflicts specified by the National Military \n     Strategy.\n\n  In other words, the operational support aircraft have to be linked to \nwhat military needs in case of war--not that it is comfortable for \ngenerals in time of peace.\n  I understand that it is comfortable to go on a plane such as this, \nbut that is not what taxpayers should be paying for. We should be \npaying for what we need in time of war. That is what the DOD is \nsupposed to do.\n  What else do they tell us in this report?\n\n       The lack of clear linkage to wartime requirements raises \n     questions about whether the support aircraft fleet is \n     appropriately sized to meet short-notice mobility needs in \n     wartime.\n\n  My friends, this is serious. We are going ahead with this \nappropriations--this green light--to lease all of these airplanes when \nthe GAO is saying to us that the ``lack of clear linkage to wartime \nrequirements raises questions about'' the fleet and whether it is \nappropriately sized. It may be terribly overly sized.\n  Let's see what else we have.\n  This is the one I think says it all.\n\n       The joint staff . . . has not maintained records \n     documenting its previous requirements reviews, so it is not \n     possible to determine whether some options for reducing \n     requirements were examined.\n\n  I have to say to my colleagues who I hope are watching this from \ntheir offices that there is a need here to defend the United States of \nAmerica, and we should do everything we can to do that. If we are going \nunder the scenario of being prepared to fight two major conflicts--some \npeople think that is outmoded, but if that is what we are doing--then \neverything we do in this budget should reflect that need. And we are \nbeing told that the Joint Chiefs do not maintain records documenting \ntheir requirements for these aircraft.\n  How on Earth can we possibly justify this kind of open-ended language \nin this bill?\n  The GAO sums up:\n\n       For all these reasons, we believe a more rigorous process \n     is needed to better ensure that support aircraft requirements \n     accurately reflect wartime needs.\n\n  I think if you really believe that supporting our military is one of \nthe most important things we can do in making sure we have dollar for \ndollar the best military in the world, then you should vote for the \nBoxer-Harkin amendment.\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\n  There is no reason given in any of the documentation in the \nDepartment of Defense as to why they need this aircraft. There is no \nrationale. The GAO has studied this. They are nonpartisan. They are the \ninvestigative arm of Congress. They have come back and told us they \ncan't even find their records. Yet we are going blindly ahead, it seems \nto me, and providing this open-ended language, which will result, I \npredict to you, in nine more of these aircraft, and they could be the \nmost luxurious in the world.\n  We already know that the Defense Department has 144 jets in its fleet \nof operational support aircraft. This includes 71 Learjets, 13 \nGulfstreams, the one Gulfstream V, and 17 Cessna Citations.\n  We know the GAO has studied all of this, and they are saying to us: \nTime out. What is the rush?\n  When I take a look at these luxury jets, I can only say this: We know \nthere are cheaper luxury jets that would have to make just one stop--I \nhave a photo of that--just one stop. This plane is about $18 million \ncompared to $50 million, which would have to make one stop to refuel.\n  I have to say to my friends that it is a beautiful plane. It is a \ncomfortable plane. For a general to stop and stretch his or her legs, \nas the case may be, and fill up the tank once on the way to a meeting \nin peacetime----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield right there?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator put that photograph back up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly. I will finish my sentence, and then I will \nyield. Then I am happy to yield. I have to finish my thought.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator yielded to me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is a smaller aircraft. We were hoping that the Air \nForce was going to look at this. But they came back with the \nGulfstreams.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I am correct, that is a UC-35 that the Senator put up \nthere, and that is what we are going to lease. That is exactly what \nthis provision covers, the UC-35s.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is not a UC-35. This is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is a Citation X.\n  The point I am making is there is nothing in the language, I say to \nmy dear friend, that suggests exactly what plane they are going to use. \nThere is nothing in this language. Last year, under the same language, \nthe Air Force leased the Gulfstream. That is the point we are making. \nWe are not limiting them to this.\n  I have to say that I know we are in a surplus situation. But we have \na lot of needs for our military personnel. I know my friends fought for \nthat. We are looking at military personnel who are not living in \nadequate housing. We know that Senator McCain has taken the lead in \ntrying to get our people off food stamps. We have an unfunded priority \nof veterans' health.\n  I think what Senator Harkin and I are simply saying is this: It is \nunnecessary to have this many planes when we now have a quite unbiased \nreport that says, ``Operational Support Airlift requirements are not \nsufficiently justified.''\n\n  Why would we run off and buy more when we don't know what we have? We \nhave seen with vague language we could wind up with top-of-the-line \njets.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 20 \nminutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for yielding me this \ntime.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of her amendment. We have worked hard on \nthis over the last couple of years to try to bring sense and \nrationality to this procurement of luxury jets for the military.\n  I was going to ask my friend from California if we might engage in a \nlittle colloquy to let our fellow Senators know where we are coming \nfrom. It is not the intention of the Senator from California, nor mine, \nto say that there should be no smaller corporate-type jets within the \nDepartment of Defense. We are not trying to say ``none.'' We are not \ntrying to cut them out. There are 364 support aircraft in the inventory \nright now.\n  I ask the Senator, is it, the intention of the Senator to do away \nwith all these types of jets?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not at all.\n  As my friend knows, we don't even really know how the jets they have \nnow are meeting our needs in a situation such as during wartime, which \nis the directive that they have to go by. The DOD has to rationalize \nand tell us, under their own directive, how their support meets the \nneeds in wartime.\n  Clearly in this report it is stated there is no rationale for what \nthey have now, let alone what they have to have.\n  Furthermore, we are saying that if they got these nine additional \nplanes, which we don't even know if they need, under this language they \nwould be able to buy the fanciest jets in the world, despite the fact \nthat Senator Stevens doesn't think they will.\n  The Senator of Alaska wasn't positive that the Air Force was going to \nlease the six Gulfstreams last year, yet they did. It is the same \nlanguage.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What happened to the six airplanes last year that we \nfought against? Have they started leasing those airplanes yet?\n  Mrs. BOXER. They put out an RFP. The only two companies that \nqualified for the RFP happened to be the two companies that made a $50 \nmillion luxury jet.\n  The Air Force is moving forward and doing exactly what we said they \nwere going to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator is correct, the request for proposal that \ndelineated the requirements, the GAO said there is no real basis for \nthose requirements. They just plucked them out of thin air. They \ndevised, if I am not mistaken, an RFP to get the jets they wanted. But \nthere is no basis for the RFP requirement.\n  That is what I read in the GAO report. For example, I say to the \nSenator from California, in the GAO study on page 7, ``One military \nofficer involved in the 1995 study said that using an assumption of \nfour flights a day yielded a requirement deemed to be too high and that \nusing an assumption of two flights a day yielded a requirement deemed \nto be too low.'' So it came out at three.\n  Listen to this: ``Operational support airlift requirements are \nsignificantly affected by this single assumption of how many flights a \nday you have. For example, our review of support aircraft found that 55 \nfewer aircraft were required when assumptions of two flights a day were \nused rather than three for overseas theaters.''\n  Again, the GAO is saying there is no real rational basis for this. \nThey say four is deemed too much, two is deemed too little. So, voila, \nthey decided on three. But again, there is no rational basis for why \nthey needed three flights a day.\n\n  We didn't have this study last year. This study just came out in \nApril of 2000. Last year, we offered the amendment that dealt with six \naircraft, and our worst fears were realized. They put out an RFP, \nlimited to the most luxurious jets. So we requested the study. In light \nof the fact that we have the GAO study that basically says we have no \nbasis on which to procure these aircraft, now we will lease nine \naircraft.\n  Let's get this straight. Last year, we did not have the GAO study. \nOur amendment was defeated. The bill said they could lease up to six \naircraft. This year, we have the GAO study that says there is no basis \nfor the requests, but now nine are requested this year.\n  Please, someone tell me what kind of sense this makes.\n  Again, I have been a pilot all my life. I enjoy flying. I know \nairplanes pretty darned well. We are not trying to say that commanders \nin the field, theater commanders, don't need long-range airplanes. They \ndo. What I am saying is we are playing a game here. It is sort of a \ngame of, I am a general and guess what. I have got a nice big fancy jet \nto ferry me around. Well, Admiral Smith over here looks at General \nJones and says, hey, he's got a big old jet that flies him around. How \ncome I don't have one? And then the general over in the Marine Corps \nsays, well, I have to have one, too. I am as high ranking as that other \ngeneral or admiral. And the Air Force general says, I have to have one, \ntoo.\n  Come on. There is a lot of this game involved here. I don't mind some \nperks for our military officers. They don't get paid a lot of money. \nThey do a\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\ngreat job of defending our country. We call upon them in wartime and \nthey lay down their lives. If you are just honest about it, this is a \nperk, a perquisite.\n  But how much of a perk? Do they really need a Gulfstream V that can \ncarry up to 19 passengers so they can put four or five people on board \nand travel in luxury? No, they don't need that. CINCPAC operates out of \nHawaii and needs a longer range plane to go from Hawaii to Guam, \nOkinawa, Japan, or Korea. I understand that. But commanders in the \nUnited States don't need those. They can land at any airport in the \nUnited States and get refueled. They don't need those longer range \nplanes. You may need one for Europe. Already in the inventory we have \n13 Gulfstream III's that have a 3,500-mile nautical range. Now the \nGulfstream V has a 5,500-mile nautical range.\n  We already have one of those in inventory. I don't know where it is. \nI don't know who operates it. But we already have one. We have 13 \nGulfstream III's with a 3,500-mile nautical range. That is not too \nshabby. And a Gulfstream III is a very luxurious plane, I can assure \nyou. The GAO says it can carry up to 26 passengers, but that is maximum \nloading. Actually, a Gulfstream III would probably carry about 10 or 12 \npeople at most on any flight. They already have 13 of them. Is that \nenough? We don't even know. The GAO says we don't even know if that is \nenough.\n\n  I am not saying we do not need some of these planes. But I think we \nneed a really thorough study of these inventories, to justify the \nrequirements.\n  The GAO said:\n\n       The Department of Defense has not clearly explained the \n     basis for the key assumptions it is using to justify the \n     requirements or identified the assumptions that should be \n     updated in each succeeding review.\n\n  What does it mean? The Pentagon has no clue about how many planes \nthey need; no clue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me just finish this.\n  The GAO found there is no justification for how many times a day \nairports are connected. There is no criterion for why some airports are \nkey airports and others are not. There is no consideration of how large \ndifferent planes need to be. Nobody could even tell the GAO whether the \nrequirement for 85 aircraft in the continental United States had been \nconsidered in the 1998 review or who was supposed to look at it in the \ncurrent review. So how do they come up with their assumptions? Here is \nwhat GAO said. I will repeat it:\n\n       One military officer said using an assumption of four \n     flights a day yielded a requirement deemed to be too high, \n     using an assumption of two yielded a requirement deemed to be \n     too low by the commanders in chief.\n\n  What does that mean? They cooked the books. That is all they are \ndoing, they are cooking the books. They are saying I would like to have \nthis Gulfstream V, so write it up so that I need it. That is all that \nis happening.\n  I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to make sure my friend was aware we have a copy \nof the RFP done by the Air Force. I ask unanimous consent this document \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Aircraft Capabilities and\n             Characteristics                              Thresholds                           Objective\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.1.1.1.* Range.........................

What it shows is exactly what my friend is saying, \naircraft should be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 nautical miles. \nOnly two aircraft, this one called the Global Express--that is made in \nCanada, and then the Gulfstream V, which, as my friend pointed out, the \nAir Force has put out this proposal, it is in the 5,000 nautical mile \nrange. So this is the characteristic. If you look at this and other \ncharacteristics, it can only be these luxury jets.\n  But I wanted to ask my friend if he saw the letter from the \nDepartment of Defense to the General Accounting Office on page 27 of \nthis report. I ask him to take a look at it because it seems to me, any \nthinking person would read this and say the Department of Defense \nagrees with Harkin and Boxer. If you look at this letter in the second \nparagraph, it says:\n\n       The department agrees with many of the findings in the GAO \n     report. Accordingly, it will take the GAO's findings into \n     consideration in future determinations of operational support \n     airlift.\n\n  That is very nice. When will they take it into consideration? After \nthey have sprung for half a billion dollars of the taxpayers' money? \nWhat we are saying is we have this report, folks. Yet in this \nparticular bill before us, I wonder if my friend is aware, in order to \ntake effect these leases must be done before 2004. So they are \nessentially rushing to run out and lease these aircraft so, as my \nfriend says, they can have the same aircraft as the Air Force.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Frankly, I say to the Senator from California, if we have \nto swallow this, they ought to at least buy the airplanes, not lease \nthem. The taxpayers are going to get stung, big time, for leasing these \naircraft, but it looks as if it is less in the beginning. Over the \nyears, we are going to pay probably, what would the Senator say, three \nto four times as much for these aircraft?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Hundreds of millions of dollars more, according to the \nNew York Times.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is if we lease them rather than buying. So we are \ncompounding it, adding insult to injury. The taxpayers are getting \nsocked for airplanes the military doesn't really need, and then they \nare leasing them, which means we are paying even more money for \nairplanes we do not even need. Again, you would think with this GAO \nstudy we would say: Wait, we don't need these nine. Let's wait until we \nsee what the requirements really are.\n  The requirements are always couched in terms of wartime necessity. We \nare not at war. It doesn't look as if there is anything bubbling up on \nthe horizon that is going to be a major war for the United States in \nthe next couple of years. So we have time to do an assessment to find \nout what our requirements really are. Does Admiral or General so-and-so \nreally need a Gulfstream V? We don't know that. Maybe they could get by \nwith a C-21.\n  I want to be perfectly honest. I have used these aircraft. As \nSenators, sometimes we travel to remote areas of the world. Because of \ntime requirements and when we have to go, we have to utilize these \naircraft. Last year, Senator Reid and I utilized a C-21. We flew \ncommercially to Jakarta, Indonesia, and then we flew a C-21 from \nJakarta to East Timor. There were no commercial flights we could take \nover there at that time. Then we had to fly back. Then I went in that \nup to Okinawa, Okinawa to Shanghai, and over to Japan, all on routes \nthat would have been very difficult commercially to do.\n  This is a C-21. You are cramped. There is no bathroom. You can't \nstand up; you can't stretch out, and there\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nwas room for about five passengers on that and we were loaded. Flying \nthose long distances, we would have to land and refuel, and get up and \ngo, land and refuel.\n  I am saying, if that is good enough for a Senator, why can't a \ngeneral do that? I didn't say I have to have a Gulfstream V with all \nthe luxury and the bathroom and a chef on board and a glass of \nchampagne--no, we don't need all that stuff. I just need basic \ntransportation to get me from point A to point B to C to D to E.\n\n  Yet I come back to the United States and look around, and I see nice \nluxury jets being used by generals and admirals, people flying around \nthe United States in these luxury aircraft. I wonder, do they really \nneed to travel that way? Why don't they fly in a C-21? It is cheaper. \nWe have a lot of them. Lord knows, we have a lot of C-21s. We have \nprobably 71 of them. They are cheap. They are efficient. They are fast. \nThey are not very comfortable, but they serve the purpose.\n  So I just say what we have here is a game of one-upmanship. General \nso-and-so has a nice plane. Admiral so-and-so wants one, too. Another \ngeneral wants one.\n  Again, I say to my friend from Alaska, I am not saying we don't need \na number of these aircraft. Some of them we do. Some of them have to be \nlarger for longer flights, as in the Pacific, maybe the European \ntheater. But we do not need them here in the continental United States, \nand that is what we are getting stung with.\n  We ought to come to our senses. This is waste, pure and simple. I do \nnot even mind, as I said earlier, a little perk of office for the \ngenerals, if they have to get in a plane and fly someplace. But they \ndon't need this kind of perk. A C-21 is fine enough to fly around the \ncontinental United States for any general or admiral, for any member of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. And a Gulfstream III is more than adequate \nfor any Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or any admiral or \ngeneral to fly from here to Europe.\n  I would say to the Senator from Alaska, a Gulfstream III can fly from \nhere, land in Gander, land in Iceland, it can refuel, or it can land \nover in Shannon, Ireland, and refuel and make any city in Europe with \none-stop refueling--one stop. They do not need the Gulfstream V. \nCorporate executives fly all the time from the United States to Europe \nin Gulfstream IIIs. They don't need Gulfstream Vs.\n  Of course, some of the bigger corporations, may have a Gulfstream V, \nbut that is the private sector. If they want to do that, that is fine. \nWe are talking about public servants here. Generals and admirals are no \nmore or less public servants than the Senator from Hawaii, Iowa, \nAlaska, or California. They do not need to be mollycoddled. They do not \nneed to be babied and pampered like some corporate executive.\n  If a corporate executive wants to be babied and pampered, that is up \nto their board of directors and their stockholders. The American people \nare the stockholders of the Department of Defense. I do not believe our \nconstituents want to spend their hard-earned tax dollars so some \ngeneral or admiral can fly around in a Gulfstream V in luxurious \ncomfort while we have troops on food stamps and while we are trying to \nraise the pay of those on the bottom.\n  So I say let's take a little time here. Let's take a breather. They \ndo not need to lease the nine aircraft right now.\n  Let's take a look at the GAO report. Let's give the Department of \nDefense 1 year to come back, and let's see their justification.\n  I ask the Senator from California again for that justification for \nthe RFPs that just went out:\n\n       Aircraft should be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 \n     nautical miles.\n\n  Why?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Why?\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield my friend 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take 4 minutes, but I \nappreciate the Senator from California yielding me time.\n  Why? Why 5,000 miles? That is the threshold. The objective is the \n``Aircraft shall be able to fly no-wind range of 5,000 nautical miles \ncarrying a full passenger and crew complement, plus their baggage.'' \nWhy? We do not know why, but that is what they said.\n  The GAO report says, as the Senator from California said, there is no \njustification for it. They plucked the numbers out of thin air. They \ncooked the books, and I do not like it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield on the remaining time he has? I \nthank my friend for joining me. This is someone who knows what it is to \nfly military aircraft. I could not have a better partner on this \namendment than Tom Harkin.\n  I want to close this particular portion, and then we will have a few \nminutes left to respond to the criticism that I am sure will now be \nleveled at us from some very astute people.\n  Here is the point: Last year when we got in this fight, they told us: \nOh, no, they were not going to go out and get these Gulfstreams. We \nsaid we thought they were; nothing in this language precludes it. They \nwent out with an RFP. We were right: Luxury planes, $50 million a copy \nif you were to buy it.\n  Secondly, we said OK to our friends, you don't believe us; we will \nhave a GAO report, the nonpartisan arm of Congress, investigate. That \nis what they do, they investigate. Guess what they said. ``Operational \nsupport airlift requirements are not sufficiently justified.'' Guess \nwhat else. The Department of Defense says they agree. So why are we in \nthis bill allowing for leases of nine jets which are not defined? They \ncan well be these luxury jets. I thank my friend and ask for his final \ncomments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to anyone who is watching this debate, get on your \ncomputer, get on the Internet and dial up www.gulfstream.com. Dial up \ngulfstream.com and take a look at the Gulfstream V and Gulfstream III, \nI say to my constituents, or anyone who is watching--gulfstream.com. \nDial it up and take a look at the Gulfstream V and ask yourself: Does a \ngeneral or an admiral or anyone who is a public servant really need \nthis kind of luxury? The answer, I think, will be obvious.\n  I reserve any remaining time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from Alaska has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Kansas and 10 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii. I want \nto start off by saying we are talking about UC-35 support aircraft \nunder a pilot lease program. I do not know what this business is about \nsomeone saying last year--I do not know the straw man. Last year, I \nsaid we expected them to lease intercontinental aircraft of a large \nsize, and they did. This time we are telling you we expect them to \nlease UC-35-type aircraft for operational and support utility purposes.\n\n  There are nine planes authorized to be leased--three for the Army, \nthree for the Navy, and three for the Marine Corps--to replace planes \nthat are aging, many of them more than 30 years old, older than the \npilots who are flying them.\n  It is time we woke up to the fact that it costs so much to operate \nthem, so much to maintain them that it is too expensive. We are trying \nto modernize without buying so many airplanes. We want to lease them.\n  This is a pilot program, as was the one last year, to see what the \ncost will be as we have to replace this fleet. It is an aging fleet. As \na matter of fact, we bought the first G-3 the first year I was the \nchairman of the subcommittee in 1981. Those planes are now over 20 \nyears old, the 21s are over 30 years old, and we have to replace them.\n  We have two pilot projects: One is to lease the larger ones and one \nis to lease these smaller ones. We are going to see what it costs us, \nwhat the maintenance costs are.\n  I am getting tired of these GAO reports written by people who do not \nknow what they are talking about, and we are going to do something \nabout that, too. That same person who has been writing these reports \nhas condemned every airplane we have bought in the last 5 years. It is \ntime we stopped listening to the people who do not know what they are \ntalking about.\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\n  These are pilot programs to lease aircraft, instead of replacing \nthem, to determine what the maintenance costs will be, what will the \ncost to the Government be if we pursue a leasing program, which most \nmajor businesses do now, rather than buying aircraft. I think it will \nbe cost effective. But above all, this is a program to determine the \ncost, whether there is a choice for us, instead of buying replacements, \nto lease these aircraft. Until we put the pilot programs in place, we \nwill not know.\n  I think this is the rational thing to do. I have seen a lot of straw \npeople, but you get on the www.gulfstream. com all you want and look at \nthe beautiful airplanes. They are not what we are talking about. We \nhave not bought any of those either. We have not bought planes such as \nthose they will see advertised for commercial purposes. We bought them \nfor military purposes. They are stripped down, and they are functional \naircraft. The ones we leased last year are functional now. I invite my \ncolleagues to take a ride on one and look at them.\n  As a practical matter, right now, I yield to my friend--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, you wouldn't yield to me. I am not going to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yielded to my friend.\n  Mr. STEVENS. You didn't yield to me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did certainly yield to you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, you didn't.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did; I did.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On your time. If you want to spend your time, I am happy \nto use it. Mr. President, on her time I yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield on your time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fine. I yielded to you on my time, but if that is how you \nwant to do it, fine. I will say this: There is nothing in this language \nthat says you are leasing a particular type of aircraft. This is the \nsame language that was used which gave the Air Force the ability to get \nthe Gulfstreams.\n  If my friend wants to change the language, that is great, but the \nlanguage is the same. The Air Force took that language and is buying \nluxury jets, and besides which the GAO says do not get any more because \nthey do not even know what they have they are so disorganized over \nthere when it comes to the operational airlift.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the language is exactly the same; the \nSenator is right. It is for leasing aircraft for operational support \nand utility airlift purposes, and it specifically says it is a \nmultiyear pilot program. There is not an expanded program as has been \nrepresented. It is nine planes total to see what the costs will be of \noperations under this pilot-type program as compared to the cost of \nbuying such an aircraft and flying it for military purposes.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. The \nway I understand the amendment, as crafted by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa and the distinguished Senator from California, it is that \nthey would strike the appropriations process to lease UC-35 aircraft. \nWe are not talking about--I took some notes--either Gulfstreams or \nBoeing 727s or Learjets and, as a matter of fact, I do not think, with \nall due respect to my colleagues, we are talking about pampering or \nmollycoddling or glasses of champagne in regard to this aircraft.\n  We are talking about basically the operational support airlift \naircraft, and the capability and the importance that these aircraft \nhave in performing the missions as deemed appropriate by the Secretary \nof Navy, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Army, \nall three of which have put these particular aircraft--nine UC-35s--on \ntheir unfunded list.\n  So if we are going to go to ``gulfstream.com''--I don't know if the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps has a dot com or the Secretary of the \nNavy or the Secretary of the Army, but they certainly had these \naircraft on the unfunded list.\n  Now, let me talk a minute about the GAO report. The Senator from \nCalifornia was exactly right when she stated the response from the \nDepartment of Defense to the GAO and all the criticism of the GAO. As a \nmatter of fact, let me say something about the GAO. It is a lot like an \neconomist. I hope someday to find an expert witness from the General \nAccounting Office with one arm so he can't say ``on the other hand.'' I \ndon't know how many times, when I had the privilege of being the \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee in the other body, we would \nhave GAO reports that were highly critical of many of the programs that \nwe had under our jurisdiction.\n  I am finding out in the Intelligence Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, and, yes, the Agriculture Committee--we ought to have it \nbefore the Ethics Committee--but, at any rate, in these three \ncommittees, we still have expertise in the GAO. Sometimes it is very \nhelpful and other times I think a little myopic.\n  But at any rate, this is what the Department of Defense says in \nregards to the GAO report. They agree.\n\n       The Department agrees with many of the findings in the GAO \n     report. Accordingly, it will take the GAO's findings into \n     consideration in future determinations of operational support \n     airlift requirements.\n\n  So they agree that this inventory should be based solely on joint \nwartime readiness requirements of the commands as opposed to any kind \nof personal use, as described in great detail by my two friends and \ncolleagues.\n\n       The Department appreciates the opportunity to comment on \n     the GAO draft report.\n\n  I do not think that is the issue. The issue is whether or not we will \nlease nine. And they would go three to the Army, three to the Navy, and \ncertainly three to the U.S. Marine Corps. They are on the unfunded \nlist.\n  Now, if this amendment is successful, they will not be leased and \nthey will not replace, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out, \naging aircraft, C-12s. I think, over the long term, this will provide a \ngreater test to see, under a cost-benefit standard, as to whether or \nnot this is in the best interests of the taxpayer, as we provide this \naircraft.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I don't have time. I will see at the end, if I can ask \nfor more time, and I would be delighted to yield to my good friend.\n  In war, this fleet--I am talking about operational support airlift \naircraft--is maintained and ready to provide the commander quick \ntransportation and to remote locations.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa said--if I can find my notes--\nthat we are not at war. Well, we are not at war. Some people in Kosovo \nmight challenge that. But we are involved in 141 nations. We have U.S. \ntroops--men and women in uniform--in 141 nations. Fifty-five percent of \nall the nations in the world have U.S. troops stationed in those \ncountries. The operational airlift capacity that is provided by these \nnine UC-35 aircraft is absolutely vital on those missions.\n  What am I talking about? Joe Ralston is the new Supreme Allied \nCommander. He took the place of Wesley Clark. The first obligation, as \nhe told me in a courtesy call, is to pay as many courtesy visits as he \ncan to his counterparts in Russia. How is he going to get there?\n  What happens if something breaks out in Kosovo? How does he get \nthere? No, we are not at war, but in terms of our obligations and in \nterms of our military being stretched and stressed and hollow, it seems \nto me we ought to be very careful when we talk about operational \nsupport airlift aircraft.\n  Let me give you another example.\n  I have a congressional fellow in my office. He is an F-15 pilot. I \nknow one case where his aircraft, in support of Operation Southern \nWatch--that is to prevent drugs from coming into this country--had to \ndivert due to a massive fuel leak. Again, in regards to this \noperational support airlift aircraft, basically what happened, it was \ndispatched with maintenance crews and the very critical parts to fix \nthe aircraft very quickly and return it to mission ready status.\n  That is what these aircraft are used for. As a matter of fact, I have \nhere a statement that only 5 percent of these aircraft, in terms of \nmissions, were ever even used by generals.\n  Here it is: In fiscal year 1999, less than 5 percent of the \noperational support missions were for generals or admirals. What does \nthe 95 percent do?\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\n The operational support airlift mission does provide--as determined by \nthe Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Army, and the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps--efficient and effective transportation \nof commanders, key staff personnel, couriers, critical spare parts, and \nequipment in support of both peacetime and wartime operations.\n\n  These missions, according to the people who fly them, are typically \nunpredictable, high priority, and require very short notice in regards \nto the airlift of the people, the cargo, and the mail. These lifts are \nnormally in support of contingency deployments--goodness knows, we have \nthose today in 141 nations --not compatible with commercial \ntransportation or larger aircraft.\n  The critical delays in the transportation of senior leaders, key \nstaff personnel, urgently needed parts, supplies, and software could \nultimately impact unit effectiveness and combat readiness.\n  I want to say, in closing, that my distinguished friend from Iowa \nreferred to a so-called--I know he was not being specific in regards to \nthe Marine Corps--``General Smith'' in the Marine Corps who would look \naround to other generals who might have a Gulfstream or a 727 or a \nLearjet, or whatever, and say: Gee whiz, I would like to have that \nperk.\n  I just want to set the record straight. I asked the Marine Corps, I \nasked the Commandant: What about this statement, Mr. Commandant? I am \ntalking about ``General Jim Jones.'' And this is the statement that \nworried me because it is very similar to the statements that have been \nmade on the floor by the proponents of this amendment. The response \nwas:\n\n       The Pentagon already has enough aircraft to taxi Generals \n     and Admirals around the world. In fact, they have more than \n     300 executive aircraft, including more than 100 jets suitable \n     to transport high-ranking officers.\n\n  I asked the Commandant, I said: Will you please comment about this \nstatement. And the response was:\n\n       The 3 UC-35s are for Active Marine Corps forces, not the \n     Navy.\n       The Marine Corps does not provide executive airlift.\n\n  Let me repeat that: The United States Marine Corps, according to the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, does not provide executive airlift.\n\n       [The Marine Corps has] a small fleet (24) of Operational \n     Support Airlift aircraft that are tied directly to a Joint \n     Staff validated wartime requirement. . ..\n       These aircraft support Marine Forces deployed [around the \n     world].\n       The need to replace----\n\n  And this is what the chairman of the committee was trying to point \nout--\n\n     aging/obsolete CT-39G aircraft has been accelerated by the \n     transfer of 2 of the Marine Corps 3 remaining CT-39s to the \n     Navy. . .\n\n  We do not even have the obsolete aircraft. That is nothing new for \nthe Marine Corps. We do not even have that.\n  I continue with the answer in regards to that statement that has been \nstated by the Commandant:\n\n       The increased performance and short field capability of the \n     UC-35 will ensure OSA support to forward deployed Marine \n     Corps forces remains viable well into the 21st century.\n\n  Again, I am quoting from the Commandant:\n\n       The Marine Corps has placed 3 UC-35s on the Commandant's \n     FY00 APN Unfunded Priority List in order to accelerate \n     delivery to the West Coast and Okinawa to support Marine \n     forces.\n       [These] Missions are typically unpredictable, high \n     priority, and require short notice airlift of people, cargo, \n     and mail. These lifts are normally in support of contingency \n     deployments not compatible with commercial transportation, \n     common user airlift, or other organic airlift.\n\n  That is a long way from being mollycoddled or thinking that you must \nhave a perk aircraft because some other admiral or general might have a \nperk aircraft.\n  I agree with the Senators from Iowa and California, we must make sure \nthat the Department of Defense, as is indicated by their response, \nadheres to the GAO report, without question.\n  Nobody wants to soak the taxpayer for any kind of generals' special \nfleet. That is not what this does. This amendment would strike nine \nunfunded priority requests by the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary \nof the Navy, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. I will put that \ndot com at the end of my remarks and hope people will pay attention to \nthe people who have that responsibility.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am not a pilot. However, I believe that \nin this body I spend more time on aircraft than other Members.\n  My home is in Hawaii. Whenever I leave the city of Washington to \nreturn home, I must prepare myself for 11 hours and 15 minutes of \nflight time. In that sense, I believe I am an experienced person when \nit comes to flying. However, in my case, because of the uncertainty of \nthe schedule in the Senate, we cannot make reservations 3 or 4 months \nahead of time. I have had a reservation for this Friday, but I just \ncanceled that because I think we are going to be handling \nappropriations measures. As a result, if something should come about \nmaking it possible for me to fly back to Hawaii this Friday, I may be \nable to get a flight, leaving at some strange hour, economy class, \nwhich I don't mind. But at the end of the trip, I usually can get home \nto my apartment and spend an evening of rest.\n  The men who fly these planes have special responsibilities. When they \nget on a flight to go to Russia, they are not going to be escorted to a \nfancy hotel as soon as they land. They are expected to go to a meeting \nat that point. The least we can provide our commanders is some rest and \nsome comfort before they get into some big business.\n  Secondly, these are not just any old aircraft. They have to be \nspecially equipped. In wartime and in peacetime, these planes are their \nheadquarters. They make command decisions on these flights. They are \nexpected to be in contact with the men and women under their command at \nall times. We are fortunate. In a sense, we are 8-to-8 employees. We \nget to work about 8 o'clock and we leave work about 8. A military \ncommander is like a police officer. He is on duty 24 hours a day. These \naircraft must be equipped to be able to provide support for his 24-\nhour-a-day responsibility.\n  Yes, we do have 71 Learjets in the inventory at this time. That is a \nlarge fleet, 71 Learjets. But they are getting pretty old and \ninadequate for the assignments. Within 5 years, about 45 are going to \nbe retired. Within 10 years, we will find that all of these will be \ngone.\n  We have 707s. I don't know how many of my colleagues have been flying \non 707s recently, but they are considered pretty old, 35 years old. \nWhether we like it or not, we will have to retire these aircraft. Yes, \nwe have C-22s, the 727. They are 25 years old. They can't last forever. \nThey are going to be retired pretty soon.\n  A third consideration: This provision in our bill does not specify \nthe name of the aircraft. We do this deliberately because we don't want \nto favor one company over another. If we put in the G-5 that we are \nfavoring one company, the Grumman, or if we put in something else, we \nare going to be favoring another company. That is not our wish. We want \nthis to undergo a competitive system. I think we have fulfilled that \nrequirement by this amendment.\n  Overall, there is another consideration. We have been speaking of \nadmirals and generals. Much of the time you will find that these \naircraft are being used by our civilian leaders, Cabinet people. Just 2 \ndays ago, the Secretary of State went to Syria, to Damascus, to attend \nthe funeral of President Assad. She did not go on Pan American or TWA. \nShe went on a military aircraft. I would hope that we Americans would \nwant our Secretary of State to travel in an aircraft worthy of her \nposition. We can easily say United Airlines is good enough for me, why \nis it not good enough for general so-and-so? Well, if he is going home \nfor vacation, he should take United Airlines or Delta, whatever \nairlines he wants to take. But these aircraft are not being used for \npersonal purposes. They are being used for military purposes. I hope we \nwill understand this. I hope when the vote is called, we will vote \nagainst this.\n\n  I would support my colleagues from Iowa and California if I at any \ntime thought these aircraft were perks. They are not perks. Any person \nwho is willing to command troops and stand in harm's way in my behalf \nand in behalf of the people of the United States,\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nI say a G-5 is good for them. If we get something better than that, so \nbe it. Nothing is too good for them.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the leadership and managers of this \nmeasure and vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 23 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from California has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia 2 minutes and apologize. She did recognize me for a four-\nline comment.\n  I yield myself what time I use to make this statement: The issue has \nbeen raised about large aircraft. That is a different issue. We have \ngone back and checked what this issue is. This is support aircraft. The \nAir Force told us today they will have to add $900 million to the \nbudget to maintain and upgrade the existing support aircraft for the \nnext 10 years. Leasing these smaller aircraft to replace them will cost \n$525 million over the next 10 years. If our pilot program works, these \naircraft in what we call the CINC Support Pilot Program will save $275 \nmillion. I think that is a good idea. It makes sense to try it for the \nUC-35s, and I hope the Senate will support that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska for giving \nme a little bit of time. I began to doubt my own memory, but I am glad \nthat he agreed that I did, in fact, yield to him. Of course, I have \ntremendous respect for him, but I don't agree with him on this \nparticular issue.\n  I want to address what one of my dearest friends in the Senate, \nSenator Inouye said. He said: I don't want to see our generals and \npeople who put their lives on the line for their country flying around \nin a commercial jet.\n  I totally understand that. I didn't disagree with him on that. I say \nto my friend from Hawaii that I personally don't want the generals \ntraveling around via United or TWA.\n  That is not what this is about. I want to make sure we have the \nappropriate number of operational support aircraft in the fleet. We \nknow--because the GAO took a long time investigating--that in fact the \njoint staff has not maintained records documenting its previous \nrequirement reviews, so it is not possible to determine whether some \noptions for reducing requirements were examined.\n  I say to my friend from Hawaii that the issue isn't that we shouldn't \nhave operational support aircraft. Of course, we have to and we must. \nBut why on Earth do we go ahead in this appropriations bill with \nlanguage identical to that which we saw last year which resulted in the \nAir Force going out with a proposal for six of the most expensive \nluxury jets? We now have the same language for nine jets. There is no \nlimit on language that the Navy or the Army can come back with. That is \nwhy we are structuring it. We are simply saying it would be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I am one of the people who, years ago when I was in the House, \nfound--I forget how much it was--I think it was an $11,000 coffeepot, \nsomething like that, and the expensive wrenches and spare parts the \nmilitary was using. Every time I got up on the floor of the House I was \ntruly lectured: You don't know what you are saying. There is no backup \nfor this. Eventually they believed we were right. They weren't going \nout for competitive bids for these spare parts.\n  I question no one in this Senate in terms of their wanting the best \ndefense we can have. But I don't think we get the best defense when we \nwaste dollars.\n  I am suggesting that the language in this appropriations bill, \nbelieve it or not, doesn't have a cap. Am I right on that point? It has \nno cap. It has no dollar figure. It only caps the number of aircraft to \nnine. But if they do what the Air Force did--Senator Stevens says they \nwon't, and perhaps they won't--but if they did do what the Air Force \nsaid, it would be almost one-half billion dollars.\n  Our amendment says strike that language. Let's have more of a review. \nLet's not waste money.\n  We weren't born yesterday. We know people love to travel in luxury. \nThere is not one person listening to this debate who wouldn't enjoy \nkicking back on this type of luxury jet.\n  Let's show a picture of it. That is not the question. But the issue \nis whether taxpayers have to spend that much money when we don't know \nwhat is in the requirements. We don't know what planes are in the Air \nForce, the Marines, or the Army. We do not have a study. It simply says \noperational support airlift requirements are not sufficiently \njustified. We don't know what is in the garage. Let's put it that way. \nThat was the verb I was looking for. We don't know what is in the \ngarage. Let's not go out and willy-nilly allow them to get an \nadditional nine aircraft. These are beautiful aircraft. There is no \nquestion they are wonderful. But we were told: Oh, well. Maybe the \nSenator from Alaska believed that he said he fully expected them to get \nthe Gulfstream. I remember the debate a little differently. The debate \nwas that we were not sure what they were going to wind up getting. They \nwere going to wind up getting these. Just because the Air Force has \nthem doesn't mean we have to have them in the Army. It doesn't mean we \nhave to have them in the Navy.\n\n  I think Senator Harkin was right. He said he knows airplanes. He \nknows aircraft. This is about luxury. What the military should be about \nis mission. What is the mission? What do we need and what do we have? \nThe GAO report clearly is telling us they do not know what they have.\n  I think it is rather embarrassing; they do not know what they have. \nYet we are going ahead as if everything was wonderful. No one on our \nside of the argument--we had over 30 people last time--has ever said \nthat we don't have anything but the greatest respect for our generals \nand our admirals. But we have respect for the taxpayers. Senators can \nargue with one another. I don't know what we appropriate for the GAO \nevery year, but they have some very smart investigators. They made an \ninvestigation and said: We don't know what they have.\n  Why should we get any more until we really know for sure?\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the operational support airlift fleet has \ndecreased from 520 in 1995 to 364 today. We are reducing the number of \nthese aircraft. Now we are starting a pilot project of leasing them to \nsee if we can save even more money. But we must go through the concept \nof replacing these aging aircraft.\n  By the way, one last comment as a pilot: People say: Well, they can \nland and take off, and they can land and take off, and they can land \nand take off. I am also a pilot. Every time you let down and land and \ntake off again, you use more fuel than if you fly straight through. \nThese planes are designed to save us money by having ``the legs,'' as \nwe call it, to go the distance and not have to stop and burn more fuel \nas they land and take off.\n  Does the Senator wish any more time?\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I serve notice that \nI intend to move to table the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I need to find out whether it is proper \nfor us to go ahead and have this vote now. We had intended to complete \nthe Wellstone amendment. Does it meet with the approval of both sides \nto proceed with this amendment now? I want to make a statement before \nwe have the rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been asked for.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, following this vote, I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 4 minutes equally divided on the Wellstone \namendment so the Senator can explain his amendment and we can respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Following that, it is my intention to move to go to \nthird reading and have final passage on this bill. I serve notice on \nall those involved that we will have a managers' package following the \nvote on this amendment before taking up the Wellstone amendment. If \nthere is no further objection, after the Wellstone amendment, we will \ngo to third reading and have final passage immediately after that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no further \nsecond-degree amendments to any amendment on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table \namendment No. 3311. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I thank the managers for accepting my \namendment making up to $3 million available to analyze the cost and \nfeasibility of restarting the production line for the U-2 aircraft at a \nproduction rate of two aircraft per year.\n  The U-2 has proven itself to be the workhorse of our airborne \nintelligence reconnaissance system. We saw the value of its \ncapabilities graphically demonstrated during the Kosovo air operation, \nwhere it was an integral part of the air strike mission. Unfortunately, \nthe Kosovo air operation also revealed how bare the cupboard is in \nterms of U-2 aircraft. The scarcity of U-2 aircraft in our inventory--\nfewer than three dozen operational aircraft--was sharply accentuated by \nthe Kosovo crisis. To move our U-2 assets into Kosovo, we were forced \ninto the difficult position of drawing down our U-2 capabilities in \nother theatres.\n  Would the Chairman agree that U.S. commanders-in-chief around the \nworld, including the Southern Command, which is in charge of \nintelligence relating to the drug war in Colombia, rely extensively on \nthe U-2 and yet lack the assets needed to completely fulfill their \nrequirements, so that even in the absence of a regional crisis such as \nKosovo, our U-2 resources are thinly stretched?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. We do, of course, have \nsatellites that provide regular intelligence, but in terms of special \nmissions and real-time needs on the ground, the reconnaissance \ncapabilities provided by aircraft such as the U-2 and UAV are \nirreplaceable.\n  Mr. BYRD. Given the current attrition rate of U-2 aircraft, \napproximately one a year, the situation will only worsen. Moreover, I \nunderstand that the research and development effort to develop unmanned \naerial vehicles such as Global Hawk, while promising, is still \nimmature. Yet we do not now have a U-2 production line in place to \nreplace the aircraft that we lose through attrition. In the interests \nof ensuring that we have an adequate inventory of reconnaissance \naircraft to meet the needs of the commanders-in-chief, would the \nChairman agree that it would be prudent for the Defense Department to \nkeep its options open and, at a minimum, prepare an analysis of the \ncost and feasibility of restarting the U-2 production line?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with the Senator. This is a matter on which the \nCommittee should seek more thorough analysis.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am hopeful that my amendment will provide that analysis. \nIt is my intent, and I hope the Chairman would agree, that the findings \nof this analysis should be provided to Congress in an unclassified \nreport prior to next April, when the next budget will be considered, so \nthat we will have the necessary information on which to base our \ndecisions.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree that such a report would be useful and timely, \nand I look forward to receiving it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the chairman for his attention and his support.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3340, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the operation of current Tethered Aerostat \n                       Radar System (TARS) sites)\n\n       On page 109, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8126.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can I go to third \nreading now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order for 4 minutes of debate on \nthe Wellstone amendment, followed by a vote on the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Following that, I will move to go to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Wellstone amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a $290 billion budget \naltogether. This amendment takes $1 billion from procurement, not from \nreadiness. This takes $1 billion. This overall budget is $3 billion \nmore than the President requested. It puts the money into the title I \nprogram.\n  This is a matter of priorities. This is a program that helps poor \nchildren in America, never mind that it helps them do better in school, \nnever mind that it helps them graduate, never mind that it helps them \ncontribute to our economy, never mind that it leads to less high school \ndropout, never mind it leads to less children winding up incarcerated \nand in prison.\n  Vote for this because most of these children are under 4 feet tall \nand they are all beautiful and they deserve our support.\n  The title I program is funded right now at a 35-percent level. This \nis a matter of priorities.\n  People in the country believe we should do better by these children. \nWe should do better by these children. It is $1 billion out of all the \nprocurement--$57 billion--that goes to children in title I.\n  I hope Senators will vote for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a strange circumstance. The \nSenator's amendment, really, would be subject to a point of order if we \nhad already raised the caps. We have not raised the caps, so this is \nnot the time to make a point of order. But it is the time to point out \nthat the Senator's amendment would move money from defense into \neducation, and it would violate the principle of the wall that we put \nup between defense and nondefense.\n  I do hope that the Senate will support the committee in voting to \ntable, and I do move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to table Wellstone \namendment No. 3366, as modified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a 10-minute vote; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, I was \njust asked why we didn't raise rule XVI to the amendments that were on \nthe list. Although they were introduced, they were not called up. So \nthe point of order has not been raised because they were not called up. \nI now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the Naval Academy Board of Visitors \nmeeting this week I learned that the Naval Academy is required to use \nfunds generated by the Visitor's Center to repay a long-term government \nloan. I believe that these funds would be better utilized by the \nMidshipmen Welfare Fund that supports extra-curricular activities not \ncovered by appropriated funds. Knowing of the strong leadership of the \nchairman and the Senator from Hawaii and support of our Service \nAcademies, I inquire as to whether they would be willing to review this \nrepayment program in conference, and if the facts merit, work to \neliminate this requirement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to assure the Senator that I will \nwork with him and the other interested members to ensure that this \nmatter is addressed in our conference in a manner that will provide a \nfavorable resolution for the Academy.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join with my chairman and will work to \nfavorably resolve this item in conference.\n\n\n                   C-5 Avionics Modernization Program\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the Chairman for \ntaking the time to discuss an issue that is very important to my \ncolleagues, myself, and national security--the modernization our \nstrategic airlift fleet.\n  In this year's Defense Appropriations report, there is a restriction \non using procurement funds for avionics upgrades of the C-5As. The \nReport also appears to restrict the High Pressure Turbine Replacements. \nI do not believe that was the Committee's intent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. The Committee does not believe this \nreport language limits replacing C-5 High Pressure Turbines. Those \nreplacements should occur to the entire C-5 fleet based on Defense \nDepartment requirements.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand, however, that the Committee is concerned \nabout the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) for the C-5 As. Just to \nclarify, there are two models of C-5s in the Air Force, 76 of the older \nA-model and 50 of the newer B-model. The C-5's mission is to take heavy \nloads over a long-distance. It is capable of carrying more cargo \nfarther than any other plane in the United States' military.\n  In particular, the C-5 regularly runs missions to and from Europe and \nthe Pacific and the United States. For this reason, compliance with the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization's rules in high-density \nflight areas is important for the entire fleet of C-5s. The AMP will \nbring C-5 aircraft into compliance with the new Global Air Traffic \nManagement (GATM) standards established by the International Civil \nAviation Organization. Compliance with GATM is important because it \nallows aircraft to use more operationally efficient airspace and lowers \noperational costs.\n  This is one of the reasons that the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices specifically requested that the Secretary of the Air Force \nproceed to test AMP upgrades on both A and B models in its Fiscal Year \n2001 Defense Authorization Report and that both defense committees in \nthe House of Representatives supported this program for the entire C-5 \nfleet.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Committee is aware of the new standards, but is \nconcerned that the Air Force is not investing in the proper mix of \nmodernization and new aircraft to meet our strategic airlift needs.\n  We are still waiting to receive the long overdue Mobility \nRequirements Study 2005 (MRS '05) that will clearly lay-out what our \nstrategic airlift needs will be for the foreseeable future. In \naddition, once that requirement is clear, we will get the Air Force \nAnalysis of Alternatives for Outsized/Oversized Airlift (AoA). This \nstudy will provide a clear understanding of what mix of aircraft will \nmost efficiently and effectively meet the operational requirements of \nthe military.\n\n  When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, \ntestified before our Committee, he expressed reservations about making \nfurther investments in the C-5A fleet.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I share the Senator's concern that we have still not \nreceived MRS '05 and the AoA. However, my conversations with the Air \nForce lead me to believe that both A and B model planes are expected to \nbe flown by the Air Force for 20 to 40 years to come, whether in \nActive-duty, Reserve, or Guard units.\n  While I know that no one in the Senate cares more about the safety of \nour military personnel than my colleague from Alaska, I remain \nconcerned that some increased risk will be incurred by aircrews flying \nplanes that have not had AMP upgrades. AMP also includes the \ninstallation of important safety features like Traffic Alert and \nCollision Avoidance System and an enhanced all weather navigational \nsystem, the Terrain Awareness and Warning System. Some of these systems \nwere mandated by Congress after the tragic death of Secretary Ron \nBrown.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct, I do not believe that the \nCommittee's language endangers any of our aircrews. Instead, it is a \ndelaying mechanism to prevent investing in these planes before we are \nsure that they will be flying for the next 20 years. If, in fact, these \nstudies suggest that, then we will take another look at the needs of \nthe A-models.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I appreciate that commitment by my colleague. I would also \nlike to clarify with the Senator from Alaska that he supports \nproceeding with AMP for the B-models.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In that case, I think it important to consider the \ndifficulty of proceeding with upgrading the C-5Bs without A models \navailable to do regular missions to Europe where the compliance issues \ncould become a problem.\n  In addition, if I am correct about the continued use of the C-5As for \ndecades to come, then not proceeding with the AMP for the A models will \ncreate a set of new problems.\n  First, efficient use of aircrew members and crew interfly will be \nprevented because of the dissimilarities that would exist between A and \nB model avionics and navigation systems. This is particularly \nproblematic when additional aircrew members are needed to meet Major \nTheater War requirements.\n  Second, by attempting to maintain two separate avionics and \nnavigation systems within the relatively small C-5 fleet (126 \nairplanes), additional spares and support equipment will be necessary \nwith increased unit costs.\n  Already, the C-5 has been particularly hard-hit by the lack of \nnecessary parts. This is likely to exacerbate that problem.\n\n  Last, the language will also create changes in the existing contracts \nfor these on-going programs. Until we know for sure what MRS '05 and \nthe AoA will say, creating this new difficulty does not make sense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again I say to the Senator that I think Chairman\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nShelton's testimony was very persuasive. He urged against using our \nscarce airlift resources on the A-model upgrades. However, my friend \nmakes a good point that changing the program at this point, before we \nreceive MRS '05 and the AoA may be premature. I am willing to re-\nexamine this issue when we go into the Conference with the House.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for taking another look at this \ncritical issue and again say that I agree with him on the need to get \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Air Force to submit their overdue \nstudies.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to follow-up on what my \ncolleague from Delaware has just mentioned.\n  First and foremost, I would like to thank the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for accepting my amendment No. 3352, which was \nco-sponsored by Senator Biden. This amendment restores full funding \n($92.5 million) for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funds \nfor C-5 modernization programs, including the C-5 Reliability \nEnhancement and Re-engining Program. This amendment, in addition to the \nCommittee recommendation of $95.4 million requested by the Pentagon in \nprocurement funds for C-5 modernization programs, will allow the \ncurrent C-5 Galaxy modernization programs to continue for the upcoming \nFiscal Year.\n  I would like to point out the only question that we are discussing \nnow is which C-5 Galaxies will be modernized. I would like to thank the \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee for clarifying the committee's \nposition on the C-5 High Pressure Turbine modernization. I also thank \nthe Chairman for agreeing to consider allowing the expenditure of \nprocurement funds for the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) on the \nC-5A models.\n  Just yesterday, I was at Dover Air Force Base, home to 26 C-5Bs and \n10 C-5As. Each year, the community leaders, the base leadership, and \nthe Delaware congressional delegation meet to discuss issues important \nto the Air Base. During a presentation by Colonel S. Taco Gilbert III, \nthe commander of the 436th Airlift Wing at Dover, he mentioned the \nimportance of this program for safely and efficiently operating the \nGalaxy.\n  The AMP will allow the C-5 to operate safely, effectively and more \nreliably. Features like the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance \nSystem (TCAS) and the Terrain Awareness and Warning System are \nimportant safety measures for the crews flying our C-5s. Bringing the \nC-5 into compliance with the Global Air Traffic Management standards \nwill allow the C-5 to use advantageous flight paths and reduce fuel \nconsumption and other costs. Finally, the new equipment will increase \nthe reliability rates for the C-5 Galaxy and allow off-the-shelf \nreplacements for hard to replace parts.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, my three colleagues have discussed in \ngreat detail the issues surrounding C-5A modernization efforts. I \nunderstand the Chairman's concern with modernizing the C-5A and believe \nthat we must take a serious look at how it fits into our nation's \nairlift requirements--an effort that is currently underway. At the same \ntime, I believe it is important for us to keep our options open and \nslowing C-5A modernization efforts now might prove costly in the \nfuture, for the very reasons given by the Senator from Delaware.\n  I am pleased that the Chairman is willing to re-examine this issue in \nconference. I am also thankful to the junior Senator from Delaware for \nhis leadership on this issue. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                               casa c-212\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to take a moment to discuss with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations the \npotential needs of the Army National Guard and the Special Forces \nGroups, in particular the 10th and the 20th Special Forces Groups, for \na short take-off and landing, fixed wing aircraft to meet their \ntraining and mission requirements. Special Forces units, in particular, \nrequire such aircraft to get in and out of ``hot spots'' and other \nsituations and areas where no landing field exists.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Maine \naddressing the utility of a multi-function short take-off and landing \nfixed wing aircraft for the Army National Guard and the Special Forces \nGroups.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am concerned that the Special Forces Groups and the \nArmy National Guard do not have sufficient aircraft available to meet \ntheir needs. In fact, I have been informed that, between October of \n1998 and September of 1999, the 10th and the 20th Special Forces Groups \ncould not support 23 missions because of the lack of aviation support \navailable. As such, I would ask that the Army National Guard and the \nSpecial Forces Groups assess their needs for a short take-off and \nlanding fixed wing aircraft and, in particular, the C-212 STOL fixed \nwing aircraft. I ask further that the Army National Guard and the \nSpecial Forces Groups report to Congress on the results of their \nassessments within six months so that we can determine whether funds \nshould be appropriated in fiscal year 2002 for the purchase of such \naircraft. Mr. Chairman, do you support such an assessment and report to \nCongress?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do and will be interested in personally reviewing the \nreports in advance of the fiscal year 2002 appropriations cycle. I \nthank my colleague for her dedication and commitment to the armed \nforces.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his continued \nsupport for our nation's national defense.\n\n\n              title III: shipbuilding and conversion, navy\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I seek recognition with the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from \nAlaska to discuss a very important matter to our national security. \nBoth the House and Senate versions of the FY2001 national Defense \nauthorization bill contain provisions that supported the President's \nbudget request and authorized $1.51 billion for Navy procurement of two \nLPD-17 amphibious ships in FY2001.\n  The LPD-17 program is a critical ship for the modernization of the \nNavy's amphibious force. It will carry more than 700 Marines and the \nequipment and means for them to get ashore and perform their mission--\nwhether that mission is combat related, peacekeeping or in response to \ncrisis throughout the world. It is a Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``there are no \nunderutilized amphibious ships,'' and the testimony by Lieutenant \nGeneral Rhodes before the Seapower Subcommittee where he stated that \n``the operational flexibility and forward presence our Amphibious Ready \nGroups represent will be significantly enhanced with the FY03 delivery \nof the first of 12 LPD-17 amphibious ships.'' He further stated, \n``these ships will overcome amphibious lift shortfalls.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Maine, in recognition of the importance of the LPD-\n17 program and the importance of these ships to the overall \nmodernization program of the Navy and Marine Corps. During \nconsideration of the FY2001 Defense appropriations bill, concern \nregarding delays in the design and construction of the lead LPD ship at \nthe lead shipyard led to a decision by the Committee to defer funding \nfor the fifth and sixth ship of the class. The Committee did, however, \nrecommend a total of $485 million for this program.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Alaska's \nsupport for the LPD-17 program, and would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss with the distinguished chairman the critical need for these \nships.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have always been a supporter of the LPD-17 program and \nthe Committee very much appreciates the need for the lift capacity of \nthis ship. In fact, it is my understanding that the San Antonio and her \n11 sister ships will be the functional replacement for four classes of \nolder amphibious ships. And in 2008, when the last LPD-17 class ship is \nscheduled to join the fleet, the amphibious force will consist of 36 \nships or 12 three-ship Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs) consisting of one \nLHA or LHD, one LPD and one LSD.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for making that point. As I \ndiscussed during the debate last week on the fiscal year 2001 Defense \nAuthorization bill, the Armed Services Committee is working hard to \ncome to terms with the force levels necessary\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nto accomplish the many missions our Navy and Marine Corps are called on \nto accomplish.\n  The increase to war fighting capability that LPD-17 brings is \ncritical to our naval force's future success. The LPD-17's ability to \naccommodate new equipment, such as the Advanced Amphibious Assault \nVehicle (AAAV), the Landing Craft Air Cushioned Vehicle (LCAC) and the \nvertical lift MV-22, and the remarkable communications, integrated \ncomputer technology and quality of life improvements are the qualities \nof the ship that the Marine Corps and Navy need to support the National \nStrategy and the Marine Corps' doctrine of Operational Maneuver From \nThe Sea.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Maine for her work to establish \nand hold the necessary shipbuilding rate for the nation's defense. I \nalso recognize that the sustained investment of $10 to $12 billion in \nthe shipbuilding account is necessary to maintain a minimum \nshipbuilding rate of 8.7 ships per year.\n  Specifically, in regard to the LPD-17 program, the committee \nrecognizes that the Navy has never employed such a rigorous new \napproach for a new class of ships--wherein the goal is to have 95 \npercent of the design work completed before construction begins, rather \nthan much lower levels in previous designs. This is an important fact, \nbecause it means the design work will lead to efficient construction of \nthese ships, and set the standard for the next generation ship designs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As always I am impressed by the chairman's knowledge and \nhis grasp of the issues. We have worked closely over the past few weeks \nto determine how the Navy and industry stand in regard to their \nprogress with this new ship class, and I appreciate that we are in \nagreement as to the value and need for this critical ship. I look \nforward to our continued work together in support of this program.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague for her dedication to this issue. \nDuring our trip to the shipyard in her state to examine new facilities \nand to meet with company officials first hand, I was impressed with the \nlevel of leadership, innovation, workmanship and coordination. I am \nalso encouraged by information that has been forthcoming from the Navy \nand industry regarding their progress in resolving possible LPD-17 \nprogram management issues. It is my intent that should additional \nfunding become available, it will be applied to the uninterrupted \nconstruction of these necessary ships.\n  Ms. SNOW. Again, I thank the chairman for his forthrightness, his \nknowledge and his desire to keep American strong. I would also like to \ncommend him for his continued dedicated efforts to our men and women in \nuniform and the efforts he has undertaken in this most important \nappropriations bill to provide them with the compensation, tools and \nequipment they need to maintain America's pre-eminence in the world.\n\n\n                    sustainable green manufacturing\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sustainable \nGreen Manufacturing initiative. This is an important effort to help the \nArmy reduce pollution in its key manufacturing processes by introducing \nclean technologies and techniques onto production lines. Partners in \nthis initiative include the TACOM Armament Research and Development and \nEngineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, the National Defense Center \nfor Environmental Excellence, The New Jersey Institute of Technology, \nand the Physical Science Laboratory of New Mexico State University.\n  Mr. President the objectives of this initiative include the promotion \nof sound environmental principles in design, material selection and \nmanufacturing of Army products; the reduction of Army costs throughout \nthe product life-cycle by efficient use of resources; the development \nof sound and environmentally benign manufacturing practices by using \nthe highest quality science and technology and applying these \npractices, methods and materials to the acquisition process. The House \nprovide $7 million for this program in its Appropriation Bill and I \nurge the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye to work during conference to provide this level of \nfunding for this important program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me assure my colleague from New Jersey that I am \naware of this important effort and I will do what I can in conference \nto ensure that the Sustainable Green program receives funding in \nFY2001.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I too want to tell my friend from New Jersey that I will \nwork with our chairman in conference to ensure funding for this \nimportant program.\n\n\n              configuration management information system\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to bring the Senate's \nattention to an important initiative called the Configuration \nManagement Information system. CMIS was developed in an effort to \nprovide the Department of Defense with a standard system that addresses \nthe configuration structure and management requirements of complex \nmilitary weapons systems, to include their hardware and software. \nOriginally developed in 1990 to support Military Sealift Command's \nconfiguration management requirements, the CMIS architecture was \nidentified as the best CM database structure across all DOD. CMIS has \nprogressed through a series of incremental development cycles to \ninclude demonstrating compliance with Y2K requirements. Currently, \nresponsibility for the CMIS database architecture is assigned to the \nNaval Air Systems Command for deployment into the operational \nenvironment.\n  Xeta International Corporation has been tasked by the CMIS Program \nManagement Office to identify platforms of weapons systems data for \nmigration into CMIS. These platforms include the EA-6B, F-14, H-60, DD-\n21, DDG-51, F-15, and F-16. Additionally, Xeta has been tasked with the \nresponsibility to liaise and collect this data from various DOD Program \nManagement Offices throughout the military. Xeta extracts the \nconfiguration management data from existing legacy databases, \nengineering drawings and other technical documentation in an effort to \naccurately populate data fields within the CMIS architecture. Once \npopulated, this ``cradle-to-grave'' configuration management repository \nis utilized in many ways by a variety of DOD offices as well as \ncontractors in order to accurately configure the product and to support \nlife cycle maintenance of the weapons systems platforms. Additionally, \nXeta has been tasked to develop a CMIS security capability (to include \na multilevel secure computer environment) when operating in a Local or \nWide Area Network (LAN/WAN).\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, no additional funds were included in \nthe Senate bill for this project. I would like to ask my friend from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, whether he is aware of these potential \nshortfalls?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate being made aware of the \nimportance of the CMIS project, and that this program's goal will \nultimately lead to great savings to the services by decreasing life \ncycle costs of a variety of weapon systems.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for \nthose remarks. I concur that this is a project important for both \nLouisiana and the services. For that reason, I hope the Senator from \nAlaska would agree that the funding of this project should be a \npriority within the Navy's Operations and Maintenance accounts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, CMIS needs support to be fully realized. \nThe Department of the Navy should ensure that the funds within the \nPresident's budget are applied to this priority. I am hopeful that \nadditional funds can be made available to fully implement CMIS.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, again, I thank the chairman, and I look \nforward to working with him on this project.\n\n\n                         defense health program\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, and the ranking minority, the senior Senator from \nHawaii, for their long and effective leadership in evolving the Defense \nHealth Program. The Senate bill added nearly $700 million to the \nPresident's request, funding the total Defense Health Program at $12.1 \nbillion for FY01. And, of great importance to me and many other members \nof this body, the Committee has once again committed the Department of \nDefense's medical science capabilities to the management\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nof a major cancer research program, extending to breast, prostate, \ncervical, lung, and other cancers. There is over $330 million in this \nbill dedicated to cancer-related research.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of the distinguished chairman \nand the ranking minority member an important area of cancer research--\nthe investigation of genealogical and genetic databases that can \nuncover medical precursors to cancer in humans. My state of Utah has a \nhistory of genealogical research that is known to the millions of \nAmericans who routinely visit the family history websites that \noriginate from Utah. But millions of Americans are also potentially \nbenefiting from a lesser known program. This program is currently \ndeveloping a genealogical database that will help identify and predict \ngenetic structures associated with the development and, hopefully, \nprevention of, cancer.\n  Mr. President, I wish to make you aware of the Utah Population \nDatabase which if a very promising development in the area of \ngenealogical research related to cancer. This data base is housed at \nthe University of Utah where scientists are learning to use this unique \ncomprehensive genealogical set of data to help predict, detect, treat, \nand prevent cancer. I am therefore asking the distinguished chairman \nand ranking minority member to support the continued development and \nuse of the Utah Population Database by increasing the University of \nUtah's program for genealogical cancer research in the coming fiscal \nyear by an additional $12.5 million.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Utah for \nhis kind remarks. The ranking member and I remain fully committed to \ncontinuing DOD participation in the national cancer research program. I \nwant to assure the Senator that National Cancer Institute-designated \ncomprehensive cancer centers, like the Huntsman Cancer Institute of \nUtah, are an important part of cancer research and a necessary element \nto the DOD effort. I find the Senator's request entirely reasonable and \nintend to assist this anticancer effort.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from Utah for \nhis continuing support of this committee's effort to expand and improve \ncancer research. This is an important topic in my state of Hawaii, \nwhere the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Hawaii has \nbeen long committed to finding treatments for the many varieties of \ncancer common not only to Hawaii but to the rest of the nation. I \nstrongly support the commitment of the chairman to the request made by \nthe Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                   navy information technology center\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks for \nthe manager's package that provides an additional fifteen million \ndollars in Navy O and RDT funding for the Navy Information \nTechnology Center (ITC) in New Orleans.\n  This additional funding represents an important portion of the \nrequest made by myself and the senior Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux. The Appropriations Committee's action ensures that the Navy and \nDefense-wide Human Resource Enterprise Strategy programs will continue \nat the Navy's Information Technology Center (ITC) in New Orleans.\n  This funding provides for the further consolidation of Navy active \nduty and reserve personnel legacy information systems and enables the \ncontinuing transition of all Navy manpower and personnel systems into \nthe enterprise-wide human resource strategy. However, I should stress \nthat this is not simply a Navy program, but has taken on defense-wide \nsignificance under the leadership of the Program Executive Officer for \nInformation Technology, Joe Scipriano, and his team located at the ITC \nin New Orleans.\n  I want to express deep gratitude to Chairman Stevens and our ranking \nmember of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Daniel \nInouye. Thanks also go to professional staff Steven Cortese, Charles \nHouy, Tom Hawkins, Gary Reese, and Kraig Siracuse.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we are excited in Louisiana that the \n``enterprise strategy'' we are developing for human resources systems \nis recognized by the Appropriations Committee as a model for other \nservice and DOD wide information systems. All of these legacy systems \nneed to be modernized to become cost effective and interoperable. The \ncommittee's support for our efforts, and for other information \ntechnology additions to this bill, confirm the need to restructure and \ncoordinate all of our service and DOD wide information systems. Only by \ndoing so can we provide real-time information to our warfighters that \nimproves both readiness and effectiveness of our troops.\n  The ITC in New Orleans was just recently chartered as part of the \nNavy's year old Program Executive Office for Information Technology and \nEnterprise Management (PEO/IT). Specifically, the ITC is designated by \nthe Navy's PEO/IT as the ``primary support command for enterprise \nsoftware development.''\n  The PEO/IT is the Navy's only PEO for Information Technology and has \nbeen delegated authority for the Navy Marine Corps Intranet, Enterprise \nAcquisition Management, the ITC, the Defense Integrated Military Human \nResources System (DIMHRS), and other information technology programs. \nThe PEO/IT's authority over these programs was chartered in November \n1999, well after the FY 2001 DOD budget process had commenced.\n  Interim and additional funding for the ITC in New Orleans is critical \nin FY 2001. This funding will ensure that the ITC can continue to \nprovide the Navy and DOD's unique enterprise strategy integration \nefforts. Only by pursuing this strategy can we guarantee that current \nhuman resources information systems and future systems are developed, \nintegrated and managed in accordance with the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 \nand other OMB initiatives based on the Government Performance Results \nAct. This enterprise strategy develops and integrates new and current \nlegacy information systems so that they will all be interoperable and \nprovide our service personnel and commanders in the field real-time, \nusable, human resource data about training, experience, and other human \nresource data from which our commanders can make deployment decisions, \nfulfill combat mission requirements, and improve readiness.\n  Again Mr. President, I thank the chairman, and our ranking member, \nthe senior Senator from Hawaii, for recognizing the importance of this \neffort. I look forward to working with them in future years to provide \nfor its continued success.\n\n\n   Nonlinear Acoustic Landmine Detection research and development at \n                    Stevens Institute of Technology\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens an important Army research and development \neffort in nonlinear acoustic landmine detection being done at Stevens \nInstitute of Technology in New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, let me begin my thanking Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye for their leadership last year in working with me to obtain $1 \nmillion in funds to initiate this very promising effort, in which \nengineers at the Stevens Institute of Technology are applying expertise \nin non-linear acoustic phenomena to develop a new method for detection \nof mines and other buried man-made objects. The technology can \ndifferentiate between rocks, other solid objects, and actual land \nmines. This will improve landmine removal safety and speed, and \ncontribute to our efforts to save lives and prevent injuries. With an \nadditional $3 million the Stevens Institute can fully land this \ntechnology's development, which has so much promise for protecting our \nmilitary personnel as well as civilian populations.\n  Although the allocation's situation we faced in the Appropriations \nCommittee in considering the DOD Appropriations measure made it very \ndifficult to fund this effort, I look forward to working with Chairman \nStevens and Senator Inouye in conference to continue this research \neffort. It is my understanding that the House has included $1.4 million \nrelated to this effort, half of which is intended specifically for the \nresearch and development at Stevens. But given the great life-saving \npromise of this technology, I hope to work with Chairman Stevens and \nSenator Inouye in achieving an increase of $3 million for the Stevens \nInstitute of Technology effort. In this regard, I yield to Senator \nStevens for his thoughts on this effort.\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Launtenberg's point is well taken \nregarding research and development effort for nonlinear acoustic \nlandmine detection research. I worked with Senator Lautenberg and \nSenator Inouye on getting this effort startled last year. Although this \nyear's allocation prevented us from providing the necessary funding \nduring the committee consideration, I am committed to working in \nconference towards the goal of an additional $3 million for the Stevens \nInstitute effort for FY 2001. This could be an important breakthrough \nthat can save lives, both among our service men and women and civilian \npopulations. I yield to Senator Inouye for his thoughts on the \ninitiative.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, last year I was pleased to work with \nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Stevens to provide the startup funds for \nresearch and development effort for nonlinear acoustic landmine \nDetection research, which is being done at Stevens Institute of \nTechnology in New Jersey. This work promises to dramatically improve \nmine detection, and in so doing prevent serious injury and save lives. \nI am committed to working with Senator Lautenberg and Chairman Stevens \ntowards the goal of a $3 million increase for the Stevens Institute \neffort during conference with the House.\n\n\n                      closed disposal technologies\n\n  Mr. REID. I thank my colleagues and good friends from Alaska and \nHawaii for their hard work on this bill. This is an important bill, a \ngood bill, and I commend their efforts.\n  I rise to engage the senior Senator from Alaska in a colloquy on an \nimportant issue. Recent studies have suggested that civilians living \nnear Army Depots which dispose of munitions through open burning and \nopen detonation (OB/OD) suffer from cancer and other maladies at rates \nhigher than would normally be expected. I have asked the Secretary of \nthe Army to study whether open burning represents a health risk to \ncivilian communities, and he has agreed to do so. This study will not \nbe completed for some months.\n  In the meantime, the Army should be studying possible alternative \ndisposal methods to open burning that are environmentally sealed and \nare not open to the atmosphere, and evaluate whether open burning \nshould eventually be phased out over time in favor of other, safer \napproaches. In the event that evidence shows open burning to be \ndangerous to civilians, these alternatives would give the Army and the \nCongress a range of alternatives that they will be able to quickly \nconsider and rapidly implement in order to minimize the danger to the \npublic.\n  I would ask the Senator from Alaska if he would seek to include \nlanguage in the conference report to accompany this bill directing the \nArmy to conduct such a study?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the senior Senator from Nevada. I believe that \nCongress has a responsibility to ensure that the military conducts its \noperations in a manner that does not pose an undue health and safety \nrisk on the population. I support your proposal, and will seek to \ninclude this language in the conference report to the FY01 Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator, and look forward to working with him \non this important matter.\n\n\n                                 motby\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye the situation at the Military Ocean Terminal \nBayonne (MOTBY). As the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Defense Subcommittee recall this military facility was closed as a \nresult of the 1995 round of the BRAC Commission closings resulting in \nthe loss of 3,000 jobs and economic hardship in Bayonne and Hudson \nCounty. The environmental and infrastructure problems existing at the \nbase at the time of its closure were enormous and not completely \ndisclosed or maybe not completely known by the Army.\n  I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their help in \nproviding $7 million for MOTBY last year for demolition and removal of \nfacilities, buildings and structures. This funding was critical for \nMOTBY as it struggles to deal with the substantial environmental and \ninfrastructure problems left by the Army when it left the base. But, \nMr. President, there is so much left to be done. Among the problems \nremaining are significant amounts of friable asbestos in dozens of \nbuildings, major leaks in the water and sewer systems, contamination of \nthe land and ground water and piers that are structurally unsafe and in \ndanger of collapsing into the water.\n  Mr. President, $5 million is contained in the House appropriations \nbill for stabilization of the South Berths at MOTBY. I strongly urge \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member to uphold the House \nposition of $5 million for the MOTBY South Berths in conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from New Jersey \nthat I am aware of the environmental and infrastructure problems at \nMOTBY and I was pleased to join last year with the ranking member, \nSenator Inouye, and the Senator from New Jersey to be able to provide \nfunding to address some of these problems last year. I understand that \nthe other body has $5 million for stabilization of the South Berths at \nMOTBY. Let me assure my friend from New Jersey that I will do what I \ncan in conference to provide significant additional funding for FY \n2001.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues from Alaska and New \nJersey for support of additional funding for MOTBY and will join with \nSenator Stevens to ensure that we do what we can in conference to \nenable this to happen.\n\n\n                                 lpd 17\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee the provision of \nthe FY 2001 Defense appropriations bill that defers full funding for \ntwo LPD 17 class vessels. The Landing Platform Dock (LPD) 17, San \nAntonio class, is the latest class of amphibious force ship for the \nUnited States Navy. This ship shoulders the critical mission of \ntransporting marines, helicopters, and air-cushioned landing craft to \ntrouble spots around the world. Moreover, the LPD 17 is a model of \nacquisition reform.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about the deferral of funds that \nwould have been used to procure two LPD 17 class ships in fiscal year \n2001. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, what is \nthe nature of your commitment to this program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me state at the outset, unequivocally, that I fully \nand strongly support the LPD 17 program, a program for which the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Maine has been an effective advocate. \nAs I stated in my opening remarks to this bill, I am committed to \nseeing the program progress and delivery to the Navy of no fewer than \nthe required twelve ships. The recommendation the committee has made \nand the language in bill is intended to stabilize the design of the \nprogram fiscal year 2001. It does not reflect a lessening of our \ncommitment to the program itself, in its entirety.\n  I agree with my dear friend and colleague that the LPD 17 is a \ncritical program for the Navy and Marine Corps service members and that \nit continues to provide our marines essential transport to troubled \nareas around the world.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chairman, shipbuilders in my home State and others \nhave stressed the criticality of the LPD 17 Program to their workforce \nover the next six to eight years as they strive to transition \nsuccessfully between maturing programs and the construction of the next \ngeneration of ships. I am concerned that any delay in the LPD 17 \nschedule may, in fact, affect the rates and costs of the various Navy \nshipbuilding programs and cause workers to lose their jobs. How have \nyou addressed these concerns in this bill?\n  Mr. STEVENS. My friend has raised excellent points. I have been \nbriefed on these technical and programmatic concerns and have discussed \nthem with both the Department of Defense (Navy) and the industry teams. \nThey have both presented their projected impacts of the appropriations \nprovision and mark on the program. However, the recommendation of the \ncommittee is to get the program back on a stable track with a stable \ndesign. This bill provides some $200 million in order to ensure that \nthere will be no interruption in work at the affected shipyards.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for his clarifications. Let me also express my deep \nadmiration for the chairman's outstanding\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nleadership and for his steadfast support for our nation's national \ndefense.\n\n\n                            HURRICANE FLOYD\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past week, there has been a \ngreat deal of misinformation emanating from the ivory towers of liberal \nnewspaper editors in North Carolina. They have made futile attempts to \nplace blame for what they describe as the ``stalled'' aid to Eastern \nNorth Carolina victims of Hurricane Floyd. The tone and the substance \nof those editors are mystifying when we consider that North Carolina \nhas been specified by the federal government to receive more than $2 \nbillion in federal aid.\n  There are some politicians who are feeding the editors false and \nmisleading information while they themselves know better. They complain \nabout politics, even though their actions clearly suggest they \nthemselves are practicing politics in its very worst form. I am \ndismayed that much of the false and unfair criticism has focused on \nsome distinguished Senate colleagues, who have done far more for North \nCarolina's flood victims than the political finger-pointers.\n  One in particular who has done much for North Carolina is the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nStevens, who has been deeply and consistently concerned with the plight \nof the flood victims. Since the day Hurricane Floyd struck North \nCarolina, nobody has shown more concern or been more willing to help \nthan Ted Stevens. He has stood with us every step of the way, and I \nshall never forget his friendship and his compassion.\n  And if I may impose Senator Stevens one more time, may I engage him \nin a colloquy to set the record straight? First, is it not correct that \nthe Senate, under the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, \ndirected more than $800 million in federal aid to go to flood victims \nthis past fall not long after the flood hit Eastern North Carolina?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is it not correct that this 1999's aid package of more \nthan $800 million was in addition to nearly $1 billion of federal \ndisaster aid directed to North Carolina through established federal \ndisaster programs?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is it not correct that the Senate, with only one \ndissenting vote, approved, in October 1999, $81 million in payments to \nfarmers, but the House refused to follow the Senate's action because \nNorth Carolina tobacco farmers would benefit?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is it not correct that the Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, along with the Majority Leader, Mr. Lott, have made clear \ntheir intent to include additional emergency natural disaster aid-- \nincluding the aforementioned $81 million for farmers--in the Military \nConstruction Conference Report?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. That is our intention.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is it not correct that the Military Construction bill is \nlikely to be the first appropriations bill to reach the President's \ndesk for signature?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. That appears to be a likely \noutcome.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chairman. He is always candid, always helpful, \nand an outstanding Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I \nam genuinely grateful for his concern for the flood victims of North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from \nNorth Carolina. He has been diligent in reminding us of the plight \nfacing the flood victims of North Carolina, and I appreciate his strong \ninterest in making sure that additional aid is forthcoming as quickly \nas possible.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I just wanted to briefly comment on this \nyear's Defense bill, and my decision to support it. Last year I came to \nthe floor and was forced to oppose the bill after the Budget Committee \nengaged in some accounting hijinks in order to squeeze an extra $7 \nbillion into the Defense budget. Even though the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated that the bill would exceed the Budget Resolution, the \nBudget Committee used an accounting gimmick to get around the rules. \nBudget gimmicks do more damage than just allowing the Congress to \nengage in irresponsible spending. Gimmicks delude the American people, \nand destroy their faith in the process.\n  Last year we crowed loudly about the savings in the Budget \nResolution, and then quietly added extra money back into the budget all \nyear long. One of the biggest offenders was the Defense Appropriations \nbill.\n  This year, however, things are different. While I did not support the \nBudget Resolution, at least this year the Defense bill is abiding by \nthe level set out in the Resolution. At least this year we are being \nhonest about how much will be spent on Defense. There are no gimmicks, \nno smoke and mirrors. I applaud Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye for \ntheir efforts this year to stay within their budget allocation. It was \nnot easy, it never is, but they were successful.\n  The bill before us is still three billion dollars above the \nPresident's request, but I reluctantly support the bill. It is a more \nresponsible bill than years past. Not only do we strengthen our \ncommitment to our soldiers and their family through improvements in the \nhousing allowance and a 3.7 percent pay increase, but we also face up \nto our overseas commitments. For the first time Congress and the \nDepartment of Defense have included funding, roughly $4.2 billion, for \nour operations in Iraq and Bosnia. Next year we will not be called on \nto furnish emergency funding for an operation that is not a surprise, \nnot unplanned, and while dangerous, it is not an emergency. I am \npleased that we are including these funds in the bill.\n  Like all my colleagues, I am very concerned about how much we spend \non our defense and where we spend it. I believe that the greatest \nassets funded in the Defense budget are our people, and that we need to \ndo more to let them know how much their country values them. This bill \nmoves in that direction, and it does that in an honest and aboveboard \nmanner.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to address the issue of \nwasteful spending in appropriations measures, in this case the bill \nfunding the Department of Defense. A careful review of this bill \nreveals that the obvious deleterious implications of pork-barrel \nspending on our national defense continue to be ignored by Congress. I \nfind it absolutely unconscionable that I have had to fight so hard to \nsecure $6 million per year to eliminate the food stamp Army while the \ndefense appropriations bill before us today includes over $4 billion in \nwasteful, unnecessary spending that was not included in the Pentagon's \nbudget request and, in most instances, is not reflected in the ever-\nexpanding unfunded requirements lists.\n  In point of fact, it would appear from this bill that there is no \nsense of propriety at all when it comes to spending the taxpayers \nmoney. With the armed forces stretched thin as a result of 15 years of \ndeclining budgets while deployments have expanded exponentially, how \ncan we stand before the public with a collective straight face when we \npass a budget funding those very same armed forces that includes \nlanguage ``urging'' the Secretary of Defense ``to take steps to \nincrease the Department's use of cranberry products in the diet of on-\nbase personnel and troops in the field.'' ``Such purchases,'' the \nlanguage goes on to say, ``should prioritize cranberry products with \nhigh cranberry content such as fresh cranberries, cranberry sauces and \njellies, and concentrate and juice with over 25 percent cranberry \ncontent.''\n  Mr. President, what heretofore shall be referred to as ``the \ncranberry incident'' must be an attempt at humor on someone's part. \nWhen I read through a defense spending bill, I see hundreds of millions \nof dollars earmarked for such programs and activities as the \ndevelopment of a small aortic catheter, marijuana eradication inside \nthe United States, and the recovery of Civil War vessels on the bottom \nof Lake Champlain. I see every single year money earmarked for the \nBrown Tree Snake. I see a list of unrequested programs added to the \nbudget that includes such items as the Alaska Federal Health Care \nNetwork, the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network, the Pacific Islands \nHealth Care Referral Program, the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Fort \nWainwright utilidors, and Fort Greely runway repairs. Was the $300\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nmillion in the budget for the Pearl Harbor shipyard so inadequate that \nan additional $24 million had to be added, four times the amount needed \nto remove military families from the rolls of those eligible for food \nstamps?\n  Fifteen million dollars was added for the Maui Space Surveillance \nSystem--$15 million--to improve our ability to track asteroids. I do \nnot intend to minimize the importance of such activities, but only the \ncast of Star Trek could conceivably have looked at a list of military \nfunding shortfalls and concluded that a total of $19 million had to be \nin the fiscal year 2001 budget for this purpose. And whether $9.5 \nmillion should be earmarked for the West Virginia National Guard is, of \ncourse, open to question.\n\n  Mr. President, I voted against the defense authorization bill in \ncommittee because of my frustration at that measure's failure to \ninclude vital quality of life initiatives for our active duty \nmilitary--initiatives that were thankfully accepted when the bill moved \nto the Floor. And that bill included less than the companion \nappropriations bill does in unneeded and wasteful spending. I dislike \nthe annual earmarks for hyperspectral research in the authorization \nbill as much as the ones in the appropriations measure, and the \nauthorizers similarly demonstrate an absence of fiscal restraint in \nthrowing money at chem-bio detectors of questionable merit, and the $9 \nmillion in the authorization bill for the Magdalena Ridge Observatory \nis every bit as deserving of skepticism as the money in the \nappropriations bill for the aforementioned Maui program, but, on the \nwhole, the authorizers adhered more closely to the unfunded \nrequirements lists than did the appropriators, who seem to have missed \nthe idea.\n  Mention should also be made of the growing corruption of the \nintegrity of the process by which the budget request and the unfunded \npriority lists are assembled. To the extent that repeated efforts at \nshining a light on pervasive and damaging pork-barrel spending has \nborne fruit, it further cannot be denied that the problem, to a certain \ndegree, has merely been pushed underground. Like the speakeasies and \nbathtub gin of an earlier era, the insatiable appetite in Congress for \npork has been increasingly reflected in the amount of political \npressure placed on the services to include unneeded projects in the \nbudget request and on the unfunded priorities lists. The integrity of \nthe budget process is under increasing assault, and the national \ndefense cannot help but suffer for our weakness for pork.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when my appearances on the \nSenate floor for the purpose of deriding pork-barrel spending are no \nlonger necessary. There have been successes along the way, but much \nmore needs to be done. There is $4 billion in unrequested programs in \nthe defense appropriations bill. Combine what that $4 billion could buy \nwith the savings that could be accrued through additional base closings \nand more cost-effective business practices and the problems of our \narmed forces, be they in terms of force structure or modernization, \ncould be more assuredly addressed. The public demands and expects \nbetter of us. It remains my hope that they will one day witness a more \nresponsible budget process. For now, unfortunately, they are more \nlikely to witness errant asteroids shooting through the skies like tax \ndollars through the appropriations process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill \nbefore us today. I would like to sincerely thank Senators Stevens and \nInouye for their strong leadership on the Defense Subcommittee. I also \nwould like to recognize the diligence and professionalism of the staff \non this Committee.\n  Every year this Committee goes through the difficult exercise of \ntrying to allocate sufficient funds to provide for our nation's \ndefense. These decisions require balancing carefully between present \nand future, people and technologies.\n  This year, despite the fact that this appropriations bill provides \nover $3.1 billion more than was in the President's budget request and \n$20 billion more than the FY 2000 appropriation, the decisions to fund \nthe wide array of critical Defense priorities were just as difficult as \nin the past. Despite these challenges the Committee has put together a \ncomprehensive bill that meets many of the most pressing needs of the \nNational Defense and remains within the constraints of the budget \nauthority and outlay limits established in the 302(b) allocation.\n  I would like to briefly mention some of the most important aspects of \nour defense addressed in this spending package.\n  The bill provides $287.6 billion in new spending authority for the \nDepartment of Defense for FY 2001. In parallel with the Defense \nAuthorization, the bill funds a 3.7 percent pay raise, new increases in \nrecruiting and retention benefits, strengthens our missile defense \nprogram, boosts the Army Transformation Initiative, and provides a long \nawaited pharmacy benefit for our military retirees.\n  The bill also provides approximately $4.1 billion in the Overseas \nContingency Operations Transfer Fund, almost double the funding \nprovided in last year's bill. It is our hope that the Department of \nDefense will now have ample resources to conduct unforseen \ncontingencies and protect the resources we provide in this bill for \ntraining and combat readiness.\n  There is good news for the Research and Development appropriation. \nThe Committee approved $39.6 billion, an increase of $1.74 billion over \nthe budget request. The Ballistic Missile Defense Program alone \nreceived an additional $4.35 billion. These resources will help prevent \nerosion of the scientific and technological foundation of our armed \nforces.\n  The Committee also provided for items that will ensure that New \nMexico based defense installations and programs remain robust. I would \nlike to briefly highlight some of the items that received funding in \nthe appropriations bill.\n  Of the increase in Operation and Maintenance funding provided by the \ncommittee an additional $5.1 million is included to maintain and \nupgrade the Theater Air Command and Control Simulation Facility. This \nis the largest warfighter-in-the-loop air defense simulation system in \noperation and proudly operated by the 58th Special Operations Wing at \nKirtland Air Force Base. Another $8 million will upgrade the MH-53J \nhelicopter simulator to include Interactive Defensive Avionics System/\nMulti-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal capability. Both of these \nprojects will strengthen and support our Air Force's readiness and \ncapabilities.\n  American dominance relies heavily on our technological superiority. \nThe Committee recognizes this and, therefore, supported substantial \nincreases to Research and Development funding above the President's \nrequest. Of this, an additional $24.4 million will go to the High \nEnergy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands Missile Range to \nsupport advanced weapons development and transformation initiatives for \nsolid state laser technology. The Theater High Energy Laser anti-\nmissile program, successfully tested last week at White Sands also \nreceived an additional $15 million. Finally, the Airborne Laser \nprogram's budget was fully restored with an increase of $92 million. \nABL is the Air Force's flagship program in directed energy weapons \nsystems. Keeping this missile defense potential on track is vital to \nour demonstration of the role lasers can play in future defense \ncapabilities.\n  The Committee also recognized the active and reserve Army's need for \nlighter, more mobile command and control vehicles. Therefore, the bill \nfunds a $63 million increase to the Warfighter Information Network \nprogram to produce these communications shelters; Laguna Industries \nmanufactures these shelters.\n  The bill includes many other New Mexico defense activities. An \nadditional $16 million will be provided for the Information Operations \nWarfare and Vulnerability Assessment work of the Army Research \nLaboratory at White Sands. The Committee also provided $10 million for \nthe Magdalena Ridge Observatory and $5.3 million to combat the threat \nof terrorism with radio frequency weapons.\n  With the help of my colleagues new technology has a strong foothold \nin New Mexico and I thank them for supporting us in our endeavors. \nThere are more hurdles ahead of us but each step takes us closer to our \nultimate goal of being a major source of support to the\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nmilitary technological transformation in the 21st century.\n  I believe this bill demonstrates the balance required to best fund \nour armed forces. Again, I am pleased by the hard work of my colleagues \non this Committee and express, once again, my admiration for the hard \nwork of Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye in achieving an appropriate \nspending package for our military men and women.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, shortly before Memorial Day, an excellent \nanalytical piece was printed in the Washington Post under the headline \nFor Pentagon, Asia Moving. I am afraid that not many of my colleagues \nhad an opportunity to read that piece, because they were preparing to \ngo home to visit their constituents over the Memorial Day recess. I \nwould like to draw their attention to this thoughtful analysis of \nevents and circumstances that will shape American Defense policies for \nthe next several decades.\n  In essence, the article suggests that, of necessity, the focus of \nAmerican defense planning, our strategy and tactics--our deployments--\nwill shift from Europe to Asia. Current events in Korea, the rise of \nChina as a modern military power, the spread of nuclear weapons to \nSouth-Asia, all of these dictate a re-examination of our defense \npolicies. We must attend to how we train and where we may someday \nfight.\n  To me, the article suggests the importance of Hawaii to our Nation's \ndefense posture in the twenty-first century. The Washington Post \narticle notes that, to many Americans, Hawaii appears to be well out in \nthe Pacific, but it is another 5,000 miles from there to Shanghai. \n``All told, it is about twice as far from San Diego to China, as it is \nfrom New York to Europe.''\n  We need to think about what this means. As U.S. economic interests in \nAsia come to dominate our economy, so too will U.S. security interests \nin Asia come to dominate our military policies. We must think about the \ndistances involved and the need to be able to strike distant targets \nswiftly and with precision. The Air Force will need more long-range \nbombers and refueling aircraft. I have long advocated the acquisition \nof more B-2 bombers. The war in Kosovo showed that they could strike at \nlong range and with precision. The Post article suggests to me that we \nmay at some time need them in Asia and that we had better be prepared \nby making those investments soon.\n  Similarly, the Navy will have to put more of its resources into the \nPacific. Already the Navy has placed a larger percentage of its attack \nsubmarines in the Pacific. Surely, this will be followed by decisions \nto forward position carriers and other elements of carrier task forces. \nI believe Pearl Harbor will become even more important to the Navy. I \nknow the people of Hawaii are prepared to welcome additional ships.\n  The Army, too, is faced with the need to be able to respond quickly \nto deter future threats in Asia. We need to look to more joint training \nexercises and even the possibility of keeping some of our forces in \nKorea after peace takes hold on the Peninsula.\n  Mr. President, I commend this May 26, 2000 Washington Post article to \nmy colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that it be reprinted in full in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Reocrd, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 26, 2000]\n\n                       For Pentagon, Asia Moving\n\n                          (By Thomas E. Ricks)\n\n       When Pentagon officials first sat down last year to update \n     the core planning document of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, they \n     listed China as a potential future adversary, a momentous \n     change from the last decade of the Cold War.\n       But when the final version of the document, titled ``Joint \n     Vision 2020,'' is released next week, it will be far more \n     discreet. Rather than explicitly pointing at China, it simply \n     will warn of the possible rise of an unidentified ``peer \n     competitor.''\n       The Joint Chiefs' wrestling with how to think about China--\n     and how open to be about that effort--captures in a nutshell \n     the U.S. military's quiet shift away from its traditional \n     focus on Europe. Cautiously but steadily, the Pentagon is \n     looking at Asia as the most likely arena for future military \n     conflict, or at least competition.\n       This new orientation is reflected in many small but \n     significant changes: more attack submarines assigned to the \n     Pacific, more games and strategic studies centered on Asia, \n     more diplomacy aimed at reconfiguring the US. military \n     presence in the area.\n       It is a trend that carries huge implications for the shape \n     of the armed services. It also carries huge stakes for U.S. \n     foreign policy. Some specialists warn that as the United \n     States thinks about a rising China, it ought to remember the \n     mistakes Britain made in dealing with Germany in the years \n     before World War I.\n       The new U.S. military interest in Asia also reverses a Cold \n     War trend under which the Pentagon once planned by the year \n     2000 to have just ``a minimal military presence'' in Japan, \n     recalls retired Army Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, a former U.S. \n     commander in South Korea.\n       Two possibilities are driving this new focus. The first is \n     a chance of peace in Korea; the second is the risk of a \n     hostile relationship with China.\n       Although much of the current discussion in Washington is \n     about a possible military threat from North Korea, for \n     military planners the real question lies further ahead: Who \n     to do after a Korean rapprochement? In this view, South Korea \n     already has won its economic and ideological struggle with \n     North Korea, and all that really remains is to negotiate \n     terms for peace.\n       According to one Defense Department official, William S. \n     Cohen's first question to policy officials when he became \n     Defense Secretary in 1997 was: How can we change the \n     assumption that U.S. troops will be withdrawn after peace \n     comes to the Korean peninsula? Next month's first-ever summit \n     between the leaders of North and South Korea puts a sharper \n     edge on this issue.\n       In the longer run, many American policymakers expect China \n     to emerge sooner or later as a great power with significant \n     influence over the rest of Asia. That, along with a spate of \n     belligerent statements about Taiwan from Chinese officials \n     this spring, has helped focus the attention of top \n     policymakers on China's possible military ambitions. ``The \n     Chinese saber-rattling has gotten people's attention, there \n     is no question of that,'' said Abram Shulsky, a China expert \n     at the Rand Corp.\n\n\n                         The Buzzword Is China\n\n       Between tensions over Taiwan and this week's House vote to \n     normalize trade relations with China, ``China is the new \n     Beltway buzz-word,'' observed Dov S. Zakheim, a former \n     Pentagon official who is an adviser on defense policy to \n     Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.\n       To be sure, large parts of the U.S. military remain \n     ``Eurocentric,'' especially much of the Army. The shift is \n     being felt most among policymakers and military planners--\n     that is, officials charged with thinking about the future--\n     and least among front-line units. Nor is it a change that the \n     Pentagon is proclaiming from the rooftops. Defense Department \n     officials see little value in being explicit about the shift \n     in U.S. attention, which could worry old allies in Europe and \n     antagonize China.\n       Even so, military experts point to changes on a variety of \n     fronts. For example, over the last several years, there has \n     been an unannounced shift in the Navy's deployment of attack \n     submarines, which in the post-Cold War World have been used \n     as intelligence assets--to intercept communications, monitor \n     ship movements and clandestinely insert commandos--and also \n     as front-line platforms for launching Tomahawk cruise \n     missiles against Iraq, Serbia and other targets. Just a few \n     years ago, the Navy kept 60 percent of its attack boats in \n     the Atlantic. Now, says a senior Navy submariner, it has \n     shifted to a 50-50 split between the Atlantic and Pacific \n     fleets, and before long the Pacific may get the majority.\n       But so far the focus on Asia is mostly conceptual, not \n     physical. It is now a common assumption among national \n     security thinkers that the area from Baghdad to Tokyo will be \n     the main location of U.S. military competition for the next \n     several decades. ``The focus of great power competition is \n     likely to shift from Europe to Asia,'' said Andrew \n     Krepinevich, director of the Center for Strategic and \n     Budgetary Assessments, a small but influential Washington \n     think tank. James Bodner, the principal deputy undersecretary \n     of defense for policy, added that, ``The center of gravity of \n     the world economy has shifted to Asia, and U.S. interests \n     flow with that.''\n       When Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, one of the most thoughtful \n     senior officers in the military, met with the Army Science \n     Board earlier this spring, he commented off-handedly that \n     America's ``long-standing Europe-centric focus'' probably \n     would shift in coming decades as policymakers ``pay more \n     attention to the Pacific Rim, and especially to China.'' This \n     is partly because of trade and economics, he indicated, and \n     partly because of the changing ethnic makeup of the U.S. \n     population. (California is enormously important in U.S. \n     domestic politics, explains one Asia expert at the Pentagon, \n     and Asian Americans are increasingly influential in that \n     state's elections, which can make or break presidential \n     candidates.)\n       Just 10 years ago, said Maj. Gen. Robert H. Scales Jr., \n     commandant of the the Army War College, roughly 90 percent of \n     U.S. military thinking about future warfare centered on head-\n     on clashes of armies in Europe. ``Today,'' he said, ``it's \n     probably 50-50, or even more'' tilted toward warfare using \n     characteristic Asian tactics such as deception and \n     indirection.\n\n\n                               War Gaming\n\n       The U.S. military's favorite way of testing its assumptions \n     and ideas is to run a war\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\n     game. Increasingly, the major games played by the Pentagon--\n     except for the Army--take place in Asia, on an arc from \n     Tehran to Tokyo. The games are used to ask how the U.S. \n     military might respond to some of the biggest questions it \n     faces: Will Iran go nuclear--or become more aggressive with \n     an array of hard-to-stop cruise missiles? Will Pakistan and \n     India engage in nuclear war--or, perhaps even worse, will \n     Pakistan break up, with its nuclear weapons falling into the \n     hands of Afghan mujaheddin? Will Indonesia fall apart? Will \n     North Korea collapse peacefully? And what may be the biggest \n     question of all: Will the United States and China avoid \n     military confrontation? All in all, estimates one Pentagon \n     official, about two-thirds of the forward-looking games \n     staged by the Pentagon over the last eight years have taken \n     place partly or wholly in Asia.\n       Last year, the Air Force's biggest annual war game looked \n     at the Mideast and Korea. This summer's game, ``Global \n     Engagement 5,'' to be played over more than a week at Maxwell \n     Air Force Base in Alabama, will posit ``a rising large East \n     Asian nation'' that is attempting to wrest control of \n     Siberia, with all its oil and other natural resources, from a \n     weak Russia. At one point, the United States winds up basing \n     warplanes in Siberia to defend Russian interests.\n       Because of the sensitivity of talking about fighting China, \n     ``What everybody's trying to do is come up with games that \n     are kind of China, but not China by name,'' said an Air Force \n     strategist.\n       ``I think that, however reluctantly, we are beginning to \n     face up to the fact that we are likely over the next few \n     years to be engaged in an ongoing military competition with \n     China,'' noted Princeton political scientist Aaron L. \n     Friedberg. ``Indeed, in certain respects, we already are.''\n\n\n                              Twin Efforts\n\n       The new attention to Asia also is reflected in two long-\n     running, military-diplomatic efforts.\n       The first is a drive to renegotiate the U.S. military \n     presence in northeast Asia. This is aimed mainly at ensuring \n     that American forces still will be welcome in South Korea and \n     Japan if the North Korean threat disappears. To that end, the \n     U.S. military will be instructed to act less like post-World \n     War II occupation forces and more like guests or partners.\n       Pentagon experts on Japan and Korea say they expect that \n     ``status of forces agreements'' gradually will be diluted, so \n     that local authorities will gain more jurisdiction over U.S. \n     military personnel in criminal cases. In addition, they \n     predict that U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea will be \n     jointly operated in the future by American and local forces, \n     perhaps even with a local officer in command.\n       At Kadena Air Force Base on the southern Japanese island of \n     Okinawa, for example, the U.S. military has started a \n     program, called ``Base Without Fences,'' under which the \n     governor has been invited to speak on the post, local \n     residents are taken on bus tours of the base that include a \n     stop at a memorial to Japan's World War II military, and \n     local reporters have been given far more access to U.S. \n     military officials.\n       ``We don't have to stay in our foxhole,'' said Air Force \n     Brig. Gen. James B. Smith, who devised the more open \n     approach. ``To guarantee a lasting presence, there needs to \n     be a private and public acknowledgment of the mutual benefit \n     of our presence.''\n       Behind all this lies a quiet recognition that Japan may no \n     longer unquestioningly follow the U.S. lead in the region. A \n     recent classified national intelligence estimate concluded \n     that Japan has several strategic options available, among \n     them seeking a separate accommodation with China, Pentagon \n     officials disclosed. ``Japan isn't Richard Gere in `An \n     Officer and a Gentleman,' '' one official said. ``That is, \n     unlike him, it does have somewhere else to go.''\n       In the long term, this official added, a key goal of U.S. \n     politico-military policy is to ensure that when Japan \n     reemerges as a great power, it behaves itself in Asia, unlike \n     the last time around, in the 1930s, when it launched a \n     campaign of vicious military conquest.\n\n\n                          SOUTHEAST ASIA REDUX\n\n       The second major diplomatic move is the negotiation of the \n     U.S. military's reentry in Southeast Asia, 25 years after the \n     end of the Vietnam War and almost 10 years after the United \n     States withdrew from its bases in the Philippines. After \n     settling on a Visiting Forces Agreement last year, the United \n     States and the Philippines recently staged their first joint \n     military exercise in years, ``Balikatan 2000.''\n       The revamped U.S. military relationship with the \n     Philippines, argues one general, may be a model for the \n     region. Instead of building ``Little America'' bases with \n     bowling alleys and Burger Kings that are off-limits to the \n     locals, U.S. forces will conduct frequent joint exercises to \n     train Americans and Filipinos to operate together in \n     everything from disaster relief to full-scale combat. The \n     key, he said, isn't permanent bases but occasional access to \n     facilities and the ability to work with local troops.\n       Likewise, the United States has broadened its military \n     contacts with Australia, putting 10,000 troops into the \n     Queensland region a year ago for joint exercises. And this \n     year, for the first time, Singapore's military is \n     participating in ``Cobra Gold,'' the annual U.S.-Thai \n     exercise. Singapore also is building a new pier specifically \n     to meet the docking requirements of a nuclear-powered U.S. \n     aircraft carrier. The U.S. military even has dipped a \n     cautious toe back into Vietnam, with Cohen this spring \n     becoming the first defense secretary since Melvin R. Laird to \n     visit that nation.\n       The implications of this change already are stirring \n     concern in Europe. In the March issue of Proceedings, the \n     professional journal of the U.S. Navy, Cmdr. Michele \n     Consentino, an Italian navy officer, fretted about the \n     American focus on the Far East and about ``dangerous gaps'' \n     emerging in the U.S. military presence in the Mediterranean.\n\n\n                         Where the Generals Are\n\n       If the U.S. military firmly concludes that its major \n     missions are likely to take place in Asia, it may have to \n     overhaul the way it is organized, equipped and even led. \n     ``Most U.S. military assets are in Europe, where there are no \n     foreseeable conflicts threatening vital U.S. interests,'' \n     said ``Asia 2025,'' a Pentagon study conducted last summer. \n     ``The threats are in Asia,'' it warned.\n       This study, recently read by Cohen, pointedly noted that \n     U.S. military planning remains ``heavily focused on Europe,'' \n     that there are four times as many generals and admirals \n     assigned to Europe as to Asia, and that about 85 percent of \n     military officers studying foreign languages are still \n     learning European tongues.\n       ``Since I've been here, we've tried to put more emphasis on \n     our position in the Pacific,'' Cohen said in an interview as \n     he flew home from his most recent trip to Asia. This isn't, \n     he added, ``a zero-sum game, to ignore Europe, but \n     recognizing that the [economic] potential in Asia is \n     enormous''--especially, he said, if the United States is \n     willing to help maintain stability in the region.\n\n\n                         `tyranny of distance'\n\n       Talk to a U.S. military planner about the Pacific theater, \n     and invariably the phrase ``the tyranny of distance'' pops \n     up. Hawaii may seem to many Americans to be well out in the \n     Pacific, but it is another 5,000 miles from there to \n     Shanghai. All told, it is about twice as far from San Diego \n     to China as it is from New York to Europe.\n       Cohen noted that the military's new focus on Asia means, \n     ``We're going to want more C-17s'' (military cargo planes) as \n     well as ``more strategic airlift'' and ``more strategic \n     sealift.''\n       Other experts say that barely scratches the surface of the \n     revamping that Asian operations might require. The Air Force, \n     they say, would need more long-range bombers and refuelers--\n     and probably fewer short-range fighters such as the hot new \n     F-22, designed during the Cold War for dogfights in the \n     relatively narrow confines of Central Europe. ``We are still \n     thinking about aircraft design as if it were for the border \n     of Germany,'' argues James G. Roche, head of Northrop Grumman \n     Corp.'s electronic sensors unit and a participant in last \n     year's Pentagon study of Asia's future. ``Asia is a much \n     bigger area than Europe, so planes need longer `legs.' ''.\n       Similarly, the Navy would need more ships that could \n     operate at long distances. It might even need different types \n     of warships. For example, the Pentagon study noted today's \n     ships aren't ``stealthy''--built to evade radar--and may \n     become increasingly vulnerable as more nations acquire \n     precision-guided missiles.\n       Also, the Navy may be called on to execute missions in \n     places where it has not operated for half a century. If the \n     multi-island nation of Indonesia falls apart, the Pentagon \n     study suggested, then the Navy may be called upon to keep \n     open the crucial Strait of Malacca, through which passes much \n     of the oil and gas from the Persian Gulf to Japan and the \n     rest of East Asia.\n       The big loser among the armed forces likely would be the \n     Army, whose strategic relevancy already is being questioned \n     as it struggles to deploy its forces more quickly. ``At its \n     most basic level, the rise of Asia means a rise of emphasis \n     on naval, air and space power at the expense of ground \n     forces,'' said Eliot Cohen, a professor of strategic studies \n     at Johns Hopkins University.\n       In a few years, Pentagon insiders predict, the chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be from the Navy or Air Force, \n     following 12 years in which Army officers--Generals Colin L. \n     Powell, John Shalikashvili and Henry H. Shelton--have been \n     the top officers in the military. Perhaps even more \n     significantly, they foresee the Air Force taking away from \n     the Navy at least temporarily the position of ``CINCPAC,'' \n     the commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific. There \n     already is talk within the Air Force of basing parts of an \n     ``Air Expeditionary Force'' in Guam, where B-2 stealth \n     bombers have been sent in the past in response to tensions \n     with North Korea.\n\n\n                           parallel with past\n\n       If the implications for the U.S. military of a new focus on \n     Asia are huge, so too are the risks. Some academics and \n     Pentagon intellectuals see a parallel between the U.S. effort \n     to manage the rise of China as a great power and the British \n     failure to accommodate or divert the ambitions of a newly \n     unified Germany in the late 19th century. That effort ended \n     in World War I, which slaughtered a generation of British \n     youth and marked the beginning of British imperial decline.\n       If Sino-American antagonism grows, some strategists warn, \n     national missile defense may play the role that Britian's \n     development of the battleship Dreadnought played a century \n     ago--a superweapon that upset the\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n     balance by making Germany's arsenal strategically irrelevant. \n     Chinese officials have said they believe the U.S. plan for \n     missile defense is aimed at negating their relatively small \n     force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n       If the United States actually builds a workable antimissile \n     system, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski \n     predicts, ``the effect of that would be immediately felt by \n     the Chinese nuclear forces and [would] presumably precipitate \n     a buildup.'' That in turn could provoke India to beef up its \n     own nuclear forces, a move that would threaten Pakistan. A \n     Chinese buildup also could make Japan feel that it needed to \n     build up its own military.\n       Indian officials already are quietly telling Pentagon \n     officials that the rise of China will make the United States \n     and India natural allies. India also is feeling its oats \n     militarily. The Hindustan Times recently reported that the \n     Indian navy plans to reach far eastward this year to hold \n     submarine and aircraft exercises in the South China Sea, a \n     move sure to tweak Beijing.\n       Some analysts believe that the hidden agenda of the U.S. \n     military is to use the rise of Asia as a way to shore up the \n     Pentagon budget, which now consumes about 3 percent of the \n     gross domestic product, compared to 5.6 percent at the end of \n     the Cold War in 1989. ``If the military grabs onto this in \n     order to get more money, that's scary,'' said retired Air \n     Force Col. Sam Gardiner, who frequently conducts war games \n     for the military.\n       Indeed, Cohen is already making the point that operating in \n     Asia is expensive. He said it is clear that America will have \n     to maintain ``forward'' forces in Asia. And that, he argued, \n     will require a bigger defense budget.\n       ``There's a price to pay for what we're doing,'' Cohen \n     concluded. ``The question we're going to have to face in the \n     coming years is, are we willing to pay up?''\n\n\n                              Section 8014\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I engage in a colloquy with my good \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii?\n  As Senator Inouye  knows, the Manager's amendment currently before \nthe Senate includes an amendment to section 8014. That section \naddresses the procedures that must be followed by Department of Defense \nagencies which seek to outsource certain civilian functions to private \ncontractors. Since 1990, this provision has been included in the \nDefense appropriations bills for each of the last ten years. Throughout \nthat time, section 8014 has provided for certain exceptions to the \nprocedures, including an exception when the private contractor is a \nNative American-owned entity. This exception has been included in \nfurtherance of the Federal policy of Indian self-determination and the \npromotion of economic self-sufficiency for the native people of \nAmerica.\n  The exception for a private contractor that is a Native American-\nowned entity is an exercise of the authority that has been vested in \nthe Congress by the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause \n3, often referred to as the Indian Commerce Clause. As the senior \nSenator from Hawaii and vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs knows, this is by no means the only Federal legislation that \nrecognizes the special status of Native Americans in commercial \ntransactions with the Federal Government which is based upon the trust \nrelationship the United States has with its indigenous, aboriginal \npeople. There are, in fact, numerous examples of provisions of Federal \nlaw that seek to provide competitive assistance to businesses that are \nowned by Indian tribes or Alaska Native regional or village \ncorporations. Congress has enacted such laws because they have been \nfound to be the most effective and appropriate means of ensuring and \nencouraging economic self-sufficiency in furtherance of the Federal \npolicy of self-determination and the United States' trust \nresponsibility. There is considerable judicial precedent recognizing \nsuch laws as a valid exercise of Congress' constitutional authority, \nperhaps the most significant of which is the United State Supreme \nCourt's 1974 ruling in Morton versus Mancari.\n  It has come to my attention that a lawsuit has been filed challenging \nthe Native American exception in section 8014 as a racially-based \npreference that is unconstitutional. That challenge is simply \ninconsistent with the well-established body of Federal Indian law and \nnumerous rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Native American \nexception contained in section 8014 is intended to advance the Federal \nGovernment's interest in promoting self-sufficiency and the economic \ndevelopment of Native American communities. It does so not on the basis \nof race, but rather, based upon the unique political and legal status \nthat the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the America have had \nunder our Constitution since the founding of this nation. It is a valid \nexercise of Congress' authority under the Indian commerce clause. While \nI believe that the provision is clear, we propose adoption of the \namendment before us today to further clarify that the exception for \nNative American-owned entities in section 8014 is based on a political \nclassification, not a racial classification.\n\n  Because my colleague was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense \nAppropriations in 1990 and involved in the drafting of section 8014, I \nwould like to know whether my understanding of the purpose and intent \nof section 8014 is consistent with the original purpose and intent, and \nwhether the amendment before us today is consistent with the original \nintent of section 8014.\n  Mr. INOUYE. My Chairman is correct in his understanding. The Congress \nhas long been concerned with the ravaging extent of poverty, \nhomelessness, and the high rates of unemployment in Native America. The \nCongress has consistently recognized that the economic devastation that \nhas been wrought on Native communities can be directly attributed to \nFederal policies of the forced removal of Native people from their \ntraditional homelands, their forced relocation, and later the \ntermination of the reservations to which the government forcibly \nrelocated them. In 1970, President Nixon established the Federal policy \nof self-determination, and that policy has been supported and \nstrengthened by each succeeding administration.\n  The Congress has sought to do its part in fostering strong Native \neconomies through the enactment of a wide range of Federal laws, \nincluding a series of incentives that are designed to stimulate \neconomic growth in Native communities and provide economic \nopportunities for Native American-owned businesses. Native American-\nowned businesses include not only those that are owned by an Indian \ntribe or an Alaska Native corporation or a Native Hawaiian \norganization, but those businesses that are 51 percent or more owned by \nNative Americans.\n  As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, time and again, the \npolitical and legal relationship that this nation has had with the \nindigenous, aboriginal, native people of America is the basis upon \nwhich the Congress can constitutionally enact legislation that is \ndesigned to address the special conditions of Native Americans. In \nexchange for the cession of over 500 million acres of land by the \nnative people of America, the United States has entered into a trust \nrelationship with Native Americans. Treaties, the highest law of our \nland, were originally the primary instrument for the expression of this \nrelationship. Today, Federal laws like section 8014, are the means by \nwhich the United States carries out its trust responsibilities and the \nFederal policy of self-determination and economic self-sufficiency.\n  I thank my Chairman for proposing this clarifying amendment which I \nbelieve is fully consistent with the original purpose and intent of \nsection 8014.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been nearly 14 months since the \nColumbine tragedy, and over a year since the Senate passed common sense \ngun safety legislation as part of the Juvenile Justice bill, and still \nthe Republican majority in Congress refuses to act on sensible gun \nlegislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil Congress acts, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of \nsome of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, \nand we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight.\n  Following are the names of a few Americans who were killed by gunfire \none year ago, on June 13, 1999:\n  Robert Ayala, 21, Chicago, IL.\n  Timothy Croft, 39, Detroit, MI.\n  Warner Freeman, 21, Philadelphia, PA.\n  James Harley, 40, Baltimore, MD.\n  Rico Perry, 27, Charlotte, NC.\n  Wesley Rodenas, 19, San Bernardino, CA.\n  Thoyce Sanders, 45, Dallas, TX.\n  Charles Stewart, 32, Dallas, TX.\n  Mario Taylor, 23, Chicago, IL.\n  Renardo Wilson, 38, Dallas, TX.\n  Unidentified male, 49, Portland, OR.\n  Mark Pierce, 36, Providence, RI.\n  Mr. Pierce was killed in a late-night drive-by shooting after a \nconfrontation between one of his friends and two young men, one 18 and \none 21, at a marina on the Providence River waterfront. After an \ninitial scuffle, the two young men departed and returned within an hour \nin a car. One of them opened fire with a handgun, killing Pierce. It's \nanother example of a quarrel that, in another time in America, might \nhave resulted in a bloody nose and a bruised ego, but instead took the \nlife of Mark Pierce.\n  And, Mr. President, the gun violence continues every day across \nAmerica. Three weeks ago, a 15-year-old girl in Providence, who was a \nkey witness for the prosecution in an upcoming murder trial, was shot \nwith a handgun at point blank range in her front yard on a Sunday \nevening. She died the next day. She was to testify in the trial of a \n19-year-old charged with shooting to death a 17-year-old last August.\n  Just this past Friday, in Providence, Rhode Island, two college \nstudents were carjacked at gunpoint, robbed, taken to a nearby golf \ncourse, and shot execution style with a .40 caliber semiautomatic \nhandgun. The handgun was stolen from the car of a freelance \nphotographer while he shopped at a local convenience store in February. \nThis case makes a strong argument against concealed carry laws and \nother liberal gun laws that encourage citizens to bring their handguns \nout of their homes and into the streets of our cities. It also \nunderscores the need for aggressive research into smart gun technology \nto ensure that a weapon can only be fired by its legitimate owner.\n  Finally, although in this instance the police were able to trace the \ngun relatively quickly because it was stolen in Providence and reported \nby the owner, in many cases crime guns cannot be traced because law \nenforcement is completely dependent upon the record keeping of gun \nmanufacturers and gun dealers, and post-retail private sales are \nusually unrecorded. If we registered handguns and licensed handgun \nowners, the police could put out an immediate alert when a weapon is \nreported stolen, and they could trace a weapon more quickly upon its \nrecovery after a horrible crime like this one. In addition, the \nassailants would face yet another felony charge for illegal possession \nof a weapon not registered to them.\n  Mr. President, twelve young Americans lose their lives to gun \nviolence every day. That's a new Columbine tragedy every 24 hours. It \nis time for Congress to do its part to reduce gun violence by passing \nsensible gun safety legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of \nchildren and convicted felons. We should do so without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5020-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5020-S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING THE ISRAELI MISSING IN ACTION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in remembering the Israeli soldiers captured by the Syrians during \nthe 1982 Israeli war with Lebanon.\n  On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit \nin the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. The Syrians succeeded in \ncapturing Sgt. Zachary Baumel, 1st Sgt. Zvi Feldman and Cpt. Yehudah \nKatz. Upon arrival in Damascus, the crew and their tank were paraded \nthrough the streets draped in Syrian and Palestinian Flags.\n  Since that terrible day in 1982, the Israeli and United States \nGovernments have been working to obtain any possible information about \nthe fate of these missing soldiers, joining with the offices of the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, and other \ninternational bodies. According to the Geneva Convention, the area in \nLebanon where the soldiers first disappeared was continually controlled \nby Syria, therefore deeming it responsible for the treatment of the \ncaptured soldiers. To this day, despite the promises made by the Syrian \nGovernment and by the PLO, very little information has been forthcoming \nabout the condition of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, and Yehudah Katz.\n  June 11 marks the anniversary of the day these soldiers were reported \nmissing in action. Eighteen pain-filled years have passed since their \nfamilies have seen their sons, and still the Syrian Government has not \nrevealed their whereabouts.\n  One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel, is an American citizen \nfrom Brooklyn, NY. An ardent\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nbasketball fan, Zachary began his studies at the Hebrew School in Boro \nPark. In 1979, he moved to Israel with other family members and \ncontinued his education at Yeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are \nintegrated with army service. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary \nwas completing his military service and was looking forward to \nattending Hebrew University, where he had been accepted to study \npsychology. But fate decreed otherwise, and on June 11, 1982, he \ndisappeared with Zvi Feldman and Yehudah Katz.\n  Zachary's parents Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in \ntheir pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have \nworked closely with the Baumels, as well as the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations of America, the American Coalition for Missing \nIsraeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the Conference of \nPresidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. These groups have \nbeen at the forefront of their pursuit of justice. I want to recognize \ntheir good work and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting their \nefforts. For eighteen years, these families have been without their \nchildren. Answers are long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5021-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TIBET\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last year I delivered a statement for \nthe record commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan \nuprising, during which His Holiness the Dalai Lama and more than \n100,000 Tibetans were forced to flee their homeland as a result of \nbrutal suppression by the Chinese government. Unfortunately, the human \nrights situation in Tibet has not improved, and has if anything \ndeteriorated over the past year.\n  U.S. Administration officials and Congressional supporters of \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations with China often claim that more open \ntrade with the West will expose ordinary Chinese to new ideas, new \nideals, and a new independence from the State. This will awaken their \ndesire for more freedom, paving the way for democracy in China. I have \noften voiced skepticism about these claims.\n  We do not have to wait for the people of Tibet to express their \nyearning for freedom. They have continuously struggled for their rights \nfor over forty years, and have paid dearly for their actions. Their \nefforts so far have failed, not because they do not yearn to be free, \nbut rather because their efforts are brutally suppressed and we are \napparently little able to help them. Even our efforts in March to \nintroduce at the annual meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights a \nresolution condemning PRC officials' human rights practices in China \nand Tibet were blocked by the PRC and most of the industrialized \nnations.\n  If the Administration and Congress are serious about their efforts to \npromote human rights in China, surely Tibet should be the bellwether. \nWe need to find concrete ways to demonstrate this commitment, and to \nencourage other countries to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5021-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO COLONEL LES BROWNLEE, USA (RET.)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the United States Army came to the \nU.S. Capitol to honor one of its most distinguished retired officers.\n  Colonel Les Brownlee is currently serving as Staff Director of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, having previously served as a staffer \non the Committee and in my Senate office. He is known and respected \nthroughout our nation's military and defense industry. This award--for \nhis lifetime of extraordinary leadership in uniform and with the \nSenate--is well deserved.\n  I ask that the introduction by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, \nGeneral Jack Keane, and the citation be printed in the Record of the \nU.S. Senate which Colonel Brownlee has served for sixteen years. His \nrecord of public service stands as an inspiration for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                 Speech Delivered by General Jack Keane\n\n                                                    June 13, 2000.\n       Senator Warner, Senator Thurmond, thank you for taking time \n     out of your busy schedules to join us. I would also like to \n     welcome Les' son, John, his wife, LeAnne, and their new \n     daughter, Thompson Ann.\n       Distinguished guests, friends and fellow soldiers. Thank \n     you all for being here today to help us honor a true American \n     patriot.\n       Originally, Major General LeMoyne, the Commander of the \n     Infantry Center, was going to present this award during the \n     Infantry Conference at Fort Benning, right there in building \n     number four in the shadow of Iron Mike--a symbol that is so \n     familiar to infantrymen. Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts \n     would not allow that to happen.\n       The citation that we will present to Les in just a few \n     moments reads that the Order of Saint Maurice is presented \n     for ``distinguished contribution to, and loyal support of the \n     Infantry, and demonstrating gallant devotion to the principle \n     of selfless service.''\n       No one fits that description better than Les Brownlee. He \n     is a passionate advocate for soldiers who has devoted his \n     entire life to the service of his country--both in peace and \n     in war.\n       Les's career of military service is, by any measurement, an \n     extraordinary record of courage, devotion to duty, and love \n     of soldiering.\n       Les chose the Army's most demanding branch of service--the \n     Infantry. Infantry training and infantry battle demand the \n     very most of the human spirit--where leaders are expected to \n     exercise personal, physical leadership with daring and \n     courage; where soldiers must be willing to give up everything \n     they care about in life; where God-forsaken terrain, foul, \n     miserable weather, extreme cold and extreme heat, can be as \n     challenging as any enemy; where raw, stark fear is personal \n     and normal; where training can be every bit as dangerous and \n     demanding as combat; and where death is always a silent \n     companion.\n       Les Brownlee volunteered for this life--a life of hardship \n     and challenge, but a life of service in the company of the \n     very best men our nation has to offer.\n       He volunteered for special skills--airborne, Ranger--skills \n     that required an even greater degree of personal courage and \n     sacrifice, but skills which would enable him to become and \n     even better infantryman.\n       Les is a veteran of two tours of combat in Vietnam. A \n     decorated Hero who has twice been awarded the Silver Star--\n     our Nation's third highest award for valor. He also has three \n     Bronze Star Medals, and the Purple Heart Medal for wounds \n     received in combat.\n       Leading soldiers in combat is the most challenging and \n     demanding assignment an officer will ever face . . . it tests \n     the character of a commander . . . it forces him to bare his \n     soul and face his own human frailties like no other \n     experience.\n       Les Brownie faced that test, twice in Vietnam, and it has \n     shaped the character of his service ever since. It is where \n     he learned about the bonds that form between soldiers and \n     between soldiers and their leaders; it is where he learned \n     that service to others is more important than service to \n     self.\n       He is a paratrooper who understands all types of infantry.\n       He served as a platoon leader in the 101st Airborne \n     Division, a Company Commander in the 173 Airborne Brigade, \n     and he commanded a mechanized Battalion in the 3rd Infantry \n     Division in Germany.\n       Despite his distinguished combat record, the thing that his \n     friends who served with him will tell you that he is most \n     proud is that, in January of 1965, he was named the \n     distinguished honor graduate of his Ranger class. This \n     prestigious honor is determined by peer and instructor \n     evaluations and is awarded to the soldier who exhibits \n     extraordinary leadership abilities.\n       Incidentally he was also graduated an Honor Graduate of his \n     Officer Advanced Course and the Command and General Staff \n     College.\n       Throughout his distinguished Army Career, and certainly in \n     his capacity on the Armed Services Committee, Les has kept \n     the welfare of the common soldier close to his heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5021-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5021-S5022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NECESSARILY ABSENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a little \nknown, but very dark chapter in American history. While many are \nfamiliar with the deplorable treatment of Japanese-Americans and others \nof Japanese ancestry living in the United States during World War II, \nthere is far less discussion and understanding of what Italian-\nAmericans were forced to endure during that period.\n  Italian-Americans refer to what happened at this time as ``Una Storia \nSegreta,'' or ``A Secret Story.'' Beginning before the war and until \nafter Italy's surrender in 1943, Italian-Americans and those of Italian \ndecent living in the United States were made suspects simply because of \ntheir country of origin. Like Japanese-Americans, they were subjected \nto all manner of civil rights violations including curfews, warrantless \nsearches, summary arrests, exclusions, relocations and even internment.\n  The United States must accept responsibility for its grievous \ntreatment of Italian-Americans during World War II. To this end, \nSenator Torricelli has introduced S. 1909, the Wartime Violation of \nItalian-American Civil Liberties Act, a bill to require the Justice \nDepartment to make a full accounting of the injustices suffered by \nItalian-Americans during World War II.

Last month, I had the privilege of addressing the \ngraduating class at Virginia Tech University. During the commencement \nceremony, three Virginia Tech students, Class President Lauren Esleeck, \nGraduate Student Representative Timothy Wayne Mays, and Class Treasurer \nRush K. Middleton, addressed the graduating class and those in \nattendance. The speeches given by these three students were so eloquent \nand so inspiring, that I felt it was important to share them with my \ncolleagues in the United States Senate and with the people of the \nUnited States.\n  To date, I have been able to obtain copies of Ms. Esleeck's speech \nand Mr. Middleton's speech. It is my pleasure to ask that these \nspeeches be inserted into the Congressional Record.\n  The speeches follow:\n\n              Speech of Rush K. Middleton, Class Treasurer\n\n       Only July 4th, 1939, Lou Gehrig, recently diagnosed with a \n     terminal illness that would cripple and kill him in the prime \n     of his life, stood before 60,000 adoring fans at Yankee \n     Stadium and proclaimed, ``I consider myself the luckiest man \n     on the face of the earth.''\n       How could a man who was so surely facing death profess that \n     he was more blessed than those who sat around him and viewed \n     their own deaths as nothing more than a distant shadow. The \n     answer is quite simple: Lou Gehrig did not measure his \n     fortune by the number of home runs he hit, the number of \n     games he played, or the sum of money he earned. Instead, \n     confronting his own mortality, he calculated the worth of his \n     life by the people that surrounded him. For, unlike the \n     countless tangible rewards and honors that were bestowed upon \n     him, the friendships and relationships he established would \n     not perish with his physical passing.\n       How does the Class of 2000 want to measure its worth? Do we \n     wish to be defined by the jobs that we accept, the salaries \n     we earn, or the number of promotions we receive? Or would we \n     rather be characterized by the unbreakable bonds that we \n     established with the people around us? I would challenge our \n     Class to pursue the latter. My challenge is this: That we \n     should leave this amazing institution with high expectations \n     of what we will accomplish in our years as alumni. That we \n     remain true to VPI's motto of Ut Prosim, ``That I may \n     serve,'' honorably serving our community, our family, our \n     church, and our alma mater. Let us remember that we have but \n     one chance on earth to dedicate ourselves to the task of \n     helping our fellow man. If we give of ourselves, we give the \n     most appreciated gift, and the one gift which no sum of money \n     can possibly buy.\n       As we pen these final lines in the collegiate chapters of \n     our lives, surrounded by family, friends, faculty, and peers, \n     let us remember that we should strive to define ourselves by \n     these relationships, and not by those material items that \n     will surely fade into our past. If we can accomplish this \n     goal, we can say with confidence, just as Lou Gehrig did, \n     that we are luckiest people on the face of the earth. God \n     bless each one of you, and God bless Virginia Tech. Thank \n     You.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Speech of Lauren Esleeck, Class President\n\n       Today, we are here in celebration of a truly significant \n     occasion and may I begin by saying, ``Congratulations''.\n       The Class of 2000 Motto is ``With Honor there is Power, \n     with Character there is Strength.'' Recently our Class \n     bestowed a gift to Virginia Tech which certainly reflects \n     this theme. The Class of 2000 has chosen to present the \n     university with a new mace, symbolizing the power and \n     strength Virginia Tech has achieved through both her honor \n     and character. During the Founder's Day celebration the Class \n     of 2000 presented Dr. Charles Steger with the new mace \n     immediately following his installation as President of \n     Virginia Tech. Our university's mace has long been a symbol \n     of our tradition of excellence and our Class is fortunate to \n     have contributed a gift to Virginia Tech which will ensure \n     this tradition continues. The new mace, created by Steve \n     Bickley, is resting here on stage. It is a gold-plated \n     contemporary design bearing 3 different seals of the \n     university:\n       The official university seal affixed to Hokiestone;\n       The centennial seal from 1972; and\n       The earliest seal of the university--dating back to 1872.\n       It also includes 8 spires representing each of the pylons.\n       Thank you the Class of 2000 for such a tremendous gift.\n       During this time of excitement and celebration, I have 2 \n     wishes for the Class of 2000. I hope that:\n       1. We view our Class motto not as a statement, but as a \n     goal;\n       2. That we be humble.\n       Again, the Class of 2000 Motto is, ``With Honor there is \n     Power, with Character there is Strength.''\n       I encourage you to view our motto not as a statement, but \n     as a goal because I hope that we strive to achieve personal \n     strength and power by developing both our character and \n     honor.\n       Character. Please allow me to borrow some thoughts on the \n     importance of character from General Charles Krulak of the \n     U.S. Marine Corp. Character is the moral courage that is \n     within each of us. Everyday we have to make decisions. It is \n     through this decision making process that we show those \n     around us the quality of our character. The majority of \n     decisions we make are ``no brainers.'' Deciding whether to \n     eat at West End Market or Owens is not going to test your \n     character. . . . judgment maybe, but not character. The true \n     test of character comes when the stakes are high, when the \n     chips are down, when your gut starts to turn, when you know \n     the decision you are about to make may not be popular, but it \n     is to be made. That's when your true character is exposed.\n       Success in life has always demanded a depth of character. \n     Those who can reach deep within themselves and draw upon an \n     inner strength, fortified by strong values, always carry the \n     day against those of lesser character.\n       Honor. Honor is captured by two essential ingredients--\n     honesty and integrity. I hope that we may each find the \n     courage to be not only true to others, but also true to \n     ourselves--a far more difficult challenge. Such uninhibited \n     self-evaluation will provide endless opportunities for \n     personal growth and development.\n       Perhaps the most important determinant of integrity is work \n     ethic. Hard work and determination have earned us the degrees \n     we\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\n     celebrate today. A wise man once said, ``It is amazing how \n     many people who work very hard are damn lucky.'' While hard \n     work may often go unrecognized, it will undoubtedly further \n     one's integrity. Both integrity and honesty are essential to \n     achieving honor. Likewise, both honor and character are \n     essential to achieving power and strength.\n       My second and final wish is that we may each be humble.\n       Two of the simplest words in the English language are too \n     often forgotten. Thank you. At a time when it is also \n     appropriate to offer thanks. None of us have walked this \n     journey alone. Whether it's your parents who offered \n     financial support, the coach who served as a father figure, \n     the professor who spent the extra time, the unknown person \n     was created the scholarship you received, the friends who \n     offered unending support, or the organizations which provided \n     the opportunity for personal growth. When someone says \n     ``congratualtions'' we should each respond with ``Thank \n     You,'' thanking those who have allowed us to achieve our \n     goals.\n       Thank You.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5023-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MOKAN KIDS NETWORK\n\n   Mr. ASHCROFT.

Since then, he has worked in the \nMinneapolis field office as the technical coordinator.\n  The FBI is a worldwide leader in crime investigation and crime \nsolving. The respect commanded by the FBI is due in large part to the \nindividual agents, like Dee, who serve with honor and integrity in \ntheir duty to make the United States a safer place to live.\n  Dee will be very busy in his retirement.

The award was originally designed to help boost \nconfidence in the quality of the milk, therefore increasing the milk \nsales. This is the fifth year that the honor has been bestowed on \nVermont.\n  The criteria each farm must meet in order to receive this award are \nextremely stringent. According to the Vermont Department of \nAgriculture, Food, and Markets, the farms must include: clean and \nattractively finished buildings; neat landscaping, ditches, roads, and \nlanes; and well-maintained fences. Also taken into account are the \nconditions of other aspects of the farm operations such as cleanliness \nof animals, the barnyard, feed areas and manure management. This is a \ngreat feat considering that the average farm in Vermont is 217 acres.\n  Vermont is fortunate to have so many citizens who hold such pride in \nthe presentation of their farms.

ROBERT GILLETTE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on June 16th, 2000, a very dear \nfriend of mine, Mr. Robert Gillette, will celebrate his 60th birthday. \nI rise today to commemorate this occasion, and to honor a wonderful man \nwho has worked extremely hard to improve living conditions for seniors \nthroughout the State of Michigan.\n  Mr. Gillette is the president of American House, an organization that \nowns\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\nand operates 24 housing facilities for seniors in the metropolitan \nDetroit area. American House strives to be the most outstanding \naffordable senior housing organization in the State of Michigan, and to \nprovide all seniors, regardless of their income, with quality services \nand care. The organization is founded on the principle that individuals \nare entitled to living with dignity and with freedom as they enjoy the \nlater years of their lives.\n  Recently, I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Gillette on an \nissue that is of utmost importance to the seniors of Michigan--\naffordable senior housing. At certain American House locations, a \nprogram has been developed which utilizes two assistance programs \navailable to seniors. A Michigan State Housing Development Authority \ntax credit provides qualified applicants with a tax credit and rent \nsubsidies, based on income limitations. In addition, the federally \nfunded Medicaid Waiver Program, which has been in effect since the \nearly 1990's assists qualified applicants in paying for housework, \nmeals, and personalized care services in a home environment.\n  Mr. President, taking advantage of these two government subsidy \nprograms has the potential to narrow the gap in housing prospects that \nexists between low, middle, and high-income seniors. It will provide \nmany seniors, who otherwise would be forced to move into publicly-\nfunded nursing homes, with the ability to remain in assisted living \nprograms like that which American House offers. It is a wonderful \nprogram with enormous potential.\n  Combining these programs to assist seniors was the idea of Bob \nGillette. This is the kind of work that he does every day. He is always \nthinking about how to make the lives of people around him better. His \nenthusiasm for his job and his genuine interest in the people around \nhim make others want to help him.\n  Anyone who knows Bob will tell you that he is a wonderful person. I \nconsider it a privilege to have him as a friend. He is truly a \nremarkable man. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish \nBob Gillette a happy 60th birthday, and best of luck in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5024-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE TELEPHONE PIONEERS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay \ntribute to the Telephone Pioneers of America. This tremendous volunteer \norganization has provided 40 years of volunteer labor service to the \nrepair of talking-book machines for the National Library Service for \nthe Blind and Physically Handicapped of the Library of Congress, \nWashington, D.C. Since 1960, the Pioneers have provided over $70 \nmillion worth of volunteer labor and have repaired nearly 2 million \nmachines. More than a half-million blind and physically disabled \nindividuals benefit from this outstanding volunteer repair service. In \nRhode Island alone, Pioneers have volunteered 27,186 hours and repaired \n17,146 machines since 1986.\n  The Pioneers are a good-will organization of a million people. This \ninternational organization is led by President Irene Chavira of U.S. \nWest, Senior Vice President, Harold Burlingame of AT, and Executive \nDirector and Chief Operating Officer James Gadd of Bell South. The \norganization is further supported by countless special people who make \nup the association, headquarters advisory board, and sponsoring \ncompanies.\n  Concerning the talking-book program itself, there are 1,500 Pioneer \nmen and women who work on talking-book repair. They consist of \nvolunteer personnel from AT, Bell Atlantic, Bell South, Lucent \nTechnologies, Southwestern Bell Corporation, SBC, Communications, Inc., \nand U.S. West. They are ably supported by their Pioneer Vice Presidents \nand are also ably assisted by regional coordinators.\n  Through the generosity of the sponsoring companies, talking-book \nrepair Pioneers are provided facilities in which they repair the \nequipment. Further, they are provided funding for tools, while the \nNational Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped \nprovides testing equipment and parts for necessary repairs. The Pioneer \norganization also ensures talking-book coordinator leadership, \nincluding administrative support, management support for the program, \nand funding for travel to training and for recognition events.\n  The talking-book machines provided by the National Library Services \nto blind and visually impaired Americans are nothing less than a \nlifeline. Profound vision loss and blindness can seem like an \ninsurmountable obstacle to what most of us take for granted, reading. \nWe live in the information age, but for blind and visually impaired \nindividuals, most information would be out of reach if it were not for \nthe availability of specially designed talking-book machines. With \ntalking-book machines, and other forms of assistive technology, blind \nboys and girls, men and women are reading for pleasure, for academic \nachievement, and for professional advancement.\n  Volunteerism is one of the greatest of all American virtues, and most \nwho given their time for the benefit of others, do so without hope of \nfanfare. The Telephone Pioneers of America truly have sounded a clarion \ncall for all other volunteer organizations to follow by responding to \nthose in need, and I commend them for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5024-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEATH OF JEFF MacNELLY\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, readers of the Chicago Tribune \nand newspapers across America suffered a great loss last Thursday when \nlegendary political cartoonist Jeff MacNelly lost his battle with \nlymphoma. He was 52.\n  Jeff MacNelly was one of the giants of modern political commentary. \nIn this era of multi-media communication, round-the-clock news, and \nubiquitous political punditry, Jeff offered a fresh and witty \nperspective on local and national affairs.\n  It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. But Jeff \nMacNelly was a master, and his were worth more. No matter what the \nissue, no matter who the subject of his praise of caustic criticism, \nJeff had a way of making his point and making you laugh at the same \ntime. That was his gift.\n  Born in New York City in 1947, Jeff MacNelly knew he was meant to \ndraw. He left college during his senior year in 1969 to pursue a career \nas a political cartoonist, and accepted a job with a weekly newspaper \nin Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Jeff won his first Pulitzer Prize in \n1972 at age 24, and two more followed in 1978 and 1985. His legendary \ncomic strip ``Shoe,'' which he continued for the rest of his life, was \nborn in 1977. By the time Jeff passed away last week, ``Shoe'' was \nsyndicated in over 1,000 publications nationwide. Jeff briefly decided \nto retire his pen in 1981, but, missing the excitement of politics and \nthe daily news business, was lured back into action in 1982 by the \nChicago Tribune. He worked at the Tribune until his death.\n  For nearly 30 years, Jeff MacNelly entertained and informed us with \nhis unique blend of humor and political insight. He died young, but \nleft his mark--literally and figuratively--on the entire world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5024-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5024-S5025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF MARK LAMPING\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mark Lamping, \nPresident of the St. Louis Cardinals. Today, the St. Louis Catholic \nYouth Council presented its Annual Achievement Award for the year 2000 \nto Mr. Lamping. His tenure as head of the Cardinals has seen a 1996 \nCentral Division championship, a return to post-season play for the \nfirst time since 1987, and a complete renovation of Busch Stadium. In \n1999, his dedication as President enabled the Cardinals to receive the \nhonor of Major League Baseball's Fan Friendly team by the United Sports \nFans of America for the Cardinals' outstanding efforts at making the \nballpark a more enjoyable, affordable, and memorable experience for the \npaying public.\n  In February of 1994, after serving for five years as Anheuser-Busch's \ngroup Director of Sports Marketing, Mr. Lamping was appointed \nCommissioner of the Continental Basketball Association. While in this \nposition, Mr. Lamping managed the company's TV and radio sports \nmarketing activities for all Anheuser-Busch beer brands, including \nsponsorship agreements with the Olympics, World Cup, the National\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\nHockey League, the National Football League, the National Basketball \nAssociation, and all other major professional sports.\n  Mr. Lamping's accomplishments are not limited to the realm of sports; \nhe also gained experience in the corporate world. In 1981, Mr. Lamping \njoined the Anheuser-Busch family and began his work as a financial \nanalyst within the company's corporate planning division. He then moved \non to serve as the District Manager in Southern Illinois and Central \nIowa. In addition to these responsibilities, Mr. Lamping served as the \nSenior Brand Manager for New Products and the Director of Sales \nOperations.\n  Mr. Lamping has also added a number of civic and charitable \nactivities to his resume, including the St. Louis Sports Commission \nBoard of Directors, the St. Louis University Business School Board of \nDirectors, and the SSM Health Care Central Regional Board. He has \nserved on the Board of Directors for the Roman Catholic Orphan Board, \nthe Boone Valley Classic Foundation, the St. Louis Cardinals Community \nFund, as well as Chairperson of the Make-A-Wish Foundation Golf Classic \nin 1997, 1998, and 1999, Chairman of the Old Newsboys Day for \nChildren's Charities, and as the Chairperson for 1999 St. Louis papal \nvisit.\n  In 1998, Mr. Lamping received the Man of the Year honor from the St. \nLouis Chapter of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Resources. That same year \nhe received the James O'Flynn Award from St. Patrick's Center in \nrecognition of his hard work to help fight homelessness in the St. \nLouis area. Also, Mr. Lamping was recently inducted into the Vianney \nHigh School Hall of Fame.\n  The holder of a bachelor's degree in accounting from Rockhurst \nCollege of Kansas City and a master's degree in business administration \nfrom St. Louis University, Mr. Lamping is husband to Cheryl and father \nto three children--Brian, Lauren, and Timothy.\n  St. Louis is lucky to count as a resident a man so dedicated to his \nnative community. It is my honor and pleasure to congratulate Mr. Mark \nLamping on his outstanding success as a Missouri citizen and as this \nyear's recipient of the Catholic Youth Council's Annual Achievement \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5025-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5025-S5026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BEST HARVEST BAKERY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a \nsignificant minority enterprise in my home state of Kansas. The venture \nis Best Harvest Bakery, and its founders are two highly capable and \nenergetic African-American businessmen, Bob Beavers, Jr. and Ed \nHonesty. Best Harvest is supplying hamburger buns to 560 McDonald's \nrestaurants throughout the Midwest and will supply a new type of soft \nroll to the U.S. military. As minority suppliers to McDonald's, Bob and \nEd join a growing force that last year provided over $3 billion in \ngoods and services to the system.\n  Bob and Ed got their start as McDonald's employees and rose through \nthe ranks to senior positions. Bob started as crew and attained the \nrank of senior vice president and a position on McDonald's board of \ndirectors. Ed joined the company right out of law school and became \nmanaging counsel for the Great Lakes Region. Last year, the two left \ntheir secure positions to become independent entrepreneurs and \nsuppliers to the company. Bob and Ed chose to locate in Kansas City, \nKansas because, as they said, it is ``the heart of the bread basket.'' \nI along with many others in my home state welcome them and Best \nHarvest's contribution to our thriving economy.\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I ask that this article on Bob Beavers and Ed Honesty, \npublished in the April 2000, issue of Franchise Times, be placed in the \nRecord, and I encourage my colleagues to read the account of these two \noutstanding African-Americans and their evolving relationship with \nMcDonald's, which has again demonstrated its commitment to diversity.\n\n                 [From the Franchise Times, Apr. 2000]\n\n                   Former Execs Switch To Supply Side\n\n                         (By Nancy Weingartner)\n\n       Robert M. Beavers Jr. Started as a part-time McDonald's \n     worker earning $1 an hour. At his girlfriend's suggestion, he \n     took the job during his junior year at George Washington \n     University, because it was close to where she lived. He \n     became an intricate part of the franchisee's business and \n     when it was sold, corporate asked him to come to Oak Brook. \n     In his 36-year career with McDonald's, he climbed the ladder \n     to a senior vice president position and was responsible for \n     bringing hundreds of minority franchisees into the system. He \n     was also the first African American on the hamburger giant's \n     board of directors.\n       Edward Honesty Jr. joined McDonald's right out of law \n     school. He worked his way up to managing counsel for the \n     Great Lakes Region, helped start the Business Counsel Program \n     and was a frequent attendee and speaker at the American Bar \n     Association's Forum on Franchising and the International \n     Franchise Association's Legal Symposium.\n       So why would two men who were at the top of their game \n     decide to give up their expense accounts and their impressive \n     titles to become suppliers?\n       In one word--entrepreneurship.\n       It was because of their contacts at McDonald's and the fact \n     that they knew the system so well, they were able to put \n     together a deal where everyone could rise to the top.\n       ``We look at the McDonald's system as a three-legged \n     stool,'' Beavers said. Each leg--corporate, franchisees and \n     suppliers--are necessary in order to keep the stool on its \n     feet. ``No one has been all three,'' Beavers said. Until now.\n       Beavers is part of an investment group, including Berkshire \n     Partners, that purchased Fresh Start Bakeries from the \n     Campbell Soup Company in 1999. Fresh Start's 14 bakeries \n     worldwide supply 24 percent of McDonald's restaurants in the \n     U.S., 64 percent of the Latin America restaurants and 14 \n     percent of those in Europe. Beavers will serve as a director \n     of Fresh Start. In addition, Beavers and Honesty purchased a \n     majority interest in the Kansas City bakery and formed a \n     joint venture with Fresh Start. Honesty is president and \n     chief operating officer and Beavers is chairman and CEO.\n       They chose buns because it's a core product that McDonald's \n     uses in large quantities, and the Kansas City location \n     because it's in ``the heart of the bread basket'' and close \n     to the McDonald's restaurants they supply.\n       While McDonald's is their largest customer, they don't have \n     a written contract. All arrangements with suppliers at \n     McDonald's are by a handshake, Beavers said. That's the way \n     Ray Kroc started doing business in 1955 and the way the \n     company still does it, he said. ``We (suppliers) have to do \n     our part, they (corporate) have to do their part. It makes \n     for a powerful relationship,'' he said.\n       Structuring the deal with a handshake has served McDonald's \n     well, Beavers said, and ``that's the spirit (in which) I want \n     to grow our business.''\n\n\n                           Leaving Corporate\n\n       Part of the reason Honesty was able to join Beavers in the \n     endeavor with a minimum amount of trepidation was that they \n     were able to get McDonald's ``blessing'' before leaping. Both \n     knew that being a supplier to McDonald's was a win-win deal.\n       Honesty had put together a blue binder with his mission \n     statement, attributes and financials and took it to \n     McDonald's purchasing department a couple of years before the \n     Fresh Start deal materialized. He let it be known, he said, \n     that he was interested in becoming a supplier for McDonald's.\n       Meanwhile, Beavers was also looking for a change of pace. \n     When he heard about the bakery opportunity, he spoke to the \n     head of McDonald's, Jack Greenberg, who Beavers said thought \n     it was a great opportunity.\n       It was a great opportunity for Honesty also, who invested \n     his life's savings and stock options in his quest for the \n     entrepreneurial life. He moved his family, a son, 15, and a \n     daughter, 11, from the Chicago area to Kansas City, \n     necessitating his wife to give up her prestigious job as a \n     medical director for Advocate Health Care.\n       Was he nervous? ``I didn't dwell on the nervousness or the \n     `what ifs,' '' he said. ``I hope to remain nervous forever, I \n     don't want to get complacent; I need to maximize my \n     potential. I'm just where I want to be--slightly over my \n     head,'' he said.\n       Because of their positive experiences with McDonald's both \n     men knew they wanted to remain in the family. Their training \n     at McDonald's, including sweeping the floors and learning how \n     to make a hamburger, prepared them to build their company \n     based on McDonald's winning recipe.\n       Beavers' experience on the board for 19 years gave him a \n     ``good understanding of how a public company is run and great \n     insight into developing a brand.''\n       Honesty's dealing with the legal side of the business \n     taught him about fairness and how to settle problems at the \n     business table rather than in court. In business, he said, \n     you're in it for the long haul, and the ones you met on the \n     way up are the same ones you'll meet on the way down,'' he \n     contends.\n       While McDonald's will always be their No. 1 customer--\n     ``Always dance with the one who brung you.'' Honesty quips--\n     Great Harvest has room in its production schedule to develop \n     other business. One contract they've won is with the U.S. \n     military to develop a soft roll that can be used as rations \n     during the military's war games. ``It's an exotic, tough bun \n     to make,'' Honesty said, but could prove to be a lucrative \n     one now that they've got the military specs down pat. They're \n     also looking into doing private labeling for supermarkets, \n     Beavers said.\n       One thing the pair wants to ensure down the road is that \n     the bakery remains a minority venture, Honesty said. Beavers \n     welcomes\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\n     the opportunity to bring two of his four grown children into \n     the company. And even though they've left their corporate \n     jobs, they still consider themselves a part of McDonald's \n     extended family. A very important leg on that three-legged \n     stool that keeps McDonald's centered.\n       ``We've got a passion for McDonald's,'' Honesty said.\n\n\n                      the bun part of the business\n\n       Name: Best Harvest Bakeries\n       Location: Kansas City, Kansas\n       Production capacity: 3,000 dozen buns an hour, 17 million \n     dozen buns, or soft rolls, a year\n       Shifts: Five days a week for three shifts\n       Size: 32,000 square feet\n       Employees: about 47\n       Customers: 560 McDonald's restaurants, the U.S. Military, \n     which just awarded Best Harvest a contract to make a bun that \n     serves as rations during military ``war games'' (all the \n     oxygen is taken out of the package so the bun stays fresh for \n     three years).\n       Goal: ``To become the premier supplier of grain-based \n     products having outstanding quality in a service environment \n     that exceeds our customers' expectations while ensuring that \n     our customers receive unsurpassed value from our \n     relationship.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5026-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5026-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ENTITLED ``THE WEKIVA RIVER ROCK SPRING RUN AND SEMINOLE \n              CREEK''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 113\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I take pleasure in transmitting the enclosed report for the Wekiva \nRiver and several tributaries in Florida. The report and my \nrecommendations are in response to the provisions of the Wild and \nScenic Rivers Act, Public Law 90-542, as amended. The Wekiva study was \nauthorized by Public Law 104-311.\n  The National Park Service conducted the study with assistance from \nthe Wekiva River Basin Working Group, a committee established by the \nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection to represent a broad \nspectrum of environmental and developmental interests. The study found \nthat 45.5 miles of river are eligible for the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System (the ``System'') based on free-flowing character, good \nwater qualify, and ``outstandingly remarkable'' scenic, recreational, \nfish and wildlife, and historic/cultural values.\n  Almost all the land adjacent to the eligible rivers is in public \nownership and managed by State and county governments for conservation \npurposes. The exception to this pattern is the 3.9-mile-long Seminole \nCreek that is in private ownership. The public land managers strongly \nsupport designation while the private landowner opposes designation of \nhis land. Therefore, I recommend that the 41.6 miles of river abutted \nby public lands and as described in the enclosed report be designated a \ncomponent of the System. Seminole Creek could be added if the adjacent \nlandowner should change his mind or if this land is ever purchased by \nan individual or conservation agency who does not object. The tributary \nis not centrally located in the area proposed for designation.\n  I further recommend that legislation designating the Wekiva and \neligible tributaries specify that on-the-ground management \nresponsibilities remain with the existing land manager and not the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior. This is in accordance with \nexpressed State wishes and is logical. Responsibilities of the \nSecretary should be limited to working with State and local partners in \ndeveloping a comprehensive river management plan, providing technical \nassistance, and reviewing effects of water resource development \nproposals in accordance with section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers \nAct.\n  We look forward to working with the Congress to designate this worthy \naddition to the National Wild and Scenic River System.\n                                                   William J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Home \nOwnership Made Easy (HOME) Act, which will expand home ownership \nopportunities for low- and moderate-income, first-time home buyers.\n  Providing affordable, fair, and quality housing for all people is \nimportant. Home ownership is not only the American Dream, it also \nincreases pride in community, schools, and safety. Too often, however, \nAmerican workers who make too much money to qualify for public \nassistance and too little money to afford a home on their own are stuck \nin the middle. These families are stuck in substandard housing or in \nneighborhoods that are far from their jobs. Fortunately, in the early \n1980's, Congress established the Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program, \nwhich allowed state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds to \nfinance mortgages at below-market interest rates to first-time home \nbuyers. Unfortunately, as sometimes happens in government programs, \nadministrative barriers have rendered the program less effective in \nrecent years.\n  The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment have been unable to collect and maintain statistical data \non average area purchase prices in all states. In Arkansas for \ninstance, the MRB Program is based on an average area purchase price \nthat was established in 1993. This means that, while housing prices are \ngoing up, the\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nthreshhold for homeowners to qualify for an MRB loan has stayed the \nsame.\n  The HOME Act reduces the administrative burden on the Internal \nRevenue Service and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It \nwill allow state and local housing finance agencies to use a multiple \nof income limits, which are readily available and updated annually. \nRelying on already established MRB income requirements is a natural fit \nbecause families generally purchase homes within their income range.\n  The Mortgage Revenue Bond program is a state administered program \nthat works. The HOME Act will continue to expand the MRB's track record \nand success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASE IN PURCHASE PRICE LIMITATION UNDER \n                   MORTGAGE SUBSIDY BOND RULES BASED ON MEDIAN \n                   FAMILY INCOME.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 143(e) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to purchase price \n     requirement) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--An issue meets the requirements of this \n     subsection only if the acquisition cost of each residence the \n     owner-financing of which is provided under the issue does not \n     exceed the greater of--\n       ``(A) 90 percent of the average area purchase price \n     applicable to the residence, or\n       ``(B) 3.5 times the applicable median family income (as \n     defined in subsection (f)(4)).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to obligations issued after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2715. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto ballistic identification of handguns; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  ballistics fingerprints act of 2000\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Ballistics Fingerprints Act of 2000'' which will help reduce gun \nviolence in our communities. Despite recent progress in reducing gun \nviolence, the number of people killed or injured each year in this \ncountry remains too high. Each year more than 32,000 Americans are \nkilled by gunfire. This means that each day, almost 90 Americans, \nincluding almost 12 young people under the age of 19, die from gunshot \nwounds. For each fatal shooting, three more people are injured by \ngunfire. These grim statistics require all of us to do more to further \nreduce gun violence.\n  History has shown that coordinated law enforcement strategies \ninvolving the public and private sector are the most effective tools in \nreducing gun violence. This includes targeting the illegal shipment of \nfirearms and implementing strategies to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals. It also includes using advanced technologies, such as \ncomputer ballistic imaging, to assist law enforcement in investigating \nand identifying violent criminals.\n  Like fingerprints, the barrel of a firearm leaves distinguishing \nmarks on a bullet and cartridge case and no two firearms leave the same \nmarks. Computer ballistic imaging technology allows these \ndistinguishing marks or characteristics to be maintained in a database \nwhere they can be rapidly compared with evidence from a crime scene for \npossible matches. The ATF and FBI have been using this technology since \n1993 to help state and local crime laboratories across the country link \ngun-related crimes and recently these agencies entered into an \nagreement to create one unified system. In 1999 alone, a total of 2,026 \nmatches were made with this unified system which represents the linkage \nof at least 4,052 firearm related crimes.\n  The ``Ballistice Fingerprints Act'' would take this innovative \napproach to crime fighting one step further by creating a national \nregistry of ballistic fingerprints. Under this legislation, every gun \nmanufacturer will be required to obtain the ballistic fingerprints or \nidentifying characteristics for every gun manufactured prior to \ndistribution so that guns used in the commission of a crime can be \neasily traced and identified. The bill also requires the Department of \nTreasury to inspect this information and create a national registry of \nballistic fingerprints. With the help of this information, police will \nbe better able to locate and identify the guns used in criminal \nactivity and to prosecute the criminals who use these guns.\n  The saturation of guns in American communities and the frequency of \ngun related violence calls upon all us to do more to combat gun related \nviolence. Common sense tells us that one way to further reduce firearm \nviolence is to identify the guns used in committing these crimes so \nthat the criminals who use these can be brought to justice. Regardless \nof where one stands on gun control, we all should be able to unite \nbehind this simple but highly effective crime fighting tool. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation enacted \ninto law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ballistic Fingerprints Act \n     of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. HANDGUN BALLISTIC IDENTIFICATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 923 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Handgun Ballistic Identification.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `projectile' means the part of handgun \n     ammunition that is, by means of an explosion, expelled \n     through the barrel of a handgun; and\n       ``(B) the term `shell casing' means the part of handgun \n     ammunition that contains the primer and propellant powder to \n     discharge the projectile.\n       ``(2) Inclusion of handgun identifiers in manufacturer \n     shipments.--A licensed manufacturer shall include, in a \n     separate sealed container inside the container in which a \n     handgun is shipped or transported to a licensed dealer--\n       ``(A) a projectile discharged from that handgun;\n       ``(B) a shell casing of a projectile discharged from that \n     handgun; and\n       ``(C) any information that identifies the handgun, \n     projectile, or shell casing, as may be required by the \n     Secretary by regulation.\n       ``(3) Requirements relating to dealers.--A licensed dealer \n     shall--\n       ``(A) upon receipt of a handgun from a licensed \n     manufacturer, notify the Secretary regarding whether the \n     manufacturer complied with the requirements of paragraph (2); \n     and\n       ``(B) upon the sale, lease, or transfer of a handgun \n     shipped or transported in accordance with paragraph (2), \n     transfer to the Secretary the sealed container included in \n     the container with the handgun pursuant to that paragraph.\n       ``(4) Duties of secretary.--The Secretary shall establish \n     and maintain a computer database of all information \n     identifying each projectile, shell casing, and other \n     information included in a sealed container transferred to the \n     Secretary under paragraph (3).''.\n       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     promulgate final regulations to carry out the amendment made \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date on which the Secretary of the \n     Treasury promulgates final regulations under subsection \n     (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n\n  S. 2716. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation and the \nAdministrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Administration from taking \naction to finalize, implement, or enforce a rule relating to the hours \nof service of drivers for motor carriers; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the motor carrier fairness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Motor Carrier \nFairness Act of 2000. This legislation would prohibit the Secretary of \nTransportation and Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration from taking action to finalize, implement, or enforce a \nrule relating to the hours of service of drivers for motor carriers.\n  Trucking is the backbone of the U.S. economy. The industry transports \napproximately 80 percent of the nation's freight, and well over 70 \npercent of communities in the United States depend solely on trucking \nto deliver their goods. The hours of service are arguably the single \nmost important rule\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\ngoverning how trucking companies and truck drivers operate. However, \nthe Department's proposed rules fail to consider the impact of the \nproposal on the nation's economy as well as the drivers.\n  The fundamental change in hours is a shift from an 18 hour, to a 24-\nhour clock. Under DOT's proposed rules, a driver's basic workday would \nbe 12 hours on, 12 hours off with mandatory two consecutive days off. I \nwas amazed to find out that by imposing these changes and increasing \nthe number of off-duty hours DOT creates the need for a 50 percent \nincrease in the number of refrigerated and dry van trucks. This in turn \ntranslates into an additional 180,000 drivers and trucks on already \ncrowded roads, just to keep the current economy moving. I know, from \nspeaking to freight carriers in my home state of Colorado, that the job \nmarket is already short approximately 80,000 drivers, and these \ntrucking companies are experiencing substantial problems finding the \nnecessary number of drivers for their operations.\n  There are many reasons why this bill is necessary. For example DOT's \nproposals would:\n  Reduce driver's salaries since they are paid per mile. By reducing \nthe overall working time from 15 to 12 hours, salaries will also \ndecrease. A 12-hour day will not allow drivers to take advantage of \nincome opportunities that fluctuating freight volumes provide. \nFurthermore, as an article in the Denver Post reported today, the \nmandatory weekend time off could result in thousands of dollars of lost \nincome per year for drivers.\n  Overcrowded rest stops. There are an estimated 187,000 parking stalls \nin truck stops around the country and the 2.5 to 3 million Class 8 \ntrucks, and the result is overcrowded rest stops. Most drivers will be \nforced to use public rest stops, gas stations or even highway ramps to \ncomply with the proposed rules. In fact the DOT held a field hearing \nyesterday at the Jefferson County Fairgrounds in Colorado. Truckers \nthere specifically warned of the re-emergence of thieves, scam artists, \nand prostitutes who linger around truck stops, preying on resting \ntruckers.\n\n  These rules would inevitably crowd the highways with more trucks. \nSince waiting time at loading docks is considered ``on-duty'' hours, \nrefrigerated carriers will need 70 percent more trucks in order to meet \ndelivery times and dry-freight haulers another 50 percent. This means \nthat 600,000 to 700,000 more trucks will be needed in order to keep \nwith the current delivery pace. In another example from the afore \nmentioned article, a mozzarella cheese maker in Denver will have to add \n23 new truck tractors in order to compensate for the down time of \ndrivers forced to idle because of these new rules. I might also add \nthat this proposal claims to reduce the number of highway fatalities, \nbut as we can see the need to add more trucks to our roads will only \nincrease the possibility of highway accidents occurring. The number of \ntruck related accidents has actually decreased 34 percent in the last \n10 years, so we should not allow the DOT to reverse this trend through \nits proposed rule.\n  Another area of concern regards the issue of the ``electronic onboard \nrecorders'' that will track the drivers hours. The cost of equipping \nType I and II long haul trucks with these devices is most certainly \ngoing to be passed on for the companies to bear. These devices, at \napproximately $1,000 apiece, could put some smaller hauling companies \nout of business.\n  Mr. President, I have been and still am a trucker. In fact, I just \nrenewed my commercial drivers license last year. I understand first \nhand the concerns that most workers in this industry have with the \nproposed regulations. The trucking industry provides millions of \nAmericans with on-time delivery. Our economy is dependent on this, and \nI believe that these proposed rules have not taken the impact of this \naspect into consideration.\n  The cost of DOT's plan is not limited to the trucking industry as a \nwhole, but will disrupt our nation's supply chain which consequentially \nwill have a ripple effect on the rest of our economy, not to mention \nAmerican jobs. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join in support of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2716\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Reg. 25539), and issued under authority delegated to the \n     Administrator under section 113 of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 2721. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore \nthe deduction for lobbying expenses in connection with State \nlegislation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        grassroots advocacy tax\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleagues Senators Shelby, Breaux, Conrad and Reid to \nmake it easier for Americans to participate in the decision-making \nprocess in their state capitols. Current tax law denies main street \nbusiness the ability to deduct legitimate expenses incurred while \nadvocating their positions at the state level of government. This \nlegislation will remove both the financial and administrative penalties \nimposed by this ``grassroots advocacy tax.''\n  As part of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress approved a \nproposal recommended by President Clinton to deny the deductibility of \nexpenses incurred to lobby on legislative issues. As passed, the bill \ncreated an ``advocacy tax'' by denying a business tax deduction for \nexpenses incurred to address legislation at both the state and federal \nlevels. Expenses incurred regarding the legislative actions of local \ngovernments, however, are exempt from this tax.\n  When the deductibility for lobbying expenses was partially repealed \nin 1993, the debate centered on activities at the federal level. The \nfact that lobbying at the local level is exempt indicates that the \noriginal authors of this proposal did not intend to cover all lobbying \nactivities. Although lobbying at the state level was not part of the \ndebate, it was included in the final legislation that was approved by \nCongress. This grassroots advocacy tax is an unwarranted intrusion of \nthe federal government on the activity of state governments. We should \nnot make it harder for Americans to participate in the decision making \nprocess in their state capitols.\n  At the state level, there is more active outside participation in the \nlegislative process. This is partly because state legislatures have \nsmaller staffs and meet less frequently than the U.S. Congress. In most \nstates, the job of state legislator is part-time. In addition, many \ngovernors appoint ``Blue Ribbon Commissions'' and other advisory groups \nto recommend legislative solutions to problems peculiar to a specific \nstate. These advisory groups depend on input from members of the \nbusiness, professional and agricultural community knowledgeable about \nparticular issues.\n  However, the record keeping requirements and penalties associated \nwith this tax discourage and penalize participation in the legislative \nprocess by businesses in all fifty states. This is especially true for \nthe many state trade associations, most of whom are small operations \nnot equipped to comply with the pages and pages of confusing federal \nregulations implementing this law. Compliance is both time consuming \nand complicated, and detracts from the legitimate and necessary work \nand services they perform for their members, who are primarily small \nbusinesses that depend on these associations to look after their \ninterests.\n  This bill is very simple. It restores the deductibility of business \nexpenses incurred for activities to deal with legislation at the state \nlevel, and gives them the same treatment that exists under current law \nfor similar activities at the local level. This change will help ensure \nthat the voices of citizen advocates and main street businesses will\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nbe heard in their state capitols. It is good legislation and it should \nbe enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2724. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to carry out an \nassessment of State, municipal, and private dams in the State of \nVermont and to make appropriate modifications to the dams; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                        Vermont Dam Legislation\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of a \npressing problem that affects not only the streams and rivers of \nVermont, but the land and people who live and work along their winding \nroutes. Vermont is home to over 2,000 dams of all sizes that clog \nVermont's 5,000 river miles. Many of these dams were built in the \neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when industries were located along \nrivers to utilize dams for running machinery, dispose of waste, and \ntransport raw materials and goods. Currently, most of these dams no \nlonger serve any commercial purpose and sit in disrepair, posing a \nsignificant safety threat and fundamentally altering the surrounding \nenvironment.\n  There are 150 dams in Vermont listed as either ``high'' or \n``significant'' hazard, meaning that the failure of one of these dams \npresents a real threat to human life, property, and the environment. \nLast week, a Vermont newspaper highlighted the extreme danger if one of \nthese dams were to fail by describing the 80 feet high wall water that \nwould crash down the river valley if the Waterbury dam were to fail. \nSuch a structural failure would mean that 22 square miles would be \nflooded, and a 15 foot high wall of water would hit the city of \nBurlington.\n  A disaster of this scope would be caused by the breakage of only a \nfew dams across the state, but serious and extensive damage could also \nbe caused by many smaller, similarly weak dams. Not only could damage \noccur due to failure, but many of the dams pose a significant threat to \npeople using rivers for recreational purposes. The dams contain broken \nconcrete, protruding metal, rotted timber cribbing and other hazards \nthat threaten fisherman, boaters and swimmers with a serious threat of \ninjury or death.\n  Not only are people and property at risk, but significant harm is \nbeing inflicted on the environment. Dams alter the basic \ncharacteristics of the rivers in which they are constructed and \ndirectly affect the features that comprise a riverine habitat. Non-\nfunctioning dams unnecessarily block wildlife, including fish that are \nattempting to migrate to spawn.\n  The Vermont Dam Remediation and Restoration Program allows the Army \nCorps of Engineers to enter into partnership with State, municipal, and \nprivate dam owners to assess and modify dams. The expertise and \nresources of the Corps would provide the much needed assistance to dam \nowners who would otherwise be unable to properly assess and modify \ndangerous, structurally unsound or environmentally harmful dams. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in addressing this critical problem and \nquickly pass this much needed authorizing legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2725. A bill to provide for a system of sanctuaries for \nchimpanzees that have been designated as being no longer needed in \nresearch conducted or supported by the Public Health Service, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n     chimpanzee health improvement, maintenance and protection act\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I rise along \nwith Senators Durbin, Kerrey, Lautenberg, and Jeffords to introduce the \nChimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection (C.H.I.M.P.) \nAct. This legislation will create a nonprofit sanctuary system for \nhousing chimpanzees that federal researchers have decided are no longer \nneeded for their research. Our bill, establishes a public/private \nmatching fund which will provide for the permanent retirement of these \nanimals. This is a wonderful opportunity for the Senate to support the \nsanctuary concept which is backed by many distinguished scientists, \nincluding Dr. Jane Goodall and humane people across the country. Mr. \nPresident, in the wild, the chimpanzee is an endangered species. We are \nfortunate that we have an opportunity now to provide decent, humane \ncare for a species which is, sadly, on the decline in its natural \nhabitat.\n  At this point in time we have a tremendous surplus of research \nchimpanzees in the United States. It began in the 1980's, when the \nterrible AIDS epidemic first appeared. Researchers in Federal agencies \ncreated breeding colonies of chimpanzees in five regional chimp \ncenters. The hope was that chimpanzees, because of their genetic \nsimilarity to humans, would be a good model for various AIDS vaccine \nexperiments. Scientists discovered, however, that although the \nchimpanzees proved to be carriers of the virus, that once it was \ninjected into them, the chimps do not develop full-blown AIDS.\n  For this reason, many researchers are, in their own words, getting \nout of the chimp business. The chimpanzee does not serve as a model for \nhow the disease progresses in humans and the researchers want to divest \nthemselves of these intelligent animals. The problem is that there is \nreally no place for the chimpanzees to go. Many of the chimps will live \nto be 50 years old! It is estimated that several hundred of the \napproximately 1,500 chimps currently in labs are ready to be sent to \nsanctuaries, but that we lack the sanctuary space to house them.\n  In a sanctuary the chimps can be put in small groups rather than \nliving in isolation as many do in labs. Small social groups enable the \nchimps to recover from research more quickly both physically and \nmentally, and it is far more cost-effective than housing them in the \npresent laboratory system. We should remember that taxpayers are \ncurrently footing the bill for what is basically the ``warehousing'' of \nthese animals in expensive and inhumane labs.\n  I have based many of the features of the C.H.I.M.P. bill on a report \nentitled ``Chimpanzees in Research: Strategies for Their Ethical Care, \nManagement, and Use,'' that was published in 1997 by the National \nResearch Council. In this study of research chimps, the well-respected \nNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) reported that there may be \napproximately 500 chimpanzees that are no longer needed in research. \nThe NAS recommended that NIH initiate a breeding moratorium for at \nleast 5 years, that surplus chimps be placed in sanctuaries rather than \nbe euthanized, and that animal protection organizations, along with \nscientists, have input into the standards of care and the operation of \nthe sanctuaries.\n  Our bill has addressed all these issues and is supported by The \nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, The American \nAnti-Vivisection Society, The Humane Society of the United States, The \nNational Anti-Vivisection Society and The Society for Animal Protective \nLegislation. I want to again point out that our bill does not interfere \nwith any ongoing medical experiments involving chimps. The bill allows \nfor the retirement of chimps only after the researchers themselves have \ndecided that a chimp is no longer useful in research. This is the \nhumane, ethical, and fiscally responsible way to handle the question of \nwhat to do with a surplus of intelligent animals who have contributed \nto the knowledge of science and the health and well-being of humanity. \nThis really should be a nonpartisan issue and I am proud to ask for the \nsupport of all my Senate colleagues.\n\n

following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas 40 percent of children who live in households \n     without a father have not seen their father in at least 1 \n     year and 50 percent of such children have never visited their \n     father's home;\n       Whereas approximately 50 percent of all children born in \n     the United States spend at least \\1/2\\ of their childhood in \n     a family without a father figure;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through \n     12 report that they have not had a meaningful conversation \n     with even 1 parent in over a month;\n       Whereas 3 out of 4 adolescents report that ``they do not \n     have adults in their lives that model positive behaviors'';\n       Whereas many of the United States leading experts on family \n     and child development agree that it is in the best interest \n     of both children and the United States to encourage more two-\n     parent, father-involved families to form and endure;\n       Whereas it is important to promote responsible fatherhood \n     and encourage loving and healthy relationships between \n     parents and their children in order to increase the chance \n     that children will have two caring parents to help them grow \n     up healthy and secure and not to--\n       (1) denigrate the standing or parenting efforts of single \n     mothers, whose efforts are heroic;\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\n       (2) lessen the protection of children from abusive parents;\n       (3) cause women to remain in or enter into abusive \n     relationships; or\n       (4) compromise the health or safety of a custodial parent;\n       Whereas children who are apart from their biological father \n     are, in comparison to other children--\n       (1) 5 times more likely to live in poverty; and\n       (2) more likely to--\n       (A) bring weapons and drugs into the classroom;\n       (B) commit crime;\n       (C) drop out of school;\n       (D) be abused;\n       (E) commit suicide;\n       (F) abuse alcohol or drugs; and\n       (G) become pregnant as teenagers;\n       Whereas the Federal Government spends billions of dollars \n     to address these social ills and very little to address the \n     causes of such social ills;\n       Whereas violent criminals are overwhelmingly males who grew \n     up without fathers;\n       Whereas the number of children living with only a mother \n     increased from just over 5,000,000 in 1960, to 17,000,000 in \n     1999, and between 1981 and 1991 the percentage of children \n     living with only 1 parent increased from 19 percent to 25 \n     percent;\n       Whereas between 20 percent and 30 percent of families in \n     poverty are headed by women who have suffered domestic \n     violence during the past year and between 40 percent and 60 \n     percent of women with children who receive welfare were \n     abused at some time in their life;\n       Whereas millions of single mothers in the United States are \n     heroically struggling to raise their children in safe, loving \n     environments;\n       Whereas responsible fatherhood should always recognize and \n     promote values of nonviolence;\n       Whereas child support is an important means by which a \n     parent can take financial responsibility for a child and \n     emotional support is an important means by which a parent can \n     take social responsibility for a child;\n       Whereas children learn by example, community programs that \n     help mold young men into positive role models for their \n     children need to be encouraged;\n       Whereas promoting responsible fatherhood is not meant to \n     diminish the parenting efforts of single mothers but rather \n     to increase the likelihood that children will have 2 caring \n     parents to help them grow up in loving environments; and\n       Whereas Congress has begun to take notice of this issue \n     with legislation introduced in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate to address the epidemic of \n     fatherlessness: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to encourage active involvement of \n     fathers in the rearing and development of their children;\n       (2) recognizes that while there are millions of fathers who \n     serve as a wonderful caring parent for their children, there \n     are children on Father's Day who will have no one to \n     celebrate with;\n       (3) urges fathers to participate in their children's lives \n     both financially and emotionally;\n       (4) encourages fathers to devote time, energy, and \n     resources to their children;\n       (5) urges fathers to understand the level of responsibility \n     required when fathering a child and to fulfill that \n     responsibility;\n       (6) is committed to assist absent fathers become more \n     responsible and engaged in their children's lives;\n       (7) designates June 18, 2000, as ``National Responsible \n     Father's Day'';\n       (8) calls upon fathers around the country to use the day to \n     reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's \n     lives, to spend ``National Responsible Father's Day'' with \n     their children, and to express their love and support for \n     their children; and\n       (9) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Responsible Father's Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/13/senate-section/article/S5033-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5033-S5053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED ON JUNE 6, 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       COLLINS AMENDMENT NO. 3174\n\n  Ms. COLLINS proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 4576) making \nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2001, and for other purposes, which was previously \nsubmitted and intended to be proposed by her to the bill (S. 2593) \nmaking appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes;

For purposes of Section 201 of the Drug Price \n     Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, commonly known \n     as the Hatch-Waxman Act (35 U.S.C. 156), a patent which \n     claims an elemental biologic used in manufacturing a product \n     shall be eligible for an extension of its term on the same \n     terms and conditions as other patents eligible under such \n     Section, except that: (1) under 35 U.S.C. 156(a)(4), the \n     product manufactured using such elemental biologic, rather \n     than such elemental biologic, shall have been subject to a \n     regulatory review period before its commercial marketing or \n     use; and (2) an application for extension of term may be \n     submitted within the sixty-day period beginning on the date \n     of enactment of this section or within the sixty-day period \n     beginning on the date the patent becomes eligible for \n     extension under this section. For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``elemental biologic'' means a genetically \n     engineered cell, or method of making thereof, used in \n     manufacturing five or more new drugs, antibiotic drugs, or \n     human biological products, each subject to a regulatory \n     review period before commercial marketing or use and each \n     receiving permission under the provision of law under which \n     the applicable regulatory review period occurred for \n     commercial marketing or use. To be eligible to apply for a \n     term extension under this section, the owner of record of a \n     patent claiming an elemental biologic must: (1) be a non-\n     profit organization as defined by section 201 of title 35; \n     (2) not itself commercially sell the product, and have made \n     reasonable efforts to promote utilization of the patented \n     invention in commercial markets by licensing, on a non-\n     exclusive, royalty free or reasonable royalty basis, rights \n     to make, use, offer to sell, or sell the invention; and (3) \n     share any royalties with the inventor, and after payment of \n     expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to \n     administration of inventions, invest the balance of any \n     royalties or income earned from the invention in scientific \n     research or education. This section shall apply to any patent \n     not yet expired at the time of enactment of this section and \n     to any patent issued thereafter. A timely applicant shall be \n     entitled to a decision by the Commissioner of Patents and \n     Trademarks granting or denying the application prior to such \n     expiration of the patent, or if the Commissioner cannot \n     render such decision prior to such expiration, an extension \n     under section 156(e)(2), Title 35 United States Code, prior \n     to expiration of the patent.\n       Sec. 2802. At the end of the first paragraph under the \n     heading ``National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     Operations, Research, and Facilities'' in title II of H.R. \n     3421 of the 106th Congress as enacted by section 1000(a)(1) \n     of Public Law 106-113, add the following: ``: Provided \n     further, That the vessel RAINIER shall use Ketchikan, Alaska \n     as its home port''.\n       Sec. 2803.

Mr. President, could I interrupt the proceedings here \nmomentarily and get the attention of the distinguished Democratic \nleader and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee?\n  Early this morning, I say to the distinguished minority leader, on \nthe subject of General Gordon, we talked and I talked to the majority \nleader. I think there is a consensus that tomorrow morning at some \npoint his nomination can be voted upon.\n  Could we, at the conclusion of this day, before it is finished, at \nleast represent that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in response to the senior Senator from \nVirginia, let me say we have no objection to moving to the nomination, \nwith the understanding that at a date no later than a date that we \ncould mutually agree to, we deal with the accompanying nomination.\n  I think that understanding has now been made, and I believe we can \nproceed to the first piece of this with that understanding.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished leader.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point, General Gordon \nhas very strong support on both sides of the aisle. He is a \nPresidential nominee who has gotten a very positive response from just \nabout everybody I know. I think the people look forward to voting on \nhis nomination as early as possible tomorrow morning.\n  Again, I think there is an effort being made to set a deadline for \nanother vote on a nominee to the same Department, someone who has been \nwaiting for a long time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for another \nmoment, Madelyn Creedon has been on the calendar since April 13, and \nGeneral Gordon has been on the calendar since May 24.\n  We have no objection to moving to General Gordon first, even though \nhe was just reported out a couple of weeks ago, and Mrs. Creedon has \nbeen now on the calendar for almost 2 months, with some understanding \nthat we can move to the Creedon nomination no later than a time on \nwhich we can agree.\n  We have no reason not to want to move to the Gordon nomination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it would be no longer than the day or day \nafter we return from the July 4 recess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is acceptable, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER. July 11 or July 12.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. With the understanding we would vote no later than July \n11, we have no reservations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could we make it July 12? I am not in a position to know \nexactly when votes are ordered on the return.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will make it the July 12.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that, that opens the \npossibilities\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nthat we would vote on that nomination prior to the recess because it \nsays ``no later than.''\n  Mr. WARNER. It does not foreclose earlier consideration.

Res. 322\n\n       Encouraging and promoting greater involvement of fathers in \n     their children's lives and designating June 18, 2000, as \n     ``Responsible Father's Day''.\n       Whereas 40 percent of children who live in households \n     without a father have not seen their father in at least 1 \n     year and 50 percent of such children have never visited their \n     father's home;\n       Whereas approximately 50 percent of all children born in \n     the United States spend at least \\1/2\\ of their childhood in \n     a family without a father figure;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through \n     12 report that they have not had a meaningful conversation \n     with even 1 parent in over a month;\n       Whereas 3 out of 4 adolescents report that ``they do not \n     have adults in their lives that model positive behaviors'';\n       Whereas many of the United States leading experts on family \n     and child development agree that it is in the best interest \n     of both children and the United States to encourage more two-\n     parent, father-involved families to form and endure;\n       Whereas it is important to promote responsible fatherhood \n     and encourage loving and healthy relationships between \n     parents and their children in order to increase the chance \n     that children will have two caring parents to help them grow \n     up healthy and secure and not to--\n       (1) denigrate the standing or parenting efforts of single \n     mothers, whose efforts are heroic;\n       (2) lessen the protection of children from abusive parents;\n       (3) cause women to remain in or enter into abusive \n     relationships;

FREEMAN, JAMES K. OKUBO, AND ANDREW J. \n                                 SMITH\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2722, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Akaka.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2722) to authorize the award of the Medal of \n     Honor to Ed W. Freeman, James K. Okubo, and Andrew J. Smith.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation which \nwould award the Medal of Honor to James K. Okubo, Ed W. Freeman, and \nAndrew J. Smith. There is no doubt that these three individuals are \ndeserving of this award based on their brave and selfless service in \ndefense of our great nation. The passage of this measure makes it \npossible for these men to receive a long overdue and well-deserve \nhonor.\n  This legislation marks the culmination of my efforts to recognize \nJames K. Okubo for his acts of gallantry during World War II. James K. \nOkubo was born in Ancacortes, Washington, raised in Bellingham, \nWashington, and interned at Tule Lake, California. Mr. Okubo entered \nmilitary service in Alturas, California on May 22, 1943 and was \ndischarged from the Army in December 1945. Following his military \nservice, Mr. Okubo was a professor at the University of Detroit Dental \nSchool. Mr. Okubo passed away following a car accident in 1967.\n  Mr. Okubo (Tec 5) served as a medic, member of the Medical \nDetachment, 442nd Regimental Combat Team. For his heroism displayed \nover a period of several days (October 28, 29 and November 4, 1944) in \nrescuing and delivering medical aid to fellow soldiers during the \nrescue of the ``Lost Battalion'' from Texas, he was recommended to \nreceive the Medal of Honor. The medal, however, was downgraded to a \nSilver Star. The explanation provided at the time was that as a medic, \nJames S. Okubo was not eligible for any award higher than the Silver \nStar.\n  Due to my concern that Mr. Okubo did not receive full recognition for \nhis acts of heroism and bravery, I requested reconsideration of Mr. \nOkubo's case under section 1130, Title 10 of the United States Code. \nThe Senior Army Decorations Board reviewed the case and submitted it to \nSecretary Caldera recommending an upgrade to the Medal of Honor. \nSecretary Caldera approved the recommendation which resulted in this \nimportant measure.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n  This legislation is especially significant as fellow members of Mr. \nOkubo's unit will be awarded the Medal of Honor next week. It is my \nhope that this legislation will be enacted shortly, thereby allowing \nthe Okubo family to participate in this auspicious event with the other \nfamilies of members from the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regimental Combat \nTeam.\n  Mr. Okubo's heroism on the battlefield is an inspiration to all who \nbelieve in duty, honor, and service to one's country. Mr. Okubo takes \nhis rightful place among America's great war heroes. He is a shining \nexample of the sacrifices made by so many other Asian Pacific Americans \nduring World War II, who served our country so ably in spite of the \ndifficulties they faced as members of a suspect minority.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2722) was considered read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2722\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
