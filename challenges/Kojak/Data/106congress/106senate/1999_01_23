You've \nalso taught us that this unity is so precious that we should be willing \nto sacrifice anything in order to maintain it--except the truth. Help \nus to affirm the great undeniable truths that twine the bond of \noneness: We are one Nation under Your sovereignty; our patriotism binds \nus together inseparably; our commitment to the Constitution is \nunswerving. In these bonds that cannot be broken, this Senate has been \nable to deal with the arguments, issues, and opinions of this \nimpeachment trial. Continue to inspire the Senators with civility as \nthey work through answers to the questions raised today.\n  Refresh and rejuvenate those who may be weary or burdened. Dear God, \npreserve the unity of this Senate for its future leadership of our \nbeloved Nation. In Your holy Name. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Deputy Sergeant at Arms will make the \nproclamation.\n  The Deputy Sergeant at Arms, Loretta Symms, made proclamation as \nfollows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, there are 11 \nhours 54 minutes remaining during which Senators may submit questions \nin writing directed to either the managers, on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives, or the counsel for the President.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  And thank you, Chaplain, for your opening prayer. I know we all \nlistened and appreciated the admonitions that were given in that \nprayer.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  I want to say, again, I appreciate the participation of all the \nSenators yesterday. Fifty questions were asked, I think a lot of good \nquestions, and obviously good responses. We have a considerable amount \nof time left for questions. But, again, it is our intent to go today as \nlong as the Senators feel that they have a need for further questions. \nIt is up to 16 hours; it doesn't require 16 hours. So I think we should \ngo forward and try to ask the needed questions, and then get a sense of \nwhere we are as we go through the day.\n  But at any rate, it would be our intent not to go later than 4 p.m. \nWe hope to take a 1-hour lunch break sometime around 12 or 12:30, but \nit will depend on how the questions are going. We will also take a \nbreak here in an hour, hour and a half, something like that.\n  Following today's session, the Senate will reconvene on Monday at 1 \np.m. and resume consideration of the articles of impeachment. All \nMembers will be notified of the details of Monday's schedule, and \nbeyond that, once we have had an opportunity for a consultation between \nSenator Daschle and myself and we get a feel for exactly what Senate \nResolution 16 provides in terms of activities on Monday and Tuesday. In \na continuing effort to make this as bipartisan and as fair as possible, \nyou will note yesterday while we alternated back and forth, some of the \nquestions were directed from this side to the President's counsel and \nthe reverse. I am sure that will happen again some today. We began the \nfirst question yesterday and you concluded; so today we would reverse \nthat. Senator Daschle will ask the first question and then we will go \nthrough the process until we complete those questions, with us ending \nwith the last question sometime today.\n\n  With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers \nfrom Senator Reid of Nevada.\n\n       Would you please tell us whether you provided notice to \n     counsel for the President, or to any official of the United \n     States Senate, of the managers' discussions with the Office\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\n     of Independent Counsel regarding an informal interview of Ms. \n     Lewinsky, and the intention of the Office of Independent \n     Counsel to file a motion in court to compel Ms. Lewinsky to \n     meet with the managers? If you provided no such notice to \n     counsel for the President or the Senate, please tell us why \n     not.\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, distinguished \ncolleagues, no, the answer to your question. I am not aware of any such \nnotice that was provided as described in the question.\n  I would like to make some clarification on this in terms of the \nwitness, Monica Lewinsky--potential witness. As we have been in an \nevolving discussion over the last few weeks in terms of if we are \nallowed to call witnesses by the Senate, who those witnesses might be, \nwhat our list might look like, obviously, the name of Monica Lewinsky \ncomes up as a potentially very important witness to these proceedings.\n  As many of us in this Chamber have had experience in the law, we very \nmuch would like to talk to some of these witnesses. The core group that \nwe have considered, however, are, in essence, in the White House \ncontrol; they are either employed by the White House or close friends \nand associates of the White House. I am sure the White House, with the \nattorneys, would be very willing to cooperate with us in making those \npeople available.\n  However, Ms. Lewinsky presents a very unique situation in that she is \ngeographically some other place. I am not sure where she is--Los \nAngeles, New York, maybe Washington. But she has attorneys we have to \ndeal with. It would be very critical, as any attorney in this body \nknows, that before you actually talk to a witness, and a witness of \nthat importance to this proceeding, that before you produce her for \nthat testimony, that you talk to her. It was intended to be a \nconversation to discuss it with her.\n  I have personally not seen the immunity agreement that she has, but \nwe understand there is a cooperation proceeding and that that agreement \nis between her, her attorneys, and the independent counsel, the OIC--\nnot Congress, not the managers, not the Senate. So we have no duty, no \nlegal standing, as I understand it, to go in and enforce that \nagreement, were she not to want to meet with us and cooperate pursuant \nto the terms of those agreements, to the agreement.\n  We did contact the OIC to arrange that meeting, and once we \nunderstood that the attorneys did not want to cooperate and furnish \ntheir client to meet with us, we asked the OIC to pursue, further, the \neffort to have Ms. Lewinsky come in and meet with us on an informal \nbasis as, again, anyone would do in preparation for calling a witness \nat a trial.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Fitzgerald, \nHatch, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Senator Thurmond, directed to the House \nmanagers.\n\n       How do you address the White House's argument that removal \n     is a disproportionate remedy for the alleged acts of perjury \n     and obstruction of justice and should there be any particular \n     concern about establishing a precedent that a President can \n     commit felonies while in office and remain President of the \n     United States?\n\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. I think the proportionality question yesterday was \nvery good in that there is a psychology to be used in judicial \ndecisions. I think there are different factors that will influence that \ndecisionmaking process and the ideals that you, as a sitting judge and \njuror, will use to strive to attain them. It is important, I think, \nalso, to have reasonableness and just solutions if you are going to \nindividualize the case, as some may hope to do.\n  I think as a society, if you take a step backward, we are kind of \ncaught in two diverse trends at the moment. You have one trend whereby \njudges like to seek individualized solutions to particularized cases; \nand the other trend is we will apply the law to individualized cases.\n  So, let me give you two best examples of both of those. With regard \nto the best example of individualized solutions to a particular case \nwould be our juvenile justice system. That is where the court would \ncome in and use a variety of means because reformation is, in fact, the \ngoal, and that is what we do in the juvenile court system.\n  As a side note of that, I think in society, with regard to--it could \nbe an act of a firing, it could be an administrative hearing for \nremoval, it could even be a Governor who had an employee who had an \nillicit affair and it was a political appointee and that Governor \ndecided, maybe he decided applying the proportionality that he remove \nhis own political appointee for having an affair. So the \nindividualization can occur out there.\n  The other example I will comment on is the justice according to law, \nand that other trend out there caught in our society--a legislature is \nnot only here in Washington but across in our State jurisdictions; you \nhave legislatures that are beginning to take some of the decisionmaking \nprocesses away from judges and they are saying, specifically, in \nFederal sentencing guidelines, as an example, that if in fact a person \nis convicted of a particular crime or possession of cocaine, the \nlegislature is now telling these judges exactly: This is, in fact, what \nyour sentence will be.\n  So, we are kind of caught, I want you to know, as you are sitting as \njudges and jurors, in this diverse trend that is occurring in our \nsociety. I know as you listen to lectures even from the Supreme Court \nJustices, they are well aware of these trends, and so you are sitting \nand you have to come in your own conscience on how best to make that \nparticular decision. I will note, though, that we have stressed the \nlatter. We have stressed that the rule of law and its importance to our \nsociety not only to serve the public and social interests, but you are \nthe guardian. When, in fact, there are crimes against the State, who is \nthere to serve the public interest? Especially if, in fact, it is the \nPresident, the Vice President, a judicial officer, or other civil \nofficers. Here where you have the President of the United States who \nhas been accused of perjury and obstruction of justice, which are \ncrimes against the State, and as Blackstone said, ``are side by side \nwith bribery,'' who is the guardian, then, of the public interest? So \nin the question of proportionality, it is you; it is you.\n  So when Mr. Craig began by arguing that this trial is not about \nvindicating the rule of law, that only criminal courts are charged with \nthat duty, I would respectfully submit that the President's counsel is \nconfusing the punishment of a particular criminal case or controversy \nin a court with your duty as Congress to ensure that future officers \nentrusted with power granted by the people may not, while their offices \neviscerate the proper administration of justice which is a cornerstone \nof our Republic.\n  I now yield to Mr. Graham.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. I know I have a minute. Great minds can differ on \nthis one: Can you have a high crime, and for the good of the nation \nremoval is not appropriate? I was asked that yesterday, and I kind of \nwanted to make a case about why I think this is not true. This is a \ngreat question.\n  The problem we have here is that you run into the judge cases. When \nyou find that a judge perjured himself, you remove the judge. The \nPresident is different than the judge; I will certainly concede that. \nBut we don't want, I think, in the use of proportionality, to create a \nstandard that doesn't make any sense, that confuses people. The law \nloves repentance. Baptists love repentance. I am a Baptist. In my \nchurch, everybody gets saved about every other week. The idea that if \nyou will come forward and admit you are wrong, you will get a different \nresult, is loved in the law.\n  Another thing to consider about proportionality is the impact on \nsociety. I think you should consider that. I think very much you should \nconsider, even if this is a high crime, the impact on our society, if \nyou decided to make the ultimate punishment. The death penalty of a \npolitical crime is removal from office. I started that train of thought \n3 months ago. Impeachment is equivalent to the political death penalty. \nEvery felony doesn't allow you to have a death penalty. What I hope you \nwill be able to do, as a wise body, is not leave this confusion \nbehind--whether or not it is a crime.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, it can be a high crime, and you \nthen have to decide the impact on society. But if you leave us confused \nabout whether or not this is a crime, the impact on society is far \ngreater than if you make the decision that it is a\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\ncrime, but proportionally it is not what the death penalty would call \nfor. It would not be a political death penalty case. Thank you very \nmuch.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Leahy to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Did any of the managers consult with any Member of the \n     Senate before seeking aid from Kenneth Starr to speak with \n     Ms. Lewinsky? Did you discuss whether this violated the \n     Senate's 100-0 vote on trial procedure?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The question is a \nvalid question to ask. We did not consult with any Senators about this. \nWe don't think that what we wanted to do, to talk to Ms. Lewinsky, has \nanything to do with the rule you passed. We don't want to violate those \nrules and we don't think we have.\n  As anybody who knows, if you have a witness that you are going to \nproduce, you have a right to prepare that witness. It is as plain and \nsimple as that.\n  I have practiced a lot of trial law before I came to Congress, and a \nnumber of you have. If you are going to have a deposition given, it is \ngoing to be your witness. You are going to go down and try to talk to \nthat witness and prepare that witness. You have a right and obligation \nto do that. It has nothing to do with the formal proceeding of taking \nthe deposition, which is covered by the rules that you have passed, as \nto how and when depositions will be taken, and it has nothing to do \nwith the issue of her testimony actually here, where the opposing \ncounsel would have a right to be present. It has everything to do with \nthe right of anyone to prepare their witness, to get to know their \nwitness, to shake hands, say hello, to put a face on that. It is normal \npractice to do this.\n  We see in no way how that abrogates this rule, or in any way violates \nwhat you have set forth. As a matter of fact, we think we would have \nbeen incompetent and derelict as presenters of the witnesses, if we get \na chance to present them, if we couldn't talk to her. We tried to do \nthis some time ago. We suggested to her attorneys that it would be \nappropriate to quietly have this discussion, to meet her, as you \nnormally would. I think they were apprehensive. They wanted a court \norder, I guess, to force this to occur, and that is why we eventually \nhave gone to do that.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Lott and Thurmond \nto the House managers:\n\n       Please give specific examples of conflicting testimony or \n     an incomplete record where the calling of witnesses would \n     prove beneficial to the Senate.\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, \neveryone. I want to echo what my colleagues have said--that we are \ntrying to be prepared. We are trying to move through this process \nexpeditiously. But we do believe that we need to call witnesses; and \nsecondly, that we should be prepared, without any delay, to proceed \nforward in the event we are granted that opportunity.\n  One of the reasons that the calling of witnesses is important is \nbecause there exists conflicts in the testimony. The White House \ncounselors, the President of the United States, has denied each and \nevery allegation under the two articles that have been submitted to \nthis body. I focused on the obstruction of justice, and each of the \nseven elements of the obstruction of justice has been denied by the \nPresident. This puts it all in issue.\n  For example, let's start with the issue of lying to the aides. The \nPresident said he was truthful with his aides, Mr. Podesta and Sidney \nBlumenthal. Yet, if you look at the testimony of John Podesta, where he \nsays the President came in and denied having sex of any kind with Ms. \nLewinsky and goes into the details of that, that is in direct conflict \nwith the testimony of the President of the United States. The same \nthing is true of the testimony of Mr. Blumenthal versus the testimony \nof the President of the United States.\n  Another conflict in the testimony is between the President and Ms. \nLewinsky--in a number of different areas. First of all, in regard to \nthe gifts, the President said, ``And I told her that if they asked for \ngifts, she had to give them.'' That is the President's testimony. Yet, \nMs. Lewinsky says that in that conversation the President said, when \nasked about the gifts, ``Give them to Betty.'' Then he says, ``I don't \nknow,'' or ``Let me think about it.'' Again, that is a direct conflict \nbetween Monica Lewinsky and the President.\n  In regard to Monica Lewinsky, he was coaching her testimony or \nsuggesting to her that ``Maybe you can sign an affidavit,'' or ``You \ncan always say you were coming to see Betty, or that you were bringing \nme letters.'' This is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. What does the \nPresident say regarding that? He said that he never talked to her about \na cover story in a legal context. In other words, it is a denial of \nobstruction of witness tampering, in contrast to the testimony of \nMonica Lewinsky. Obviously, there is a conflict in the details of the \nrelationship.\n  There is a conflict between the testimony of Monica Lewinsky and \nVernon Jordan in three different areas. Ms. Lewinsky said she shared \nwith Mr. Jordan some details of the relationship. Mr. Jordan says that \nwas not accurate. Ms. Lewinsky says in a particular meeting that Mr. \nJordan--where they discussed about notes she had been keeping, Mr. \nJordan said, ``Go home and make sure they're not there.'' But Mr. \nJordan denies that.\n  In another area, on the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky says that she brought \nto Mr. Jordan the affidavit, and he assisted in making some \ncorrections. Mr. Jordan does not recall that. So there are conflicts \nbetween Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan.\n  There are conflicts between Ms. Currie and the President in regard to \nthe coaching incident. Ms. Currie said the statements were made and \ntaken in the sense that ``the President wished me to agree with the \nstatement.'' The President says, ``I was trying to get as much \ninformation as quickly as I could.'' Obviously, Betty Currie testified \nbefore the grand jury before the President did, and there were never \nany follow-up questions. I would want to ask her: What did you say in \nresponse? Did you provide any information that the President was \nsoliciting at that particular moment, according to the defense he has \nasserted? So there is conflict there.\n  There is a conflict between the President and a witness that we would \noffer from the deposition. The President denies that he focused on what \nAttorney Bennett was stating in reference to the false affidavit. I \nbelieve that we can offer a witness--it could be in the form of an \naffidavit or deposition--that would testify that he was focusing, \npaying attention.\n  So there is clear conflict in the record that can only be established \nthrough the presenting of additional questions or additional witnesses.\n  The need for witnesses is so basic and fundamental to our truth-\nseeking system of justice in this country that words fail me in making \nthe case that we should call witnesses and then you should permit it in \nthis proceeding.\n  We are sympathetic totally with the timeframe and the time constraint \nof the U.S. Senate, and for that reason we will prepare our witness \nlist, we will accommodate a quick session. The White House counselor \nsaid this is going to drag on for months. If it drags on for months, it \nis because they want it to drag on for months. We will do all that we \ncan to end this in a timely fashion, and the American people and the \nU.S. Senate need to understand that.\n  Why are the White House counselors so concerned about witnesses? Many \nof these witnesses are friendly to them. We are in a truth-seeking \nendeavor, and I would respectfully submit that the calling of witnesses \nwould help resolve the conflicts that I have recited.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Dodd to the counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       Do you believe that a fundamental question of fairness and \n     due process has been raised by the failure of the House \n     managers to notify you of the proposed Lewinsky interview or \n     by your exclusion from that interview? And do you wish also \n     to respond to Mr. Hutchinson's comments?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I will use most of my \ntime on the first part of that question and try to perhaps weave in a \nfew comments on the second part.\n  I am not going to seek here this morning to vindicate the interests \nof this body; that is for others. But I do think it useful to speak for \na bit about the interests of the accused, the President of the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n  It is odd as I think we listen to the managers explain what they were \nseeking to do to put that in the context of what we know was actually \nhappening here. It was suggested that they wanted to just have a \nconversation like any lawyer getting ready for a trial would want to \nhave a conversation with a witness before he or she put the witness \ninto a deposition or on trial--that it was sort of normal for a trial \nlawyer to do this.\n  I think one of the managers suggested they just wanted to say \n``hello'' to put a face on it. And they even suggested that counsel for \nMs. Lewinsky wanted a court order to force their client to testify. \nWell, as we will all see once the record is made available to everyone, \nthat last point is sheer nonsense.\n  But I suggest that earlier suggestions that just a friendly little \nchat was all they were looking for is belied by the notion of what we \nhave here is the managers using their ``institutional role'' to get the \nindependent counsel to join with them and use the authority that he has \nunder the immunity agreement to threaten Ms. Lewinsky with jail, to \nthreaten her with violation of her immunity agreement, and opening up \nthe prospect of prosecution if they do not meet in a friendly little \nconversation, just say hello, just like to meet you, gathering with the \nmanagers.\n  Can you imagine what that little conversation is going to look like, \nheld in the independent counsel's office, with the people there who \nhave the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail, while there is this \nfriendly little conversation, just say ``hello,'' normal everyday \ndiscussion between the trial lawyer and the witness he would like to \nget to know?\n\n  From the perspective of my client for the moment, putting aside the \nrules which you all agreed on as to how we ought to proceed, can we \nreally say that is just normal, just OK, to have one side using the \nmight and majesty of the independent counsel's office, threatening a \nwitness with violation of an immunity agreement if she doesn't agree to \nfly across the country and meet for this friendly little chat? I think \nnot.\n  I don't know whether I have a minute or two left. But on the issue of \nconflicts, this is, of course, something that has been the subject of \nmuch discourse over the last few days. Let me just take a couple of \nexamples put to you by Manager Hutchinson.\n  On the issue of the statements made by the President, Mr. Podesta, \nand Mr. Blumenthal, there is no conflict in the testimony here. The \nPresident indeed said that he was trying to keep his aides from \nbecoming witnesses. He even said that he didn't even remember his \nconversation with Mr. Podesta but he took as true--this is what he said \nto the grand jury--he accepted as true that Mr. Blumenthal said this is \nwhat that conversation sounded like. Mr. Podesta said that is what the \nconversation was. There was no conflict. The President indeed adopted \nin the grand jury what those people would say. And of course he didn't \nput them into the grand jury in order to repeat some or to mislead the \ngrand jury as to their knowledge of what they told him. They testified \ntruthfully in the grand jury when they recited their conversations with \nthe President.\n  But I want to move just a second to something you have never heard \nbefore in the entire days that we have been sitting here. We heard \nlittle hints about how Vernon Jordan might be a liar because of what he \nsaid about December 11. All of a sudden just 5 minutes ago, this body \nheard for the first time he not only may be a liar about the job \nsearch, he may be a liar about destroying evidence. Words fail me.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Abraham to the \nPresident's counsel:\n\n       Is it your position that Ms. Lewinsky was lying in her \n     grand jury testimony, her grand jury deposition, and her FBI \n     interviews when she said that the President engaged in \n     conduct with her that constituted ``sexual relations'' even \n     under his narrow interpretation of the term in the Jones \n     deposition? Is it your position that she was also lying when \n     she gave essentially the same account contemporaneously with \n     the occurrence of the events to her friends and counselors?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Senator, our position is not that she is lying. \nOur position is that there are two different versions of what happened, \nand there is a discrepancy.\n  In my presentation to the Senate, I acknowledged that there was a \ndisparity between what the President had recounted and what Ms. \nLewinsky said happened when it came to recalling and reporting these \nspecific rather graphic and intimate details concerning their \nactivities. I pointed out that, with respect to other essential \nelements of the relationship, there was no disagreement that they \nacknowledge that there was a relationship, that they tried to conceal \nit. But I also suggested--and I suggest to you today--that not every \ndisagreement, not every discrepancy, is the foodstuff or the subject of \na perjury charge.\n  I also made the observation that perhaps this kind of conflict of \ntestimony as to who touched who, when, where, and why, was not the kind \nof conflict that this institution would want to resolve through \ntestimony on the floor. If you have any doubts about that point, I \nwould suggest you read Ms. Lewinsky's August 20 testimony before the \ngrand jury which is very complete and entirely and vigorously dedicated \nto eliciting every single gritty detail of what went on between them. I \nsaid also that I thought that this disagreement, this disparity, was of \nquestionable materiality. Let me explain why.\n  On January 29, Judge Wright ruled that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony about \nher relationship with President Clinton was unnecessary and maybe even \ninadmissible; that she had had no information relating to the core \nissues of the case. She made that ruling after all the allegations \nabout that relationship had been made public. And the judge knew what \nhad been reported in the newspapers and what was generally understood \nabout it at that point. She had been there when the President testified \nabout this. And she concluded that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony was not \nrequired, at least for the Paula Jones case. In truth, Ms. Lewinsky was \nan ancillary or peripheral witness in the Paula Jones case. She had \nabsolutely no firsthand knowledge about what happened in the Excelsior \nHotel when Ms. Jones claimed that then-Governor Clinton made an \nunwelcome sexual overture to her. Ms. Lewinsky had nothing to add or \nsubtract, no ability to testify about that issue.\n  So on the issue of the materiality to the Jones case as to the truth \nof what actually happened between them, it is clear it is of \nquestionable, if no, materiality whatsoever. She was a peripheral \nwitness on issues not having to do with the core issues of the case, \nand the case had no legal merit.\n\n  Please recall that the judge concluded that the case had no legal or \nevidentiary merit. Please also remember that the Jones lawyers, when \nthey were asking these questions of President Clinton, presumably knew \nthe answers to these questions about the relationship because they had \nbeen fully briefed the night before.\n  Now, as to the question of the materiality of this testimony and this \nissue of who touched whom, when, where and why to the grand jury, let \nme just say this: The House managers claim that one or the other must \nbe lying because both cannot be correct. They argue that if you believe \nMonica Lewinsky on this issue, you must disbelieve Bill Clinton, and if \nyou disbelieve Bill Clinton, you must conclude that he knowingly \nperjured himself when he denied under oath having this kind of contact \nwith Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Now, this direct issue was addressed by the panel of expert \nprosecutors that we brought to testify before the Judiciary Committee, \nand they all agreed that this kind of issue would never be the subject \nof a perjury prosecution. I would urge you to go back and look at some \nof the testimony that they gave to the Judiciary Committee. They talked \nabout the oath-on-oath issue, they talked about what is independent \ncorroborative evidence and what is not, and they concluded that no \nreasonable, though responsible, prosecutor would bring this kind of \ncase based on that kind of an issue.\n  We are not arguing with the managers about the law. We are not \narguing with the managers about the disparity. We are talking about \nprosecutorial practices, what in reality would be a criminal \nprosecution, and I submit to you that no reasonable, no responsible \nprosecutor would bring this kind of a case based on that kind of \nevidence.\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Daschle addressed \nto counsel for the President:\n\n       Do you believe that it is a requirement of due process and \n     fairness that you be allowed to participate in the Lewinsky \n     witness debriefing sought by the managers, and do you believe \n     that the House would have asked for the same right if the \n     White House had attempted to interview Ms. Lewinsky?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, that question raises an \ninteresting mix of issues, because I think in one respect the House \nmanagers are correct, that once the Senate determines that it is \nprepared to go forward--I trust it will not--but if it does determine \nthat it is prepared to go forward in some way with respect to the \ndepositions of witnesses, at that point, with the Senate having made \nthat decision, it would be appropriate for both sides to seek a \nvoluntary, consensual, typical opportunity to meet with any witness in \na setting that doesn't involve having the prosecutor with life and \ndeath authority over that witness doing the debriefing or being present \nwhile you talk to the witness.\n  Thus, although I will take the opportunity of offering to sit in on \nany meeting between the managers and the independent counsel and any \nwitness, because I would certainly like to know what the mood and the \natmosphere of that process really sounded like, the issue here, I \nthink, is not so much whether it would be nice to sit in on that \nmeeting but whether there can be any hope for due process, fairness and \nopportunity for both sides, or certainly my side--I won't speak for the \nmanagers--to have an opportunity for a reasonable, fair and open \ndiscussion voluntarily with any witness who will talk with us, not--not \nto be too rhetorical about this--with the looming presence of the \nprosecutors sitting in the room with us.\n\n  As everyone who practices in this district knows, indeed, it is a \nmatter of law that a prosecutor may never interfere with the access of \nany witness to defense counsel. I can't think of much more interference \nthan being required to sit in the room with the prosecutor and with \nanother prosecutor while that kind of discussion goes on.\n  So the answer is, fairness, no. But if it is my only opportunity to \nmeet with Ms. Lewinsky, I will take it. But I trust that as a matter of \ndue process it will not be.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators DeWine, Collins \nand Murkowski to the House managers:\n\n       With all of the conflicting testimony that exists on the \n     record between Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie, for example, \n     how are we to resolve the questions of perjury and \n     obstruction of justice without observing the demeanor of \n     witnesses?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I do not think there is any way to resolve \nthe conflicts in their testimony without calling witnesses. You can \nread the transcripts and you can look at those and you can try to \ndetermine whether there is any corroborating evidence, how you can \nbelieve it, make some of those kinds of evaluations. But particularly \nwhoever you are looking at, whether it is Monica Lewinsky or Betty \nCurrie, there are followup questions and there is the demeanor that \nallows you to determine who is telling the truth and who you believe.\n  And in contrast, Mr. Ruff tries to make the point that somebody is \nlying here, and maybe somebody is lying, but a jury --in this case the \nSenators--can look at this and say, well, someone is not recalling the \nsame way, someone is more believable because their recollection is \nbetter, it is corroborated, or you could conclude that someone is \nlying. It doesn't always break down that simply, but you have to \nevaluate that. And that is how you resolve it.\n  But let me just come back--I think what we see here today is the \nWhite House counsel do not want to talk about the facts. They do not \nwant to talk about this case. They do not want to talk about \nobstruction of justice; just like in the House, they want to talk about \nthe process. They want to talk about everything that is going on except \nfor the case of obstruction of justice. And it probably will be the \nnews story later on today, the questions that they have raised about \nthis.\n  But the fact is, it is very simple that they have access to Betty \nCurrie. Every time the President has talked to and tried to coach Betty \nCurrie, I don't think the President invited the independent counsel in \nwhen this was under investigation, or the Paula Jones lawyers. I don't \nthink that happened. I don't think that--at least from the news clips, \nwhen I saw Betty Currie hugging the President, I don't think he invited \nthe House managers in. I didn't necessarily expect him to. But we have \nto be prepared.\n  And I will just tell you right now, so nobody is surprised, if we get \nto call Vernon Jordan, I don't want to delay the U.S. Senate in order \nto be prepared for that, so I confess today that I called up William \nHundley, the lawyer for Vernon Jordan, to visit with him.\n  Now, I hope that if you talk to any witnesses, that if you feel it is \nfair, that you will give us a chance to join with you in that. But, \nobviously, this is an adversary process we are engaged in, and I think \nthat we today in this question and answer session that you all so \ngraciously extended to us should focus on the obstruction of justice \ncharges because that is what you have to determine--on the perjury \nallegation, because that is what we have to determine today.\n  I thank the Chief Justice and the Senators.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Kohl and Edwards. \nTo whom is it addressed? Oh, it is to the House managers:\n\n       Throughout this trial both sides have spoken in \n     ``absolutes''; that is, if the President engaged in this \n     conduct, prosecutors claim he must be convicted and removed \n     from office, while the President's lawyers argue that such \n     conduct does not in any way rise to an impeachable offense. \n     It strikes many of us as a closer call. So let me ask you \n     this: Even if the President engaged in the alleged conduct, \n     can reasonable people disagree with the conclusion that, as a \n     matter of law, he must be convicted and removed from office--\n     yes or no?\n\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Absolutely. And this is a hard case in a couple \nof areas, and I think it is an easy case in many areas.\n  The Constitution reads that upon conviction, the person shall be \nremoved. You have to put it in the context of the judge cases, because \nthat is where it gets to be hard for this body. Because of the \nprecedents of the body when you apply the same legal standard of high \ncrimes and misdemeanors to the fact that a judge who was convicted of \nperjury was removed by the body, and you conclude in your mind that the \nPresident committed perjury, you have a dynamic you have to work \nthrough.\n  Mr. Bumpers says there is perjury, then there is perjury. I would \nsuggest to you that the allegations of perjury and obstruction of \njustice in this case are not trivial. It is not about a speeding ticket \nor a trivial matter. It is about the activity of the President when he \nwas defendant in a lawsuit, a sexual harassment lawsuit, when he was \ntold by the Supreme Court you have to play and you have to play fairly.\n  If you determine that he committed the crime of perjury and you \ndetermine that he committed the crime of obstruction of justice, based \non the precedents of the Senate I think you would have a hard time \nsaying under the situation of this case that that is not a high crime. \nBut I would be the first to admit that the Constitution is silent on \nthis question about whether or not every high crime has to result in \nremoval.\n  If I was sitting where you are, I would probably get down on my knees \nbefore I made that decision. Because the impact on society is going to \nbe real either way. If you find this President guilty in your mind, \nfrom the facts, that he is a perjurer and that he obstructed justice, \nyou have to somehow reconcile continued service in light of that event.\n  I think it is important for this body to not have a disposition plan \nthat doesn't take in consideration the good of this Nation. I have \nargued to you that when you found that a judge was a perjurer, you \ncouldn't in good conscience send him back in the courtroom because \neverybody that came in that courtroom thereafter would have a real \nserious doubt.\n  I will argue to you that when you find this President guilty of \nperjury, if you do, that he has violated his oath and that by a \nconsequence of that, some public trust has been lost. And I would show \nto you the body of evidence\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\nfrom this question, ``Do you trust William Jefferson Clinton?''--the \nAmerican people will tell you--three out of four say no. But the \nAmerican people will also tell you that I understand what happened here \nand some want him removed and some don't. And you have to consider what \nis best for this Nation.\n  I will yield to Mr. Buyer in a second, but the point that I am trying \nto make, not as articulately as I can, is that I know how hard that \ndecision is. It has also been hard for me.\n  It has never been hard to find out whether Bill Clinton committed \nperjury or whether he obstructed justice. That ``ain't'' a hard one for \nme. But when you take the good of this Nation, the upside and the \ndownside, reasonable people can disagree on what we should do.\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. I would just like to remind all of you that the \nimpeachment process is intended to cleanse the executive or the \njudicial office when it is plagued with such a cancer as perjury or \nobstruction of justice, which violates the oath required to hold those \nhigh offices.\n  Now, what may be turning in the gut of some of you are the precedents \nof the Senate, when in fact you have turned out of office, you have \nexercised your judgments of proportionality when these judges violated \ntheir oaths and had perjury, you said they shall be removed from \noffice.\n  Now there are some that are going, well, I am uneasy in this case \nwith the President. That is what may create a little problem here. I \nwould suggest to you that you actually have findings of fact; that the \nSenate has findings of fact that the President, in fact--he lied or he \ndid not lie or he committed an obstruction; that you actually have \nfindings of fact. And then you can move beyond to the questions of \napplication of the law.\n  But when the Senate has performed such a cleansing and removed Judges \nNixon, Claiborne and Hastings, all three of them impeached for perjury \nin some form--and in Judge Hastings' case even though he had been \nacquitted of the criminal case--the Congress, in particular the Senate, \nyou have a duty to preserve the integrity of public office, and that is \nwhat impeachment was precisely designed to do.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Voinovich, \nJeffords and Chafee to the House managers:\n\n       In her interviews with the Office of the Independent \n     Counsel, Ms. Lewinsky stated that on January 5, 1998, the \n     President told her not to worry about the affidavit because \n     he had seen 15 others. Did the President mean that he had \n     seen previous drafts of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, or did the \n     President mean that he had seen drafts of other affidavits \n     that were in some way connected to the Paula Jones matter?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. You can take that \neither way. But I believe in the context--and I presented this to you \nthe other day--in which the President uttered those words, that the \nmost logical conclusion is that he had seen 15 other drafts of hers. If \nyou remember, she was discussing with him the issue of whether he \nwanted to see this particular draft of her affidavit. And at that \nparticular moment he said, ``No, I don't want to. I have seen 15 \nothers.''\n  Technically speaking, he could have seen 15 other affidavits in his \nlife somewhere back in Arkansas, who knows? But it strikes me that the \nlogical conclusion, the commonsense conclusion in the context of \neverything else that you see this President was intent on and had in \nhis mind, and the interest that he had already shown from all the \nconversations that he had had with Vernon Jordan and others to make \nsure that this affidavit was on track, and knowing that he was going to \ntestify in a few days himself in the Jones case, and rely on it and in \nfact did go in and tell the same cover stories that were in this \naffidavit to the court, untruthfully, that the probabilities are pretty \ngood, that common sense says that he was saying he had seen 15 other \ndrafts of this version of this affidavit. But that is for you to \ndecide. That is a judgment call for the triers of fact. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Leahy to counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       Could you reply to the statement just made by Manager \n     McCollum.\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, on Thursday afternoon I went \nover, in perhaps tedious detail, the facts relating to the affidavits. \nI pointed out that there was no way in which--there was no evidence \nthat the President saw any affidavit draft. Mr. Manager McCollum just \nnow, I think, admitted that he has only a speculation. He doesn't have \nany record evidence. The President denied seeing any affidavit draft. I \npointed out in the managers' chart 7 that their theory about when Ms. \nLewinsky could have gotten an affidavit was simply wrong because their \ntheory was she got it on January 5. This is a single affidavit draft. \nThe evidence plainly shows that she could not have gotten it until \nJanuary 6. There is simply nothing in the record--and the independent \ncounsel interviewed Ms. Lewinsky extensively, both in interviews and \nbefore the grand jury--and there is simply no evidence whatsoever that \nthe President saw any drafts or, indeed, that there were 15 drafts.\n  Let me say a word about whether or not we are addressing the facts. I \nam not going to frighten you. I am not going to go back through the \nobstruction of justice evidence. But I think if you will remember the \npresentation--first by Mr. Craig who addressed in detail the evidence \nwith regard to perjury, then if you will recall what Ms. Mills said \naddressing two of the seven allegations of obstruction of justice, and \nwith what I said to you on Thursday afternoon for almost 3 hours--and I \nthank you for your uncommon patience; you were attentive all the way \nthrough that exercise--you know that we have addressed the facts. What \nwe had yesterday, what Mr. Ruff has already addressed, is, again, I \nwill use the word ``remarkable'' occurrence involving the independent \ncounsel.\n  We have addressed the facts, and there is simply nothing to support \nin all this record, this heavy, long record, that the President had any \nreview of any affidavit or, indeed, that there were more than one or \ntwo drafts of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators DeWine, Santorum, \nand Fitzgerald to the President's counsel:\n\n       If we are to assume that the various allegations as to \n     obstruction of justice are in fact true, is it your \n     contention that if the President tampered with witnesses, \n     encouraged the hiding of evidence, and corruptly influenced \n     the filing of a false affidavit by a witness, that these acts \n     do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, this is something I won't have \nan opportunity to say very often, but I believe that Mr. Manager Graham \nhas, in fact, stated for you the essential of the role that this body \nmust play. We will probably differ as to what the right answer to the \nquestion is, but as to the process and as to the question that must be \nasked, I think he stated it well.\n  I believe that the facts do not support the conclusions that are \nembodied in the question. But not only can reasonable people differ on \nthe facts, but reasonable people may differ on the outcome. And if, \nindeed, reasonable people can differ, doesn't that mean, by the very \nstatement of that proposition, that this body cannot meet its \nconstitutional heavy mandate, which is to determine whether or not, \nwhatever conduct you believe the President committed, as outlined by \nthese managers over the last many days--can you legitimately determine \nthat he ought to be removed from office.\n  And all I can do, I suppose, is to remind you, as I have too \nfrequently, I am sure, that if you try to put yourself in the minds and \nthe hearts of the men who created our system of Government, they wanted \nto know only really one answer to one question, as framed in many \ndifferent ways, but the essence remains the same: Is there a sufficient \ndanger to the state--danger to the state--to warrant what my colleagues \nacross the aisle here have called the political death penalty. And I \nthink the answer to that is no.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Wellstone to \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       To what extent should the views of the American people be \n     taken into account in considering whether a President should \n     be removed from office?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the answer to that \nquestion is not the polls that you read in\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nthe newspapers or that you see on your evening news, whatever those \nnumbers may be; that is only one clue as to what the American people \nare thinking. And each of you knows the people in your jurisdiction far \nbetter than any polltaker does and that certainly I do.\n\n  But surely one way to test the ultimate question that I just \ndescribed in response to the last inquiry from the Republican side of \nthe House, is to ask yourself, on the basis of experience over the last \nyear, on the basis of your experience in the political--and by that I \nmean political in the very best constitutional sense of the term as \nused by Alexander Hamilton--as to your sense of the political structure \nof this country and what the people are saying to you and what your \nsense of their needs is: Do they need the kind of cleansing that \nManager Buyer spoke about?\n  I think the answer to that, if you look within the body of people you \nare most familiar with, must be no. This isn't to say that it is a \npopularity contest, that we ought to go out and have a referendum or \nanother poll before you all decide on this. But surely the sense of the \npeople, the will of the people, the belief of the people in this \nPresident's ability to govern must educate each of you, not mandate a \nresult, but surely guide the result that you reach in this proceeding.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Collins to the \nHouse managers:\n\n       The President's counsel has made much of Ms. Lewinsky's \n     statement that no one ``promised'' her a job for her silence. \n     She did not testify, however, that no one promised her a job \n     in return for a false affidavit--or, for that matter, that no \n     one implied that she would get a job for her cooperation. Can \n     you think of any reason why we should not call Ms. Lewinsky \n     to help clarify such ambiguous testimony?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. That is an \nexcellent question and really goes to the heart of some of the \ndisputes.\n  I think as you read the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, as you read some \nof the other areas of testimony, questions come to your mind. You would \nlike to follow up, you would like to ask her a question, and that one \ncomes out and flags you that that is a question that would like to be \nasked: No one promised her a job for her silence, and that is the \ntestimony that she gave in response to a question in the grand jury.\n  But I believe this is a case in which actions speak louder than \nwords. I think that actions and what took place and the commonsense \nunderstanding of what is happening here demonstrate the case that there \nwas a false affidavit that was obtained and that was in conjunction \nwith the obtaining of a job for Monica Lewinsky.\n  So I think that is a natural question, and I think that also if you \nread, if you look at the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, I think it is \nclear that the case is made that she was encouraged to lie and she was \nalso encouraged to sign a false affidavit and she was also provided a \njob coincidentally at the same time.\n  I would like to take the opportunity, if I might, Mr. Chief Justice, \nin further answering a question that was raised earlier; it was on the \nfalse affidavit. That is, I think, related to the question as well.\n  During Mr. Kendall's presentation a few days ago, he made this \nstatement:\n\n       The idea that the telephone call [between Lewinsky and \n     Clinton on January 5] is about that affidavit is sheer, \n     unsupported speculation and, even worse, it is speculation \n     demolished by fact.\n\n  This is the statement that Mr. Kendall gave the other day on this \nfloor, as cited in the Congressional Record, summarizing his \npresentation that the idea that Clinton and Lewinsky talked about the \naffidavit ``is sheer, unsupported speculation and . . . demolished by \nfact.''\n  Well, the record demonstrates that Monica Lewinsky's testimony is \nthat she had a conversation with the President on the telephone in \nwhich she asked questions about the affidavit. She was concerned about \nsigning that affidavit. And according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President \nsaid, ``Well, you could always say the people in Legislative Affairs \ngot it for you or helped you get it.'' And that is in reference to a \nparagraph in the particular affidavit.\n  Now, my question to Mr. Kendall is, Would you agree, Mr. Kendall, \nthat your assertion that there is no support for it in the record is \nthat you are totally rejecting the testimony of Monica Lewinsky as \ntotally unbelievable? And once again you have a conflict that is \npresented in the testimony, and there is only one way to resolve it, \nand that is to hear from the key witnesses.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Lautenberg to \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       Could you reply to the question put by the manager?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, let me address the first part \nof Mr. Manager Hutchinson's response; and that is, whether the \nstatement by Ms. Lewinsky that ``Nobody ever promised me a job for my \nsilence'' covered other possible promises to her. And it is quite \nclear, when you read all the interviews that were done of her by the \nindependent counsel, all the grand jury testimony, that she \nunequivocally testified there were no promises made to her, there were \nno assistances given to her, that were in any way conditioned upon her \ntestifying a certain way or giving a certain kind of affidavit. And she \nis unequivocal about that.\n  Now, in the statement that she made that I quoted, she does not say \nnobody ever did these other things, but she said that in her previous \ntestimony. She uses the offer of a job as simply a proxy for anything \nthat would connect the assistance she would receive with testifying in \na certain way. There is simply no evidence anywhere in the record. And \nthe independent counsel covered that with her in detail. She felt \ncompelled to volunteer her statement at the end of the process because \nthey had left some innuendo in the record that she had been provided \nassistance. But her testimony is unequivocal. I have quoted it.\n  Now, the only testimony in the record about linking the job to some \nassistance in the Jones case comes from the Linda Tripp audiotapes. \nAnd, again, Ms. Lewinsky could not be clearer in her grand jury \ntestimony what she told Linda Tripp was false. There was no connection \nthere whatsoever. Her proffer, which I put up on the board, was quite \nunconditional. And this you have in your materials. This is in her own \nhandwriting: Neither the President nor Mr. Jordan nor anyone on their \nbehalf asked or encouraged her to lie.\n\n  So with regard to the first part of Mr. Manager Hutchinson's \nquestion, there is simply no evidence, again, that any kind of \nassistance to Ms. Lewinsky was conditioned on her performance in any \nway in the Jones case.\n  Now, with regard to the affidavit, I stand on what I said before you \non Thursday. And I want to be very clear about what Mr. Hutchinson's \npresentation was in chart No. 7 that I was responding to. And I think \nit is quite important to recall yesterday that a question was addressed \nto the House managers whether there were any statements contained in \ntheir exhibits which contained misrepresentations or omissions that, in \nthe interest of fairness to justice, they would like to correct; and \nMr. Manager Hutchinson said, ``We are not aware of any corrections that \nneed to be made on any of our exhibits offered to the Senate.''\n  I would simply rest on the presentation. I am not going to take you \nthrough, again, the many errors in the charts. Those were not refuted \nin any way. They rested on their charts. I leave that to your judgment.\n  But with regard to chart 7, what Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you \nalmost a week ago was that chart 7 was a summary of what happened on \nJanuary 5: Ms. Lewinsky meets with her attorney, Mr. Carter, for an \nhour; Carter drafts the affidavit for Ms. Lewinsky; she calls the \nPresident; the President returns Ms. Lewinsky's call; and then they had \na discussion about this draft affidavit.\n  The point of my demonstration through Mr. Carter's testimony and \nthrough his billing records was in fact that the affidavit had been \ndrafted the next day. They could not have had a discussion about the \naffidavit on that date. And I think the record is quite clear on that.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Lott to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Do you have any comment on the answer given by the \n     President's counsel with regard to the views of the American \n     people?\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Senators, this is \na\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\nfascinating question. Edmund Burke was asked that once, and he said \nthat a member of Parliament owes the highest degree of fidelity to his \nconstituents, but he doesn't owe his conscience to anybody.\n  We have, or we have not, a representative democracy. We are not \ndelegates who are sent here to weigh our mail every day and then to \nvote accordingly. Our work here is not an ongoing plebiscite. We are \nelected to bring our judgment, our experience, and our consciences with \nus here.\n  I have always believed--and I believe more firmly than ever; and this \nexperience confirms me in that belief--there are issues of transcendent \nimportance that you have to be willing to lose your office over. I can \nthink of several that I am willing to lose my office over--abortion is \none; national defense is another; strengthening, not emasculating, the \nconcept of equal justice under the law. My life is devoted, as a lawyer \n--I have been on the Judiciary Committee; this is my 25th year--and \nequal justice under the law is what moves me and animates me and \nconsumes me. And I am willing to lose my seat any day in the week \nrather than sell out on those issues.\n  Despite all the polls and all the hostile editorials, America is \nhungry for people who believe in something. You may disagree with us, \nbut we believe in something.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we recess \nthe proceedings for 15 minutes.\n  There being no objection, at 11:19 a.m., the Senate recessed until \n11:36 a.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. We will go approximately \nanother hour, if questions are still available--and I assume they will \nbe--and then we will break for about an hour for lunch.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Biden to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       If a Senator believes that the President may have lied to \n     the American people, his family and his aides, and that some \n     of his answers before the grand jury were misleading or half-\n     truths, but that he could not be convicted in a court of law \n     for either perjury or obstruction of justice, is it the \n     opinion of the House managers that his actions still justify \n     removing the President from office?\n\n  Mr. Manager BARR. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have taken two \npublic oaths in my career in the service of the people of this great \nland. One was as a Member of Congress; the other was as a U.S. \nattorney. As a U.S. attorney, it was my job on behalf of the people of \nthe United States to prosecute cases against individuals and other \nentities that violated the Criminal Code of the United States of \nAmerica. That Criminal Code, as you are well aware, includes the \noffenses of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  That Criminal Code does not include the offenses of lying to one's \nfamily. That is not what brings us here today. What brings us here \ntoday is the belief by the House of Representatives in lawful public \nvote that this President violated, in numerous respects, his oath of \noffice and the Criminal Code of the United States of America--in \nparticular, that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  I can tell you, as a U.S. attorney serving under two Presidents, that \nI would prosecute these cases, because I did prosecute such cases. I \nprosecuted cases against people, including members of the body from \nwhich we as managers come, who appeared before grand juries and lied, \nwho appeared before grand juries and misled grand juries, people who \nobstructed justice, people who tampered with witnesses in precisely the \nsame way that this President has committed perjury, tampered with \nwitnesses and obstructed justice.\n  We respectfully submit to the Senators of the United States of \nAmerica assembled here today that these are prosecutable cases, that \nthey are cases that have been prosecuted, and that the question before \nthis body, we respectfully submit, in the House of Representatives' \narticles of impeachment, is not that the President lied to his family. \nWhat is before this body, we respectfully submit, as contained in the \ntwo articles of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives, is \nthat this President violated his oath of office and committed the \noffenses of perjury and obstruction of justice, which we firmly believe \non behalf of the people of the United States of America provide a \nsufficient basis on which this body, exercising its deliberative power \nand its legitimate jurisdiction, may find that this President, as \npeople in courts of law similarly but not identically situated, are \nindeed found guilty and removed from positions of trust, as this \nPresident ought to be for committing the perjury and obstruction of \njustice --not lying to his family.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Snowe, Mack, \nChafee, Burns, and Craig to the House managers:\n\n       Before Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed in the Jones case, the \n     President refused on five separate occasions--November 3, \n     November 10, November 12, November 17, and December 6--to \n     produce information about gifts from Lewinsky. The \n     President's counsel argued the President was unconcerned \n     about these gifts. If that is the case, why didn't he produce \n     these gifts in November and December?\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators for the \nquestion. This case needs to be looked at for the mosaic that it is.\n  There is a reason why the President never produced gifts. There is a \nreason why the President continued to give Ms. Lewinsky gifts. It is \nbecause he believed that she would never produce them. We know that \nfrom her testimony.\n  In my presentation to the Senate a week ago, I quoted from the \ntranscript where she said, ``Nobody ever asked me to lie.'' But then \nshe also said there was never any doubt but that ``we\" would deny the \nrelationship if asked.\n  We see that throughout the entire proceeding. We see that before \nMonica Lewinsky's name appeared on the list--on December 5--on the \nwitness list. And we especially see it after. In fact, Monica Lewinsky \nwent to the President and said, ``I've been subpoenaed. They are asking \nfor gifts. What should I do? Maybe I should give them to Betty.'' And \nthe President said, ``Let me think about that.'' And we all know by now \nthat within a few hours Betty Currie called Monica Lewinsky and came \nand retrieved the gifts, not to give them to the Jones lawyers pursuant \nto the subpoena, not to cooperate with the sexual harassment lawsuit; \nshe took the gifts and she put them under her bed.\n  Members of this body, it begs common sense for any interpretation of \nthat conduct to be somehow cooperative with the legal proceedings in \nthe sexual harassment case. Every piece of this puzzle, when put \ntogether, demonstrates a very clear pattern of obstructing justice, not \nto cover up personal affairs, not to cover up an indiscretion, but to \ndestroy Paula Jones' rights under the sexual harassment laws of this \ncountry to have her day in court. That is the ultimate question that \nthis body is going to have to address.\n  Yes, reasonable minds can differ on this case as to whether the \nPresident should be removed office. But reasonable minds can only \ndiffer if those reasonable minds come to the conclusion that \nenforcement of the sexual harassment laws in this country are less \nimportant than the preservation of this man in the office of the \nPresidency. And that is the ultimate question that this body is going \nto have to answer. What is more important--the survival of Bill \nClinton's Presidency in the face of perjury and obstruction of justice, \nor the protection of the sexual harassment laws in this country?\n  And imagine, every victim in the workplace will be waiting for your \nanswer.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senator Daschle to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Will you agree to arrange to have prepared a verbatim, \n     unedited transcript of any debriefing which may occur with \n     Ms. Lewinsky for immediate distribution to the Senate? And \n     will you agree also to provide for the inclusion of any such \n     debriefing of representatives of the Senate, one selected by \n     the majority and one by the minority?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, it \nis not our intent to be doing a deposition, a formal presentation, a \npreparation for the Senate, if we talk to Ms. Lewinsky. It is our \nintent to do what any good attorney would do in preparing to go to \ntrial, presuming--we don't\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nknow that you are going to allow us to have witnesses--but presuming we \nare going to be able to depose and have witnesses, and that is to meet \nwith the witness, talk with the witness, and prepare the witness. And \nany good attorney who does that is going to meet his or her witness in \ntheir own confidences, in their own quiet respite. We discover things \nthat way. We are not prepared. No. The answer to your question is no, \nwe are not prepared to say we are going to give you our work product, \nwhich is what that would be.\n  ``Work product'' is a technical term of law which, for anybody who is \nout in the public, is what lawyers do all the time. And they work on \ntheir case, and they prepare what they are going to do, and then they \npresent it. That is the system we have.\n  Somebody said--I think it was Mr. Hutchinson who said earlier--this \nis an adversarial position. The White House counsel will have their \nchance to talk to witnesses that they are going to present; we will \nhave our chance to talk to ours. Then there is the opportunity for the \ndepositions, which is what comes next, which is the formal proceedings \nwhen we both have a chance to talk with them. Then, of course, if you \nlet us call them as witnesses here, they will be here, and they will \nget cross-examined, and examined, and all the questions you can imagine \nwill be asked. That is the traditional American system of justice.\n  So, no, we would not give you our work product notes. We have no idea \nwhat would be in them. We don't think that is appropriate. We think \nthat a lot is being made out of this. We attempted to do this a couple \nof weeks ago. We would have liked to have talked to her earlier. It has \nnot worked, that we have been permitted to, for reasons that we are not \nsure. But the reality is, this is the normal process. We would talk to \nany other witness despite however the White House counsel wants to \nargue about it. They do the same thing.\n  I yield what time I have left to Mr. Graham.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. I would like to echo the work product analogy.\n  But let me just say this as directly as I know how to say it --that \nif this body as a whole believes we are going to do anything improper, \nthen whatever rule you need to fashion to make sure we don't, you do \nit, because nobody should ever doubt whether a witness comes into this \nbody in this case with anything other than testimony that was truthful. \nIf you want to go down the road of the atmosphere that people were \napproached and how they were treated about being witnesses, let's go \ndown that road together. Let's bring in people in this body and let's \nsee how they were approached when they were asked to participate in \nthis trial, what the atmosphere and the mood was, when it comes to \ntheir time to be identified as witnesses.\n  So I would just say as strongly as I know how that if you have any \ndoubt about us and what we are up to, you fashion rules so we do not \ncreate an unfairness in this body; but please, when we ask for \nwitnesses and we raise doubt about how people may have been treated, \nthat you give us the same opportunity to explore the moods and \natmosphere of those witnesses.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is to the House managers from \nSenators Murkowski, Gregg, Grams, Thomas, Crapo, Thompson and Hatch:\n\n       The President's counsel rely upon the President's \n     statements in many instances. Therefore, the President's \n     credibility is at issue. Is the President's credibility \n     affected by the fact that, until the DNA evidence surfaced, \n     the President denied any improper relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky?\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators.\n  First, I don't think it was a compliment to me from my colleagues \nthat as soon as the issue of DNA came up, they all pointed to me and \ntold me to come up and answer the question. I will do my best.\n  Obviously, as the triers of fact, Members of this body individually \nwill have to make determinations respecting credibility of the \nPresident as well as the other witnesses. It is indisputable, however, \nthat from January 1998, when he spoke at the deposition, until August \n17, when he made a quasi-admission before the grand jury, there were \nintervening factors that required him to change his position.\n  We saw from the moment the story first broke in the press about \nMonica Lewinsky the President making denials in the most emphatic of \nways, and not only doing it repeatedly himself but sending out his \nCabinet and his aides and his friends to do it on his behalf. That \ncontinued up until the eve of the deposition. Was it because the \nPresident suddenly had a change of heart? Was it because his conscience \nwas suddenly bearing down upon him? Or were there other reasons? Well, \nlet's see.\n  Just before his deposition testimony, Monica Lewinsky decided to \ncooperate with the Office of Independent Counsel. Monica Lewinsky \nsuddenly turned over a blue dress. And that is fascinating because, as \nyou know from the record and you have heard from the presentations, the \nPresident was prepared to take Monica Lewinsky and trash her in a very \npublic way until the dress was turned over to the FBI. Remember what he \nsaid to Sidney Blumenthal. He called her a stalker. He said that she \nwas threatening him. But he no longer could make these presentations \npublicly or privately once he knew there was potential physical \nevidence.\n  So I think there are a number of factors Members of this body can \nlook at with respect to credibility just from the cold record. But if \nthat is not enough, if Members of this body are not satisfied that they \nare able to resolve these issues of credibility, then the way to handle \nthis is to follow the dictates of the Constitution and our Framers who \nunderstood the value of trial and bringing witnesses forward, placing \nthem under oath and giving the triers of fact the opportunity to see \nthe witnesses, to hear their testimony, to gauge their credibility.\n  That is what the purpose of a trial is for. And the House managers \nentrust this body to make sure that at the end of the day this is more \nthan a proceeding; this is an arena where the truth will be determined \nnot just for our time but for history.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Murray to counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       Could you reply to the comments of Manager Rogan?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. The existence of DNA or any other evidence or any \nother events before the President's grand jury testimony had no bearing \nwhatsoever on his determination which he carried out on that day in the \nmiddle of August to answer the grand jurors' questions truthfully. He \ndid so. It may be that the managers can speculate about, well, there \nmust have been some reason why in the middle of August, after some \nmonths of denying to the Nation and his family any misconduct, he \nchanged his mind and told the truth. But there was one reason why he \ndid that. Because he went before the grand jury for the United States \nDistrict Court of the District of Columbia and told the truth.\n\n  Now, it has been suggested by many of the managers over the last day \nthat the President was somehow anxious to--or contemplated the prospect \nof, as they put it, trashing Ms. Lewinsky. This issue was raised \nyesterday and has been raised again by Mr. Manager Rogan. I think it is \ntime to set that record straight.\n  Mr. Manager Bryant yesterday, as he was discussing the Dick Morris \nissue, purported to recite from the independent counsel's referral and \npurported to describe a conversation between the President and Mr. \nMorris in which, to quote from Mr. Manager Bryant, ``According to \nMorris, the President warned him''--that is, Mr. Morris, he warned the \nPresident--excuse me. Let me start before that.\n\n       Later the next day, the President has a followup \n     conversation with Mr. Morris, in the evening, and says that \n     he--\n\n  That is, the President--\n\n     is considering holding a press conference to blast Monica \n     Lewinsky out of the water. But Mr. Morris urges caution. He \n     says, ``Be careful.''\n\n  And that he warned the President not to be too hard on her.\n  Well, 180 degrees off from that description, let me read you what, in \nfact, the independent counsel's office referral says, and I am sure it \nwas just a slip of the read that you heard yesterday.\n\n       The President had a followup conversation with Mr. Morris \n     during the evening of January 22nd, 1998--\n\n  This is page 127 of the independent counsel's referral--\n\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n\n     when Mr. Morris was considering holding a press conference to \n     ``blast Monica Lewinsky `out of the water.''' The President \n     told Mr. Morris to ``be careful.'' According to Mr. Morris, \n     the President warned him not to ``be too hard on [Ms. \n     Lewinsky]''. . .\n\n  Close. Close. One hundred eighty degrees off. Beyond that, let me be \nvery clear about one proposition which has been a subtheme running \nthrough some of the comments of the managers over the last many days. \nThe White House, the President, the President's agents, the President's \nspokespersons, no one has ever trashed threatened, maligned or done \nanything else to Monica Lewinsky--no one.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Hutchison of \nTexas, Snowe, Allard, Collins and Hatch to the House managers:\n\n       The counsel for the President have said that the heart of \n     this case is private consensual sex. A tenet of sexual \n     harassment law, however, is that the implied power \n     relationship between a supervisor (in this case, the \n     President), and a subordinate (in this case an intern), is \n     enough to constitute sexual harassment.\n       This is well settled in military law and is developing \n     along this line in the civilian sector. In your view, how \n     might acquittal of this case affect laws regarding sexual \n     harassment?\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, the law of sexual harassment is \na relatively new genre. If somebody wanted to make a case before the \nCongress had stepped in and improved upon the law, it essentially \nreduced women in the workplace, for instance, who had been harassed \ninto what has been referred to as a ``he said-she said'' type of \nargument, and so the law has improved upon that type of argument \nbecause the law recognizes today that sometimes there can be evidence \nof a pattern of conduct, and that conduct is relevant to prove how \nsomebody may have behaved.\n  Consider what would happen if victims of the workplace get a message \nfrom the Congress of the United States that what the President did with \nPaula Jones, or allegedly did with Paula Jones, is of no constitutional \nsignificance here. It would send a message to every woman in the \nworkplace that if they have a complaint against an employer who is \nattempting to use a position of power and authority to pursue improper \nadvancement, the message would be that you might as well just keep \nquiet about it because the person can lie in court and suffer no \nrecrimination. First, they will probably never be discovered, because \nmost of the time DNA evidence doesn't suddenly appear, but even if DNA \nevidence does appear to corroborate the victim, the message is that as \nlong as he is appropriately apologetic and the lie was, after all, only \nabout sex, it is of no import with respect to removing them from their \njob or having them suffer any legal consequences. I think that would be \na horrible message.\n\n  The reason the law allows this pattern-of-conduct evidence is because \nsexual harassers operate in a unique way. They get their victims alone. \nThey typically don't commit these crimes under the glare of klieg \nlights or in front of television cameras or where witnesses can \ntestify. They get their victims alone for one reason--because they know \nthrough intimidation and fear one of two things will happen. Through \nintimidation or fear, the victim will submit; or through intimidation \nor fear, the victim will not submit but will keep their mouth shut \nabout it.\n  What is the message to these victims who do brave losing their job, \nbeing destroyed publicly, having their reputations destroyed? What is \nthe message to them if, when they come forward and they want to pursue \ntheir case, we take the legal view that somebody can perjure \nthemselves, somebody can lie, somebody can obstruct justice, somebody \nin the greatest position of power in our country can take whatever \nsteps are necessary to destroy that woman's claim in a court of law \nwhere she is entitled to pursue it if at the end of all of this we say: \nWell, you know, he was embarrassed, he did lie but it was only about \nsex? Lies in sexual harassment cases, Members of the Senate, are always \nonly about sex.\n  The question before this body is, what type of validity are we going \nto give these laws and what sort of message are we going to send to \nvictims in the workplace? I pray that we can put personal relationships \naside with respect to how people individually feel about this President \npersonally and how they feel about his administration and focus on what \nis the ultimate conclusion legally and what is the precedent that would \nbe set if we turned a blind eye to this sort of conduct.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Boxer, Feinstein, \nLandrieu, Mikulski and Murray to counsel for the President.\n\n       Has Ms. Lewinsky ever claimed the relationship was other \n     than consensual and was not Ms. Jones' case dismissed as \n     having no claim recognized by law?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. No. And yes. Indeed, as Mr. Manager Rogan has told \nyou, and others before him on the managers' side, our sexual harassment \nlaws and our civil rights laws are of critical importance to all of us. \nMy colleague, Ms. Mills, spoke eloquently on that subject a couple of \ndays ago.\n  But it is important to understand, I believe, with no sense at all \nthat we are in any way diminishing the importance of those laws and of \nthe rights of every American citizen to seek justice under those laws, \nthat we are talking about a case in which the trial judge determined \nthat on all the evidence that had been gathered and all the claims that \nplaintiff had made and all the discovery that had been taken, there was \nno case. That is justice. That is the way the system works. The \nplaintiff brings the claim, the process moves ahead, and a judge \nultimately makes the decision. And this didn't have anything to do with \nwhat President Clinton said in his deposition on January 17. What the \njudge ruled was, first, that that evidence was irrelevant to her \nconsideration; and then ultimately, in April of last year, that there \nsimply was no case.\n  We accept the results of the justice system whether they go against \nus or whether they go for us. In either event, it is justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Thompson to the \nHouse managers:\n\n       Is there any reason to believe that there is any \n     relationship between the President telling Mr. Blumenthal \n     that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker and expressing his \n     frustration about not being able to get his story out with \n     the fact that shortly thereafter negative stories about Ms. \n     Lewinsky, including the allegation that she was a stalker, \n     began to appear in news articles quoting sources at the White \n     House?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Well, I appreciate that question. And thank \nyou, Mr. Chief Justice. Because I made a note of Mr. Ruff's statement \nthat no one--and I believe he specified the President, his aides, or no \none has ever trashed or spoken ill--used some other words--of Monica \nLewinsky. It really caught me as striking, in light of the sworn grand \njury testimony of Sidney Blumenthal. And, of course, he is testifying \nas to what the President told him. And, of course, in that conversation \nthe President told Sidney Blumenthal, as described by Mr. Blumenthal, \nthat: Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me. I \nrebuffed her. The President said: I have gone down that road before, I \nhave caused pain for a lot of people. I am not going to do that again. \nShe, referring to Monica Lewinsky, threatened the President. This is \nthe President's statement. It goes on and describes it; she was known \nas a stalker.\n\n  In my understanding that is trashing, that is speaking ill, that is \nbeing very critical and doing everything you can to basically destroy \nher reputation.\n  Now, why was he telling Sidney Blumenthal that? Was he trying to use \nSidney Blumenthal to get the message out to the public and to the grand \njury, who might hear this, that she is not a believable person? That \nthe whole idea is that she came on to him, that threatened the \nPresident of the United States? I think--I don't understand Mr. Ruff's \nrepresentation to the Senators that no one, including the President or \naides, has ever trashed Monica Lewinsky.\n  Now, I think it is important also, at that particular point in time, \nthe President knew that Sidney Blumenthal and John Podesta would be a \nwitness before the grand jury. That was his testimony. That is what the \nPresident of the United States admitted to. He said he knew that they \nwere going to be witnesses. And, clearly, that constitutes obstruction \nof justice; when he knows that they are going to\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\nbe a witness, he gives them false information knowing they are going to \nrepeat it to the grand jury, and that is an element of one of the \npillars of obstruction.\n  I want to come back to some things that have been said about the \nJones case. First of all, it has been characterized as a ``no win'' \ncase--that Judge Susan Webber Wright issued that order.\n  Well, if the truth had been known, what we know now about the \nrelationship, about the pattern of conduct, would that have made a \ndifference? And, of course, when those facts came out it was right \nbefore a decision by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that might \nhave reversed Judge Wright's order that the President of the United \nStates made a decision he could settle this case for eight hundred and \nsomething thousand dollars.\n  What would have happened? Maybe Paula Jones would not have had to \nhave gone through that many years of litigation if the truth had just \ncome out.\n  But there was a pattern of obstruction of justice, of lying, of \ncoaching witnesses, of tampering with witnesses, which ultimately led \nto a defeat of that case and the truth not coming out. But when it came \nout, it made a difference; it made a difference for that plaintiff in \nthat civil rights case.\n  Senator Hutchison asked a question about whether the power of the \nposition makes the difference in sexual harassment cases. Let me assure \nyou, if there is any chief executive officer of any company, whether it \nwas consensual or not, with an intern or a young person half of the \nofficer's age and whether it was--whatever they termed it at that \npoint, whether it was a subordinate employee--and that is the key \nlanguage, ``subordinate employee,'' then, yes, Senator, it does make a \ndifference, and that is the crux of many cases that are brought into \ncourt to protect women against sexual harassment in the workplace. I \nthink it is a linchpin of this act that this Congress passed. So I \nthink that when you look at the overall picture, there is that pattern \nof obstruction of justice.\n  Senator Biden asked a question, Would any prosecutor bring this case \nforward? Let me tell you, it would be easier--and I say this with great \ndeference to the Senate--but it would be easier to win a conviction \nbeyond any reasonable doubt, and I could win a conviction beyond a \nreasonable doubt in a court in this country on obstruction of justice \nbecause I know that common sense permeates a jury panel whenever they \nhear this case and the perjury--they are not going to buy, they are not \ngoing to accept what ``is'' is. They understand what these words mean, \nand common sense will apply. And I know that common sense exists in the \nSenate of the United States.\n  But let me assure you that this is a case that I would bring forth \nwithout any hesitation, and I believe the proof would demonstrate a \nconviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Kennedy to the \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       Could you reply to Mr. Hutchinson's allegations?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I think it important because the question put to \nthe House managers, Mr. Chief Justice, was whether there was some \neffort or some relationship between Ms. Lewinsky and a series of \narticles or stories that supposedly appeared in the early days \nfollowing the revelation of this investigation. I think it is important \nto recognize what the real facts are here.\n  This was the point made at the very end of my testimony before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee on December 9. One of the members of that \ncommittee spoke at great length and quite heatedly about what he \nbelieved to have been a plan to disseminate unfavorable information in \nthe press, and he submitted for the record a number of newspaper \narticles.\n  The articles that he submitted, which were largely spun off of one \nAssociated Press story, did not contain two--at least two--statements \nthat made it very clear that the accusation that there was some effort \non the part of the White House to disseminate disparaging information \nwere simply false.\n  In an Associated Press story of January 31, which was used by a \nmember of the House Judiciary Committee as one of his examples of how \nthe White House was supposedly coordinating such an attack, there was \nomitted the following portion. This is a statement by Ann Lewis, who is \nthe White House communications director:\n\n       To anyone who was saying such things about Ms. Lewinsky, \n     either it reflected a lack of coordination or thought or \n     adult judgment. We are not going down that road. It is not \n     the issue. A discussion of other people is not appropriate.\n\n  That is on January 31. Retrospectively, when Ms. Lewinsky had already \nbegun to cooperate with the independent counsel, the Los Angeles Times \nwrote the following:\n\n       From the beginning, the White House has been careful about \n     what it has said of Ms. Lewinsky. The week the Lewinsky story \n     broke in January, Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, \n     signaled the tone the White House would take by deflecting \n     questions about whether the 24-year-old intern was less than \n     stable.\n\n  Mr. McCurry:\n\n       ``I can't imagine anyone in a responsible position at the \n     White House would be making such an assertion. I've heard \n     some expressions of sympathy for what clearly someone who is \n     a young person would be going through at a moment like \n     this.'' And McCurry quickly signaled that the marching orders \n     had not changed once Lewinsky made a deal with the \n     independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, for immunity from \n     prosecution.\n\n  I think it is important that the record be clear that the stories \nabout which the managers were asked in their last question simply never \nreflected any plan, coordinated or uncoordinated, to do anything other \nthan treat Ms. Lewinsky with respect.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question doesn't show which Senators are \nsubmitting it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Hatch.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Hatch:\n\n       Isn't it true that Chief Federal District Judge Johnson \n     ruled today--in an order that she authorized to be \n     released to the public--that Ms. Lewinsky's immunity \n     agreement, which requires her ``to make herself available \n     for any interviews upon reasonable requests,'' compels her \n     to submit to an interview with the House? What light does \n     this shed on the earlier debate on this matter?\n\n  I am sorry, it is addressed to the House managers.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, I think certainly having come \nfrom an experience of practicing law and learned so much over the years \nand trying cases and putting together cases in an ethical and \nappropriate fashion, to come into a political proceeding, and as we \nhave dealt with this, and I think as the lawyers to my left had to deal \nwith the same type of situation, in a political realm, not just in the \nSenate, but months and weeks before we came in to here, is very \ndifficult.\n  What we have seen this morning is a completely innocent standard \npractice of sitting down with a potential witness before you have to \nlist your witnesses Monday and deciding whether or not you want to use \nher.\n  They have talked about lawyers committing malpractice by not taking \ndepositions. I submit it would be close to that if you don't talk to a \nwitness before you call that witness. Certainly, while the OIC has had \ncommunication with her over some time, we have not. We have not had \ncontact with any of these witnesses.\n  I alluded earlier to the White House and the other witnesses that \nwork for the White House that we might be looking at calling. I must \npresume by this conversation in this area of questioning that they have \nnot had any contact about this case with Ms. Currie and Mr. Podesta and \nMr. Blumenthal, and that even a friend of the White House, Mr. Vernon \nJordan. We are not asking we be privy to every time they say hello in \nthe hallway to these people or may sit down and talk with them. We \nunderstand the realities of life. We simply just wanted that crazy idea \nthat maybe we ought to talk to a witness before we decide whether or \nnot we want to list that witness.\n  I think to answer that question--and I will sit down--Judge Johnson \nclearly vindicated this right to do that, to accomplish that through \nthe immunity agreement. I apologize if we have offended the Senators. \nWe certainly didn't intend to do that. We certainly didn't intend to \nbreak any rules about this, and we don't think we did.\n  Certainly, if we are going to go down that road, and if you see it is \nappropriate that we have a rule you can agree on, we would be happy to \nabide\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\nby that, but we would simply like equal treatment with the other \nwitnesses, also with the White House and their attorneys. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is to the House managers from \nSenators Collins and Feingold:\n\n       On the basis of the President's and Betty Currie's \n     testimony concerning their conversation on Sunday, January \n     18, 1998, have each of the elements of obstruction of justice \n     under 18 U.S.C., section 1503, or witness tampering under 18 \n     U.S.C., section 1512, been met? We are particularly \n     interested in your analysis of whether the Senate can infer \n     that President Clinton intended to corruptly influence or \n     persuade Ms. Currie to testify falsely and the weight to be \n     given Ms. Currie's testimony in that regard.\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. The answer is that, under 18 U.S.C. section \n1503, there is a case for witness tampering in the conversation between \nPresident Clinton and Betty Currie.\n  I want to refer you to a case, United States v. Shannon, which is an \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals case decided October 12, 1987. And for \nyou lawyers here, it has been Shepardized. It is good law, and it \nreally puts this into perspective.\n  In the case, the defendant contended that the evidence did not \nsupport a conviction under 18 U.S.C. section 1503 because the \nGovernment did not prove that the witness in this case, Gray, was ever \na witness before the grand jury or that the defendant knew that that \nperson was going to be a witness before the grand jury. And this is \nwhat the court said:\n\n       This argument is . . . without merit. A conviction under \n     section 1503 for attempting to influence a witness is \n     appropriate so long as there is a possibility that the target \n     of the defendant's activities will be called upon to testify \n     in an official proceeding.\n\n  Now, this gentleman, this defendant, Mr. Shannon, went to jail. He \nmade the defense that, ``Well, I didn't--you know, that person was \nnever called as a witness, it was never an official proceeding,'' and \nit didn't fly. He was convicted. It was affirmed by the Court of the \nland and, presumably, he went to jail. Now, that is the law of the land \nin the criminal courts of our country. And so there would be a \nconviction under 18 U.S.C. section 1503.\n  In this case you have much more because, as I pointed out yesterday \nin reference to Betty Currie, Betty Currie was clearly a witness. They \nleft that deposition knowing she would be a witness. The Jones \nattorneys went back and immediately worked on issuing a subpoena for \nher because they had to have her because the President asserted her \nname continually through that. The President knew she was going to be a \nwitness. He came back and engaged in one conversation where he coached \nher testimony. He tampered with her testimony. It wasn't enough, so 2 \ndays later he brought her back in again and did the exact same thing. \nThe legal question is, As a prospective witness, is she covered under \nthe obstruction of justice statute? The answer is, yes, because other \npeople go to jail for exactly the same thing.\n  But I think we need to take a step back a moment. This U.S. Senate is \nnot bound by the strictures of the U.S. Criminal Code. If I came in \nhere today and said, ``Well, under the criminal procedures of the land, \nI'm entitled to bring witnesses and I'm entitled to cross-examine, and \nI'm entitled to do this, and we need to follow the criminal procedure \ncode,'' you would say, ``No. This is the Senate of the United States.'' \nAnd you would rightfully say that. You set your own rules in this.\n  And the same thing is true with the criminal law of the land. I think \nthat we make a criminal case for obstruction of justice that can be \nprosecuted, as other people are in every courtroom in this land. But \nthat is not the burden here. The issue is, Is this an impeachable \noffense? And something that is much higher is at stake, and that is the \npublic trust, the integrity of our Government, much more than in United \nStates v. Shannon. And that is what you are dealing with.\n  So we can debate the criminal code all day--and we win all that--but \nwe have to talk about the public trust, the integrity of our system. \nAnd that is what our country needs you to win for them.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Thurmond and \nBunning to the counsel for the President:\n\n       If there was no case and the White House accepted the \n     results of the justice system, why then did the President pay \n     nearly $1 million to Paula Jones?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I say this with all due respect, truly. As I think \neveryone knows in this Chamber, and outside this Chamber, who has \npracticed law, litigated difficult cases, the judgment of a defendant \nto settle a case, to pay whatever sum may be required to settle it, is, \nin all candor, I think, for all of us, not reflective of any belief \nthat he was wrong, that the other side was right. It reflects in this \ncase, very candidly, a judgment by the President, which he has stated \npublicly, that in the midst of the many matters that he is responsible \nfor, including, I must say, this matter, as well as all those matters \nof state on which he spends his time and to which he devotes his \nenergy, he could no longer spend any of that time and any of that \nenergy on the Jones case.\n  I am so hesitant to say this, but I really believe--please take it in \nthe spirit it is meant--that to ask whether the settlement of this case \nreflects substantively on the merits of Ms. Jones' claim is not fair. \nThe merits of Ms. Jones' claim were decided by Judge Wright. She \nconcluded that there were none. And I really do believe that to ask \nwhether the President's decision to settle is somehow a reflection on \nthe merits, contrary to those reached by Judge Wright, is simply not \nthe case.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question to the White House counsel from \nSenators Johnson and Leahy:\n\n       A few minutes ago, Manager Hutchinson stated that he would \n     be more confident of obtaining a conviction for obstruction \n     of justice in a court than he is in the Senate. Can that \n     statement be reconciled with the following exchange that \n     occurred on the Sunday program ``This Week'' on January 17, \n     1999, in which Manager Hutchinson was asked, ``On the case \n     that you have against the President on obstruction of \n     justice, not the perjury, would you be confident of a \n     conviction in a criminal court,'' and Manager Hutchinson \n     said, ``No, I would not''?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice----\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. It's addressed to the President's--is it the \nPresident's counsel? It is addressed to the President's counsel.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I believe under your ruling yesterday I can't \nobject to questions.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. That is correct.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I would----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Objection.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object to this, if he is unable to object, to make an \nobjection in any other form.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian advises me that the manager \nmay make an objection to the question being answered.\n  Mr. REID. Nothing being answered.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I have second thoughts, frankly. That ruling is \nbased on a very Delphic, almost incomprehensible statement that Salmon \nChase made during the trial of Andrew Johnson. And I think the correct \nresponse is that the managers do not have a right to object to a \nquestion by the Senator. So I rule the objection out of order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Regular order.\n  Ms. Counsel MILLS. I just wanted to address, for a second, Manager \nHutchinson's comments with regard to 1503. And he cited a 1987 case. In \n1995, I think, as we talked a little bit about, and the House managers \nhad discussed, Aguilar came down. And in that case the issue was, Was \nthere sufficient nexus between the actual conduct of the person \ninvolved and the proceeding? And in particular, I am just going to read \nto you for 1 minute from the case law.\n\n       The Government argues that respondent ``understood that his \n     false statements would be provided to the grand jury'' and \n     that he made [these] statements . . . to thwart the grand \n     jury investigation and not just the FBI investigation. . . . \n     The Government supports its argument with . . . the \n     transcript . . .\n\n  They go through the discussion that was between the judge and the \nagent in which the judge specifically asked whether or not he was a \ntarget for the grand jury investigation, and the agent responded:\n\n       There is a grand jury meeting. Convening I guess that's the \n     correct word. . . . [E]vidence will be heard . . . I'm sure \n     on this issue.\n\n  So, in other words, the person making the statement knew at that \npoint that there was potentially the possibility that his testimony \nwould be presented to the grand jury, and the court\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\nruled, as I talked to you a little bit about during my presentation \nbefore, that that was an insufficient nexus for there to prove a \nviolation of 1503.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Helms and Stevens \nto the House managers.\n\n       Do you have any comment upon the answer just given by the \n     President's counsel?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  First, I want to thank Ms. Mills for the courtesy she extended to me \njust a moment ago. And in our exchange, and Mr. Chief Justice, what I \nstarted to state my objection was, was really not to the question at \nthat point, but I was just going to make the reference to the \nanticipated answer that the statement on ``This Week with Sam and \nCokie'' was not exactly a part of this record. We are to be debating \nthe facts of this case, and Ms. Mills was kind enough not to go into \nthat. I think she was going to make the point that the answer I made \nwas in reference to the need to call witnesses; that how confident can \nyou be in any case without calling a witness so the jury can hear it?\n  Let me go back to what Ms. Mills said. She did cite the United States \nv. Aguilar, and I wish the Chief Justice--since he wrote the opinion--\ncould give us a lecture on that particular decision. I feel maybe we \nshould not be talking about this. But I read that opinion as totally \nconsistent with the United States v. Shannon and that the law is clear, \nthat if this body were to apply 18 U.S.C., section 1503, that a \nconviction would obtain, but again this is a body gathered for the \npurpose of consideration of an impeachable offense.\n  I also yield to Mr. Graham on that point.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. This is Saturday at 12:30 and a lot of people are \nprobably watching with interest what is going on. Let's talk about the \nlaw just for a moment in a way that we all can understand when this \nthing is over with.\n  It is a long time since I have been in law school, but I liked the \nexchange between the professor and the students because you kind of \nunderstood what the law was about at the end of the day. Witness \ntampering is designed--the statute is designed to do what? As Senator \nBumpers and I would say in Arkansas and South Carolina, ``messin' with \npeople.'' We can elevate that a little bit and say that the witness \ntampering statutes that we are talking about here are designed to make \nsure we get to the truth. Section 1512 is in the conjunctive, part (B): \n``Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force.''\n  That is one thing you don't want to happen here. You never want \nanybody to go up to a potential witness and threaten through force or \nintimidation to tell something that is not true. So that is out of \nbounds. That is illegal.\n  Or ``corruptly persuades''--now, what does that mean? There are some \ncases that talk about what that means. That means if the person has an \nintent, an evil intent or an improper purpose to persuade somebody \nwithout force or intimidation, that that is a crime.\n  Or listen to this: ``Engages in misleading conduct toward another \nperson with the intent to influence or prevent the testimony of any \nperson in an official proceeding.''\n  What are we getting to there, ladies and gentlemen? What the law \nsays, if you go to a person who likes you, who is your friend, who \ntrusts you, and you try to get them to tell a story --through \nmisleading them--that is not true, that is a crime.\n  The marvelous thing about the law is that it is based in common \nsense. It is very obvious to us we don't want somebody to tell a story \nthat is not true. It is also obvious to us that we don't want to take \npersonal relationships and misuse them to get false testimony out into \na courtroom.\n  So if you go back to your secretary--who trusts you, who likes you, \nwho admires you--and you try to mislead them by telling a scenario that \nis not true, and you believe that they may appear in court one day, \nwhat you have done is very wrong, because what you have done is you \nhave planted the seed of a lie in a way that we say is illegal.\n  So, if you believe the President of the United States was not \nrefreshing his memory when he told Betty Currie, ``She wanted to have \nsex with me and I couldn't do that. I never touched her, did I, \nBetty?'' If you believe that is not to refresh his memory, if you \nbelieve that was misleading, and you believe that he had reason to \nbelieve she was going to be a witness because of his own conduct, then \nhe is guilty.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Kerrey of Nebraska \nto the counsel for the President.\n\n       Could you elaborate on your comments about the settlement \n     of the Jones case, focusing on the reality, for example, that \n     corporations in this country routinely settle cases they \n     regard as utterly without merit, simply to spare the costs of \n     defense, public embarrassment, and for other reasons?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I think far better than I did, \nthe Senator from Nebraska has already elaborated on my answer. I think \nall of us who have been involved, either as lawyers or as parties, \nunhappily, in litigation know the burden that it imposes, and one can \nonly imagine--I am barely able to--a special burden that it places on a \nPresident to be immersed in this kind of litigation.\n  We take, I think, as a basic understanding in our jurisprudence that, \nas a matter of law, the settlement of a case is not probative of any \nbelief on either side about the strengths or weaknesses, but what it \nis, as a matter of law, is probably less relevant than what it is to \nthis body or to the American public's perception.\n  But underlying the law about what one can do in litigation in using a \ndecision to settle is, I think, a commonsense judgment that everybody, \nwhether it be a large corporation or individual or the President of the \nUnited States, makes a judgment about where his or her resources should \nbe expended--and I don't mean simply resources in terms of dollars, \nalthough they are secondly important--but resources in terms of energy, \ntime, worry, interference with the day-to-day business that all of us \nhave to conduct.\n  And I think it is fair to say that it is those factors, those very \ncommonsense factors, the ones we would all weigh, in different \ncircumstances at different settings if we were caught up in litigation, \nthat inform your judgment about what you should or, in my judgment, \nshould not take from the fact that the President settled this case.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Nickles, Warner, \nHelms, Inhofe, and Thurmond to counsel for the President.\n\n       Members of the armed services are presently removed from \n     service for improper sexual conduct and/or for perjury. If \n     the President is acquitted by the Senate, would not it result \n     in a lower standard of conduct for the Commander in Chief \n     than the other 1.3 million members of the armed services?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, this, of course, is a question \nlegitimately asked but I also think legitimately answered no. We all \nunderstand entirely what rules are imposed on members of the armed \nservices. Indeed, every member of the Federal civil service, every \nmember of a private company, when they engage in certain conduct, may \nbe sanctioned for it.\n  In the military, I understand--as do the Senators who have much \ngreater personal and institutional experience with our Armed Forces \nthan I--the importance of maintaining due order and discipline in the \narmed services, and also the importance of believing that nothing that \nthe Commander in Chief does or says should ever undermine the strength \nof our Armed Forces, their cohesiveness, or their belief in the rules \nand integrity of the rules that govern them.\n  But, that said, A, I do not believe, as a matter of what will flow \nfrom an acquittal of the President, who is, indeed, Commander in Chief, \nthat that will in fact undermine the good order and discipline of the \nArmy. But if I am wrong in some fashion about that, if my understanding \nof the process is flawed --and it may well be--we, nonetheless, have to \nask the question which I think is implicit in the question that was put \nto me: Because of the rules that apply to members of the Armed Forces, \ndoes it follow that because a sergeant, or a lieutenant, or a general, \nor an admiral will suffer in his career, that we must go back to the \nframers who wrote the impeachment clause and say they must have \nexpected that the Commander in Chief, the President, would be removed \nfor the same conduct? They had an Armed Forces then. Indeed, they were \nprobably more intimately involved\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nwith that, having just come through the Revolution, than Presidents and \nleaders of the country have been in the following 210 years. They \nsurely understood that there was a constitutional and societal \ndifference between the President in his role as Commander in Chief and \nthe President in his role as the leader of the country, on the one \nhand, and those to whom rules of discipline had to apply in order to \nsecure the strongest and best Armed Forces that we could secure.\n  It is, in a sense, I suppose, not an easy answer to give, because \nmembers of the Armed Forces put their lives on the line, and we want \nthem to feel that they are being treated fairly. But at the end of the \nday, it cannot be that the President of the United States is removable \nfor conduct that would adversely affect a career of a member of the \nmilitary.\n  There may be occasions on which the President engages in such \nhorrific conduct that he ought to be removed, and the same would happen \nto an admiral, or a general, or the Chief of Staff of the Joint Chiefs, \nor the highest military member that you can contemplate. But that \ndoesn't mean that this conduct is transposed from the world of the \nmilitary into the world of the Constitution in such a way that the \nPresident, even if he is our Commander in Chief, should be removed from \noffice, because I think that judgment would be inconsistent with the \njudgment made by the framers.\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest that this would be an \nexcellent time to take a 1-hour break for lunch.\n  There being no objection, at 12:44 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n1:45 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, we are ready momentarily to begin with the \nquestioning period again. I believe the first question will come \nthrough Senator Daschle.\n  I do want to say to our colleagues that any Senator is entitled to \npropound a question on both sides, and so we will give you every \nopportunity to do that. Again, it is our intent to go today not later \nthan 4 o'clock, and if additional time is needed for questions, it will \nhave to go over until Monday. We have some questions that have already \nbeen propounded that we would like to put to one side or the other, but \nat some point I think we will have a sense that maybe the basic \nquestions have been asked.\n  So if any Senator on either side feels strongly about a particular \nquestion, he or she may want to be thinking about how and when they \ninsist that it be offered. But I think a lot of ground has been \ncovered. I hope that within a reasonable period of time the questions \nthat Senators have will be given and we will have a response, and then \nwe will make a decision on how to proceed from there.\n  I yield, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Bingaman to \ncounsel for the President.\n\n       When Samuel Dash resigned as adviser to the independent \n     counsel, he wrote in the letter of resignation that he was \n     doing so because the independent counsel had become an \n     advocate and had ``unlawfully intruded on the power of \n     impeachment which the Constitution gives solely to the \n     House.''\n       In using his power to assist one party to the pending \n     impeachment trial before the Senate, do you believe he has \n     unlawfully intruded on the power of the Senate to try \n     impeachments?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, the independent \ncounsel statute gives the independent counsel in some sense almost \nunbounded power to investigate the President and other high officials \nof Government. It does not give him and has never given him unbounded \npower even to the extent that he has become immersed in the impeachment \nproceedings in the House. For the statute itself says not you shall \nbecome the 436th Member of the House, not that impeachment is vested in \nthe independent counsel, but that impeachment is vested in the House \nand trial in the Senate.\n  We were, obviously, dismayed at the role that the independent counsel \nchose to follow rather than simply sending information to the House \nthat might bear on possible impeachable offenses but, rather, to drive \nhis van up to the building and unload unscreened, undiluted boxes of \ninformation which thereafter made their way, at least in part, into the \npublic domain.\n  But surely it was a shock to all of us, at least on this side, to \nlearn yesterday evening that playing a role in the House proceedings \nhad now become a role in this Chamber, that the independent counsel was \nusing not only his powers of coercion but calling on the U.S. district \ncourt to assist him and, in turn, enabling the managers not simply, as \nthey would have it, to do a little work product, to do a little meeting \nand greeting, to do a little saying hello and a little chatting with \nsomeone who may be a witness before this body but, rather, saying to \nthis witness: I hold your life in my hands and I'm going to transfer \nthat power to the managers for the House of Representatives.\n  The managers have said we are engaged in an adversary process here, \nand they themselves have talked long and loud today about letting them \nplay out the process that any lawyer would play out preparing for \ntrial. Well, no other lawyer that I know of gets to have a prosecutor \nsitting in a room with him and saying to the witness: Talk to these \npeople or your immunity deal is gone and you may go to jail.\n  Now, we have been accused by Manager Hutchinson and others of always \ntalking about process, of always falling back on process. Well, I \nsuggest, Senators, that process is what our justice system is all \nabout. Process is what we have always relied on to protect everyone \nagainst the vaunted power of the state in this case; not just the \nmanagers, but the state embodied in the independent counsel.\n\n  But in this case it is more than just a call for due process, for \nfairness, because it is going to have a direct and immediate impact on \nthe facts as we learn them, as they learn them, and most importantly as \nyou learn them. Can you imagine--can you imagine what it is going to be \nlike for Monica Lewinsky to be sitting in a room with the 13 managers, \nor however many there are, and the independent counsel, and his \nlawyers, knowing the threat that she is under, knowing how she got into \nthat room? Can we have any reason to believe that what comes out of \nthat process will be the fair, unvarnished truth? Or will she, of \nnecessity, be looking over her shoulder and saying I better not put one \nfoot wrong because the independent counsel is sitting there watching, \nand he has already told me that this deal is gone if I don't cooperate \nwith the House managers.\n  Process and truth, they are inextricably linked, but not--not if the \nindependent counsel moves to that side of the room and becomes the \nmoving force in the development of the truth and the facts as this body \nis entitled to know them.\n  Accuse us of talking about process if you will; accuse us, if you \nwill, of falling back on process. We do it proudly because process is \nwhat this is all about, because process leads to truth. But not that \nway.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Specter, Frist, \nSmith of New Hampshire, Inhofe, Lugar, Brownback, Roth, and Crapo to \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       In arguing that an impeachable offense involves only a \n     public duty, what is your best argument that a public duty is \n     not involved in the President's constitutional duty to \n     execute the laws? At a minimum, doesn't the President have a \n     duty not to violate the laws under the constitutional \n     responsibility to execute the laws?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. It can't be. It can't be that if the President \nviolates the law and thus violates his duty faithfully to carry out the \nlaws, he is removed from office. Because that would literally encompass \nvirtually every law, every regulation, every policy, every guideline \nthat you could imagine that he is responsible for carrying out in the \nexecutive branch. If that were so, it would have been very simple for \nthe framers to say the President shall be impeached for treason, \nbribery and failure to carry out his oath faithfully to execute the \nlaws. They wrote that. They could have incorporated it into the \nimpeachment clause if they had wished, and they chose not to.\n  So that if, in fact, you suggest that a failure to faithfully execute \nthe laws\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\ninevitably leads to a decision that an impeachable and removable \noffense has been committed, I suggest with all respect that you have \nsimply eliminated the impact of the words ``treason, bribery and other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  Now, you may well judge within that setting--that is, within that \nconstitutional standard ``other high crimes and misdemeanors''--that \nsome particular violation of law warrants removal. But it surely can't \nbe, just looking back at what the framers did and what the words \nthemselves mean, that any violation, even if you were to find one, must \nlead you to conclude that having therefore violated his responsibility \nto faithfully execute the laws, removal must follow.\n  The framers knew what the other parts of the Constitution said, and \nthey specifically chose the words they chose, intending that they cover \nonly the most egregious violations of the public law and public trust \nthat they could conceive of.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senator Graham to counsel for \nPresident Clinton:\n\n       In the event the Senate determines the removal of the \n     President is not warranted, are there any constitutional \n     impediments to the following action: (1) a formal motion of \n     censure; (2) a motion other than censure incorporating the \n     Senate's acknowledgement and disapproval of the President's \n     conduct; (3) a motion requiring a formal Presidential apology \n     or any other statement accepting the judgment of the Senate; \n     or (4) a motion requiring the President to state that he will \n     not accept a pardon for any previous criminal activities.\n       Assuming that one or more of the above actions are \n     constitutional, are there any other serious policy concerns \n     about the advisability of the Senate formally adopting a \n     legislative sanction of the President that falls outside the \n     scope of the constitutional sanction of removal from office?\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like the record to show that that \nwas Senator Graham of Florida. (Laughter.)\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The record may so show.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Senator Gramm, my apologies. I assumed since \nSenator Daschle sent it up it was probably from this side, but I am \nglad you clarified the record.\n  That question probably requires much more constitutional learning to \nanswer in great detail than I possess, but let me give it a try. And \nthe easiest one for me to answer is the fourth part: Would it be \nappropriate for, in some fashion, for the President formally to state \nthat he would not accept a pardon?\n  I have stated formally on behalf of the President in response to a \nvery specific question by the House Judiciary Committee that he would \nnot, and, indeed, we have said in this Chamber, and we have said in \nother places, that the President is subject to the rule of law like any \nother citizen and would continue to be on January 21, 2001, and that he \nwould submit himself to whatever law and whatever sanction or whatever \nprosecution the law would impose on him. He is prepared to defend \nhimself in that forum at any time following the end of his tenure. And \nI committed on his behalf, and I have no doubt that he would so state \nhimself, that he would not seek or accept a pardon.\n  I will not even begin to tread on the territory that is the Senate's \njurisdiction and the issues that it takes unto itself, much less give \nit advice about what it is possible or not possible to do, except to \nventure this. I see no constitutional barrier, certainly, to the \nSenate's passing a censure motion in whatever form it chooses--whether \nadopting language from the articles or creating language of its own. We \nmight at the end of the day disagree with you about whether the \nlanguage is justified or whether it accurately reflects the facts, but \nthere is nothing in the Constitution, I believe, that prevents this \nbody from undertaking that task.\n  With respect to a formal acknowledgment, there I suppose the \ninterplay between the legislative and the executive branch becomes more \ntenuous. But to the extent that whatever the Senate chooses to say in \nsuch a document needs to be acknowledged or recognized by the \nPresident, that can be done without trenching on the separation of \npowers in that special uncertain area between the legislative and \nexecutive branches. I have no doubt that some process can be worked out \nthat meets the Senate's needs. I say this all in the sort of vast limbo \nof hypothesis, because obviously I am answering both somewhat off the \ncuff and without knowing what language we are talking about.\n  But the core position, as we see it, is that nothing stands in the \nway of this body from voicing its sentiments. Indeed, I have said in \nthe House of Representatives that I thought a censure was an \nappropriate response, and the President has said he is prepared to \naccept the censure. I have no doubt, although that was said in the \ncontext of the proceedings in the House, it surely is applicable as \nwell to anything that this body chooses to do.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Thompson to the \nHouse managers:\n\n       Do you have any comment on the answer given by the \n     President's counsel with regard to the Office of Independent \n     Counsel?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that \nquestion. It is our judgment--and I think a fair judgment--that we \nshould be allowed and are permitted, under any of the rules normal to \nthis, to request of the Office of Independent Counsel the opportunity \nto talk to Monica Lewinsky, which we otherwise apparently were not \ngoing to be able to have as a normal course of preparation.\n  It makes me wonder--with all of the complaints that are going on here \nfrom the White House attorneys about this and their desire not to have \nwitnesses--what they are afraid of. Are they afraid of our talking to \nMonica Lewinsky? Are they afraid of the deposition of Monica Lewinsky? \nAre they afraid of what she might say out here? I don't think they \nshould be, but they appear to be.\n  We are not doing anything abnormal. We are exercising our privileges, \nour rights. If it were a prosecutor and you had a prosecutorial arm, \nwhich you do in the case of the Independent Counsel Office, that had an \nimmunity agreement, as there is in this case, you certainly would not \nhesitate if you had a recalcitrant witness who you needed to call to \nutilize that immunity agreement and have the opportunity to discuss the \nmatter with that witness, and you certainly would not hesitate if you \nneeded to use that immunity agreement to assure truthful testimony in \nany proceeding that was going on.\n  After all, that is the purpose of the immunity agreement. It means \nthat the witness is probably much more likely to be telling the truth \nthan under any other circumstances, which is why counsels frequently \nargue immunity agreements as a reason why a particular witness is more \ncredible than they might otherwise be if it were not for that \nagreement.\n  So I think there is an awful lot being said today about our meeting \nthat we want to have with Ms. Lewinsky to prepare her as a witness. I \nwant to tell you all it is being done, in my judgment, with all due \nrespect to those who are doing it, principally because of the concerns \nthey don't want us to have that opportunity or they want to cast some \naspersion or doubt, or whatever.\n\n  We are not about to do anything improper. We can assure you of that. \nWe would never do that. We are going to follow regular order and do \nthis as good counsels would do in good faith, and in no way would we \nwish to do it otherwise, nor have we. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question of Senator Baucus to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       In view of the direct election of the President, his \n     popularity, and short duration of his term, and in view of \n     the fact that, as House Manager Graham stated, ``reasonable \n     people can differ in this case,'' please explain, precisely, \n     how acquitting the President will result in an immediate \n     threat to the stability of our Government.\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, I don't think anyone contends that if the President is \nacquitted that suddenly it is apocalypse now or the Republic will be \nthreatened from without or from within. I think erosion can happen very \nslowly and very deliberately. The problem that I have is with this \noffice being fulfilled by someone who has a double responsibility.\n  The first responsibility is to take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted. He is the only person in the country, in the world, who has \nthat\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\ncompact with the American people. The other, of course, is his oath to \npreserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He is the national role \nmodel, he is the man, he is the flagbearer in front of our country. He \nis the person, his office is the person every parent says to their \nlittle child, ``I hope you grow up and be President of the United \nStates some day.'' We do nothing as important as raising our kids, and \nthe President is the role model for every kid in the country.\n  When you have a President who lies and lies and lies under oath--and \nthat is the key phrase, ``under oath.'' I don't care about his private \nlife or matters that are not public. But when he takes an oath to tell \nthe truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth and then lies and \nlies and lies, what kind of a lesson is that for our kids and our \ngrandkids? What does it do to the rule of law?\n  Injustice is a terrible thing. The longer you live, the more you can \nencounter it. Injustice, abuse, oppression, and the law is what \nprotects you; the law, having resort to an objective standard of \nmorality in action. And when you are sworn to take care that the laws \nare faithfully executed, how do you reconcile the conduct of perjury \nand obstruction of justice with that obligation?\n  I have a suggestion. Let's just tear it out of the Constitution. Tear \nout that ``take care to see that the laws are faithfully executed.'' It \nis wrong. It is an example we are setting for millions of kids that if \nthe President can do it, you can do it. What do you say to master \nsergeants who have their careers destroyed because they hit on an \ninferior member of the military? We are setting the parameters of \npermissible Presidential conduct for the one office that ought to gleam \nin the sunlight. And the kids, that is what moves me, the kids.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Nickles, Warner, \nCrapo, Helms, Inhofe, and Thurmond to the House managers:\n\n       Would you like to comment on the remarks of Counsel Ruff \n     concerning the impact of an acquittal of the President \n     accused of improper sexual conduct and/or perjury and \n     obstruction on the Armed Forces?\n\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to thank the \nSenators for the question, because I believe it is also insightful.\n  The question of double standards or establishing lower standards, I \nbelieve, is extraordinarily important. The defense asserted--and it is \nhard for me to believe--but they are asking you to set a higher \nstandard for judges and a lower standard for a President who nominates \nthem to you, asking you--they think that we can set a higher standard \nfor law enforcement, yet establish a lower standard for the Chief \nExecutive or the chief law enforcement officer that has the duty to \nfaithfully see that the laws are executed; set a higher standard for \nmilitary personnel, and then a lower standard for the Commander in \nChief who must make the painful decisions to send them into battle.\n  Now, the precedents in impeachment trials here in the Senate, the \njudgment of the Armed Services Committee and the Senate regarding the \nstandards for promotion, have been otherwise than that which Mr. Ruff \nhas asserted.\n  We must confront the fact that the President is the Commander in \nChief. And I believe that it is perfectly acceptable of the American \npeople to demand of the military the highest standard, which also means \nthat those of whom find themselves in positions of responsibility in \nthe Pentagon of whom are in civilian leadership must also live by such \nexemplary conduct and standards. The high character of military \nofficers is a safeguard of the character of a nation.\n  The Senate, who must ratify the officers' promotion list, has \nrepeatedly found that anything less than exemplary conduct is therefore \nunworthy of a commission or further promotion. I recall when I first \ncame to Congress in 1992, there were many making a big to-do over \nTailhook. Remember? And it was serious. There are still remnants around \nof Tailhook because there are still those who are screening the \nofficers' promotion. If you were within 100 miles of Tailhook, look out \nfor your career. That needs to be put to bed.\n  Then I was given a duty to ensure that after Aberdeen broke and the \nsexual misconduct in the military--whether it was at Fort Jackson, \nAberdeen, or at other places--I spent 18 months out on the road to \nensure that the policies of the military were fair and the treatment of \nequal dignity in the workplace among men and women. We cannot forget \nthat.\n  You see, we also must recognize and must be candid with the harsh \nreality that the officers and NCOs are human and not without fault, \nfolly, and failings. I believe, though, it is the aspirations of high \nideals that are important for each of us, but more so to the military \nin order to keep the trust and the public faith of the military. You \nsee, a soldier, a sailor, an airman or marine is prepared to lay down \nhis or her life to defend the Constitution. And it is the devotion and \nthe fidelity to the oath without mental reservation that is the epitome \nof character.\n\n  Now, the President is not and should not be subject to the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. And I concur with Mr. Ruff when he made that \npoint. And the President is not an actual member of the military. But \nwe have a unique system in the world. We have that civilian control of \nthe military, and it works. But we also must recognize and be cognizant \nthat the President, however, is at the pinnacle, he is at the top of \nthe chain of command. And that is what I learned about, being on the \nroad for 18 months, and How do we make corrections? and How do you set \nthe proper dignity in the workplace?\n  It doesn't matter if it is your own office or, in fact, if you are \nthe President as Commander in Chief. Whoever leads you sets the tenor \nof those who must follow. You see, the message is that the military \npersonnel do look to the Commander in Chief to set the high standard of \nmoral and ethical behavior. The military personnel are required to set \na high standard of conduct in order to set the example to those they \nlead. Adherence to high standards is the fabric of good order and \ndiscipline. When military leaders fall short of this ideal, then there \nis confusion and disruption in the ranks. And today many do see a \ndouble standard. There is a double standard because the Commander in \nChief has allegedly conducted himself in a manner that would be a \ncourt-martial offense for military personnel having been alleged of the \nvery same thing.\n  The President's actions have had an intangible and coercive impact \nupon military personnel. To turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to it would \nbe shame on us. The question soldiers and sailors ask is: I took an \noath to swear to tell the truth. And I also took an oath to uphold the \nConstitution. How can this President take the same oath and not be \ntruthful and remain in office? If I were to have done what the \nPresident did, I would be court-martialed.\n  You see, we also have to recognize that each of the services are \nrecruiting young people all across the Nation. At boot camp they infuse \nthese young people with the moral values of honor, courage and \ncommitment, and they're teaching self-restraint, discipline and self-\nsacrifice. Military leaders are required to provide a good example to \nthose young recruits, yet when they look up the chain of command, all \nthe way to the Commander in Chief, they see a double standard at the \ntop. Again, it is the President that sets the tone and tenor in the \nmilitary, just as he does for law enforcement.\n  I believe the President has violated this sacred trust between the \nleaders and those of whom he was entrusted to lead. I also spoke in my \npresentation that it was the President's self-inflicted wounds that \nhave called his own credibility into question not only in his \ndecisionmaking process, but with regard to security policies.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair has the view that you have answered the \nquestion.\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Torricelli and \nKohl to the President's counsel:\n\n       At the outset of the House proceedings, a member of the \n     majority, now a manager, stated: ``The solemn duty that \n     confronts us requires that we attain a heroic level of \n     bipartisanship and that we conduct our deliberations in a \n     fair, full and independent manner. . . . The American people \n     deserve a competent, independent, and bipartisan review of \n     the Independent Counsel's report. They must have confidence \n     in the process. Politics must be checked at the door.''\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\n       In evaluating the case against the President, should the \n     Senate take into account: (a) the partisan nature of the \n     proceedings in the House, or (b) the public's ``lack of \n     confidence'' in the proceedings thus far?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, I think that this body has \ngot to take into consideration what brought these articles here, and \nthat is the action both of the independent counsel and the House of \nRepresentatives. I think when fairly considered, when you look at the \nactions of both, you find an absence of fairness and bipartisanship.\n  The independent counsel investigated this case for 8 months. It \ndeveloped every bit of evidence it could that was negative, derogatory, \nor prejudicial, and it put them into those five volumes. It did not \npursue exculpatory leads. It did not follow up evidence that might lead \nto evidence of innocence. And it downplayed, when it came to write the \nreferral, significant testimony which was exculpatory or helpful.\n  I think the independent counsel's process was really epitomized by \nMs. Lewinsky's statement that nobody asked her to lie or had promised \nher a job for silence. You see, the independent counsel didn't bring \nout that testimony. In fact, it came out when the independent counsel \nwas through examining Ms. Lewinsky in the grand jury. I want to read \nyou a very short part of that, page 1161 of the appendix.\n  Independent counsel prosecutor says, ``We don't have any further \nquestions,'' and a grand juror pipes up, ``Could I ask one?''\n\n       Monica, is there anything that you would like to add to \n     your prior testimony, either today or the last time you were \n     here, or anything that you think needs to be amplified on or \n     clarified? I just want to give you the fullest opportunity.\n\n  Here is what Ms. Lewinsky says:\n\n       I would. I think because of the public nature of how this \n     investigation has been and what the charges aired, that I \n     would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I \n     was never promised a job for my silence. And that I'm sorry. \n     I'm really sorry for everything that's happened.\n\n  Now, we requested the independent counsel, before he sent the \nreferral to the House of Representatives, for an opportunity to review \nthat. We were denied this.\n  I think if you compare what happened here with what happened in 1974 \nwhen Special Prosecutor Jaworski sent a transmission of evidence to the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, the comparison is very revealing. Then \nSpecial Prosecutor Jaworski sent only a road map of the evidence, a \ndescription of what was in the record. Judge Sirica reviewed that at a \nhearing where White House counsel were present. Judge Sirica then said \nit was a fair, impartial summary and transmitted it on to the House \nJudiciary Committee. Here, without review either by the presiding judge \nor the grand jury, a referral was sent to the House that was a one-\nsided, unfair prosecutorial summary.\n  When the House managers speak of the need for discovery, they have no \nsuch need. Everything prejudicial that could be found through an \nunlimited budget and seemingly endless investigation has been found and \nput there, tied up with a red ribbon for you.\n  In terms of bipartisanship in the House, I think that speaks for \nitself. I don't think this was a bipartisan process. I don't think it \nwas a bipartisan result. I think, though, it rests with this body to \ntry the case. It is clear under the Constitution that this body has the \npower, the sole power, to try impeachment. The Chief Justice in the \nNixon case made that very clear.\n  I am not going to comment on the independent counsel's assistance to \nthe House manager with Ms. Lewinsky. I think that is for you to decide \nwhether that is consonant with how you decide the case ought to be \ntried. But I think that the presentation of the articles to this body \nhas been neither fair nor bipartisan.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Lott to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Do you have any comment on the answer just given by the \n     President's counsel?\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I welcome \nthis opportunity to fill in a considerable gap in the record.\n  Mr. Counsel Kendall said earlier today or perhaps yesterday--it was \nyesterday--``We never had a chance to call witnesses ourselves, to \nexamine them, to cross-examine them, to subpoena documentary evidence, \nat no point in this process.''\n  On October 5, 1998, the House Judiciary Committee passed House \nResolution 581 by voice vote, the impeachment inquiry procedure, which \nincluded the right to call witnesses for the President.\n  On October 21, the House Judiciary Committee staff met with Mr. Ruff, \nMr. Kendall, and Mr. Craig. At that time, the Judiciary Committee staff \nasked the White House to provide any exculpatory information, provide a \nlist of any witnesses they wanted to call, without result.\n  On November 9, the House Judiciary Committee wrote to Messrs. Ruff, \nKendall, and Craig and again informed them of the President's right to \ncall witnesses.\n  On November 19, Independent Counsel Starr testified 12 hours before \nthe House Committee on the Judiciary. President's counsel was given the \nopportunity to question the independent counsel. He did not ask a \nsingle question relating to the facts of the independent counsel's \nallegations against the President. Now, the Democrats have Mr. Kendall, \nthey had Abbe Lowell; we had Dave Schippers. That is not an invidious \ncomparison.\n  On November 25, I wrote a letter to the President asking the \nPresident, among other things, to provide any exculpatory information \nand inform the committee of any witnesses it wanted to call, without \nsuccess.\n  On December 4, two working days before the presentation of the \nPresident to the Judiciary Committee, counsel for the President \nrequested to put on 15 witnesses. The White House was allowed to \npresent all 15 witnesses. Not a single one of those was a fact witness.\n  Lastly, I quote from a letter from Mr. Kendall to Mr. Bittman. It is \nin volume 3, part 2 of 2, page 2326.\n\n       That you now request we submit exculpatory evidence is \n     perfectly consonant with the occasionally ``Alice in \n     Wonderland'' nature of this whole enterprise. I am not aware \n     of anything that the President needs to exculpate.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Leahy to the White \nHouse counsel:\n\n       The managers argued in response to a previous question that \n     would set a bad example for the military to acquit the \n     President. Given that argument, how could you reconcile the \n     statement by Manager Hyde after Caspar Weinberger was \n     pardoned by President Bush of multiple criminal violations, \n     including perjury, that, ``I'm glad the President had the \n     chutzpa to do it. The prosecution of Weinberger was political \n     in nature, an effort to get at Ronald Reagan. I just wish us \n     out of this mess, the 6 years and this $30 or $40 million \n     that has been spent by independent counsel Lawrence E. \n     Walsh''?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. The question, in virtually every respect, speaks \nfor itself.\n  But I would make this point because I think it fleshes out a bit my \nearlier answer and responds in some fashion to the argument made by the \nmanagers on this very issue. I was probably too lawyerly, as is my \nwont, in responding to the earlier question on this issue by Senators \nWarner and Thurmond, because I think the one point that needs to be \nmade in the context of Senator Leahy's question which goes to the \nleadership of the Secretary of Defense and the issue of what it means \nto undertake the removal of a President, the distinction that I think \nwe all need to hold on to that I probably glided over too rapidly in my \nearlier answer, is that the President of the United States is elected \nby the people of the United States.\n  He appoints the Secretary of Defense; he appoints the officers in the \nmilitary; he appoints the judges. And the Senate plays a role in that \nprocess by approving his choices, or occasionally not approving his \nchoices. But there is only one person who is put in his job with the \nvoice of the people, and however we may be concerned, as rightly we \nshould, if that person oversteps the bounds either of his office or his \npersonal conduct, to say that there is some one-to-one, or any other \nnumber you can think of, comparison between the impact of enforcing the \nlaw on those civilian and military personnel who serve our country and \nthe very different question of whether the voice of the people will be \nstilled by removing the President is the point on which I think this \nbody needs to focus.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Kyl and Mack to \ncounsel for the President:\n\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\n\n       Mr. Ruff said President Clinton was never asked in the \n     grand jury whether everything he testified to in the Jones \n     deposition was true. If he were asked, would he say it was \n     all true? Would the President be willing to answer an \n     interrogatory from the Senate asking that question?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Senator, it is true that he testified that he \ntried to be truthful in the Jones deposition, that it was his purpose \nto be accurate in the Jones deposition. He tried to navigate his way \nthrough a minefield without violating the law, and believes that he \ndid. There is no statement in that testimony in the grand jury that \nreaffirms, ratifies, and confirms all of his testimony in the Jones \ndeposition.\n  Now, we would be happy to take questions and get responses to you, \nconsult the President, if you would like to submit them.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Murray to the \nWhite House counsel:\n\n       Has Ms. Lewinsky ever claimed that she was sexually \n     harassed by the President?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, Ms. Lewinsky has made no such \nclaim. What happened between the President and her was improper, but it \nwas consensual. To say that does not excuse it or sugarcoat it or \njustify it, but it does, I think, put it in the proper context. She has \nnever claimed that she has any evidence at all relevant to sexual \nharassment by the President. When the President--and I went through \nthis on Thursday in respect to the obstruction of justice allegation, \nabout the President stating that she could file an affidavit. The \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky reasonably believe that she could have filed \na limited but truthful affidavit.\n  And I think you have to look to the fact that the Jones case was not \na class action. It was a suit only about what Ms. Jones claimed \nhappened in May 1991 in a Little Rock hotel room. The December 11 \nruling on discovery was a ruling not only on admissibility, but \ndiscovery. The President believed that an affidavit--a truthful \naffidavit--might be successful--not that it would, but that it might \nbe.\n  Now, in filing such an affidavit, in preparing it, no particular form \nwas necessary. There was nothing to dictate what had to go in and what \nhad to go out of it. There were many witnesses on the witness list. The \nend of discovery was approaching, and there was at least some chance, \nthey thought, that a factual affidavit, which was limited, might \naccomplish the purpose. And I think this is confirmed by the fact that \nwhen Judge Wright considered whether to order Ms. Lewinsky's \ndeposition, she issued a ruling on January 29 saying that \nthe deposition would not go forward because evidence from Ms. Lewinsky \nwould not be admissible at the Paula Jones trial because it was both \nirrelevant to the court allegations and it was inadmissible as \nextrinsic evidence of other facts.\n\n  So I think that Ms. Lewinsky had nothing whatsoever to offer on the \ncritical issue in the Paula Jones case, which was an issue of sexual \nharassment.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question by Senator Shelby to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Would a verdict of not guilty be a stronger message of \n     vindication for the President than a motion to dismiss, or, \n     in the alternative, a motion to adjourn? And what are the \n     constitutional implications, if any, if a motion to dismiss \n     prevailed, short of concluding the trial?\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, there are \nvarious options. It is really a misdirected question, if I may say, to \nask us to suggest the consequences of solutions to this dilemma that we \nare in. I think the beauty--and that is not the word--I think the \nadvantage of proceeding with the articles of impeachment is it is \nconsonant with the Constitution. It is simple; it is clean: either \nguilty or not guilty.\n  The consequences of that verdict, of course, are up to any individual \nwho casts a vote. Now, I have heard the word ``censure'' sometime \nbefore. You gentlemen and ladies do anything you want to do. It is your \npower, it is your authority, it is in your yard, but you have to deal \nwith the Constitution, no matter what you do.\n  You have a problem of a bill of attainder, a problem of the \nseparation of powers, and you have a problem that any censure, to be \nmeaningful, has to at least damage the President's reputation; and that \nbecomes, in my judgment, a bill of attainder, but that, again, is up to \nyou. The consequences, I don't think, will harm us, whatever you do. We \nhave done our best. We have lived up to our responsibility under the \nConstitution, and all we ask is that you live up to your \nresponsibilities under the Constitution and give us a trial. I am sure \nyou will.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question to the President's counsel from \nSenator Levin:\n\n       Monica Lewinsky has explicitly said in her handwritten \n     proffer that ``no one encouraged'' her to lie. Yet, House \n     Manager Asa Hutchinson claimed to the Senate, using \n     inferences, that Ms. Lewinsky was ``encouraged'' to lie. Do \n     the House managers argue that such inferences are as credible \n     as Ms. Lewinsky's direct testimony to the contrary?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I think Senator Levin's question goes to the heart \nof much of what we have been saying for the last few days. If, in fact, \nyou look at the five volumes stacked up in front of my colleague, Mr. \nKendall, you will see Ms. Lewinsky say not just once, but many times, \nin essence: I was never told to, never encouraged to lie, never traded \nan affidavit for a job, never did any of the things that lie at the \nvery heart of the managers' case. And so what do we have, then? We have \nthe managers trying to snatch a bit of evidence here, a bit of \nspeculation there, or a bit of extrapolation over there, and say, well, \nshe really didn't mean it when she said several times quite directly, \n``Nobody ever told me or encouraged me to lie.''\n\n  It is possible, of course, whenever one deals with circumstantial \nevidence, to make reasonable leaps from that evidence to some viable \nconclusion. But I think most courts that we are familiar with--and \nthose of you who practice law are familiar with--would have a good deal \nof difficulty in concluding that if I take a little bit here and a \nlittle bit there and a little bit over there, pull them all together \ninto some vast speculation about what was really in someone's mind, and \non the other side I have the person saying what is in her mind and \nsaying the opposite, I don't think that case would ever get to the \njury.\n  And maybe it is one of the things that worries me just a little bit \nabout the normal, everyday--we do it all the time in conference between \nthe managers and the independent counsel and Ms. Lewinsky--that maybe \nin that setting, to the independent counsel gently patting Ms. Lewinsky \non the back and telling her it is time to cooperate, maybe the message \nwill become closer to their side and their speculation, don't stay \nwhere you were, which is what you told the grand jury, the FBI, and us \nunder oath and not under oath on multiple occasions, which is, indeed, \n``Nobody told me to, nobody encouraged me to lie.''\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Bond to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       When Ms. Mills described the President's testimony before \n     the Jones grand jury, she said the President was \n     ``surprised'' by questions about Ms. Lewinsky. What evidence \n     is there of the President's knowledge that Lewinsky questions \n     would be asked? Is there evidence that he knew in advance the \n     details of the Lewinsky affidavit which his counsel presented \n     at the Jones deposition?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  There are numerous evidences in the record to show that the President \nwas not surprised about the questions pertaining to Monica Lewinsky at \nthe January 17 deposition. First of all, in regard to the affidavit \ntestimony of Monica Lewinsky--I believe it was January 6--5th or 6th--\nis that she discussed that with the President, signing that affidavit, \nand the content of the affidavit. That is whenever he made his \nstatement, ``I don't need to see it. I have seen 15 of them.''\n  Again, we don't know what he is referring to in reference to that \n``15.'' But clearly, according to Monica Lewinsky's testimony, she went \nover the contents of that, even though she might not have had it in \nhand, with the President.\n  Also, circumstantially, there is a conversation between Mr. Jordan \nand the President during this time.\n  But in addition, let me just recall something I made in my \npresentation--that a few days before the President's deposition \ntestimony, that it was Michael Isikoff of a national publication\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\ncalled Betty Currie and asked about courier records on the gifts. This \nstartled Betty Currie, obviously, because the gifts at that point were \nunder her bed. As she recalled, she probably told the President that. \nAnd then second, she went to see Vernon Jordan about that issue.\n  All of that leads you to believe, clearly, that the President fully \nknew that when he went into the deposition on January 17, that he would \nbe asked time and time again about the specifics of his relationship \nwith Monica Lewinsky.\n\n  So I think that addresses part of that question.\n  Let me remark on what Mr. Ruff just said--I am just constantly \namazed--about our effort to interview witnesses, because yesterday Mr. \nRuff--I believe it was; it might have been Mr. Kendall; excuse me if I \nhave gotten the attribution wrong--but criticized us, saying they want \nto call witnesses but they have no clue what these witnesses would say. \nDo you recall that? That was the argument yesterday. And so, if we make \nan effort to determine what these witnesses would say, then we are \ncriticized for trying to find out what they would say.\n  So I think that again it is more convenient to talk about what the \nmanagers are doing, what the process is, rather than the facts of \nobstruction.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question to the White House counsel from \nSenator Kennedy:\n\n       Would you please respond to Manager Hyde's suggestion that \n     an acquittal would send a bad message to the children of the \n     country, and to Manager Hyde's statements regarding the \n     fairness of the process in the House of Representatives?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you for that question.\n  Children--what do we tell the children? Well, ladies and gentlemen of \nthe Senate, that is not an academic question for me and for my wife. I \nassume that is the case for many, many families all over this country. \nWe happen to have quite a few children, and they are very young; they \nare under 12. And we talk about what is going on here. We talk about \nhow important it is to tell the truth, and we talk about how wrong it \nwas for the President of the United States not to tell the truth. And \nwe think that we have learned a lot by going through that process. We \nhave talked about what President Clinton did and why it was wrong.\n  With all due respect to the chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, I and my wife--and I don't think many parents when they \nraise their children rely every day on messages or resolutions from the \nCongress of the United States to tell them that it is important to \nteach children the importance of truth telling.\n  I am a little bit disappointed in the inference of the argument that \nthose of us who oppose impeachment, for the reasons that you \nunderstand, somehow are sending a message that it is OK to kids not to \ntell the truth. I am a little bit disappointed in that argument, \nbecause I don't think that is the way the parents of this country feel. \nThat is certainly not the way I feel. And I don't believe that \nimpeachment is a question of what you tell your children about truth \ntelling. Of course you tell your children to tell the truth. Of course \nyou tell your children the difference between right and wrong. I am \nsurprised that it is an issue here.\n  The second part of your question, Senator: I went through that House \nof Representatives experience, and I must say that I was disappointed \nin it, because we had been promised bipartisanship. When the Office of \nIndependent Counsel sent its referral to the House of Representatives, \nWhite House counsel did not have access to that document before it was \nreleased to the world. When the Office of Independent Counsel sent its \n60,000 pages, 19 boxes of evidence, to the House of Representatives, we \nwere not given access, the way Members of the Judiciary Committee were, \nto all that material. We were given access to a very limited amount of \nmaterial in the course of that process. In fact, much of that material \nwe never had access to on behalf of the President.\n  We were disappointed that there was no actual discussion of the \nconstitutional standards for impeachment before they went forward to \nvote on an impeachment inquiry. We thought that was the cart before the \nhorse.\n  We were disappointed and we regretted that grand jury materials \nprovided with promises of confidentiality were dumped into the public \nwith salacious material, unfiltered by the House of Representatives and \nthe Judiciary Committee, and we saw party line vote after party line \nvote after party line vote over and over and over again in the \nJudiciary Committee. We were disappointed that the depositions went \nforward without our participation. We were disappointed there was no \ndefinition of the scope of the inquiry. We were disappointed that there \nwas no term of time, no limitation on either the scope or the time of \nthis inquiry. And we were disappointed that there was no adequate \nnotice of the charges.\n  There were two events that happened near the end of this process that \nI think were particularly disappointing to us. One was that while the \ndebate was underway on the House floor, Members of the House of \nRepresentatives were taken into the evidence room and shown evidence \nthat was not in this record, that had not been included in the \ndiscussion in the House Judiciary Committee, that had never been shown \nto counsel for the President, that was not in the referral and became a \nfactor in the decisionmaking at least of some Members of the House--\nunfairly so, I think.\n  And finally, we were disappointed that the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives were denied the right and the opportunity to vote for \ncensure. They were promised the right to vote their conscience. They \nwere told they could vote their conscience. And if they had been given \nthat right to vote their conscience, we may not be here today. We might \nhave had the resolution of censure and this thing might have been \nresolved, and that was the greatest disappointment of all.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Bennett, \nBrownback, Campbell, Hagel, Roth, Specter and McConnell to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Would each of the managers who have been prosecutors prior \n     to being elected to the House of Representatives please state \n     briefly whether he believes he would have sought an \n     indictment and obtained a conviction of an individual who had \n     engaged in the conduct of which the President is accused?\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, I know there are several, \nprobably not only at our table, but all across this Senate, who have \nhad some experience somewhere in prosecution of cases. I would just \nbriefly say that--and I think it has probably been said very well today \nmore eloquently than I will say it, not only from some of the people on \nour side, but even some of the people on the President's side have \ntalked about this same concept of justice and the rule of law--it is so \nimportant in our system of justice that the American people have \nconfidence in that.\n  And one of the ways that I found in my experience that confidence \nsometimes suffered were phone calls that occasionally you would receive \nwhere there had been an allegation that someone in an elected office or \nsome public official in particular had, allegedly again, committed a \ncrime or perhaps been charged with a crime with allegations of coverup \nbecause of who that person was--there was not equal justice out there, \npeople were being treated differently and specially. And that happens, \nthat comes with our territory. We are very visible people. Certainly \nthe President of the United States is the most visible of us.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, he is a role model for many people. \nAnd certainly when these kinds of allegations come up against the \nPresident, people raise these kinds of thoughts and complaints.\n  As a prosecutor, I would find this type of charge particularly of \nconcern not only because of the perjury, which is so important because, \nas I said earlier, too, truth underpins our whole system, but I find it \nequally compelling as a prosecutor that a person of this visibility, of \nthis responsibility not only commits a crime himself, but he brings \nsomeone else into that. He ensnares another person, actually other \npeople into this, the coverup, the obstruction part--Monica Lewinsky, \nBetty Currie, Vernon Jordan, all the White House people that we have \ntalked about. He brings other people into this and causes other people \nto\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\ncommit crimes. I would view that even more seriously because of the \nfact that he made other people commit types of crimes. And because of \nthat, I think as a prosecutor, were this another person, a John Doe of \nsome visibility, a local district attorney, a local mayor or someone \nlike that, there would be no doubt that the allegations would have to \ngo to court.\n  And I might add in line with this that we have heard of this \nselecting the President out of this process by saying, well, we should \nnot consider him like we would a Federal judge or like a general that \nwe are talking about maybe promoting to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nor a captain for promotion to major or really anyone else here. It \nalmost seems that--yes, he is different, but it almost seems that we \nwant to treat him like a king because he is the only person we have got \nhere, and because he is the only one, we can't look at him like a \nthousand judges or 200 generals or other public officials.\n  I think that is a fallacious argument. If the facts are there, no \nmatter if this man is the President, to me that is what the \nConstitution is about. I think they set up this process to avoid a king \nand a kingdom.\n  I will yield time to Mr. McCollum. \n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. I will be much briefer in answering that \nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  I served as a military judge advocate for 4 years on active duty, 20 \nmore years in the Reserves. I was a prosecutor, defense attorney and \nmilitary judge. I think this is a very compelling case on the evidence. \nI would never hesitate to take this to trial if I were prosecuting the \ncrimes of perjury, obstruction of justice, or any of the military \noffenses that might be included in here. But just on the criminal \ncharges which are in the UCMJ, I would certainly do so if given the \nopportunity for all the reasons and then some that Mr. Bryant gave.\n  Mr. Manager BARR. Mr. Chief Justice, to me this is not a hypothetical \nquestion in any sense of the word. As a United States attorney under \ntwo Presidents, I had the opportunity not only to contemplate bringing \nsuch cases based on the evidence and the law but actually having the \nresponsibility of carrying those cases out and prosecuting them, \nincluding a case that probably cost me a primary election in the \nRepublican Party for prosecuting a Member of Congress for precisely the \nactivity which brings us here today; that is, perjury, misleading a \ngrand jury.\n  So the answer to the question, Mr. Majority Leader, is not only yes \nbut absolutely yes.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I know we have run out of time. The facts and \nlaw support it, and the answer is yes. And may I add that Mr. Rogan who \nhas certainly prosecuted, Mr. Lindsey Graham, and Mr. Gekas, all \nwould--if you would like to join in that. Otherwise, we all would \naffirm that the answer is yes.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question to the President's counsel from \nSenators Boxer and Johnson.\n\n       The managers repeatedly assert that if the Senate acquits \n     President Clinton, the Senate will be making the statement \n     that the President of the United States should be held above \n     the law. If, as the managers concede, President Clinton may \n     be held accountable in court for the charges alleged in the \n     House articles regardless of the outcome of the Senate trial, \n     how could a Senate vote to acquit the President be \n     characterized as a vote to place him above the law?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I suppose the one quote that has been heard most \noften throughout these proceedings in the House and in this body is \nTheodore Roosevelt's, and I won't repeat it except to go to the heart \nof this question. The fact that we are having this trial in this \nChamber, the fact that we had an impeachment proceeding in the House, \nis itself part of our rule of law. The President is immersed in the \napplication of the rule of law at this very moment. And the rule of \nlaw, as I think my colleague, Ms. Mills, said, is neither a sword nor a \nshield, depending on your perspective. We are all subject to it and we \nlive with its outcome, if it is fair and is consistent with the system \nof justice that we have developed in the last 210 years.\n  And, so, the verdict here, if it is ``not guilty'' as I trust it will \nbe, or if this trial is ended appropriately through some other legal \nmotion or mechanism, as long as it is done within the rule of law, will \nhave met all of our obligations. And most importantly, it will have \nensured that the President is treated neither above nor below.\n  But certainly the one issue that is raised in this question is \nimportant to focus on, because this is not a situation in which the \nPresident walks away scot-free no matter what happens, not to mention \nthe personal pain and the pain that has been suffered in going through \nthis process. The President has said, and I have said on his behalf, \nthat he will not use his powers, or ask anyone else to use their \npowers, to protect him against the application of the rule of law. \nMoreover, just in case it has slipped anyone's mind--and it has \noccasionally been misstated in other forums--the statute that has \nallowed the independent counsel to pursue the President for the last 4-\nplus years specifically provides that he retains jurisdiction over the \nPresident for a year after the President has left office.\n  So there can be no argument that, oh, this will just fall into the \ncracks, or this will disappear into the ether somewhere. The President \nwill be at risk. We trust that reasonable judgments will be made and a \ndetermination will be reached that it is not appropriate to pursue him. \nBut that, too, will be pursued under the rule of law to which he is \nsubject.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Campbell, Hagel \nand Specter to the House managers:\n\n       White House counsel have several times asserted that the \n     grand jury perjury charge is just a ``he says, she says'' \n     case and that we cannot consider corroborating witnesses you \n     cite. What is it about the President's grand jury testimony \n     that convinces you he should be removed from office?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice, that question goes to the \nheart of what we are here about today. We have had a great deal of \ndiscussion about a lot of peripheral questions and issues, but the fact \nof the matter is, the simplest portion of this deals with grand jury \nperjury, and I assume the question principally is directed to the first \nof four points under the grand jury perjury article, because, for \nexample, the second point with respect to the President having the goal \nor the intent of being truthful--which he said he did in the grand jury \nin the Jones deposition--there isn't a ``he says, she says'' question.\n  That is just very simple. The President lied multiple times in that \ncivil deposition, and if he said in the grand jury to the grand jurors, \n``My goal was to be truthful,'' it is pretty self-evident that that was \na lie and he perjured himself. So that is not a ``he says, she says.''\n  But the question that the counsel over here has tried to bring up \nseveral times, saying the part with respect particularly to Monica \nLewinsky saying that the President touched her in certain parts of her \nbody which would have been covered by the Jones definition of sexual \nrelations, and the President who said explicitly in his grand jury \ntestimony, ``I didn't touch those parts,'' and, ``Yes, I agree that \nwould have been and is part of the definition of sexual relations in \nthe Jones case''--that is, whether you believe her or him, and they say \nthat is a ``he says, she says,'' and it is not.\n  But even if it were, you could listen to it and accept it. I think \nthere is some confusion about the law. The law of grand jury perjury \ndoes not require two witnesses. Nor does it require the corroborating \ntestimony of anybody else. It does not. That is why, in 1970, it was \nchanged, and most prosecutions today for perjury, including people who \nare in Federal prison today for perjury in civil cases for lying about \nmatters related to sex--and there are several, a couple of whom \ntestified before us in the Judiciary Committee during our process and \nhearings--are based upon that 1970 law that does not require any \ncorroboration.\n  In this case, you have Monica Lewinsky, who is a very credible \nwitness by other reasons, so that you don't even have to get to those \ncorroborating witnesses on those points. No. 1, she was under immunity \nunder the threat of prosecution when she testified that way. No. 2, she \nhas consistent statements throughout, many times over. She didn't say \nshe had sexual intercourse with him. She could have made that up, but \nshe didn't. Everything she says is believable about that portion of it. \nAnd third, and not\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\nlast in all of this, is that she did make very contemporaneous \nstatements to at least six other people who were her friends and \ncounselors, describing in detail exactly the same thing she testified \nto under oath before the grand jury in this respect.\n\n  Now they say, the counselors here, you can't consider that under the \nFederal Rules of Evidence because that is, presumably, hearsay. Well, \nthere are at least three exceptions to that hearsay rule which could be \nbrought out in a courtroom. They have gone about trying to carefully \nsay we have never said that Monica Lewinsky lied.\n  I remember, I think it was Mr. Kendall or maybe it was Mr. Craig up \nthere a little earlier, saying when asked that question, ``Did she lie \nin this instance or in any other?'' and they say it is just a different \nversion of the truth. If she is saying it as explicitly as she is about \nthis nine times or four times or whatever, and the President is saying \nI never did that, I don't see how they can fudge around, challenging \nher truthfulness and credibility.\n  That is what they have been doing. And in any courtroom I have ever \nbeen in, once that has occurred you can certainly bring in her prior \nconsistent statements, and you don't even have to go with the rules of \nevidence on this. You are not bound by those rules of evidence. And \ncommon sense says she had no motive to be lying to her friends in those \nnumerous telephone conversations or her meetings with her counselors \nwhen she described in detail these things the President says he didn't \ndo, because all of those statements occurred, all of those discussions \noccurred before she ever was knowingly on a witness list or likely to \nhave to testify in any other way.\n  She is very credible. Those prior consistent statements are very \nbelievable, and I submit to you they would be admissible in a court in \nthe kind of contest that would be involved in a situation like this. It \ngoes to the very heart of what we are here about--grand jury perjury, \nthe simplest, clearest one. The President lied. Monica Lewinsky told \nthe truth about it. And it is profound and it is important and it is \ncritical to this case. And that is the principal one of the perjuries \nthat we have been drawing your attention to because it is so clear. \nThank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Dorgan to counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       How can the House claim that its function is accusatory \n     only, when the articles it voted call for the President's \n     removal?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. This, of course, takes us back to the very heart of \nthe argument that raged for a small time here yesterday and on previous \ndays, the notion that the House of Representatives viewed itself during \nthe month of December as merely--I won't even say that it rose in their \nmind to the level of an accusatory body that we would think of when we \nthink of the grand jury, but to a body whose job it was, as one of the \nmanagers said at one point, simply to find probable cause to believe \nthat the President had committed these acts.\n  Perhaps there has been some extraordinary transposition from the mood \nand the tenor of the comments made during those days when the Judiciary \nCommittee was doing its work to the days when these managers have \nappeared in the well of the Senate, something that has transformed the \nmere probable cause screening finding that they allegedly viewed as the \nrole of the House and the Judiciary Committee into the certainty that \nyou hear today.\n  It is a good question, as to how, then, given the role they saw for \nthemselves, they could go so far, not only to seek the removal of the \nPresident but, indeed, to add in all their prosecutorial vigor \nsomething that has never been sought before, a bar against holding any \nfuture office, at the level of certainty that they must have achieved \ngiven the standard that they held themselves to. What happened between \nDecember 19 and today that allows these managers to come before you not \nsaying, ``Well, we were certain then and we're more certain now,'' or \n``We only found probable cause back in 1998, but in 1999 we are \nsufficiently certain that we ought to shut down the public will as \nexpressed in the elections of 1996.''\n\n  I haven't yet found an answer to that question.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Bond, Brownback, \nCampbell, Hagel, Lugar, Hutchison of Texas, Roth and Stevens. It is \ndirected to the House managers:\n\n       After everything you have heard over the last several weeks \n     from the President's counsel, do you still believe that the \n     facts support the charges of obstruction of justice alleged \n     in the articles of impeachment? Specifically, what \n     allegations of improper conduct has the President's counsel \n     failed to undermine?\n\n  The question is also from Senators Specter and McConnell.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, \nwhy is obstruction of justice important to begin with? I think back on \nan opportunity I had at a hearing once to question a member of the \nColombian drug cartel. I asked him: ``What is the greatest weapon that \nlaw enforcement has that you fear?''\n  His answer was very quickly, ``Extradition.''\n  I said, ``Explain. Why is extradition feared?''\n  He said, ``Because in Colombia, you can fix the system, but in \nAmerica you can't.''\n  That is why I think the obstruction of justice charge is so important \nto the administration of justice. Money, position, power does not \ncorrupt, should not corrupt the administration of justice.\n  The question is, Where has the President attacked, counselors \nattacked credibly the allegations of obstruction? The first one is that \nthe President personally encouraged a witness, Monica Lewinsky, to lie. \nThis is on December 17 at 2 a.m. in the morning when the President \ncalls Monica to tell her that she is a witness on the list--2 a.m. in \nthe morning. At that time, of course, she is nervous, she is a witness \nand asked, ``Well, what am I going to say?'' And the President offers, \naccording to Monica Lewinsky, you can always say you came to see Betty \nor you came to deliver papers.\n  The President's counselor attacked this by saying, ``Well, remember \nwhat Monica said, `I was never told to lie.' '' I refer you to a Tenth \nCircuit case, United States v. Tranakos, Tenth Circuit, 1990. The law \nis that the request to lie need not be a direct statement. As the court \nheld:\n\n       The statute prohibits elliptical suggestions as much as it \n     does direct commands.\n\n  That is common sense. That is logic. That is what a jury applies--\ncommon sense. And here, of course, in this case, Monica Lewinsky \ntestified that she was told, in essence, to lie. The President didn't \nsay, ``Monica, I need you to go in and lie for me.'' He told her the \ncover story in a legal context that she could use that would cover for \nhim that, in essence, would be a lie. We all know that is what it is.\n  Of course, the President says--well, he denies that. Of course, he \nsaid, I never told her to use the cover stories in a legal context, \ndirectly in conflict, but clearly the President's counselors have not \nattacked that obstruction of justice.\n  The second one is the jobs and the false affidavit. They say there is \nabsolutely no connection in these two, none whatsoever. Of course, I \npointed out the testimony of Vernon Jordan who testified it doesn't \ntake an Einstein to know that whenever he found out she was a witness, \nshe was under subpoena, that the subpoena changed the circumstances. \nThat is the testimony of Vernon Jordan. They say there is no \nconnection. Vernon Jordan, the President's friend, says the \ncircumstances change whenever you are talking about getting a job with \nsomebody who is also under subpoena in a case that is very important to \nthe President of the United States.\n  Of course, Vernon Jordan also indicated the President's personal \ninvolvement when he testified before the grand jury in June. He said he \nwas interested in this matter: ``He''--referring to the President--\n``was the source of it coming to my attention in the first place.''\n  He further testified: ``The President asked me to get Monica Lewinsky \na job.''\n  The President was personally involved in the obtaining of a job. He \nwas personally concerned about the false affidavit, and Vernon Jordan \nacknowledges that when those are combined, the circumstances are \ndifferent.\n  The third area of obstruction is tampering with the witness, Betty \nCurrie,\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\non January 18 and January 20 when the questions were posed after the \ndeposition. The President's counselor challenged this and said, Well, \nshe wasn't a witness. Even the Jones lawyers never had any clue that \nshe was going to be a witness in this case. The President couldn't know \nthat she was going to be a witness.\n\n  They hoped that we would never find the subpoena, because Mr. Ruff \nmade that statement early on, which he very professionally expressed \nregret that he made that misrepresentation, but we found the subpoena. \nWe found the subpoena that was actually issued a few days after the \ndeposition for Betty Currie. She was a witness; she was not just a \nprospective witness. She was there, she had to be ready to go and the \nPresident knew this and the Jones lawyer knew it. So that stands. The \npillar of obstruction stands.\n  The false statements to the grand jury--that has been covered. There \nhas never been any holes that have been poked into that, but it was to \ncontinue the coverup of the false statements that were made in the \ncivil rights case.\n  Another area of obstruction was December 28 when the gifts were \nretrieved, and this has been challenged. I will admit, as I always \nhave, that there is a dispute in the testimony. But I believe the case \nis made through the circumstances, the motivation, the testimony of \nMonica Lewinsky as to what Betty Currie said when she called and the \ncorroborating evidence. I don't believe they have poked a hole in that. \nI believe it stands. We would like to hear the witnesses to make you \nfeel more comfortable in resolving that conflict and determine the \ncredibility of those witnesses.\n  But the gifts that were subpoenaed were evidence in a trial; they \nwere needed in a civil rights case. The President knew they were under \nsubpoena; he had the most to gain, and they were retrieved. And I \nbelieve the testimony indicates that it was based upon the actions of \nBetty Currie that would have been directed by the President.\n  There are other areas of obstruction, including the President \nallowing his attorney, Robert Bennett, to make false representations to \nthe Federal district judge in the deposition. The President's defense \nis that there is no proof whatsoever that he was paying any attention. \nWe offered the videotape that shows he is believed to be looking at the \nattorney, but we would offer a witness in that regard to show that he \nwas attentive. That is simply something that can be substantiated.\n  We believe that you can evaluate that, that he was paying attention, \nbut that is an element of obstruction because he was allowing his \nattorney to make a false representation to the court that was totally \nuntrue, that would aid in the coverup and that was presented.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Hutchinson, I think you have answered the \nquestion.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Levin to counsel \nfor the White House:\n\n       In their brief to the Senate, the House managers said that \n     there was ``no urgency'' to help Ms. Lewinsky until December \n     11, 1997, and that on that day ``sudden interest was \n     inspired'' by a court order, which the House managers had \n     represented was issued in the morning of December 11, before \n     the Vernon Jordan/Monica Lewinsky meeting that afternoon.\n       It took some doing yesterday to get the House managers to \n     finally acknowledge that the court order was not issued in \n     the morning, but in the afternoon of December 11. Why were \n     the House managers so reluctant to make that acknowledgment?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, well, I think they were \nreluctant to make the acknowledgement because they were in cement due \nto their trial brief, which at page 20, as the question indicates, \nsaid, as to this particular time period after the December 6 meeting, \n``There was obviously''--there was obviously--``still no urgency to \nhelp Ms. Lewinsky.'' They thought that they had a chronology that was \nconsistent with the inference of causation. But when you look at the \ntrue time of the events, that dissolves.\n  Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson used a word repeatedly, a phrase I would \nlike to call your attention to, as he was summarizing the evidence. He \nused the phrase: ``In essence.'' Now, that is another phrase that is \nkind of a weasel word. When you hear that, it means that the evidence \nisn't really quite there, but if you look at the big picture maybe you \ncan see what is there ``in essence.'' It doesn't work here. It doesn't \nwork because of the evidence.\n  Just a week ago, Mr. Manager Hutchinson, on this obstruction of \njustice question, was asked very clearly: ``On the case that you have \nagainst the President on obstruction of justice, not the perjury, would \nyou be confident of a conviction in a criminal court?'' And he said, \n``No, I would not.''\n  Now, I am not going to walk through each and every element that he \nidentified. I think we have repeatedly dealt with them. And I am not \ngoing to step on your patience to do that again each time.\n  I would like to make two points. That is, in terms of encouraging Ms. \nLewinsky to lie, were these cover stories an attempt to encourage her \nto lie? As I tried to indicate, there is testimony in the record that \nat a certain time in the relation these cover stories were discussed. \nThere is not any evidence, however, from Ms. Lewinsky, the President, \nor anyone else, that these were discussed in connection with the \ntestimony, in connection with the affidavit. You remember Ms. Lewinsky, \nwhen asked if she could exclude that possibility, said, ``I pretty much \ncan.''\n  Now, the testimony that Mr. Hutchinson mentioned with Mr. Jordan on \nDecember 19, you remember he quoted Mr. Jordan. He said the discovery \nof the subpoena at that point changed the circumstances. Well, it did, \nbut just in the opposite way that Mr. Manager Hutchinson would have you \ninfer, because when Mr. Jordan discovered, on December 19, that Ms. \nLewinsky had a subpoena, was going to testify in the Jones case as a \nwitness, unless she could get it quashed, he went to her and went to \nthe President to seek assurance that the job assistance he was engaging \nin could not at any time be said to be improper because of the presence \nof an improper relationship. Both parties assured him there was no such \nrelationship. This observation by Mr. Jordan cuts just the opposite \nway.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I do have another question I will send \nto the desk momentarily, but I would like for the Senators to know that \nwe have had some 104 or 105 questions now that have been asked. I \nbelieve that is correct--104. Senator Daschle and I conferred. We want \nto thank the Senators for their participation and their questions. We \ndo want to make it clear we are not seeking questions. (Laughter.)\n\n  So don't feel like you need to help us by sending them down. But \nunder your rights as Senators, under the Senate Resolution 16 and the \nrules we are proceeding under, every and each Senator is entitled to \nsubmit a question if he or she feels it is important, but I hope that \nit will be one that you think really is essential that has not been \ntouched on somewhere already in the answers to the questions and also \nwould hope--and that the Record be made clear--that we, in a bipartisan \nway, have tried very hard to make sure that this proceeding here and \nthe question period, and all we have done, has been fair both to the \nPresident's counsel and the House managers. And we will continue to \nwork in that vein.\n  With that observation, and if we do need to continue going forward \nwith questions, we would have to give some consideration of taking a \nbreak and going longer, although I had indicated I hoped we could quit \nat 4. Maybe after this question and, if necessary, one or two more, we \ncould end for the day and then get together and see if we need more \ntime on Monday for additional questions.\n  I send the next question to the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Cochran, Roth, \nCampbell and Frist to the House managers:\n\n       The President's counsel has suggested that the Senate has \n     considered a ``good behavior'' standard in impeachment cases \n     involving Federal judges. The removal of judges seems to have \n     been based by the Senate on the impeachment power whose \n     standard for removal is the same for both Federal judges and \n     executive branch officials. Is the counsel for the President \n     asking us to use a different test for removal of this \n     President than we\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\n     did in the case of Judge Walter Nixon? Please explain.\n\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I \nappreciate the opportunity to answer this question. It is an important \nquestion. And it is true that counsel for the President are asking that \nyou use a different standard in this case than the standard you have \nalready established, not in just one case but, in fact, in a series of \ncases involving Federal judges who were before the Senate in the 1980s. \nThere was a succession of three cases in the Senate, all dealing with \nthe question of whether a Federal judge who had lied under oath should \nbe removed from office because the Federal judge had lied under oath. \nIn all three cases, the Senate decided that the Federal judge should be \nconvicted and removed.\n  Now, the President's counsel have the burden of establishing that \nthose recent and very clear precedents of the Senate should not apply \nto this case where the President is charged with lying under oath. And \nthey attempt to do that in a number of ways. But I would suggest, as \nyou evaluate their attempt to distinguish away those precedents, that \nyou look first and last to the Constitution.\n  The Constitution should be your guide. And I would suggest to you \nthat there is nothing in the Constitution which establishes a different \nstandard for the President--for any reason. There is not something in \nthe Constitution that says he is subject to a different standard \nbecause he is elected. That argument had been advanced. If you look in \nthe Constitution, you simply will not find that. And to argue for a \ndifferent standard because the President is elected, I would submit to \nyou, is to impose something on the Constitution that is entirely alien \nto the document itself.\n  The Constitution contains a single standard for the application of \nthe impeachment and removal power. I have read it before, but I will \nread it again. Article II, section 4 provides:\n\n       The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the \n     United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n  Now, reference was made in the question, and reference has been made \nby the President's counsel, to the good behavior clause. That is found \nin article III, section 1. That clause does not alter the standard I \nhave just read to you, however. Rather than creating an altered \nstandard for removal of Federal judges, the good behavior clause merely \nestablishes that the term of office for judicial officers is life.\n  Now, I wouldn't ask you to take my word for this. Let me refer again \nto the 1974 report by the staff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry. There \nthey asked the question: ``Does Article III, Section 1 of the \nConstitution, which states that judges `shall hold their Offices during \ngood Behaviour,' limit the relevance of the. . .impeachments of judges \nwith respect to presidential impeachment standards as has been argued \nby some?'' That is essentially the question before the Senate now. \nTheir answer was: ``It does not.'' It does not. ``. . .the only \nimpeachment provision''--they go on to say--``discussed in the \n[Constitutional] Convention and [indeed]. . .in the Constitution is \nArticle II, Section 4, which by its expressed terms, applies to all \ncivil officers, including judges. . .''\n  Now, I would go on to note, it is very interesting that at the \nConstitutional Convention, on August 27, 1787, an attempt was made to \namend the good behavior clause by adding a provision for the removal of \njudges by the executive on the application by the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. Now, this proposal, which was offered by John \nDickinson, was based on the English parliamentary practice of removal \nof judges by address, a practice also utilized by several American \nStates. And under this process, judges could be removed for misconduct, \nfalling short of the level of seriousness that would justify \nimpeachment.\n  Now, the proposal offered by Dickinson was overwhelmingly rejected. \nIt was overwhelmingly rejected by the Convention. Thus, the sole \nprovision for removal and the sole standard for removal is that which I \nhave referred to in article II, section (4).\n\n  Now, mention has been made, and I want to respond to this, because \nmention has been made of efforts of Congress to establish a separate \nprocedure for the removal of Federal judges, a procedure separate and \napart from the impeachment and removal process.\n  Specific mention has also been made of testimony given in 1970 by the \nChief Justice, who was then an assistant attorney general, regarding a \nproposal to establish a separate removal procedure. The testimony given \nby the Chief Justice at that time related to the constitutionality of \nthe provisions of the bill relating to the removal of judges by methods \nother than impeachment.\n  Now, my own view, quite candidly, is that such a removal procedure \nraises serious constitutional questions--serious questions about \nmaintaining the independence of the judiciary. Putting that question \naside, and regardless of the standards that might be applied in such a \nseparate removal procedure, it is clear that the single constitutional \nstandard for impeachment and removal would remain the same. That is \nwhat is in the Constitution. That can't be changed by any statute or \nanything set up apart from the constitutional procedures.\n  Now, one thing I want to say as I move toward concluding my response: \nIt should be recognized that some specific acts might be a breach of \nduty if done by a judge but not a breach of duty if done by the \nPresident of the United States. That is an important distinction that \nwe all should bear in mind. For example, it would be serious misconduct \nfor a judge to engage in repeated ex parte meetings with parties who \nhave an interest in a matter pending before that judge; but it is \ntypical for the President to engage in such ex parte meetings with \npersons who have an interest in matters on which he will decide. For a \njudge, such conduct constitutes a breach of duty; for the President, it \ndoes not constitute a breach of duty.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Canady, I think you have answered the \nquestion.\n  This question from Senator Harkin is to counsel for the President:\n\n       There are three contradictions in the record: One, who \n     touched whom on what parts of the body; two, when the \n     relationship began; three, who called whom to get the gifts, \n     Ms. Currie or Ms. Lewinsky.\n       How will these witnesses clear up the contradiction?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Harkin, it is difficult \nfor me to explain how, after you have gotten 19 interviews, 2 grand \njury appearances, and 1 deposition to cover that precise territory, any \nfurther kind of inquiry along those lines would be of any help.\n  The House managers have argued that they need to call witnesses for \nthe purposes of resolving inconsistencies, conflicts, and discrepancies \nin testimony. And they have, in fact, identified Monica Lewinsky in \nparticular as having given testimony in conflict with the testimony of \nthe President, with Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan.\n  But it would be well to remember that the lawyers for the Office of \nIndependent Counsel certainly are not seeking to elicit testimony that \nis favorable to the President, that those lawyers have already done a \ngreat deal of this precise kind of inquiry at some great length. Those \nlawyers--no friends of the President--have already explored \ninconsistencies, they have already tested memory, they have already \nlaboriously and at great length subjected these witnesses to searching \nscrutiny, and their work is available for all to see in the record of \nthis case before the Senate today.\n\n  Let me be very specific and very concrete. Monica Lewinsky was \ninterviewed by the lawyers for the Office of Independent Counsel or \ntestified before the grand jury on 20 different occasions after Betty \nCurrie and Vernon Jordan had given their testimony before the grand \njury. And contrary to the assertions of the House managers, Monica \nLewinsky was interviewed six times and testified twice--one time before \nthe grand jury and once in a sworn deposition after the President had \ngiven his testimony before the grand jury on August 17.\n  On August 19, she was interviewed by the FBI and by lawyers for the \nspecial counsel. She testified before the grand jury--Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified before the grand jury on August 20. She was interviewed by \nlawyers and FBI agents for the independent counsel on August 24. She \nwas interviewed on August 26. She\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\nappeared for a deposition held in the conference room of the Office of \nIndependent Counsel on August 26. She was interviewed pursuant to her \nimmunity agreement with independent counsel and FBI agents on September \n5. She was also interviewed--excuse me; that was September 3. She \nappeared and listened to tapes with the FBI present on many occasions \nduring the period September 3 through September 6. She appeared and was \ninterviewed by special counsel, independent counsel, on September 7 and \nSeptember 5 and September 6.\n  So it raises a question as to whether or not the desire to interview \nMonica Lewinsky stems from a desire to resolve conflicts that she has \nwith other people, because certainly these occasions gave the lawyers \nfor the independent counsel an opportunity to do so.\n  I would simply submit that within the bounds of ethical behavior, I \nam sure, because I respect the professionalism of the House managers, \nbut I would suspect that one of the reasons they want to inquire of Ms. \nLewinsky is not to resolve discrepancies and disputes, it is to perhaps \nchallenge her testimony when it is helpful to the President and perhaps \nbolster her testimony when it is not helpful to the President. The \nHouse managers are not neutral investigators, they are neutral \ninterrogators.\n  It raises questions about what the managers' true purpose is in \ncalling Vernon Jordan and Betty Currie forward as witnesses, what they \nwant to inquire about if they conduct an interview of them. I suggest \nthat this is also a bit of a fishing expedition, looking for evidence \nthat will be damaging to the President.\n  We are not afraid of witnesses, but we do want fairness, and we don't \nthink it is fair in this process. If you are going to have a real \ntrial, then we want to have a real defense, and to have a real defense \nrequires real discovery and real opportunity to have access to \ndocuments and witnesses and evidence that has been in the custody and \nthe control of the House of Representatives, that has never been made \navailable to us, that is in the custody and control of the Office of \nIndependent Counsel, that has not been made available to us.\n  I suggest, as we have seen from the statements made by the managers \nto this body yesterday and today about Vernon Jordan suggesting--\nactually suggesting that he did not tell the truth when he testified \nnumerous times before the grand jury, which is an outrageous \nsuggestion, and suggesting, which happened today--implying that he \ndestroyed evidence, which not even the independent counsel had \nsuggested, they seek to do nothing more than to attack, attack, attack \nthe best friend of the United States, the President of the United \nStates, and his personal secretary.\n  That is the reason they want to talk to these people. I think it is \nan improper reason. It is wanting to win too much. I don't think the \nU.S. Senate should be part of it.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Hagel, Abraham, and \nHatch to the House managers:\n\n       White House counsel has indicated their opposition to \n     calling witnesses, asserting that calling witnesses would not \n     shed light on the facts and would unnecessarily prolong the \n     proceedings. But it is the responsibility of the Senate to \n     find the truth. And if any Senators reasonably believe that \n     hearing witnesses would assist in finding the truth, why \n     shouldn't they be called?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  ``Methinks thou doth protest too much.'' I think that is what White \nHouse counsel has been doing. I don't know why, but they, frankly, \ndon't want witnesses. They don't want what you normally have in a \ntrial. We can paint this with any kinds of colors you want to have, but \na trial without witnesses, when it involves a criminal accusation, a \ncriminal matter, is not a true trial; it really isn't. It is not what I \nthink of, and I guarantee it is not what any of my friends sitting over \nhere who have been counsel, prosecutors and defense lawyers, think of. \nIt is remotely conceivable, but certainly not where you have had the \ninferences and the conclusions that we draw logically from the entire \nsequence of events that are painted from the very day when the \nPresident got word of Monica Lewinsky being on the witness list, and \nall the way through his testimony in the Jones case, all the way \nthrough the grand jury testimony, when they challenge every inference \nthat you should logically draw from the record, and then suggest that, \noh, but we should not have anybody in here; so you who are going to \njudge ultimately whether our representations are persuasive or not \nabout those inferences, whether you should be able to judge--and I \nthink you should--what the witnesses actually are saying.\n  I will give you one illustration. I don't know how many times--two or \nthree times--I put up here on the board, or I have said to you--and I \nknow a couple of my colleagues said to you--that during the discussion \nwith regard to the affidavit that Monica Lewinsky had in front of the \ngrand jury, she explicitly said: No, the President didn't tell me to \nlie, but he didn't discourage me either. He didn't encourage me or \ndiscourage me.\n  You need to have her say that to you. They have even been whacking \naway at that, confusing everything they can, talking about the job \nsearches at the same time they are talking about the affidavit, what \nshe said here, there, or anywhere else. Witnesses are a logical thing. \nThere are a lot of conflicts that are here.\n  When we get to the point--which we presume we will get that \nopportunity to do--to argue our case on why we should have witnesses, \nmaybe Monday or perhaps Tuesday--I think that even though you have a \nmotion to dismiss, we will get that chance--we will lay out a lot of \nthese things. There are a lot of them out there. But the point is, \noverall, you need to have the witnesses to judge what any trier of fact \njudges about any one of these.\n  I would be happy to yield to Mr. Graham or Mr. Rogan if they wish--\nneither one. That is fair enough.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, it now approaches the hour that we had \nindicated we would conclude our work on Saturday. There may still be \nsome questions that Senators would like to have offered. I have talked \nto Senator Daschle.\n\n  One suggestion made is that maybe on Monday we would ask that \nquestions could be submitted for the Record in writing. I think that is \na common practice. We don't want to cut it off. At this point, I would \nnot be prepared to do that. But I would like to suggest that we go \nahead and conclude our business today, and if there is a need by a \nSenator on either side to have another question, or two or three, we \nwill certainly consult with each other and see how we can handle that, \nperhaps on Monday, and even see if it would be appropriate to prepare a \nmotion with regard to being able to submit questions for the Record, \nwhich would be answered. We would not want to abuse that and cause that \nto be a protracted process.\n  In view of the time spent here--in fact, we have had around 106 \nquestions, and we are about 10 hours into this now--I think we should \nconclude for this Saturday. We will resume at 1 p.m. on Monday and \ncontinue in accordance with the provisions of S. Res. 16. I will update \nall Members as to the specific schedule when it becomes clear.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that in the Record following \ntoday's proceedings there appear a period of morning business to \naccommodate bills and statements that have been submitted during the \nday by Senators. I thank my colleagues for their attentiveness during \nthe proceedings.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/23/senate-section/article/S933-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S956-S957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.

Mr. President, in the past several months, through \nthe Leader's Lecture Series, we have been honored to hear from some of \nAmerica's most outstanding leaders. Speaking just down the hall in the \nstately Old Senate Chamber, these distinguished guests have shared \nrecollections and observations of life in the Senate, in politics, in \nthis great country. Their imparted wisdom allows us not only to add to \nthe historical archive of this institution, but also to gain \nperspective on our own roles here. As sponsor of the series and a \nstudent of recent history, I am especially appreciative of their \nparticipation.\n  At the conclusion of each Congress, the Senate will publish the \ncollected addresses of these respected speakers and make them available \nto the public. But their words should be recorded prior to that time. \nFor this reason, Mr. President, I now request that the presentations of \nour most recent lectures--former President George Bush, who was here \nWednesday night, and Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who spoke in \nthe fall--be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd: The Senate's Historic Role in \n                            Times of Crisis\n\n       Clio being my favorite muse, let me begin this evening with \n     a look backward over the well traveled road of history. \n     History always turns our faces backward, and this is as it \n     should be, so that we might be better informed and prepared \n     to exercise wisdom in dealing with future events.\n       ``To be ignorant of what happened before you were born,'' \n     admonished Cicero, ``is to remain always a child.''\n       So, for a little while, as we meet together in this \n     hallowed place, let us turn our faces backward.\n       Look about you. We meet tonight in the Senate Chamber. Not \n     the Chamber in which we do business each day, but the Old \n     Senate Chamber where our predecessors wrote the laws before \n     the Civil War. Here, in this room, Daniel Webster orated, \n     Henry Clay forged compromises, and John C. Calhoun stood on \n     principle. Here, Henry Foote of Mississippi pulled a pistol \n     on Thomas Benton of Missouri. Senator Benton ripped open his \n     coat, puffed out his chest, and shouted, ``Stand out of the \n     way and let the assassin fire!'' Here the eccentric Virginia \n     Senator John Randolph brought his hunting dogs into the \n     Chamber, and the dashing Texas Senator, Sam Houston, sat at \n     his desk whittling hearts for ladies in the gallery. Here, \n     seated at his desk in the back row, Massachusetts Senator \n     Charles Sumner was beaten violently over the head with a cane \n     wielded by Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina, \n     who objected to Sumner's strongly abolitionist speeches and \n     the vituperation that he had heaped upon Brooks' uncle, \n     Senator Butler of South Carolina.\n       The Senate first met here in 1810, but, because our British \n     cousins chose to set fire to the Capitol during the War of \n     1812, Congress was forced to move into the Patent Office \n     Building in downtown Washington, and later into a building \n     known as the Brick Capitol, located on the present site of \n     the Supreme Court Building. Hence, it was December 1819 \n     before Senators were able to return to this restored and \n     elegant Chamber. They met here for 40 years, and it was \n     during that exhilarating period that the Senate \n     experienced its ``Golden Age.''\n       Here, in this room, the Senate tried to deal with the \n     emotional and destructive issue of slavery by passing the \n     Missouri Compromise of 1820. That act drew a line across the \n     United States, and asserted that the peculiar institution of \n     slavery should remain to the south of the line and not spread \n     to the north. The Missouri Compromise also set the precedent \n     that for every slave state admitted to the Union, a free \n     state should be admitted as well, and vice versa. What this \n     meant in practical political terms, was that the North and \n     the South would be exactly equal in voting strength in the \n     Senate, and that any settlement of the explosive issue of \n     slavery would have to originate in the Senate. As a result, \n     the nation's most talented and ambitious legislators began to \n     leave the House of Representatives to take seats in the \n     Senate. Here, they fought to hold the Union together through \n     the omnibus compromise of 1850, only to overturn these \n     efforts by passing the fateful Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.\n       The Senators moved out of this room in 1859, on the eve of \n     the Civil War. When they marched in procession from this \n     Chamber to the current Chamber, it marked the last time that \n     leaders of the North and South would march together. The next \n     year, the South seceded and Senators who had walked shoulder \n     to shoulder here became military officers and political \n     leaders of the Union and of the Confederacy.\n       This old Chamber that they left behind is not just a \n     smaller version of the current Chamber. Here the center aisle \n     divides the two parties, but there are an equal number of \n     desks on either side, not because the two parties were evenly \n     divided but because there was not room to move desks back and \n     forth depending on the size of the majority, as we do today. \n     That meant that some members of the majority party had to sit \n     with members of the minority. It did not matter to them. The \n     two desks in the front row on the center aisle were not \n     reserved for the majority and minority leaders as they are \n     now, because there were no party floor leaders. No Senator \n     spoke for his party; every Senator spoke for himself. There \n     were recognized leaders among the Senators, but only \n     unofficially. Everyone knew, for example, that Henry Clay led \n     the Whigs, but he would never claim that honor. Clay \n     generally sat in the last row at the far end of the Chamber.\n       The Senate left this Chamber because it outgrew the space. \n     When they first met here in 1810 there were 32 Senators. So \n     many states were added over the next four decades that when \n     they left in 1859, there were 64 Senators. Yet, while the \n     Senate had increased in size, it was essentially the same \n     institution that the Founders had created in the \n     Constitution. Today, another century and four decades later, \n     and having grown to 100 Senators, it is still essentially the \n     same institution. The actors have changed; the issues have \n     changed; but the Senate, which emerged from the Great \n     Compromise of July 16, 1787, remains the great forum of the \n     states.\n       This is so, largely, because as a nation, we were fortunate \n     to have wise, cautious people draft and implement our \n     Constitution. They were pragmatists rather than idealists. \n     James Madison, particularly, had a shrewd view of human \n     nature. He did not believe in man's perfectability. \n     He assumed that those who achieved power would always try \n     to amass more power and that political factions would \n     always compete out of self-interest. In The Federalist \n     Papers, Madison reasoned that ``in framing a government \n     which is to be administered by men over men, the great \n     difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and, in the next \n     place, oblige it to control itself.'' Madison and other \n     framers of the Constitution divided power so that no one \n     person or branch of government could gain complete power. \n     As Madison explained it: ``Ambition must be made to \n     counteract ambition.''\n       However, ambition has not always counteracted ambition, as \n     we saw in the enactment by Congress of the line item veto in \n     1996. Just as the Roman Senate ceded its power over the purse \n     to the Roman dictators, Sulla and Caesar, and to the later \n     emperors, thus surrendering its power to check tyranny, so \n     did the American Congress, the Senate included. By passing \n     the Line Item Veto Act the Congress surrendered its control \n     over the purse, control which had been vested by the \n     Constitution in the legislative branch.\n       This brings me to the first point that I would like to \n     leave with you this evening. It is this: the legislative \n     branch must be eternally vigilant over the powers and \n     authorities vested in it by the Constitution. This is vitally \n     important to the security of our constitutional system of \n     checks and balances and separation of powers. George \n     Washington, in his Farewell Address of September 17, 1796, \n     emphasized the importance of such vigilance:\n       ``It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in \n     a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with \n     its administration to confine themselves within their \n     respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise \n     of the powers of one department, to encroach upon another. \n     The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of \n     all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the \n     form of government, a real despotism. . . . The necessity of \n     reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by \n     dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and \n     constituting each the guardian of the public weal against \n     invasions of the others, has been evinced by experiments \n     ancient and modern. . . . To preserve them must be as \n     necessary as to institute them.''\n       Each Member of this body must be ever mindful of the \n     fundamental duty to uphold the institutional prerogatives of \n     the Senate if we are to preserve the vital balance which \n     Washington so eloquently endorsed.\n       During my 46 years in Congress, and particularly in more \n     recent years, I have seen an inclination on the part of many \n     legislators in both parties to regard a chief executive in a \n     role more elevated than the framers of the Constitution \n     intended. We, as legislators, have a responsibility to work \n     with the chief executive, but it is intended to be a two-way \n     street. The Framers did not envision the office of President \n     as having the attributes of royalty. We must recognize the \n     heavy burden that any President bears, and wherever and \n     whenever we can, we must cooperate with the chief executive \n     in the interest of all the people. But let us keep in mind \n     Madison's admonition: ``Ambition must be made to counteract \n     ambition.''\n       As Majority Leader in the Senate during the Carter years, I \n     worked hard to help President Carter to enact his programs. \n     But I publicly stated that I was not the ``President's man''; \n     I was a Senate man. For example, in July 1977, I opposed \n     President Carter's plan to sell the AWACS (Airborne Warning \n     and Control System) to Iran. Iran was then a military ally of \n     the United States, but I was troubled over the potential \n     security risks involved and the possibility of compromising\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\n     highly sophisticated technology in that volatile region. I \n     was concerned that the sale ran contrary to our national \n     interests in maintaining a stable military balance and \n     limited arms proliferation in the Middle East. Both Houses of \n     Congress had to vote disapproval resolutions to stop the \n     sale. I enlisted the support of the Republican Minority \n     Leader, Howard Baker. Senator Baker was someone who could \n     rise above political party when he believed that the national \n     interests required it, just as he did during the Panama Canal \n     debate. The Carter Administration chose to withdraw the sale \n     of AWACS temporarily. Shortly afterwards, the Iranian \n     Revolution occurred and the Shah was deposed. Had the sale \n     gone through as planned, those sophisticated aircraft would \n     have fallen into the hands of an unfriendly government. As so \n     often has happened in our history, individual courage and \n     character again charted our course.\n       This brings me to my second point. On the great issues, the \n     Senate has always been blessed with Senators who were able to \n     rise above party, and consider first and foremost the \n     national interest. There are worthy examples in Senate \n     history.\n       When I came to the Senate in 1959, artists were at work \n     painting five porthole portraits in the Senate reception \n     room. The Senate had appointed a special Committee chaired by \n     Senator John F. Kennedy to select the five most significant \n     Senators in Senate history. This was no easy task, because \n     there were many potential candidates. In setting the \n     criteria, the Committee looked to Senators who had stood firm \n     for principle, who had not blown with the prevailing \n     political winds, and who had made personal sacrifices for the \n     national good. They were not saints or perfect men. Daniel \n     Webster's personal financial dealings left an eternal blot on \n     his record; yet, he deserved to have his portrait in the \n     Senate reception room, not simply as a great orator but as a \n     man who sacrificed his own political standing by endorsing \n     the compromise of 1850, which was deeply unpopular in his \n     home state of Massachusetts, but which he realized was the \n     best chance to hold the Union together.\n       In my almost 46 years in Congress, I have seen other \n     courageous Senators. I have already referred to the courage \n     demonstrated by former Senator Howard Baker during the Panama \n     Canal debates. Without Senator Baker's support, the Panama \n     Canal Treaties would never have been approved by the Senate. \n     The killing of American servicemen in Panama would have gone \n     on, but Senator Baker threw his shoulder behind the wheel and \n     helped to construct what he and I referred to as leadership \n     amendments, amendments which protected U.S. interests in that \n     region, and we both worked shoulder to shoulder against great \n     odds, as indicated by the polls. We did so because we \n     believed, after careful study, that the Treaties were in the \n     best interests of the United States.\n       Howard Baker knew what Mike Mansfield and all students of \n     the Senate's institutional role  know. Political \n     polarization--too much emphasis on which side of the aisle \n     one sits, is not now, and has never been, a good thing for \n     the Senate. I am talking about politics when it becomes \n     gamesmanship or when it becomes mean-spirited or when it \n     becomes overly manipulative, simply to gain advantage. I \n     am not talking about honestly held views or differing \n     philosophical positions. Those things enrich our system. \n     Americans have always loved a good debate. And that is \n     what I believe they wish for now--more substantive and \n     stimulating debate and less pure politics and imagery. But \n     I well understand history and its ebb and flow, and I well \n     know that we live in an age of imagery. It is simply my \n     wish that, sometime soon, the rising tide of imagery and \n     partisanship will begin to ebb rather than to flow quite \n     so freely.\n       Washington, in his farewell address, warned us against the \n     ``baneful effects of the spirit of party'' when he said:\n       ``. . . in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \n     to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain \n     there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary \n     purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the \n     effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate \n     and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a \n     uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest \n     instead of warming, it should consume.''\n       I believe that the American people are more than tired of \n     partisan warfare. I believe they wish for less of it from the \n     Congress, especially in the Senate, where more statesmanship \n     and a longer view are still expected. Declining participation \n     in elections, and repeated public surveys which indicate \n     weariness, distrust, and alienation within our system ought \n     to serve as a harbinger to be ignored at our peril.\n       It must be a matter of concern to all of us that all too \n     few Americans look to officeholders for inspiration in these \n     troubled and turbulent times. How can we attract the talent \n     needed to serve in public office in future years if elected \n     officials continue to be held in such low esteem? I would \n     very much like to see a rekindling of basic faith in our \n     leaders, and a renewal of interest in politics and in public \n     service. But the existence of inspiring leadership by public \n     officials is fundamental to a shoring up of that faith.\n       In short, I think the American people are in desperate need \n     of some old-fashioned heroes. Now, it seems, today's heroes, \n     if we want to loosely use the term, are merely celebrities--\n     rock stars who spout deplorable messages, or sports figures \n     who amass fortunes advertising baggy clothes at exorbitant \n     prices. Not much to look up to here, I say. Not much to build \n     dreams on. Look hard at the content of our popular culture. \n     There is really nothing much to inspire and uplift. And \n     regrettably there also is not much to counter the empty \n     commercialism which is so prevalent today. It has become the \n     norm.\n       So where are we in all of this? What is our role? What part \n     can we as Senators--authority figures, statesmen representing \n     the people--play while we simultaneously endeavor to carry \n     out our 200-year-old mandate, bequeathed to us by some of the \n     most brilliant men of their age, or of  any age before or \n     since?\n       Well, we have our prescribed and our tangential duties, we \n     can show up for roll call votes, carry out our committee \n     assignments, issue the obligatory press releases, dutifully \n     follow up on constituent requests, and answer our mail. All \n     of these are necessary and to a greater or lesser degree \n     important. But a reemphasis by the Senate on our strict \n     institutional role is certainly something which I would like \n     to see. It is a sobering and heavy responsibility all by \n     itself, and its very weightiness tends to cool the over-\n     heated passions of political demagoguery. After all, that \n     role is, in a Constitutional sense, the reason we are here. \n     The Framers expected a zealous defense of our powers to keep \n     the tyrants at bay.\n       But there is still another role--an intangible something--\n     that we who are privileged to sit in this body, and indeed \n     leaders in the private sector, as well as those who write and \n     reflect upon the news, are called upon to play. I call it the \n     duty beyond our duties. The duty I am talking about is the \n     duty to endeavor to inspire others and to demonstrate, \n     through personal example, that public service of all types \n     ought to be an honorable calling. Contrary to what many \n     believe, it is absolutely the wrong place for the slick and \n     the insincere.\n       Serving the public in a leadership role demands honesty, \n     hard work, sacrifice, and dedication from those who dare to \n     ask the people for such an awesome trust. Those who ask to \n     shoulder that mantle also shoulder a much larger personal \n     obligation than many of us may regularly contemplate. We all \n     have a clear responsibility to serve as role models to \n     inspire our people, and particularly our young people, to be \n     and to do their best. On that score, we politicians, as a \n     group, generally miss the mark. Perhaps it's because power, \n     whether it be the power of political office, or the power to \n     run giant corporations, or the power to report and analyze \n     events, is a very heady thing. It can lead to arrogance, self \n     aggrandizement, disregard for playing by the rules, and \n     contempt for the people. It can lead us to forget that we are \n     servants, not masters.\n       In the real world, exemplary personal conduct can sometimes \n     achieve much more than any political agenda. Comity, \n     courtesy, charitable treatment of even our political \n     opposites, combined with a concerted effort to not just \n     occupy our offices, but to bring honor to them, will do more \n     to inspire our people and restore their faith in us, their \n     leaders, than millions of dollars of 30-second spots or \n     glitzy puff-pieces concocted by spin meisters.\n       These are troubling times for our nation and our people on \n     both the national and international fronts. For our country \n     to weather the rough seas ahead, we must use most tempered \n     judgments and seek out our best and most noble instincts. Our \n     example here can be a healing element--a balm to salve the \n     trauma of distrust and disillusionment too long endured by a \n     good people. Let each of us follow his or her own conscience \n     when it comes to issues, but as we do so, may we be ever \n     mindful of the sublimely uplifting part which the example of \n     simple dignity, decency, decorum, and dedication to duty can \n     play in the life of a nation.\n       Let us also remember that even after two hundred years, the \n     Senate is still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and \n     evening star in the American constitutional constellation. It \n     has had its giants and its little men, its Websters and its \n     Bilbos, its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the stage \n     of high drama, of comedy and of tragedy, and its players have \n     been the great and the near great, those who think they are \n     great, and those who will never be great. It has weathered \n     the storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and \n     the attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength \n     to the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, \n     panics and depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the \n     sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of \n     a political minority because great and courageous Senators \n     have always been there to stay the course and keep the faith. \n     As long as we are ever blessed in this august body with those \n     who hear the clear tones of the bell of duty, the Senate will \n     continue to stand--the great forum of constitutional American \n     liberty!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Remarks by President George Bush\n\n       Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senators Thurmond and Byrd, \n     distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:\n       What a special pleasure it is to look around this room and \n     see so many respected former colleagues--and friends. As a \n     former member of the extended Senate family, tonight has a \n     certain homecoming feel to it. It's nice to be back.\n       It is particularly an honor to follow in the footsteps of \n     the distinguished leaders who\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\n     preceded me as lecturers for this series. Mike Mansfield, \n     Howard Baker, and Robert Byrd are true giants in the Senate's \n     history--each, in his own way, ``a Senator's Senator.'' In \n     this room, it doesn't get any better than that.\n       It being apparent that a quorum is present, I feel it only \n     proper to establish a single ground rule. I am ill suited to \n     ``lecture'' anyone here about the Senate. As the resident \n     expert on ancient Greek history, not to mention the Senate \n     itself, Senator Byrd can tell you what happened to Socrates. \n     Socrates was the great philosopher who used to go around \n     lecturing everybody . . . until they poisoned him.\n       So to be clear, this is not a lecture. Nor is it a \n     filibuster.\n       Speaking of filibusters, Barbara is sorry she couldn't be \n     here this evening.\n       Yesterday, we were in Austin to see our son, George W., \n     sworn in for his second term as Texas Governor. And two weeks \n     ago, we were in Tallahassee to see our other politically-\n     active son, Jeb, sworn in as Governor of Florida.\n       Today, the boys are sworn in . . . and their parents are \n     worn out.\n       (My politics today relate to our two sons. I think this is \n     my first visit to the Senate since leaving Washington on \n     January 20, 1993--six years ago today.)\n       Of course, 18 years ago today, Barbara and I were \n     participating in another inauguration--one that brought us \n     back to Washington, and back to Capitol Hill.\n       It's funny, I ran for the Senate twice--both times with a \n     spectacular lack of success. But for eight years, and then \n     four more after that, all the Senators called me ``Mr. \n     President.''\n       When I reported to the Senate in 1981, without a doubt the \n     biggest influence made on me in terms of the Senate came from \n     my father's 11 years of service here. My Dad loved the \n     Senate. He had come out of a business background, and had \n     done his civic duty serving as Town Moderator of Greenwich, \n     Connecticut.\n       He respected his fellow Senators. He found the Senate a \n     civil place to be. The term ``gentleman,'' he felt, applied \n     far more often than not--just as term ``gentle lady'' applied \n     to Margaret Chase Smith of Maine and other distinguished \n     women who have called the Senate home.\n       My Dad and LBJ could be cross-threaded, as we say in the \n     oil business, often disagreeing on issues. But on more than \n     one occasion he told me he respected LBJ's leadership. I'll \n     never forget it. He said: ``Lyndon's word was good. If he \n     said a vote would be at a certain time, you could bet your \n     bottom dollar that that was what would happen.'' Dad felt \n     that LBJ as leader was fair to the minority and ran a tight \n     ship.\n       Like my Dad, my predecessor in the Vice Presidency and the \n     White House, Harry Truman, loved the Senate. Truman called \n     the 10 years he spent here in the Senate the ``happiest of \n     his life''--and I have to say I enjoyed my eight years here, \n     too.\n       In letters written to his beloved wife, Bess, then-Senator \n     Truman confided it took a while to learn the ropes. Along the \n     way, one valuable piece of advice he received came from Ham \n     Lewis of Illinois, the second-longest serving Democratic \n     Whip. Said Lewis to the Missouri freshman: ``For the first \n     six months you'll wonder how you got here. After that, you'll \n     wonder how the rest of us got here.''\n       Later, Truman would write: ``I soon found that, among my 95 \n     colleagues, the real business of the Senate was carried on by \n     unassuming and conscientious men--not by those who managed to \n     get the most publicity.'' Clearly, this was before the days \n     of C-SPAN.\n       As for me, I loved interacting with Senators from both \n     parties. Of course, it was easier for me, better, as Vice \n     President. For one thing, with Howard Baker at the helm, my \n     Party controlled the Senate for my first six years here--that \n     helped. But after I moved down the street to the White House, \n     my dealings with the Senate seemed to involve more raw \n     politics.\n       As President of the Senate, the primary constitutional role \n     I served was breaking tie votes. I cast seven tie-breaking \n     votes as VP--three times alone on the esoteric matter of \n     nerve gas. (Most unpopular, those tie-breakers were.)\n       A myth arose from one of those votes that my mother bawled \n     me out. Well, she didn't quite do that. She did give advice, \n     however. After attending my first  State of the Union speech \n     as Vice President, for example, Mother called to say she \n     had noticed that I was talking to Tip O'Neill while \n     President Reagan was addressing the country. ``He started \n     it,'' was all I could think to say.\n       ``Another thing,'' she continued. ``You should try smiling \n     more.''\n       ``But Mum, the President was talking about nuclear \n     annihilation.''\n       Everyone belittles the job of Vice President. The saying \n     goes that the daily duties of the Vice President include \n     presiding over the Senate and checking the health of the \n     President. Theodore Roosevelt derided it as a ``stepping \n     stone to oblivion.'' FDR's first VP, ``Cactus'' Jack Garner, \n     said the vice presidency ``wasn't worth a warm pitcher of \n     spit''--lovely thought, that.\n       (Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. went so far as to \n     suggest abolishing the office altogether, but then old Sam \n     Rayburn would be quick to note that Arthur had ``never run \n     for sheriff'' himself.)\n       When asked his thoughts on the Vice Presidency, LBJ, who \n     was Majority Leader at the time, said: ``I wouldn't want to \n     trade a vote for a gavel, and I certainly wouldn't want to \n     trade the active position of leadership of the greatest \n     deliberative body in the world for the part-time job of \n     presiding.''\n       In fact, LBJ wielded so much power as Majority Leader that, \n     when John Kennedy introduced him at a 1959 Boston dinner, he \n     observed that: ``Some people say our speaker might be \n     President in 1960, but, frankly, I don't see why he should \n     take the demotion.''\n       A year later, Kennedy became only the second Senator to be \n     elected President directly from the Senate--and as we now \n     know, LBJ traded his vote for the gavel. Explaining his \n     acquiescence to accepting the Number Two spot on the ticket, \n     he said: ``I felt that it offered opportunities that I had \n     really never had before in either . . . the House or the \n     Senate.''\n       The truth is: Many pundits and press people ridicule the \n     Vice Presidency to this day, but most Members of Congress \n     would readily take the job. As Presidents delegate more \n     responsibilities to their VPs, the job has become more \n     productive. And, TR's critique notwithstanding, it has proven \n     to be a fairly good stepping stone to the Presidency--or at \n     least the Party nomination.\n       Just as LBJ became a revered role model for students of the \n     Senate, I also learned from his example when I became \n     President.\n       In his memoirs, LBJ stated he was ``determined, from the \n     time I became President, to seek the fullest support of \n     Congress for any major action that I took.'' I shared his \n     desire to achieve consensus where possible.\n       When I raised my right hand and took the Oath of Office 10 \n     years ago today, I meant it when I held out my hand and \n     pledged to work with the leadership here  on Capitol Hill. \n     And despite the ugliness that erupted early on over the \n     Tower nomination--and later over the nomination of Justice \n     Thomas--I was generally pleased with much of what we \n     accomplished during the first two years. Both the Clean \n     Air Acts and the ADA were landmark pieces of legislation \n     that became a reality only after the White House and the \n     Senate demonstrated bipartisanship and compromise.\n       Of course, every so often, an issue would trigger the \n     tensions built into Mr. Madison's system of checks and \n     balance. When it did, progress necessarily became more \n     difficult to achieve. The irony is: Many observers would look \n     at this so-called ``gridlock'' and think the system was \n     broken--when it was actually performing its ``salutary check \n     on the government,'' just as the Framers intended.\n       Then came the Fall of 1990, when two major issues came to \n     the fore: The budget, and the Gulf crisis. From the \n     beginning, I wanted bipartisanship on both issues--and \n     consensus. But I soon found out that consensus, on either \n     matter, would not be easy to achieve.\n       For example, there was a fundamental difference of opinion \n     between the Senate and the White House over the Senate's role \n     in declaring war--one that dated back to the War Powers Act. \n     Like all of my predecessors, I believe the War Powers Act to \n     be unconstitutional; but as President, I still felt an \n     obligation to consult fully with the Senate. In my mind, not \n     agreeing with the War Powers Act did not mean ``failure to \n     consult.''\n       And during the course of the Gulf crisis, I consulted with \n     the Congressional leadership and bipartisan groups on more \n     than 20 occasions--not including individual meetings and \n     phone calls. I always remembered how LBJ had gone the extra \n     mile to work with Congress at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin \n     Resolution in 1964. As he candidly confided that August 4th, \n     during a meeting with nine Senators (led by Mike Mansfield) \n     and seven House leaders in the Cabinet Room, he said he \n     didn't want to ``go in unless Congress goes in with me.'' The \n     resolution subsequently passed the House unanimously--416 to \n     none. In the Senate, the tally was 88 to 2 in favor.\n       (Incidentally, LBJ thought Truman had made a mistake not \n     asking for a resolution of support from Congress when he went \n     into Korea. It wasn't until the Formosa Straits crisis \n     erupted early in 1955 that a President would reach out to \n     Congress in such a fashion. On January 24, 1955, the House \n     took but an hour to consider President Eisenhower's message \n     requesting a resolution before it passed 410 to 3. Four days \n     later, the Senate followed suit by an 83 to 3 margin.)\n       If I had to pick one vote, I'd say the Senate vote in \n     January 1991 on the resolution authorizing me to use ``any \n     means necessary'' in order to liberate Kuwait was the key \n     Senate vote during my Presidency. To be honest, for weeks we \n     debated whether to try and pass such a resolution in the \n     Senate. I'm glad we did  bring it here, and pleased that it \n     passed. But the 52-47 margin was the slimmest Senate \n     margin ever to vote for war, and naturally I regret that \n     we couldn't convince more in the Majority to help us send \n     a clear and united signal to Saddam, and the world, about \n     our resolve to lead.\n       Before the resolution passed, my respected friend, Sen. \n     Inouye came to me and warned that ``if things go wrong (on \n     the use of force), you could well be impeached.'' I'll never \n     forget that. As it was, several House members had already \n     filed papers of impeachment.\n       But we stayed the course, and I hope history will say not \n     only that we won--but that we won with honor. And when our \n     troops came home, this time they were welcomed with cheers--\n     not jeers. It was a united country that saluted our troops, \n     united by a new respect for our military and for U,S. world \n     leadership.\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\n       Prior to the commencement of Desert Storm, we honored \n     Congress' right to be heard, and to cast their votes, before \n     a single shot was fired. In ending the war when we did, after \n     Kuwait had been liberated, we also kept our word to our \n     coalition partners--and abided by the international authority \n     under which we agreed to operate. Our principled leadership \n     and restraint enhanced our credibility in the region, and \n     earned us a windfall of political capital--which we, in turn, \n     used to jump-start the peace process.\n       As President, it fell to me to lead this effort; but let me \n     note for the record that no President was ever more blessed \n     by a superb team. ``Excellence'' best describes the people I \n     had at my side.\n       I also want to note the special role played by one of your \n     future speakers in this outstanding series, Bob Dole. It is \n     well-known that Bob and I went head-to-head a time or two on \n     the campaign trail--but when the dust of political combat \n     settled, we were always able to put it behind us, and close \n     ranks. It's a good thing, too, for during my four years as \n     President, I earned the distinction as only the second Chief \n     Executive to serve a full term without Party control in \n     either House of Congress. As a result, I came to rely heavily \n     on Bob Dole--and not once did he let me down.\n       He was the model Party leader in the Senate--never putting \n     his agenda ahead of the President's. In my opinion, you could \n     write a textbook based on the way he handled a tough job. \n     Through it all, he showed great class, and courage, and \n     leadership.\n       In the final analysis, I had my chance to serve, and did my \n     best. I messed some things up, and maybe got a few things \n     right. For four years, I was up against a Senate Majority \n     that looked very differently at some of the key issues I \n     faced as President, but I never felt that it wasn't within \n     their right. That's just the way it was, and I am quite \n     content to step aside and let history judge the merits of our \n     actions.\n       Now, since leaving Office, I have stayed away from \n     Washington--but that does not mean I lack interest in events \n     here. I have refrained from commenting on the serious matter \n     now before the Senate--and will continue to do so. But like \n     Howard Baker and many others, I confess that the lack of \n     civility in our political debate and official dealings with \n     one another concerns me.\n       I worry, too, about sleaze--about excessive intrusion into \n     private lives. I worry about once-great news organizations \n     reduced to tabloid journalism--giving us sensationalism at \n     best, smut at worst. (I have to be careful: I used to go \n     around bashing the media, to standing ovations I might add, \n     until a friend wrote and told me to stop it. So I joined \n     Press Bashers Anonymous . . . and I've been clean for six \n     months now.) But I do think the press needs to be more \n     accountable.\n       All in all, it seems to me that, whereas the problems \n     looming over this town dealt more with budget deficits in \n     times past, today we are confronted with a deficit of \n     decency--one that deepens by the day. Washington is a place \n     for big ideas, and doing big things; but it's also a small \n     town in many respects, too small for the bitter rancor that \n     has divided us as people in recent times.\n       Having said that, as a former President, I don't believe in \n     placing outside pressure on the Senate. I have felt it is \n     better for the Senate to chart its own course and do its \n     business without my intervention.\n       It is a popular notion, in some quarters, to name former \n     Presidents as ``senators-for-life.'' After seeing what has \n     happened to General Pinochet, I'd rather pass on that. I am \n     not one who feels that former residents of 1600 Pennsylvania \n     must be consulted, or that some office must be created to use \n     their expertise.\n       Writing in his book Mr. Citizen after he left Office, \n     President Truman suggested designating former Presidents as \n     ``Free'' members of Congress--with the right to sit in the \n     Congress, take part in the debate, and sit in on any \n     committee meetings, but with no right to vote. (This from a \n     dangerously titled chapter, ``What to do with Former \n     Presidents?'') I have great respect for President Truman, but \n     no interest in such a concept.\n       Besides, should I speak up on a hot or controversial issue, \n     some enterprising reporter would go to one of my sons and \n     say: ``Your nutty father feels this way, Governor. How do you \n     feel?''\n       They don't need that grief--nor do I.\n       It was Thomas Jefferson who said: ``There is a fullness of \n     time when men should go, and not occupy too long the high \n     ground to which others have the right to advance.''\n       So it is for the Bush family, just as it is here in the \n     Senate family.\n       In his 1963 book, ``A Senate Diary,'' journalist Allen \n     Drury published the daily diary he kept from 1943 to 1945 \n     when he was a newly assigned reporter covering Capitol Hill. \n     It's an extraordinary book that recorded his initial \n     impressions, and captured the essence of the daily \n     proceedings--particularly in the Senate.\n       Of the Senators themselves, Drury summarized: ``You will \n     find them very human, and you can thank God they are. You \n     will find that they consume a lot of time arguing, and you \n     can thank God they do. You will find that the way they do \n     things is occasionally brilliant but slow and uncertain, and \n     you can thank God that it is . . . That is their greatness \n     and their strength; that is what makes (the Senate) the most \n     powerful guarantor of human liberties free men have \n     devised.''\n       One last thought about the Senate.\n       Fifty years ago, I was starting out in the oil business--\n     out on the dusty expanse of West Texas. In those days, in \n     that place, a man's word was his bond. So much so, in fact, \n     that much of our business was done on a handshake.\n       There aren't many places where you can still do business on \n     a handshake. But you can still do it in the United States \n     Senate.\n       Indeed, gathered as we are in this solemn setting, we not \n     only marvel at how the universe outside these hallowed walls \n     has changed over the last 189 years--we also take comfort at \n     how much the world inside these walls has remained the same--\n     how a timeless code of duty and honor has endured. And we can \n     thank Almighty God that it has.\n       In this light, it is fitting to close with the words Aaron \n     Burr used to close his career in the Senate. In his \n     retirement address of 1805, Burr eloquently noted: ``It is \n     here, in this exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will \n     resistance be made to the storms of political frenzy and the \n     silent arts of corruption . . .''\n       As long as there exists a Senate, there will exist a place \n     of constancy, of Madisonian firmness--a place unlike any \n     other, where the sacred principles of freedom and justice are \n     eternally safeguarded. As with this majestic chamber, may we \n     always be humbled before it--and cherish it ever more.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/23/senate-section/article/S957-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF THOMAS G. PELLIKAAN\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Thursday, January 21 marked the \nend of Thomas Pellikaan's Senate career.\n  Over the past 35 years, Tom Pellikaan served the Senate with \ndistinction in various capacities--first as Senate press liaison and \nthen at the Office of the Daily Digest, where he spent the majority of \nhis Capitol Hill career. He advanced from a staff assistant in the \nDaily Digest office to serve as Editor of the Daily Digest since 1989.\n  Tom's attention to detail is well known around the Halls of the \nSenate. His office has the responsibility of ensuring that the \ninformation contained in the Daily Digest section of the Congressional \nRecord reflects the actions taken on any given day in the Senate. The \nDaily Digest is an important and useful tool for the Senate family. Tom \nand his staff are to be complimented for the excellent job they have \ndone and will continue to do.\n  While Tom has left the Senate, I am sure his interest in the Senate \nwill continue. On behalf of my Democratic colleagues, we wish him well \nas he enjoys the ``country life'' on his farm in Culpeper, VA.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/23/senate-section/article/S960-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}]
