Yesterday, Mr. President, we made progress on this bill--\nnot quite as much as I had hoped, but nevertheless progress was made. I \nwish to draw to the attention of my colleagues that late last night the \nranking member and I put forth an amendment to this bill regarding the \nD-Day memorial. As the last act, it seemed to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan and myself that it was most appropriate that the 56th \nanniversary of D-Day be concluded with an amendment which provides the \nopportunity for, first, the Senate, and hopefully the entire Congress, \nto participate in the raising of the needed dollars for the World War \nII memorial. Over 1,000 World War II veterans are dying each day. \nOrganizers are within $6 million of reaching that sum of money needed \nto complete the construction and design phases of this memorial.\n  I am pleased to say this amendment passed last night. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Mr. Levin, for joining me. All the World War \nII veterans currently serving in the Senate were added as cosponsors. I \nserved very briefly at the end of World War II. And the others, seven \nin number, were added as cosponsors together with our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Kerrey--although not a World War II veteran, a \nveteran of Vietnam with greatest distinction. So I am pleased to\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nmake that announcement. Some Senators may have missed it last night.\n  I note Senator Kerrey's presence in the Chamber. We thank the Senator \nfor cosponsoring the amendment last night by which the Senate goes on \nrecord endorsing a contribution of $6 million, I might add, out of \nnonappropriated funds. We were able to get the funding from that \naccount.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my good friend from Virginia in \ncommenting on that action last night, how appropriate it is for the \nheroes and heroines who served us so well in World War II, both in war \nand on the home front. As my dear friend from Virginia mentioned last \nnight, there were an awful lot of heroes and heroines--obviously, \nveterans first and foremost, but a lot of folks here at home. And this \nmemorial is to them. We have now nine World War II veterans remaining, \nI believe, in the Senate; is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. We have the number here. I will get it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Every one of those were cosponsors, each one with \nextraordinary stories to tell. I was just delighted to be a small part \nof that, even though I am not a vet, just in some way to speak for the \nnonvets in this body about the contributions which have been made by \nthose who served us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that this \nSenator, the Senator from Virginia, although his service at the end of \nWorld War II was brief, a little less than 2 years, does not put \nhimself in the hero class with those in this body who, indeed, very \nhumbly and rightfully earned that hero distinction. I may have served \nin Korea in the second engagement of our country in war but not at this \nparticular time. Basically, the Navy educated me, for which I am \ngrateful. The GI bill helped me, as it did all of those us who served \nat the time. That was probably the greatest investment the United \nStates ever made in a bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Virginia and I properly tipped our hats \nto Bob Dole last night.\n  Mr. WARNER. We did. I talked to him last night after we departed the \nChamber. Guess what. He sat and watched us and critiqued us very \ncarefully. We are proud of Bob Dole.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if I could make a comment on that subject, \nvery much a part of this effort to try to find a compromise on this \nmemorial, in the beginning I opposed the design and they redesigned it. \nI am very pleased now to be able to support both the design and \nconstruction.\n  One of the things, I say to my friend from Virginia, that happened \nduring this process was that there was a deletion made from this design \nthat I think at some point needs to be corrected --not on this site \nbecause its too small a site to accommodate it--and that is the \nconstruction of a museum that tells the full story. And I think it has \nrelevance, in fact, to the debate on this bill because when George \nMarshall accepted Roosevelt's appointment to be Chief of Staff of the \nArmy on September 1, 1939, the Armed Forces of the United States of \nAmerica were approximately 137,000 people. Marshall had to build the \nArmy to 8 million people in order for it to be an effective fighting \nforce, and it wasn't just the military people who responded. There was \na huge civilian effort that supported that buildup. It is a story of \nhow dangerous it is, even though you may not see an enemy on the \nhorizon at the moment, how dangerous it is to stack arms for the United \nStates of America.\n\n  We had a resolution a couple of years ago, I think, on this bill to \ntry to allocate the resources and do the study to build. There were a \nnumber of terrific places in the Senator's State right across the river \nthat were cited. I believe this will be a wonderful memorial, but the \nmissing piece is to tell the full story of what happened from \nVersailles all the way through the Second World War. There was \nbasically an interruption for 20 years while America tried to withdraw \none more time from the world. We paid a terrible price for it. I \nappreciate very much the Senator's willingness to allocate the money \nfor this.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can advise my distinguished colleague, the subject \nof a military museum embracing the chronological history of the \nparticipation of men and women of our Nation in causes of freedom \nbeyond our shores is very much in the minds of the members of the Armed \nServices Committee. At the moment, I and other Senators are promoting a \nmuseum colocated with Arlington Cemetery on the ridge that overlooks \nwhere the current headquarters of the Marine Corps is located. That is \ndue for demolition. That site seems to me and others to lend itself to \nthe convenience of tourists visiting this Nation's Capital. It would \nembrace the military history of all branches of our services. We are a \nmodest size in comparison to others, but the Senator is right.\n  I noticed with interest yesterday in Great Britain the Queen opened \nan extraordinary exposition and permanent museum devoted to the \nHolocaust, again, a reminder of chapters of the tragedy that unfolded \non the European Continent as a consequence of Hitler and the Axis \npowers.\n  Mr. KERREY. I know that site fairly well. I think it would be a \nterrific site for history of the Armed Forces, but I also believe \noftentimes the most important decisions aren't the decisions the \nmilitary is making but that the civilians made prior to the military \nhaving to act, at least as I see the history.\n  In the Second World War, there were an awful lot of mistakes made in \nthe 1920s and the 1930s that created the necessity for that terrible \nwar. It is a very important reminder, especially today. It is something \nI am asked all the time when debating authorization for the military.\n  People say: Do we need it? Who is the enemy? We are spending more \nthan 20 leading nations, et cetera, et cetera.\n  People say: Why do we need to continue to do this? The cold war is \nover, and so forth.\n  The best answer lies in that 20-year period between 1919 and 1939 \nduring which the United States of America tried, in the face of all \nevidence to the contrary, to stack arms and withdraw and become \nisolationist.\n  We have talked long enough on that subject. I appreciate very much \nthe Senator responding to former Senator Dole's request. This is the \nminimum that the people of the United States of America ought to do to \nparticipate in constructing this important memorial.\n  Mr. WARNER. One footnote to this colloquy. Yesterday Senator Dole, \nwho is chairman of the National World War II Memorial Campaign, \nreceived a check for $14.5 million from Wal-Mart stores. The \ncontribution was presented by a group of World War II veterans and Wal-\nMart associates during a special ceremony yesterday. That, together \nwith the action by this Chamber which I hope will become law, are the \nfinal building blocks needed in that fundraising campaign.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. The junior Senator from Virginia and I actually sponsored \nlegislation earlier. We have been trying to support what it is you are \ntrying to do with this Armed Forces memorial that will tell the story \nof the Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Robb is very active in that.\n  I yield the floor.\n     amendment no. 3183\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate now \npresents to Members of the Senate a series of questions that we have to \nanswer.\n  The first is, Should the Congress, under any circumstances, impose a \nlimitation on the Commander in Chief? As it says, the Commander in \nChief can't go below a certain level of strategic nuclear weapons. We \nimposed this for the first time in 1998. One of the strongest arguments \nmade in 1998 and 1999 was that we needed that in order to put pressure \non the Duma to ratify START II. They have now ratified START II. I \nthink it is unwise to impose a limitation. Whether the President is a \nDemocrat, whether the President is a Republican, I think it limits that \nPresident's ability to be able to negotiate. As a consequence, it puts \nthe President in a weaker position when he is talking, whether to \nRussia or other nations--it puts that President in a weaker position \nand gives him less maneuverability to be able to protect the people of \nthe United States. If we don't like the action a President takes, the \nCongress can intervene to act. That is question No. 1.\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\n  Do you think, under any circumstances that you can describe, we ought \nto pass a law that says a President cannot go below a certain level? In \nthis case, the START I level is not only 6,000 warheads, but as the \nSenator from Arizona indicated earlier, we describe in the law the \nprecise platform delivery systems for the warheads.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator posed a question. I will take responsibility \nto answer the question as we go along, and we can frame for colleagues \nwhere the differences are between yourself and my amendment, and then \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer will take the second question.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to do that.\n  The first question is, Did the Congress do the right thing in 1998 \nand 1999, and would we be doing the right thing today or in the future \nto have a statute that imposes upon a President a floor, a limitation, \nunder which that President cannot go as a consequence of our deciding \nthat should only occur as we described in this law?\n  We did it in 1998 and again in 1999 and we are proposing to do it \nagain this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. The answer to that question is very simple. It was first \ndone in 1996. We repeated it in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In 2000, we made \nit permanent. That is the provision which the Senator from Nebraska is \ntrying to strike.\n  In response to that, Congress took action and the President of the \nUnited States signed it into law one time, two times, three times, four \ntimes, five times. That should answer the question posed by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n\n  The President concurred in the judgment of the Congress which said \nthat you should not drop below those levels. What the amendment from \nthe Senator from Virginia says is it doesn't, in my judgment, restrict \nthe President's constitutional right to negotiate, but it says, Mr. \nPresident, you should not unilaterally, as Commander in Chief, reduce \nour Armed Forces in terms of those strategic levels until you do two \nthings which have been followed by previous Presidents, and, indeed, \nthis President when he first came to office. You make a QDR study.\n  For those that do not understand it, it is an entire study of the \nworld threat situation, our force levels, force levels which are \nconventional, force levels which are strategic, and you do a \ncomprehensive review of the nuclear posture.\n  Those two things having been done, then you can proceed to exercise \nyour judgment as Commander in Chief to reduce certain force levels.\n  There it is. The President signed it five times, clearly. He could \nhave vetoed it. He did not. He signed it into law five times. It \nremains the law of the land today. I will vigorously oppose the efforts \nof my colleague and good friend from Nebraska to repeal that law \nbecause that law very clearly says you must take prudent actions. My \namendment sets out what those prudent actions are. Then my amendment \ngives the President the right, after taking those actions of the QDR \nand the posture review of the nuclear forces, to waive the statute that \nhas been signed five times by the President of the United States.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, Congress should be making a \ndecision based upon what we think is right. We oftentimes pass defense \nauthorization bills that have things the President doesn't like. My \nguess is that the Senator from Virginia has urged the President on many \noccasions: I understand, Mr. President, you don't like this particular \nprovision, but I urge you to sign it anyway. There are many other good \nthings in the bill. Mr. President, we hope you will sign it because we \ncan't get it any better.\n  That happens all the time here.\n  So the fact that the President signed it does not mean the President \nconcurs. Nor should it cause a Senator to say, just because the \nPresident signed it, that doesn't mean it is a good act. We disagree \nwith the President all the time around here. We will get behind him \nwhen we like what he is doing, and we will get out in front of him when \nwe do not like what he is doing. That is the appropriate way, I \nsuspect, it ought to be done. Members of the Senate should be deciding: \nDo we think it is a wise thing? Do we want to restrict future President \nBush or future President Gore? It is not accidental that was imposed in \n1996. It has not been imposed on previous Presidents. It has been \nimposed only on this particular President. So whether the President \nsigns the bill or not, in my view, is secondary to the question: Do you \nthink it is a sound policy?\n  In a post-cold-war era where we have had three Presidential elections \nin Russia--and understand, the bulk of our strategic weapons system is \nfor Russia. That is the bulk of our system. What would the Senator say, \n75 percent or 80 percent of the SIOP is dealing with the democratic \nnation of Russia with whom we have relations, with whom we are trying \nto work to help to be successful in their democratic experiment and \ntheir experiment with free markets? The question is, Does it restrict \nthe President and make it less likely he can begin to think in a new \nway--which, in my judgment, needs to occur?\n  So, regardless, whether the President signs it or not, my guess is \nthe President does not support this provision. But even if he said, ``I \nsupport it,'' I would still oppose it. I still think it is unreasonable \nfor Congress to do. So that is question No. 1 that you have to decide. \nWhether the President signs it or not is secondary. My guess is a lot \nof folks on that side of the aisle think the President signs a lot of \nthings they wish he would not sign, things they voted against. So it is \nnot, to me, a very compelling argument to say we have to do this \nbecause the President signed five previous bills that had this \nprovision in them.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say to my good friend, I strongly disagree. This \nPresident signed this five times. We saw an example where the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and I had the Byrd-Warner \namendment regarding the deployment of our troops and taking certain \nsteps by the Congress. What happened? Not only this President but the \ncandidates for President, both Vice President Gore and George W. Bush, \ncommunicated in various ways they believed that amendment was an \nencroachment on Presidential power, and we missed that by a mere three \nvotes, is my recollection, because of that very issue. It was an \nabridgement of Presidential power. Nothing is fought on this Chamber \nfloor with greater vigor than protecting the powers of the President of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, is our time being charged to \nthe two of us? Is that how this is being worked?\n  Mr. WARNER. It seems to me that is a fair allocation in the course of \na colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). When the Senator from Nebraska \nspeaks, that is charged against his time. When the Senator from \nVirginia speaks, it is allocated against his time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not think it is going to be persuasive to the \nSenator from Virginia, but this is the statement of policy on the \nSenate defense authorization bill:\n\n       The administration appreciates the bill's endorsement of \n     our plan to reduce the Trident submarine force from 18 to 14 \n     boats, while maintaining a survivable, effective START I-\n     capable force. However, we prefer repealing the general \n     provision that maintains the prohibition, first enacted in \n     the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act, against obligating \n     funds to retire or dismantle any other strategic nuclear \n     delivery systems below specified levels. . . .\n\n  And on and on and on.\n  So the President has signed it, but the President does not support \nthis policy. Again, I do not suppose that is going to be persuasive to \nmy colleague, but he used an argument against repealing this provision \nthat said the President supports it, or he signed the bill which \nimplies that he supports the provision.\n  I personally believe the Congress should be making the decision. The \nSenator's argument, with great passion, that he does not like \ninfringing upon the prerogatives of the President--I have heard him \nmany times down here arguing, oftentimes against Members of his own \nparty, against efforts to do that. So I am surprised, in fact, \nespecially now that the Russian Duma has ratified START II, that we\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nwant to continue this policy. I think it is not good. So that is \nquestion No. 1. You have heard very eloquent argument on the other \nside. Question No. 1 is: Does Congress want to do that under any \ncircumstances with or without a review?\n  The second question we are now going to be asked, as a consequence of \nthe second-degree amendment, is: Do we want to delay action? Do we want \nto restrict the action in accordance with the second-degree amendment \nwhich basically says we have to have a nuclear force structure review \nand that review is submitted concurrently with the quadrennial review \nwhich is expected December of 2001?\n  I believe it is time for the people's representatives, elected by the \npeople, to be having a debate about what kind of force structure we \nwant to maintain. And it is counterproductive, it is difficult for us \nto reach the right decision, if we once again farm it off and say we \nwant somebody else to figure it out. It is the civilians who send \ninstructions to the CINC at STRATCOM. It is PDD-60 that determines what \nthe Single Integrated Operating Plan, the SIOP, is. The targets are \nselected as a consequence of civilian instructions, not the other way \naround. It is we who have to decide, Do we have enough? Do we have too \nmuch? Or is it right? It is we who have to bring commonsense analysis \nto the debate and answer the question: Given the current status, given \nwhat we expect out in the future, do we have enough?\n  We have the statements of General Shalikashvili in 1995, as he \nevaluated this, that seem to indicate that lower levels are safe. But \neven there, General Shalikashvili is following civilian instructions.\n  I understand this amendment provides people an opportunity to sort of \nvote for this thing and we are going to have a normal review. It may in \nfact carry the day. It is a very complicated argument, and it may in \nfact be that the second-degree amendment passes. I hope not, because it \nis time for this Congress to take back the responsibility for targeting \nand answer the question: Do we have enough, do we have too little, or \ndo we have the numbers quite right?\n  I urge Members to look at what we now have in the public realm, data \nthat indicates what that targeting is. We have an analysis, public \nanalysis now, of what happens when we have 2,500 strategic warheads \nafter we subtract that fraction that may not be available to us for a \nvariety of reasons. Understanding we are not shooting bullets here, \nthese are very complicated systems, and you cannot, with 100-percent \nreliability, predict that they are going to arrive on target in the \nmanner that has been described. So they are very complicated systems. \nIt requires modernization; it requires constant analysis. The men and \nwomen at STRATCOM and others who have that responsibility are highly \nskilled, and they work on that problem all the time.\n\n  This is why I think the review is not a good idea. It pushes away \nfrom us one more time the problem of just considering what these \nnuclear weapons can do instead of asking ourselves, with a commonsense \nanalysis--because, again, the targeting begins with civilian \ninstructions. It is the Presidential directive that determines what the \ntargeting is. We have modified the targeting, certainly, to accommodate \nsome of the changes that have occurred as a result of the end of the \ncold war. But I believe if you look at these things and say, oh, my \ngosh, what will those do, you will reach a commonsense conclusion that \nwe have more than is necessary in order to keep the people of the \nUnited States of America safe.\n  That is the mission of this defense authorization bill, whether we \nare debating the pay for our military, whether we are debating our \nforce structure, or readiness, whatever it is. We ought to authorize \nand we ought to appropriate such funds as necessary to keep the people \nof the United States of America and our interests and our allies safe. \nThat is what our mission is.\n  But, again, on the question of the need for review, what is needed is \nfor Congress to review it, for Congress to answer the question. We \nhave, under what is called the minimal deterrent level, the 2,500 \nwarheads: We have 500 100- to 300-kiloton weapons that will land on \nwar-supporting installations in Russia, 160 on leadership, 500 on \nconventional forces, 1,100 on nuclear targets.\n  I urge, rather than doing a review, what we need to do is bring out a \nmap of Russia and take a look and answer the question, What do 2,260 \nnuclear detonations of a minimum of 100 kilotons do to Russia? \nRemember, the war in the Pacific ended in 1945 as a consequence of two \n15-kiloton detonations. I stipulated earlier my uncle died in the \nPhilippines and my father was a part of the occupation force rather \nthan invasion. I have a vested interest in declaring that I think \nTruman did the right thing. But those were two 15-kiloton detonations. \nWe are talking about 2,260 detonations in excess of 100 kilotons. We do \nnot need a review by professionals. The people's representatives need \nto do an analysis of this, and I urge my colleagues to do that kind of \nanalysis. Imagine those kinds of detonations and ask yourself, Do we \nhave enough?\n  Connected with that, do an analysis yourself, both of the command and \ncontrol capability of Russia and of their ability to do warnings, \nbecause if they have mistakes made at either command and control or \nwarning--and their capacity to do early warning not only is declining \nbut it is declining enough so the President, in one of the few \nsuccesses he had, in addition to getting an agreement to eliminate \nweapons-grade plutonium, got an agreement to do a joint warning center \nin Moscow because the analysis says their capacity to do accurate \nwarning is declining. What does that mean? It means if they get a false \nalarm, they are going to launch because their instructions are to \nlaunch on warning.\n  So what we are doing is, as a consequence of maintaining higher \nlevels pending more reviews, et cetera, et cetera, we are forcing the \nRussians to maintain a level higher than they are able to maintain, \nputting us at risk. It increases the risk today. That is how the end of \nthe cold war has changed things. Russia cannot maintain 6,000 strategic \nweapons. They have been begging us for years. Indeed, one of the things \nI said yesterday, one of the paradoxes of this whole debate, is I am \nnot sure this administration would take action.\n  (Mr. WARNER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for just a moment? I \nwould like to be able to answer his question.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Chairman made a good point. We need to run a \ncomparison. The question the Senator asked is, Do we need to delay \nactions? The answer is, No, we don't want to unnecessarily delay \naction. But I think we need to have a responsible decisionmaking \nprocess set up. These are very complex issues.\n  There are a lot of issues involved. Hearing the Senator's comments \nsounds to me as if he would agree with what the committee has tried to \ndo. They said: Look, these are complicated issues. We need to have a \ncareful review. In fact, the Strategic Subcommittee, which I chair, has \nset up a process where we have two studies to review our nuclear \nposture of where we are and move into negotiations.\n  For the committee to be informed means we have to hear from the \nprofessionals who deal with these issues. They need to bring the \ninformation to the committee.\n  We represent the people of the United States in the Congress and the \nArmed Services Committee tries to represent those interests. We have to \nset up a process to do exactly what the Senator from Nebraska is \ntalking about.\n  A lot has changed since the last posture review in 1994, and what was \nrelevant in 1994 is not necessarily relevant today. We have new \nleadership, by the way, since that review. In Russia, we have new \nleadership. We have new leadership around the world. We have leadership \nthat has changed even in this country. We need to reevaluate in the \ncontext of this new political environment. We need to reevaluate in the \ncontext of new technology, new positions as far as the nuclear posture \nis concerned.\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\n  This amendment is critical to protecting our country and stabilizing \nthe world. We need to get the current crop of experts, military and \ncivilian--it is proper to bring in the civilian role--to formulate \nrecommendations given today's dynamic changes.\n  It seems to me the Senator from Nebraska would agree with what the \ncommittee is trying to do. We agree perhaps times have changed. As the \nchairman pointed out earlier, the law expressly prohibited the \nPresident. Now we are saying, with a careful Nuclear Posture Review, \nmaybe we can move ahead and review some of these issues.\n  (Mr. L. CHAFEE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that response. I made it clear in questions \nyesterday posed to the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nColorado having to do with the issue of whether or not this action \ncould be taken prior to December of 1991, whether or not an accelerated \ncomprehensive review could occur if it was a President Bush or a \nPresident Gore. The answer was yes, leading me to say in that situation \nmaybe I would support the amendment because if they can do an \naccelerated review, so can President Clinton.\n  The answer then came back: No, we do not want President Clinton to do \nan accelerated view. We are willing to let President Gore or President \nBush do it but not President Clinton. That is precisely why it is a bad \nprovision because I believe it is there because of distrust of a single \nPresident. It is not wise, in my judgment, for the Congress to impose \nthat kind of restriction because it does send a signal to our allies \nnot to negotiate.\n  It makes it much more difficult for the President to negotiate not \nonly arms control agreements but to take action as President Bush did \nin 1991 facing a problem of how do we leapfrog the arms control \nprocess.\n  I heard my colleagues on the other side say the old arms control \nprocess needs to be torn up. That is not inconsistent with this kind of \nthinking. That is exactly what Governor Bush said in his press club \nspeech surrounded by Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Brent Scowcroft, \nand Colin Powell. If those four men were part of that new \nadministration and they came out and said we need a review in November, \nDecember, and January and we think we can go to lower levels and we \nwant to go immediately, we can get Russia to agree to a robust missile \ndefense, my guess is every single Member of the other side would go \nalong with it immediately, understanding these men are qualified and \nthey understand what is necessary to protect the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  They do not need another review, and they certainly do not need \nCongress imposing a limitation on where they can go. This is a \nlimitation that has been imposed on a single President. If it becomes \npolicy for Congress to do it, I believe it is going to be very \ndifficult for us to take advantage of this new post-cold-war \nopportunity, as the other side has done repeatedly. There are times \nwhen the President submits a budget for defense and they say it is not \nenough. They do not say we need a review of this for another 3 or 4 \nmonths or a long period of time. They say we have done a review; we are \nnot ready so we have to put more money in the budget, we have to put \nmore weapons systems in the budget that were not in the President's \nrequest.\n  We do not have any difficulty confronting the President. We do not \nask for reviews when the President is not asking us to do something we \nwant. This is, in my judgment, a provision that was put in here as a \nconsequence of not trusting a particular President, and it is a \nmistake. It is going to hamstring the next President, whoever that \nPresident is. This amendment attempts to soften it a bit, but it still \nleaves it in place. Senator Kyl, I understand, was speaking for how \nthey now interpret the amendment, saying, no, the review has to be \nsubmitted concurrently with a quadrennial review whenever that occurs. \nMaybe it is not in December 2001. Maybe it is done in January 2002. \nWhat if you have a President Bush coming online with Secretary of \nDefense Colin Powell and George Shultz and Brent Scowcroft and Henry \nKissinger as part of that administration, and they do a review in \nNovember and December and come to you and say: We decided we want to go \nto 5,000 in exchange for an agreement; is that sufficient?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me tell you what the committee was thinking, as \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, when we looked at this and said \nwe need to have a careful Nuclear Posture Review. The Senator is trying \nto imply there was a political motive with that. This committee, made \nup of Democrats and Republicans, said we need to have a careful Nuclear \nPosture Review and we need to look at the facts. We recognized that in \n1994 we had a review. We need to go back.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am not implying a political motivation. I am rereading \nyour answers to my questions yesterday. I saw reason I would support \nthis amendment, and the reason I could have supported the amendment is, \nif you had said to me, yes, a thoughtful and thorough review can be \ndone by civilians in less time than done by a quadrennial review that \nwould allow President Bush or President Gore, and the answer was that \nwould be acceptable. I then said: What if Clinton did the same thing? \nThe answer was no. I am reading back and remembering what the exchange \nwas yesterday.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In considering this issue, we need to have a careful \nNuclear Posture Review. It is not going to happen quickly. What the \nSenator from Nebraska wants to see happen in public policy where we \nwould carefully evaluate where we are in comparison with the rest of \nthe world is not going to happen in 3 or 4 months. It is going to take \ntime. We have to have input from civilian experts. We have to have \ninput from military experts. From a practical standpoint, it is \nprobably not going to be an opportunity on which this President can \nact. Whether it is a Democrat or Republican President, whoever is in \noffice next, I think the same policy is going to have to apply because \nthe ultimate goal is to have a careful posture review and make sure we \ndo not unilaterally disarm this country, that we do not make it more \nvulnerable than it is today.\n  I yield my time to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to listen.\n  Mr. KERREY. Go ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply reiterate what my colleague, who is the chairman \nof the subcommittee, has said. This amendment, which I drew up \ncarefully, is drawn in such a way that it does not preclude President \nClinton from negotiating and, indeed, preclude him from exercising his \nauthority as Commander in Chief to direct the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs and others in the Pentagon: This is a level to which you will \ndrive nuclear weapons. He can do it.\n  We are saying it should only be done after a quadrennial review, \nafter a nuclear posture study has been completed. From a practical \nstandpoint, it simply, in my judgment, cannot be achieved. If it were \nforced to be done, it would be viewed not only by us but the Russians \nand all others who follow this as an imprudent, an unwise step by our \nPresident. That is it.\n  Mr. KERREY. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Do you think that Congress made a mistake not having a similar \nprovision in place so we could have prevented President Bush from \ntaking his action in 1991?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. Fine. Let's review what President Bush did. In the \nfinal hours of the days of his Presidency, he did the START II. I \nunderstand that. But the point is, that was a process that evolved over \nmany years. The work had been done. The studies had been done. All of \nit was in place ready for his signature.\n  I say to the Senator, that is not the case in this instance. The last \nposture review of importance was 1994. Why this administration sought \nnot to bring those up to date, to bring up a current one----\n  Mr. KERREY. But I say to the Senator, the question directly is, Do \nyou think Congress should have passed a similar restriction on \nPresident Bush so he could not have done what he did in 1991?\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I would say, if this situation today were of a parallel \nsituation at the time of President Bush, I would have been the first to \npass this same law. It was an entirely different factual situation, I \nsay to the Senator. I hope those listening understand that. But you \nposed the question. If President Bush at that time was faced with the \ndecision such as this to lower the numbers drastically, I would say it \nshould not be done until the staff work and the careful work had been \ndone by those entrusted, namely, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, to make the analysis before a President \nacts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield just for----\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the floor to you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I must say, I am utterly amazed by the last answer of my good friend \nfrom Virginia. What the Senator from Virginia said is that President \nBush carefully, after thorough deliberation and consideration, \nnegotiated a START II treaty. That was done, to use my good friend's \nwords: After the studies were done, after the work was done.\n  I am wondering if my friend from Nebraska would agree with what I am \nnow going to say. The law that is on the books will not let us go down \nto the Bush START II level, which was so carefully negotiated.\n  Think about what our law is. We just heard--and I agree with the good \nSenator from Virginia--that President Bush carefully, thoughtfully, in \nthe words of the Senator from Virginia, after the studies were done and \nthe work was done, negotiated a START II treaty. I agree with that. The \nlaw on the books will not let us go to the level that President Bush \nnegotiated. We have to stay at START I levels.\n  Mr. KERREY. I quite agree with that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You cannot have it both ways. If President Bush \nthoughtfully--and he did--carefully--and he did--after work was done--\nand it was--negotiated a START II level--we have ratified START II--the \nJoint Chiefs want us to go to that level and have testified to that, \nthat we are wasting money staying at the START I level--we have \npeacekeepers that we can't afford to maintain; it is wasteful--they \nsay, please don't force us to keep to that level, but we have a law on \nthe books which says we have to stay at the START I level of 6,000 \nwarheads. We cannot go down to the START II level of 3,000 to 3,500 \nwarheads because of the law on the books. You can't have this both \nways.\n\n  To add insult to injury, now we are saying that the only way that can \nbe waived, that limit, that START I requirement that we have on the \nbooks, is if there is another Nuclear Posture Review. We have had two \nvery thoughtful, Nuclear Posture Reviews, one in 1994, one in 1997.\n  You will not let us implement it. This law will not let us implement \nthe previous careful, thoughtful Nuclear Posture Reviews. I do not have \nany problem with another one, by the way. I do not have any problem \nwith the bill the way it now reads.\n  The problem I have is with the Warner amendment, which says that we \ncan't do what we negotiated in START II, even though it has been \nconfirmed by two thoughtful posture statements, unless the President--\nthe next President, not this one--first has another Nuclear Posture \nReview. That is the problem.\n  I think the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nVirginia is aimed very clearly at this President. I think it is a \nmistake in terms of its approach. It is being limited to hobble this \nPresident, to force him to maintain a force structure which was \nnegotiated to a lower level by a previous President. I think that is a \nmistake in terms of precedent and in terms of what we should be doing \nin terms of a body. It should not be aimed at one President.\n  But in addition to that, I must say that we are maintaining a force \nstructure which the Joint Chiefs say we do not need, a force structure \nwhich START II--which was negotiated by President Bush--says we do not \nneed. So we are wasting a lot of money as well as engaging, I believe, \nin a partisan effort to hobble the President.\n  That is the sad news. That is one of the problems with the Warner \namendment. But there is some good news--not in this amendment, but \nthere is some good news that should give us a little bit of comfort.\n  It will not work. We can waste money. We are. We can maintain a \ndangerous level of force structure, for the reasons which the Senator \nfrom Nebraska gave, making us less secure, not more. We can do all \nthat. But we cannot hobble the President, although I believe the intent \nof this amendment is to hobble this President. I believe that is the \nintent because it is only aimed at this President.\n  The next President--whether it is a Democratic or Republican \nPresident--we have been told last night, can go through this review in \na matter of months, if they want to, and then waive this statute, but \nnot this President. So I think it is aimed at this President. But this \nPresident has the constitutional right to negotiate a treaty, should he \nsee fit. Thank God, the Constitution is there again to save us.\n  Because although this language will not allow a waiver by this \nPresident to get down to the level which President Bush negotiated, and \nwhich the Joint Chiefs of Staff say is all we need to keep us secure--\nhalf of the level which the current law forces us to maintain--even \nthough that is what this language will force us to do, it cannot stop \nthe President from carrying out his constitutional duty to his last day \nin office.\n  He can negotiate a treaty at a lower level. If he does so, we can \nreject it. The Senate has to ratify under the Constitution. But the \nPresident is nonetheless able to negotiate reductions below the START \nII level, as the Joint Chiefs have said he safely can.\n  In 1997, the Joint Chiefs said we can safely go down to 2,000, 2,500, \nwhich is about 1,000 below the START II level. They have already said \nthat after a careful posture review. I hope the President succeeds in \ncoming up with a treaty which allows us to deploy a limited national \nmissile defense at a lower level of nuclear weapons. I hope he \nsucceeds.\n  But I must say this amendment is not constructive. It is not \nsomething which I believe would be offered were a President of a \ndifferent party in office. I do not believe that it would be offered. I \nthink the answers last night give support to that conclusion.\n  It is a very sad conclusion on my part to reach that because I know \nmy friend from Virginia is not ordinarily of that bent. We have worked \ntogether long enough so I know what his instincts usually are. But in \nthis case, I am afraid it falls short of where we should be as a body, \nwhich should be supporting our right to ratify, supporting a force \nstructure we need, but not maintaining a force structure we no longer \nneed according to two careful posture reviews, for purposes which I \nbelieve are intended to restrict this President.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask the Senator from Nebraska, is it not \naccurate that the START II level which was negotiated by President Bush \nwas supported by a Nuclear Posture Review made by the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff?\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is correct. It is one reason additional \nreview is not necessary. It is offered in good faith, but it is \ncertainly not necessary to make this determination.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might summarize, again, on five \noccasions President Clinton has signed into law actions by the Congress \nof the United States which state very clearly we should not go to these \nlevels. There it is.\n  It is interesting, one of the reasons Congress took that action is we \nwere not sure what the Duma would do on START II. We were right. They \naccepted START II, but with the following conditions on it: ABM treaty \ndemarcation protocol, ABM treaty succession multilateralization \nprotocol, START II extension protocol. Those protocols have not been \nsent to the Senate by the President. No one can refute that; they have \nnot been sent here. They do not have his endorsement. That is why we \nshould not undo hastily with this amendment this fabric of legislation \nwhich for 5 consecutive years has been passed by the Congress and \nsigned by the President of the United States.\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\n  The Warner amendment does not preclude President Clinton from \nnegotiating. It does not preclude our President from creating a QDR in \nthe next few months, creating an updated nuclear posture. He could do \nit. But it would be imprudent and unwise to do it because it would run \nagainst the guidance provided by the Congress. No one should say this \nCongress, particularly the Senate, is not an equal partner on matters \nof seriousness of this nature, particularly as it relates to treaties. \nIt is in the Constitution just as clearly as is the President's \nCommander in Chief role.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may have 1 additional minute, I will \nthen yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the point of the President signing five bills, when the \nPresident signs bills--these bills are 600 pages long--he makes it very \nclear he doesn't agree with every single provision in every bill he \nsigns. As a matter of fact, if that were the test, I am sure we could \nget a statement right now from the President indicating his opposition \nto this provision. I would think the Senator from Virginia would still \nnot drop this provision, even though the President of the United States \nwould indicate opposition to it.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, speaking for the administration, I \nam sure, in 1995, said:\n\n       Our analysis shows that, even under the worst conditions, \n     the START II force levels provide enough survivable forces \n     and survivable, sustained command and control to accomplish \n     our targeting objectives.\n\n  That is the Joint Chiefs speaking for the administration in 1995. The \ncurrent law will not allow this administration to go down to the levels \nwhich General Shalikashvili and the current Joint Chiefs say are \nadequate. It is wasteful as well as attempting to hobble the President. \nBut if the test is whether the President supports the language or not, \nI am sure we can get a quick letter from the President indicating his \nopposition to the Senator's amendment. I wonder whether the Senator \nwould drop his amendment if the President indicated opposition in a \nletter?\n  Mr. WARNER. Unequivocally, no, I say to my good friend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. In quick summary, he cites what the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs said in 1995. Fine. But General Shelton and others were acting \non the predicate, on the assumption, which was a fair assumption, that \nthe Russian Duma would adopt START II as it was written and not put \nthese conditions on it. Once they put these conditions on, it was a \nclear signal to all of us, we had better go back and reexamine what in \neffect is the desire of Russia on arms control. These are conditions \nwhich they know this Chamber, as presently constituted, would never \naccept.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement of \nGeneral Shelton be printed in the Record at this time, indicating that \nmajor costs would be incurred if we remain at START I levels, stating \nhis opposition to the language which the Senator from Virginia would \nmaintain in our law without the possibility of a waiver until next \nyear.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Testimony Before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, January 5, \n                                  1999\n\n\n             RATIONALE FOR STAYING AT START I FORCE LEVELS\n\n       Senator Levin. General Shelton, in your view, is there any \n     military reason why we should freeze our strategic forces at \n     the START I level until Russia ratifies START II?\n       What is the cost (a) in fiscal year 2000; and (b) through \n     the FYDP; to maintain our forces at the START I level instead \n     of a lower level that is required for military reasons?\n       General Shelton. As a result, the force structure could \n     undergo change. The Joint Chiefs and I are working with the \n     Commander in Chief of our Strategic Command on a \n     recommendation for the Secretary of Defense. There are a \n     number of alternative force structures with fewer platforms \n     that meet our national security needs and still provide 6,000 \n     strategic warheads to maintain leverage on the Russians to \n     ratify START II. The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to \n     consider options that will reduce our strategic forces to the \n     levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I \n     legislative restraint will need to be removed before we can \n     pursue these options.\n       Major costs will be incurred if we remain at START I \n     levels. Since our START II baseline calls for Peacekeeper to \n     be retired by 31 December 2003, costs in fiscal year 2000 \n     include an additional $51 million to maintain all Peacekeeper \n     missiles for 1 year. Overall Peacekeeper costs are \n     approximately $150 million per year and maintaining them over \n     the FYDP will cost $560 million. Keeping our SSBN force \n     structure at START I levels (18 SSBNs) until fiscal year 2006 \n     will costs an additional $5.3 billion, which includes \n     refueling, overhaul, and backfitting four Trident SSBNs with \n     D-5 missiles.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Secretary Cohen. . . . So the answer is, I do not think we \n     need to have the legislation, which expires, and we can \n     maintain the same level until such time as--level of warheads \n     that we have under START I, until such time as the Russians \n     ratify START II, so we can achieve that particular goal.\n       Senator Levin. So, the way the legislation is framed is not \n     helpful or necessary?\n       Secretary Cohen. I think it is unnecessary at this point.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n               FISCAL YEAR 2000 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n       Senator Levin. Would you oppose inclusion of a provision in \n     the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization Act mandating \n     strategic force structure levels--specific numbers of Trident \n     Submarines, Peacekeeper missiles and B-52 bombers?\n       General Shelton. Yes, I would definitely oppose inclusion \n     of any language that mandates specific force levels. It is \n     important for us to retain the ability to deploy the maximum \n     number of warheads allowed by START I but the Services should \n     also have the flexibility to do so with a militarily \n     sufficient, yet cost effective, force structure.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Senator Levin. Are there any military requirements for the \n     50 Peacekeeper ballistic missiles?\n       General Shelton. The Commander in Chief United States \n     Strategic Command conducted an extensive analysis of \n     maintaining 14 Tridents, 500 Minutemen IIIs, and 0 \n     Peacekeepers uploaded to the approximate warhead limits of \n     START I in our inventory and he concluded this force was \n     militarily sufficient and I concurred with this assessment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Senator Levin. I would hope they take that into account and \n     also the fact that they are doing that because that is what \n     we wanted them to do under the START agreements, is to move \n     to the new kind of weapons system. But whatever you want to \n     take into account, please respond to that for the record.\n       [The information referred to follows:]\n       The Service Chiefs and I agree it is time to reduce the \n     number of our nuclear platforms to a level that is militarily \n     sufficient to meet our national security needs. Specifically, \n     we should move to the force structure levels recommended by \n     the Nuclear Posture Review. For fiscal year 2000, this means \n     programming for the reduction of our nuclear-powered fleet \n     ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) force structure from 18 to \n     14 TRIDENTs while maintaining 50 PEACEKEEPERs. We strongly \n     believe it is militarily prudent to review PEACEKEEPER \n     annually. The four SSBNs will continue to operate until they \n     reach the end of their reactor core life when they will be \n     retired. With a strategic force of 14 TRIDENT SSBNs, 50 \n     PEACEKEEPER and 500 MINUTEMAN III intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles (ICBMs), and our nuclear capable bombers, we will \n     still be capable of deploying approximately 6,000 strategic \n     warheads as allowed by START I. The statutory provision that \n     keeps us at the START I level for both TRIDENT SSBNs and \n     PEACEKEEPER ICBMs will need to be removed before we can \n     pursue these options.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may make one observation in reply, \nthe President's budget for 2001 includes funds to sustain our strategic \nforces at current levels. Why then did he send up a budget request to \nmaintain those strategic levels, the levels you are now asking him not \nto knock down?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the answer to that is a question back to \nthe\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nSenator from Virginia. If the President is asking for these levels, why \nwould he insist on a prohibition of his going lower? Why is he so \nconcerned he is going to go lower, if the President is asking for these \nlevels? Why does he need this provision?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, ultimately we will go lower. But we should \ntake into consideration the actions of the Duma and the fact that we \nshould study very carefully this nuclear posture in view of the actions \ntaken by the Duma.\n  Mr. KERREY. The question the Senator from Virginia asked me was, Why \ndid the President send up an authorization request for current levels \nif he was thinking about going lower? That is a good question. I am not \ncertain the President would use his authority. The question that \nprovokes is, Why, if the President is asking for existing levels, are \nthis Senator from Virginia and others so concerned that he might go \nlower? Why do we have this prohibition on any President? It is an \nunnecessary and unwarranted interference, and it makes the people of \nthe United States of America an awful lot less safe, given what is \ngoing on in Russia today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair state the allocation of the \ntime remaining between the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 14 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Virginia has 25 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is a sensible proposal \nthat merits bipartisan support.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff decided many years ago under the Bush \nadministration that we could safely go below START I force levels. \nPresident Bush signed START II, and the Senate approved it in 1996.\n  Now the Russian parliament has approved START II. That treaty cannot \nenter into force yet, due to differences over the ABM Treaty, but both \nthe United States and Russia could usefully go below START I levels.\n  The Joint Chiefs have consistently opposed the statutory ban on going \nbelow START I levels. As General Shelton said to Senator Levin in an \nanswer for the record.\n\n       The cold war is over. . . . The Service Chiefs and I feel \n     it is time to consider options that will reduce our strategic \n     forces to the levels recommended by the Nuclear Posture \n     Review. The START I legislative restraints will need to be \n     removed before we can pursue these options.\n\n  The ban that the Kerry amendment would repeal is a hindrance to \nrational planning and resource allocation. It makes us maintain forces \nthat are not needed, at the expense of more pressing needs. As General \nShelton replied to Senator Levin: ``Major costs will be incurred if we \nremain at START I levels.''\n  The Warner second-degree amendment would retain this ban for another \nyear-and-a-half, for no good reason.\n  It would prevent the President of the United States from implementing \nstrategic force reductions that are supported by our military leaders. \nIt would also prevent his successor from implementing such reductions \nfor nearly a year, and from deactivating any of those forces for \nanother 30 days beyond that.\n  This is not just a slap in the face of our President--although it is \nsurely that. It is also a slap in the face of the likely Republican \nnominee for President, Governor Bush of Texas.\n  Two weeks ago, Governor Bush proposed cuts in U.S. forces below the \nSTART II level--not just below START I, but below START II. Governor \nBush said: ``The premises of Cold War nuclear targeting should no \nlonger dictate the size of our arsenal.''\n  He may think that the White House is the home of cold war thinking. \nIf the American people should ever elect Governor Bush to be our \nPresident, however, he'll find that the cold war is alive and well a \ncouple of miles east of the White House--in his own party.\n  Governor Bush added, 2 weeks ago:\n\n       . . . the United States should be prepared to lead by \n     example, because it is in our best interest and the best \n     interest of the world. This would be an act of principled \n     leadership--a chance to seize the moment and begin a new era \n     of nuclear security.\n\n  Would the Warner amendment allow him to seize the moment? Not for \nmany months.\n  Imagine our new President negotiating with President Putin of Russia \nin 2001. Putin says: ``Let's do START III.'' President Bush (or \nPresident Gore) replies: ``Heck, my Senate won't even let me go under \nSTART I. Come back next year!''\n  Hamstringing the President in this way is silly, and we all know \nthat. The Joint Chiefs opposed it; the future Republican nominee for \nPresident wants to go far beyond it; and the Congressional Medal of \nHonor winner from Nebraska, whom the Senator from Virginia praised just \nlast night, would never undermine our national security.\n  Let's stop playing games. Let's defeat the Warner amendment and \nsupport the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will respond to some of what I have heard in today's \ndebate. My dad has an expression: Sometimes what people say is not what \nthey mean, even though when they say it, they think they may mean it. \nThat sounds confusing. I always used to wonder what he meant by that. I \nthink I understand it better now.\n  The Senator from Virginia has an amendment that, with all due respect \nto him, is bad logic, bad law, and bad politics. I know him to be a \nmuch more informed fellow. I have asked myself why, why does he have \nthis amendment? What is the real reason? I am not suggesting duplicity. \nI am not suggesting any kind of treachery, but why? Why would you have \nan amendment that says a President cannot do what a previous President \nsaid was proper to do and all the military people then and since then \nhave said we should do? Why would you do this?\n  It has dawned on me that we are finally getting to the place--I \nsuggest humbly--that I predicted we would get to 18 months ago. We are \nfinally coming out of the closet in the real debate. The real debate is \nwhether there should be arms control any longer or not. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a piece \nby Charles Krauthammer on this very point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is in the latest Time magazine. Mr. Krauthammer is a \nvery bright fellow. The thesis of his piece is that no one really \nlistened to what George W. had to say. Everybody misunderstood what he \nmeant when he stood up, with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell and \nGeorge Shultz standing behind him, and laid out his position, at least \nhis position on nuclear weapons and on national missile defense.\n  He said that what Governor Bush really means is that this is a new \nera. No more arms control, period. START I, START II, START III, START \nanything, START V--no more. He ends his article by saying we should \nmake our judgments about whether to reduce our weapons or to increase \nour weapons, or whether to build a national missile defense, \nirrespective of anything other than what we believe should be done at \nthat moment. And that dictates, he says, the end of arms control.\n  That is what this debate is about. Cut through all the haze here. The \nproblem with the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Michigan, the \nSenator from Nebraska, and my two colleagues on the floor now, is that \nwe know too much about this. We are like nuclear theologians. I have \nbeen doing this for 28 years. I used to know what the PSI of the Soviet \nSS-18 missile silo was. That is very valuable information for someone \nto have to walk around with. The old joke is that we have forgotten \nmore about these details than most people ever learned. In the process, \nwe also forgot what this is really about.\n  What is the logic of the Warner amendment? The logic is that this \nPresident cannot enter into any more agreements. Really he doesn't need \nan agreement to go down, but what they are worried about is that he \ncould decide, either with Russian President Putin or without Putin, to \ntake numbers down to the START II levels, and that that will be offered \nas a sign of good faith to Putin that the President, in fact, is ready \nto go lower, which is what the Russians want in a START III agreement.\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n  This is about arms control. Let's cut through all the malarkey. \nBefore this next 12 months are over, in the next administration--\nDemocrat or Republican--it will finally be out in the open. This place \nwill be divided between those who say that arms control has a place in \nour strategic doctrine and those who say it has no place. We are \ngetting there. We are getting there, inching to it. They are feeling \ntheir way, I say to my friend from Nebraska, feeling their way around \nthis because, up until now, arms control has been the Holy Grail of \nboth Republicans who are informed and Democrats who are informed. \nNobody except the wackos has been flat opposed to any arms control. But \nthere is a feeling emerging in the intellectual community on the right, \nas well, that what we should be doing as the United States of America, \nbecause of our overwhelming military political and economic superiority \nrelative to the rest of the world, not just the Russians--is taking \nadvantage of the luxury of dictating outcomes without consultation.\n  My friend from Virginia knows that a lot of his friends and my \nacquaintances in think tanks on the right believe what I just said. I \nam not saying the Senator does. But that is the genesis, the root, the \ncause of this debate--a legitimate debate to have. But they are just a \nlittle afraid, in this election year, to say they don't like arms \ncontrol: If we are elected, no more arms control. We will adjust, or \nnot adjust, to the levels that we choose independently, not in the \ncontext of a negotiation with anyone else. That is what this is about, \nwith all due respect to my friends who support the amendment; even if \nthey don't think that is what it is about, that it is just logical, \nrational, political purpose.\n  Think what you are saying. You are telling the President of the \nUnited States of America: you can't go down--although, by the way, \nconstitutionally we probably can't do this. He is Commander in Chief. \nNobody has been more aware than I of the prerogative of the Senate as \nit relates to the war clause and the Constitutional relationship of the \nauthority between the executive and legislative branches relative to \nthe ability to use force and/or control the forces we have.\n  The reason that there was a provision on the Commander in Chief was \nnot to allow Presidents to go to war unilaterally. It was rather to \nmake sure Congresses didn't tell George Washington he could or could \nnot move troops out of Valley Forge. They had a bad experience during \nthe Articles of Confederation. So they wrote it in saying, hey, don't \ntell the Commander in Chief he can't steam here with the fleet or he \ncan't move the flanks there, or he can't move troops from one place to \nanother. That is what somebody should do day to day. We are telling him \nin the law and in the Warner amendment that he cannot reduce force \nnumbers to something that has been negotiated and that everybody says \nmakes sense.\n\n  Let me return to the Krauthammer piece, entitled ``The End of Arms \nControl; George W. Bush Proposed a Radical New Nuclear Doctrine. No One \nNoticed.''\n  Byline: Charles Krauthammer. Concluding paragraph:\n\n       We don't need new agreements; we only need new thinking. If \n     we want to cut our nuclear arsenal, why wait on the Russians? \n     If we want to build a defensive shield, why ask the Russians? \n     The new idea--extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily \n     obvious--is that we build to order. Our order.\n       Read my lips. No new treaties.\n\n  That is what this is about. Whether old ``W'' knows it or not--and I \ndon't know that he does; I mean that sincerely; he may know more than \nall of us on the floor combined; he may know as little as it appears \nthat he knows; I don't know--this approach says ``no new treaties.'' \nThat is what this is about.\n  So I would like us to have national elections. There should be a \nnational referendum as well. We should have a national debate on that. \nI urge my friends to come out of the closet completely. Let's have an \nup-or-down debate. It is a little embarrassing to make the case for the \nWarner amendment on either logical grounds or constitutional grounds or \npolitical grounds, based on the way it is now. It doesn't add up.\n  I thank the Chair. I see my time is up. I thank my colleagues, and I \nhave a feeling this is only the beginning of what is going to be a big, \nbig, long debate--not on this particular amendment, but for this \nNation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    June 12, 2000.\n       There have been two revolutions in nuclear theology since \n     the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction became dominant \n     four decades ago. The first came in 1983. President Reagan \n     proposed that defensive weapons take precedence over \n     offensive weapons. The second happened last week. It came \n     from George W. Bush and was almost universally misunderstood. \n     Bush was said to have proposed the primacy of defensive \n     weapons over offensive weapons. That is old news. In fact, he \n     did something far more important: he proposed the end of arms \n     control.\n       This seems strange to us. For more than a generation we \n     have been living in a world in which arms control is the \n     norm. But for all of history before that, it was not: if you \n     needed a weapon to defend yourself and had the technology to \n     build it, you did not go to your enemy to get his agreement \n     to let you do so.\n       When the world was dominated by two bitterly antagonistic \n     superpowers, arms control made sense. Barely. The world was \n     made marginally safer by the U.S. and the Soviet Union having \n     a fairly good idea of, and a fairly good lid on, the nuclear \n     weapons in each other's hands.\n       For the U.S. it was important because of a rather arcane \n     doctrine called extended deterrence: we pledged to defend \n     Western Europe not by matching the huge Warsaw Pact tank \n     forces (which would have been outrageously costly) but by \n     threatening nuclear retaliation against any conventional \n     invasion.\n       Not a very credible threat to begin with. And as the \n     Soviets overcame the American nuclear monopoly, it became \n     less credible by the year. We needed arms control to ensure \n     that there would be enough American nuclear firepower \n     (relative to Moscow's) to make our security guarantee to \n     Europe at least plausible.\n       As I said, arcane. But then again, the whole arms race with \n     the Soviets had a distinctly academic, almost unworldly \n     quality. It was really a form of bean counting. Like money to \n     billionaires, it had little intrinsic meaning: it was just a \n     way of keeping score.\n       Perhaps most important, arms control gave the Soviets and \n     us something to talk about at a time when there was very \n     little else to talk about. We were fighting over every inch \n     of the globe, from Berlin to Saigon. So, every few years, we \n     would trade beans in Geneva, shake hands for the cameras and \n     thus reassure the world that we were not going to blow it up.\n       But now? That late-20th century world of superpowers and \n     bipolarity and arms control is dead. There is no Warsaw Pact. \n     There is no Soviet Union. What is the logic of tailoring our \n     weapons development against various threats around the world \n     to suit the wishes of a country--Russia--that is not longer \n     either an enemy or a superpower?\n       Yet that is exactly what President Clinton has been intent \n     on doing in Moscow this week. He is deeply enmeshed in arms-\n     control negotiations (1) to revise the treaty that radically \n     restricts America's ability to defend itself from missile \n     attack (the ABM treaty) and (2) to set new numbers for \n     American and Russian offensive missiles (a START III treaty).\n       The parts of this prospective deal that are not \n     anachronistic are, in fact, detrimental to American security. \n     One of the reasons the development of an effective missile \n     defense has been so slow and costly is that the ABM treaty \n     prevents us from testing the most promising technologies, \n     such as sea-based and space-based weapons. Even today, we \n     cannot test a high-speed interceptor against any incoming \n     missile traveling faster than 5 km per SEC, because the \n     Russians are afraid it might be effective against their \n     ICBMs. This is quite crazy. It means that because of a cold \n     war relic, the U.S. has to forgo building the most effective \n     defense it can against nuclear attack by a rogue state such \n     as North Korea.\n       But Bush's idea is significant because it goes beyond \n     questioning why we should be tailoring our defensive weapons \n     to Russian wishes. He asks, Why should we be tailoring \n     offensive weapons--indeed, any American military needs--to \n     Russian wishes?\n       He proposes to reduce the American nuclear arsenal \n     unilaterally. The Clinton idea--the idea that has dominated \n     American thinking for a generation--is to hang on to \n     superfluous nukes as bargaining chips to get the Russians to \n     reduce theirs.\n       Why? Let the Soviets keep, indeed build what they want. If \n     they want to bankrupt themselves building an arsenal they \n     will never use--and that lacks even the psychologically \n     intimidating effects it had during the cold war--let them.\n       We don't need new agreements; we only need new thinking. If \n     we want to cut our nuclear arsenal, why wait on the Russians? \n     If we want to build a defensive shield, why ask the Russians? \n     The new idea--extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily \n     obvious--is that we build to order. Our order.\n       Read my lips. No new treaties.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to pose a question or two to \nmy very dear friend and good colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will answer on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. We will do that. I ask my friend to not overextend \nhis responses.\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I won't.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator has raised a legitimate question. Are \nwe as a body in the Senate to look in a bipartisan way to future arms \ncontrol or are we not? It is a fair question given the action by this \nChamber, which is a proper action, on the test ban treaty. I fought \nhard against that. The Senator was on the other side. We rocked the \nHalls of this Chamber with that debate. But that is history.\n  I want the Senator to know that this Senator from Virginia firmly \nbelieves in an ongoing arms control process, firmly believes that this \ncountry should continue its leadership with this very important \nendeavor to try to make this a more safe world. But every arms control \nagreement that comes along is not the one we should buy into. I say to \nmy good friend, if he says this Chamber is divided, I commit this \nSenator to work, so long as I am privileged to be a Senator, for arms \ncontrol. But for some reason, the Russian Duma, although it is in \ncomparison a very new legislative body, had the opportunity to take \nSTART II and accept it, just as President Bush had signed it, put it \ninto force and effect--but how well you understand, they put conditions \non and those conditions they knew would not be acceptable in this \nChamber. So they intentionally blocked going into force and effect the \nSTART II treaty. I say to my friend, why did they do that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry?\n  Mr. WARNER. Why did the Russian Duma deliberately put conditions on \nSTART II, knowing that those conditions would never survive a vote in \nthis Chamber?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Well, I would respond rapidly by saying that we have \nenough trouble figuring what happened in this Chamber, let alone a new \nparliamentary body in a place called Russia. I think what they did was \nto put those conditions on because we had said we wanted these \nprotocols.\n  We negotiated with them. They cannot anticipate that we in the Senate \ndo not want to do what our Presidents have negotiated with them to get \ndone. But there is a little concern by them about this Senate like we \nare concerned about them.\n  They are saying: Look, you negotiated a START II treaty with us, and \nyou also negotiated demarcation protocols with us that you asked for. \nWe didn't say we want new protocols to allow certain missiles to fly at \ncertain speeds, et cetera. We didn't ask for that. You came to us and \nyou said that.\n  We agree. If you are going with the whole package you negotiated with \nus over the years, we are in on the deal. If you are not going with the \nwhole package you negotiated with us, we are not in on the deal, \nbecause we don't know what you are about.\n  I think that is what they are thinking. That is what I think. Keep in \nmind that the demarcation protocols the Senators are talking about are \nnot protocols that the Russians initiated. They did not sit down and \nsay: By the way, let's accommodate your ability to have theater missile \ndefenses. We said: We want to be able to do that. And we went to them. \nThey said: We don't want to do anything on the protocol. We said: You \nhave to. So there were negotiations for several years. And they said \nOK. Finally, they signed it.\n  That is what I think. I don't know. I have enough trouble figuring \nout this place, let alone the Duma.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in quick reply to my good colleague, he \nknows full well that those protocols put on by the Duma relate to the \nABM Treaty. That is a subject of great controversy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for just a second, those \ndemarcation protocols to the ABM Treaty were protocols that we--not the \nDuma--asked for. We asked for them. We said we will not ratify the \nextension of START II deadlines unless you, the Russians, allow us to \ntest these theater missile defenses, which you claim are in violation \nof the ABM Treaty. Unless you amend the ABM Treaty to allow us to do \nthis and also ratify START II, we will not ratify START II extension or \ngo to START III. Right?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our President doesn't take the exact turn \nin the way these things are written. The Duma knew full well that in \nthis Chamber--and, indeed, in the Congress and, indeed, in the whole of \nthe United States--there is a very serious and important debate going \non; I hope it is part of the Presidential election debates, as to \nwhether or not this Nation should allow itself to be held hostage by \nRussia in terms of a critical need to defend our Nation against the \ngrowing threat of strategic intercontinental missiles. You know that, \nand I know that. That is what these protocols go--the ability of this \nNation to defend itself. They were very clever in the Duma because they \nknew that was putting out, as we say in the military, a ``tank trap.'' \nWe were stopped cold once those protocols were put on.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield for another \nresponse? I will be very brief. Let me make an analogy for the \nchairman.\n  Say we have a contract with someone on the rental of an apartment \nbuilding. We say we want to renegotiate that contract to be able to \nrent to build 12 more units on that apartment building. We say: By the \nway, although parking is no part of this lease, we want to renegotiate \nour parking lot agreement with you as well. Before we agree to go into \na new deal with you on the building, we want to get 10 more parking \nspaces. The guy who owns the building says: Wait a minute. I don't want \nto. I will only negotiate with you on the building. We say: We are not \ngoing to do it unless you give us more parking spaces.\n  That is what we did here. They said they want to go to START III. We \nsaid we are not going to do that unless you give us more parking \nspaces--unless you allow us to do something the ABM does not allow us \nto do right now. You give us the ability to test these missiles at a \nfaster speed to be able to intercept your missiles that are called \ntheater nuclear missiles. You allow us to do that. If you do not, we \nare not going to renegotiate a deal on the whole building. Do the \nparking, or we will not even talk about the building.\n  That is what we said. We said allow us to amend ABM, or we are not \ngoing to go down to these levels.\n  That is what happened.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I don't know.\n  I must regain the floor and control it.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is welcome.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly disagree. I don't believe that \nlinkage existed in these negotiations. What is clear is that our \nPresident, in good faith--I commend our President--at the summit did \nthe best he could. I am concerned about some of the language he used in \nregard to the future discussions on the ABM Treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nwritten by William Safire, which I think in a very clear and careful \nway points out the language about which I have a concern.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 5, 2000.]\n\n                           Mistake in Moscow\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--``We have agreed to a statement of \n     principles,'' President Clinton told a joint news conference \n     in Moscow, ``which I urge you to read carefully.''\n       Noting that the Russian and American sides disagreed on \n     whether a limited missile defense against rogue states posed \n     a threat to the mutual deterrence of the ABM treaty, Clinton \n     added: ``The statement of principles that we have agreed to I \n     thought reflected an attempt to bring our positions closer \n     together . . . let me say I urge you all to read that.''\n       O.K., let's read it. The central issue is whether the U.S. \n     will allow Russia to hold us to the ABM treaty negotiated 30 \n     years ago with the Soviet Union. We want to build defenses \n     against the few missiles from terrorist nations, not the \n     thousands held by Russia. President Vladimir Putin of Russia \n     wants to make us pay for his permission by slashing our \n     offensive missile forces in Start III down to levels our \n     military leaders consider imprudent.\n       Clinton went along with the sweeping assertion that the two \n     nations ``reaffirm their commitment to that [ABM] treaty as a \n     cornerstone of strategic stability.''\n       Putin then gave Clinton a little wiggle room by agreeing \n     that the missile threat from other nations ``represents a \n     potentially significant change in the strategic situation . . \n     .'' and to ``consider possible proposals for further \n     increasing the viability of the Treaty.'' That means allowing \n     the U.S. to defend its cities against rogue nations, \n     terrorists and accidental launches only in ways that Moscow \n     approves.\n       Thrice did Clinton embrace the word viability, which means \n     ``capable of living.'' He\n\n[[Page S4617]]\n\n     committed the U.S. ``to strengthen the ABM treaty and to \n     enhance its viability'' and agreed that we ``attach great \n     importance to enhancing the viability of the Treaty. . . .''\n       So here we have Clinton breathing new life into the cold-\n     war treaty provided Putin will allow some minor amendments \n     that may not meet future U.S. defense needs.\n       And then the outgoing American president stepped into the \n     incoming Russian president's trap. He paid for Putin's \n     permission to tinker with the ABM treaty with an enormous \n     concession:\n       ``They agree that issues of strategic offensive arms cannot \n     be considered in isolation from issues of strategic defensive \n     arms and vice versa. . . .''\n       Read that again to savor its import: that is the principle \n     of linkage. It's what Putin's military wanted and what \n     Clinton never should have given.\n       ``Issues of strategic offensive arms'' means Start III: the \n     reduction of the massive U.S. and Russian arsenals. The issue \n     there is how far to cut: our military says our strength would \n     be sapped at fewer than 2,000 missiles, while the Russians--\n     who can't afford to keep that many nukes--want us to weaken \n     our worldwide missile forces by 25 percent more.\n       ``Issues of strategic defensive arms'' means ABM and our \n     national missile defense against dictators who could threaten \n     us with nuclear blackmail and against a possible Chinese \n     threat. By mistakenly linking reductions in Start III (our \n     missile offense) to the minor modification of ABM (our \n     missile defense), Clinton played into Russian hands, making \n     future arms negotiation more difficult for his American \n     successor.\n       Now here comes the strange part. Putin must know the \n     substantial difference in approach between candidates Al Gore \n     and George W. Bush, Gore goes along with Clinton and \n     presumably will embrace his ABM-Start III linkage. Bush wants \n     a free hand with a limited anti-missile system and would set \n     our offensive missiles at a level to suit our deterrent \n     needs, inviting the Russians to reciprocate. Huge policy \n     difference.\n       And yet Putin said, ``We're familiar with the programs of \n     the two candidates . . . we're willing to go forward on \n     either one of these approaches.''\n       Did he mean to ad-lib that? Was he misinterpreted? Having \n     won his linkage with Clinton-Gore, is the inexperienced Putin \n     willing to toss that advantage aside with Bush? Is a \n     puzzlement.\n       Despite Clinton's policy error, he neither embraced the \n     K.G.B.'s man nor called him ``Volodya.'' Our president's \n     demeanor remained coolly correct, and we can at least be \n     thankful for that.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is very clear that the next President \nof the United States must be given every possible bit of leverage he \ncan have as he readdresses in good faith, as did President Clinton, \nthis issue of the ABM Treaty. It could well be that the levels we are \ndebating right here in this amendment are the levels of those arms \nreductions which we all know as a certainty will be done at some point \nin time.\n  We believe, of course, in accordance with the Warner amendment, that \nit should be done after careful analyses and steps have been taken. In \nany event, we will come down to those levels. We know that.\n  But should not that next President have in his negotiating strategy \nthe ability to do those negotiations of lower levels as a part of the \nessential requirement to get some reasonable modification to the ABM \nTreaty that enables this country, as George W. Bush said in his \nstatement, to rightfully defend itself? That is what this is all about. \nDon't take away a possible negotiating bit of leverage he has with \nregard to the levels of these weapons.\n  Will the Chair advise us with regard to the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 4 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Virginia has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, rising. I see other distinguished \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to point out \nthat the START II agreement is not a unilateral agreement, it is a \nbilateral agreement. It takes the approval of both the Duma and the \nRussian leadership, as well as the United States.\n  Also, to clarify the record, in 1997 the Quadrennial Defense Review \ndidn't include a Nuclear Posture Review. I think it is entirely \nappropriate that we have a Nuclear Posture Review. Since 1994, a lot of \nleadership has changed. A lot of technology has changed. Certainly I \nwould like to see us move forward with disarmament. But it needs to be \nverifiable. It shouldn't be unilateral. I think those are two very \nimportant conditions as we move forward on the disarmament discussion.\n  I congratulate the chairman because I think he is moving forward with \nthis amendment pretty much with the strategic committee; that is, we \nneed a very careful Nuclear Posture Review. It should involve civilians \nas well as the military.\n  This is not going to happen quickly. It is going to take time. This \nshould happen no matter who the President of the United States is. We \nshouldn't rush into these agreements until we fully understand where we \nstand and where our posture is.\n  I know we have some Members on the floor who may want to speak. But I \nsay to the chairman that I think perhaps at this time we ought to have \na little bit of review as to what has been happening here in the \ndebate. I would like to take the time to do that and to clarify some \nstatements that have been made in this debate.\n  Since fiscal year 1996, Congress has passed, and the President has \nsigned, legislation prohibiting the retirement of strategic nuclear \ndelivery systems--bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and \nstrategic submarines--until the START II agreement enters into force. \nThis provision was designed to put pressure on Russia to actually \nratify the START II agreement.\n  The idea was not that they were going to send back a counterproposal \nto the United States. Again, it would have to be considered by this \nCongress. This was not an inflexible position.\n  I point out that, for example, last year the law was modified to \nallow the Navy to retire 34 Trident strategic submarines. Moreover, the \nlaw has been and continues to be consistent with the administration's \nown policy.\n  We have heard quite a bit about the statement made by Gov. George W. \nBush relating to U.S. strategic forces. What has been overlooked in his \nfocus on the need to have a comprehensive review of our strategic \nguided forces is the statement that originally was made by Governor \nBush. He said, ``As President, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture.'' Then he goes on \nto say, ``the exact number of weapons can only come'' after this \ncareful assessment.\n  I think we are very much in step with what the committee has been \nsaying, what George W. Bush would like to see happen, and what I hear \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee saying he would like to \nsee happen.\n  I would like to again review where we are with the Warner amendment.\n  The Warner amendment substitute would include additional items to be \nconsidered in the review required by section 1015, including whether \nreductions can be conducted in a balanced and reciprocal \nmanner, whether changes in our alert posture would enhance our security \nand strategic stability, and whether U.S. strategic reductions could \nadversely impact our conventional delivery systems, such as the B-52 \nbomber.\n\n  The Warner substitute amendment provides authority for the President \nto waive the limitations in current law regarding the retirement of the \nstrategic nuclear delivery systems once the Secretary of Defense has \ncompleted the Nuclear Posture Review required by section 1015.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Nebraska, on the other hand, would \nnot be consistent with a policy enunciated by Governor Bush, nor would \nit satisfy the concerns Congress has raised for the last 5 years. It \ncould lead to misguided and uninformed reductions rather than a forced \nposture review based on careful review of all of our strategic \nrequirements and how they relate to overall national military strategy.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership. I pledge that I will \ncontinue to work with the Senator for disarmament, move towards \ndisarmament, but it has to be bilateral and verifiable.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. He has served this committee very \nwell in his chairmanship. I think he has stated very clearly the issues \nin this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, in 1968 I had the good fortune, or \nmisfortune, to be given the chance to go down to Fort Benning and go \nthrough Army Ranger School. We had a little joke that was keying in on \na line from a John Wayne movie. We looked out in the darkness and said: \nIt sure is quiet out there. Somebody else would come back with a \npunchline: Too quiet.\n  That is precisely my instinct when it comes to strategic nuclear \nweapons. There is a real danger. For some reason, we understand the \ndanger if it is North Korea maybe getting nuclear weapons or Iraq maybe \ngetting nuclear weapons or Iran maybe getting nuclear weapons.\n  Russia has 7,000 strategic nuclear weapons and 12,000 tactical. These \nare not inaccurate, unreliable systems. These are very accurate, \nreliable, and deadly systems. They have more than they need, and we \nhave more than we need. Instead of pressing the President to go to \nlower levels, the current language of law and this amendment says we \nwant further delay; we want to push the President in the opposite \ndirection. We are pushing this President in the wrong way. We should be \npushing the President to go to lower levels because it keeps America \nsafe if we do.\n  Why does it keep America safe? Not only is it sort of odd to be \nnegotiating with Putin on all sorts of things at the same time that we \nhave 160 nuclear weapons aimed at Russian leadership, but in addition, \nthe Russian economy simply doesn't generate enough income to enable \nthem to be able to sustain the investments necessary to control their \ncommunity system and most importantly, their warning system.\n  So what happens? We are pushing the President to go slow, we are \nasking for more studies.\n  Mr. President, we don't need more studies. We can make this debate \nabout more and more studies, but for gosh sakes, this is one subject on \nwhich we don't need more studies. This has been examined up one side \nand down the other. We have studies coming out the wazoo. We need \ndecisions. Looking at the current situation, one can reach no other \nconclusion than that we are requiring the Russians, as a consequence of \ncurrent law, to maintain a level beyond what they can safely control, \nincreasing the risk far beyond the risk of rogue nations such as Iraq \nor Iran or North Korea, far beyond that. If there is an accidental or \nunauthorized launch that occurs as a consequence of a mistake made \nbecause of a warning failure, they are not going to send a couple. It \nwill be a couple hundred or a couple thousand.\n  I smell danger. I am glad we have had this debate, but we are pushing \nthe President in the wrong direction both with the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia and the existing law. I hope that enough \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have listened to this debate \nand will vote against the Warner amendment. I believe quite seriously \nthat it increases the risk to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. It is on a \nvery important issue. I express my gratitude to so many colleagues who \nhave participated.\n  In summary, I simply say this body, five times, has passed the \nstatute which my good friend desires to have repealed. Do not repeal \nthis statute. Do not, I say to my colleagues, in good faith, repeal a \nstatute which was signed into law five times by the President. I ask my \nfriend, what has changed to justify repealing it? He says the \nratification of START II by the Duma. Had that ratification been in \naccordance with the way this Chamber ratified it, I would say it is \ntime to let the statute go. But they did not do it. They put protocols \non that treaty which pose a great problem to the next President--\nindeed, to this President--as he saw when he went to the summit.\n  And nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet, time and time again when our President \ntried in a very rational way to determine the flexibility that Russia \nmight have on the ABM Treaty, which flexibility is essential for this \nNation to provide for its own defense. Nyet, nyet, nyet. Those are the \nonly changes since five times this Chamber has adopted that law; five \ntimes the President has signed it. The only change is a ratification of \nSTART II by the Duma, with impossible conditions put on it, which not \nonly the Senate would not accept but nor would this Nation accept.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent the portion of the 1997 QDR saying \nthat the 1994 posture review still applied and was adequate be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Nuclear Forces\n\n       Our nuclear forces and posture were carefully examined \n     during the review. We are committed to reducing our nuclear \n     forces to START II levels once the treaty is ratified by the \n     Russian Duma and then immediately negotiating further \n     reductions consistent with the START III framework. Until \n     that time, we will maintain the START I force as mandated by \n     Congress, which includes 18 Trident SSBNS, 50 Peacekeeper \n     missiles, 500\n\n[[Page S4619]]\n\n     Minuteman III missiles, 71 B-52H bombers, and 21 B-2 bombers. \n     Protecting the option to maintain this force through FY 1999 \n     will require adding $64 million in FY 1999 beyond the \n     spending on these forces contained in the FY 1998-2003 \n     President's budget now before Congress.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. That posture review supported the START II levels. Our \nJoint Chiefs of Staff support the START I levels. They want to be able \nto go to the START II levels. It has nothing to do with the \nratification by the Duma. It has to do with what we no longer need in \nour force structure, which the law requires them to maintain, and costs \ndollars that could be better used elsewhere, including for perhaps \nhealth care.\n  Mr. WARNER. I regain 30 seconds of my time. I simply say at the time \nthat was done, they did not foresee the Duma would put these conditions \non the START II treaty. That is the essence of this debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a co-sponsor of the Kerrey amendment \nand urge the Senate to adopt this important amendment.\n  Current law prohibits the U.S. from reducing its strategic nuclear \ndelivery systems below START I levels. This law requires the U.S. to \nstay at START I levels--to maintain 6000 nuclear warheads, until START \nII enters into force. This law was enacted, in 1996, just 16 months \nafter the START II treaty was signed. The amendment offered by Senator \nKerrey will repeal this law which is neither needed or helpful.\n  The START II treaty allows the U.S. to reduce the number of nuclear \nwarheads to 3000-3500, but the law requires that we maintain 6000 \nwarheads. We do not need 6000 thousand warheads and we do not need this \nlaw.\n  The Department of Defense has consistently argued that the law is not \nnecessary. When asked his view about this provision, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, was clear: ``I would \ndefinitely oppose inclusion of any language that mandates specific \nforce structure levels.'' General Shelton made it clear that the Chiefs \nalso oppose this provision: ``The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time \nto consider options that will reduce the strategic forces to the levels \nrecommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I legislative \nrestraint will need to be removed before we can pursue these options. \nMajor costs will be incurred if we remain at START I levels.'' We have \nalready spent millions staying at the START I, 6000 warhead level. For \ninstance, we are unnecessarily spending to maintain the 50 Peacekeeper \nICBMs.\n  The Nuclear Posture Review, conducted in 1994, reaffirmed that the \nU.S. did not need 6000 warheads and that the START I level of 3000-3500 \nwarheads was adequate. General Shalikashvili stated, in 1995, in \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee that ``Our analysis shows \nthat even under the worst conditions the START II force levels (3000-\n3500 warheads) provide enough survivable forces, and survivable, \nsustained command and control to accomplish our targeting objectives.''\n  It is ironic that Governor Bush criticizes the Clinton administration \nfor ``remain(ing) in a Cold War mentality'' and for failing ``to bring \nthe U.S. force structure into the post-Cold War world'' when it is this \nlaw, put in place by Congress, that requires staying in the Cold War \nmentality.\n  If this law is not repealed now, it will tie the hands of the next \nPresident, the next Secretary of Defense, as well as the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs.\n  The Warner second degree amendment would require the U.S. to stay at \nthe START I 6000 warhead level for at least another 18 months. Even \nthough there is general agreement that we need to go below the START I \nlevel of 6000 warheads, the Warner amendment would keep the U.S. at \nthis high warhead level, even though the 3000-3500 START II level has \nbeen reviewed and validated repeatedly and continually since 1992 when \nthe START II Treaty was signed.\n  In 1994 the DOD conducted a comprehensive Nuclear Posture Review that \nvalidated the START II force structure levels--3000-3500 warheads. The \n1997 Quadrennial Defense Review carefully reviewed and affirmed that \nthe START II nuclear force structure was appropriate to protect U.S. \nnational security requirements. In 1997, in preparation for discussions \nin Helsinki between the United States and Russia, the DOD and the Joint \nChiefs again reviewed nuclear force structure levels and determined \nthat an even lower force structure level at the proposed START III \nlevel of 2000-2500 warheads was adequate.\n  Just last month, in extensive testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Commander of the \nStrategic Command testified that the 2000-2500 warhead level proposed \nfor START III level was adequate to meet U.S. military requirements. \nOnly Congress is still stuck at a START I force structure levels.\n  In light of the nuclear force structure reviews that have been \nconducted since START II was signed, it is clear that force structure \nlevels will be at or below START II levels of 3000-3500 warheads. Why \ndo we have to wait another 18 months to go below the START I force \nstructure level--a level that no one seriously argues should be \nmaintained?\n  Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is a simple amendment to repeal a \nlaw whose time and usefulness has past. I urge its adoption.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKerrey motion to strike the Section 1017 of the Defense Authorization \nAct regarding U.S. strategic nuclear force levels.\n  I do not believe that the restrictions that this bill contains, which \nprevents the Department of Defense from reducing U.S. strategic nuclear \ndelivery vehicles--warheads--below START I levels until START II enters \ninto force, is necessary or, given the current international security \nenvironment, needed.\n  Striking this provision does not mandate any cuts in U.S. nuclear \nforces: It merely makes it possible, now that the Russian Duma has \nratified the START II treaty, for the U.S. to make further cuts below \nSTART I levels.\n  In fact, I believe that it is important that the President, the Joint \nChiefs, and the Secretary of Defense have the flexibility to determine \nthe appropriate force level and alert status for U.S. nuclear forces \nbased on military and security need.\n  In fact, the original reason for including this provision in the \nDefense Authorization bill in 1998 was not based on military or \nsecurity need per se, but rather to encourage the Russian Duma to \nratify START II. Well, now they have, and the U.S. should be prepared \nto reduce our nuclear forces below START I levels, consistent with our \nnational security needs, if and when Russia moves to reduce its forces \nbelow START I levels in a verifiable manner. That is what the Kerrey \nAmendment will allow.\n  Before I conclude, I would also like to take a few minutes today to \nspeak to some of the larger issues raised by this debate.\n  We no longer live in the world of the superpower nuclear arms race of \nthe 1950s, 1960s, 1970s or 1980s.\n  During the Cold War the threat of nuclear war was omnipotent, and the \nsize and configuration of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was very much a \nfunction of the Cold War international security environment and the \nneeds of nuclear deterrence with the Soviet Union.\n  But the Soviet Union is gone. The Berlin Wall came down over ten \nyears ago. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are now members of \nNATO. The world in the year 2000 is not the same as the world of \ntwenty, thirty, or forty years ago. And I believe that our nuclear \nweapons policy should reflect these new realities.\n  We live in a transformative moment for international politics: The \nsecurity structures and imperatives that guided our thinking during the \nCold War have either melted away or are malleable to change. Both Al \nGore and George W. Bush recognize that. Why should the U.S. Senate \nremain captive to the thinking of the Cold War, or to the nuclear \nweapons counting arithmetic of the Cold War?\n  The world has changed, yet as Dr. Bruce Blair, President of the \nCenter for Defense Information, has pointed out, the Single Integrated \nOperating Plan (SIOP) which guides our nuclear weapons targeting, has \nbeen growing steadily since 1993, and grew over 20 percent in the last \nfive years alone. It includes over 500 weapons aimed at Russian \nfactories in a country whose economy is all but defunct and which \nproduced almost no armaments last year, and over\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\n500 Russian conventional military targets for an army of a country that \ncan not even successfully invade itself.\n  Something is amiss. Clearly we need to retain a force capable of \nrobust deterrence. But we can not allow ourselves to pursue an outdated \npolicy that dictates an arsenal far larger than new, current-day \nreality suggests we need or is advisable.\n  I strongly believe that deterrence can remain robust with a smaller \nnuclear arsenal. Analysis by Dr. Blair and others suggests that with a \nforce of 10 Tridents, each with 24 missiles, 300 Minuteman III land-\nbased missiles, 20 B-2 bombers and 50 B-52 bombers we can assure the \ndestruction of between 250 and 1,000 targets worldwide in retaliation \nfor any strike against the United States. If this sort of retaliatory \ncapacity does not deter any adversary, than it is hard to imagine what \nwould.\n  I also believe that it is critical, as we move into this new world, \nfor the United States to review our own nuclear alert status and those \nof other nuclear capable-states. Right now the U.S. maintains 2,300 \nwarheads on launch-ready alert: 98 percent of the Minuteman III and \nPeacekeeper land-based force on 2-minute launch readiness and 4 Trident \nsubmarines, two in each ocean, on 15 minute launch readiness. The \nRussians, likewise, maintain their forces on hair-trigger alert. \nKeeping these forces on hair-trigger alert is a potential accident \nwaiting to happen, with devastating consequences if it does.\n  In January 1995 a commercial space-launch off the coast of Norway in \nthe middle of the night was almost misinterpreted by Russia as a U.S. \nTrident missile launch, despite the fact that we had pre-notified them \nabout the launch. As I understand it, Russia prepared for a nuclear \nretaliatory strike. It was only at the last minute that the Russians \nrealized that this was a commercial launch headed for space, not a \nnuclear weapon headed for Moscow and stood-down their forces.\n  These risks--these needless risks which do nothing to add to our \nsecurity but, just the opposite, make the world a less safe, stable, \nand secure place--need to be addressed.\n  And they need to be addressed in a way that will allow us to embrace \nthe challenge of the new century, not be held captive to the grim math \nof the old. As Governor Bush pointed out on May 23, ``These unneeded \nweapons are relics of dead conflicts and they do nothing to make us \nmore secure.''\n  Mr. President, I think that it is important to point out that the \nKerrey Amendment does not mandate that we cut U.S. nuclear force \nlevels. It merely gives the President, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Joint Chief the flexibility to determine whether, if and how \nlowering U.S. force levels below the START I limits would be a net-plus \nfor U.S. national security and, if it is, to do it.\n  As Senator Kerrey has argued, by mandating force levels higher than \nare needed or desired for national security needs, we actually run the \nrisk of undermining our security interests. If we force the Russians to \nmaintain at hair-trigger status more nuclear weapons than they can \nsafely control we run the risk of an accidental or unauthorized launch. \nIf we maintain our own nuclear arsenal at high levels when it is \nunnecessary to do so, we encourage rouge nations to pursue their own \nnuclear weapons programs.\n  A decade after the end of the Cold War, and on the cusp of the \ntwenty-first century, I believe that it is critical that the United \nStates Senate show a willingness to engage in the serious business of \nforging a new strategic vision. We must do so with no preconditions or \npreconceived notions about how many, or how few, nuclear weapons are \nnecessary. If an objective review of our national security needs \ndictate that we should maintain an arsenal at START I levels, then I \nwill be second to none in this body in insisting that our arsenal \nremain at that size. But if, as Governor Bush has suggested, deeper \ncuts are advisable, then I do not believe that artificial barriers to \nachieving this goal should be put in place by this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kerrey Amendment and strike \nSection 1017 of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back on both sides.\n  Under the previous order, amendments numbered 3183 and 3184 shall be \nlaid aside, and the Senate will resume consideration of the Warner \namendment, No. 3173. Under the previous order, amendment 3173 shall be \nlaid aside, and the Senator from South Dakota is recognized to offer a \nsimilar amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is the time agreement on the upcoming two amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 hours \nequally divided for the two amendments.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3191\n\n  (Purpose: To restore health care coverage to retired members of the \n                          uniformed services)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 3191.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 241, strike line 17 and all that follows through \n     page 243, line 19, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 703. HEALTH CARE FOR MILITARY RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n     the uniformed services who entered service prior to June 7, \n     1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by \n     reason of a service-connected disability.\n       (2) Recruiters for the uniformed services are agents of the \n     United States government and employed recruiting tactics that \n     allowed members who entered the uniformed services prior to \n     June 7, 1956, to believe they would be entitled to fully-paid \n     lifetime health care upon retirement.\n       (3) Statutes enacted in 1956 entitled those who entered \n     service on or after June 7, 1956, and retired after serving a \n     minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected \n     disability, to medical and dental care in any facility of the \n     uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and \n     facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental \n     staff.\n       (4) After 4 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 \n     and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment \n     facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a \n     military medical treatment facility is virtually nonexistent \n     for many military retirees.\n       (5) The military health care benefit of ``space available'' \n     services and Medicare is no longer a fair and equitable \n     benefit as compared to benefits for other retired Federal \n     employees.\n       (6) The failure to provide adequate health care upon \n     retirement is preventing the retired members of the uniformed \n     services from recommending, without reservation, that young \n     men and women make a career of any military service.\n       (7) The United States should establish health care that is \n     fully paid by the sponsoring agency under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program for members who entered \n     active duty on or prior to June 7, 1956, and who subsequently \n     earned retirement.\n       (8) The United States should reestablish adequate health \n     care for all retired members of the uniformed services that \n     is at least equivalent to that provided to other retired \n     Federal employees by extending to such retired members of the \n     uniformed services the option of coverage under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program, the Civilian Health and \n     Medical Program of the uniformed services, or the TRICARE \n     Program.\n       (b) Coverage of Military Retirees Under FEHBP.--\n       (1) Earned coverage for certain retirees and dependents.--\n     Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in section 8905, by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(h) For purposes of this section, the term `employee' \n     includes a retired member of the uniformed services (as \n     defined in section 101(a)(5) of title 10) who began service \n     before June 7, 1956. A surviving widow or widower of such a \n     retired member may also enroll in an approved health benefits \n     plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title as an \n     individual.''; and\n       (B) in section 8906(b)--\n       (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraphs (2) and \n     (3)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (2) through (5)''; and\n       (ii) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) In the case of an employee described in section \n     8905(h) or the surviving widow or widower of such an \n     employee, the Government contribution for health benefits \n     shall be 100 percent, payable by the department from which \n     the employee retired.''.\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\n       (2) Coverage for other retirees and dependents.--(A) \n     Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1108.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nMcCain, Bingaman, Murray, Reid, and Jeffords in offering an amendment \ndealing with military retiree health care. I first want to thank \nSenators Warner and Levin for their continued hard work in the Armed \nServices Committee in attempting to address this critical and urgent \nissue.\n  Last year, the Senate began to address critical recruitment and \nretention problems currently facing our nation's armed services. The \npay table adjustments and retirement reform enacted with my support in \nthe fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense authorization bill were, \nfrankly, long overdue improvements for our active duty military \npersonnel.\n  However, these improvements did not solve our country's difficulty in \nrecruiting and keeping the best and the brightest in the military. In \norder to maintain a strong military for now and in the future, our \ncountry must show that it will honor its commitment to military \nretirees and veterans as well.\n  Too often, military health care is treated as an afterthought rather \nthan a priority. That's why on the first day of this legislative year, \nI introduced the Keep our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act, \nS. 2003. This legislation currently has 32 bipartisan cosponsors \nincluding 18 Republicans and 14 Democrats.\n  Companion legislation in the House has over 300 bipartisan \ncosponsors. The bill also has the strong support of military retirees \nacross the country and organizations including the Retired Enlisted \nAssociation, the Retired Officers Association, the National Association \nof Uniformed Services, and the Disabled American Veterans.\n  The amendment I offer today is the same language as that contained in \nS. 2003. This legislation honors our nation's commitment to the men and \nwomen who served in the military by keeping our Nation's promise of \nhealth care coverage in return for their service and selfless \ndedication.\n  In doing so, it also illustrates to active duty men and women that \nour country will not abandon them when their military career ends.\n  Our country must honor its commitments to military retirees and \nveterans, not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because \nit's the smart thing to do.\n  We all know the history: For decades, men and women who joined the \nmilitary were promised lifetime health care coverage for themselves and \ntheir families. They were told, in effect, if you disrupt your family, \nif you work for low pay, if you endanger your life and limb, we will in \nturn guarantee lifetime health benefits.\n  Testimony from military recruiters themselves, along with copies of \nrecruitment literature dating back to World War II, show that health \ncare was promised to active duty personnel and their families upon the \npersonnel's retirement.\n  In fact, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry \nShelton, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and said:\n\n       Sir, I think the first thing we need to do is make sure \n     that we acknowledge our commitment to the retirees for their \n     years of service and for what we basically committed to at \n     the time that they were recruited into the armed forces.\n\n  Defense Secretary William Cohen also testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and said:\n\n       We have made a pledge, whether it's legal or not, it's a \n     moral obligation that we will take care of all of those who \n     served, retired veterans and their families, and we have not \n     done so.\n\n  Prior to June 7, 1956, no statutory health care plan existed for \nmilitary personnel, and the coverage which eventually followed was \ndependent upon the space available at military treatment facilities.\n  Post-cold war downsizing, base closures, and the reduction of health \ncare services at military bases have limited the health care options \navailable to military retirees.\n  That's right: Many of the people who helped us win the cold war have \nlost their health care because the cold war ended.\n  Some military retirees in South Dakota and other rural states are \nforced to drive hundreds of miles to receive care. Furthermore, \nmilitary retirees are currently kicked off the military's TRICARE \nhealth care system when they turn 65.\n  This is a slap in the face to those men and women who have sacrificed \ntheir livelihood to keep our country safe from threats at home and \nabroad.\n  My amendment honors the promise of lifetime health care coverage. It \ndoes so in two ways:\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\n  First, it allows military retirees who entered the armed services \nbefore June 7, 1956 (the date military health care for retirees was \nenacted into law) to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram (FEHBP), with the United States paying 100 percent of the \ncosts.\n  Second, military retirees who joined the armed services after space-\navailable care was enacted into law on June 7, 1956 would be allowed to \nenroll in FEHBP or continue to participate in TRICARE--even after they \nturn 65. Military retirees who choose to enroll in FEHBP will pay the \nsame premiums and fees--and receive access to the same health care \ncoverage--as other Federal employees.\n  In my own family, my oldest son is in the Army and currently serves \nas a sergeant in Kosovo. I fully appreciate what inadequate health care \nand broken promises can do to the morale of military families.\n  This stress on morale not only effects the preparedness of our \nmilitary units, but also discourages some of our most able personnel \nfrom reenlisting, making recruitment efforts more difficult.\n  I have long contended that all the weapons and training upgrades in \nthe world will be rendered ineffective if military personnel and their \nfamilies are not afforded a good ``quality of life'' in our nation's \narmed forces. I have been a strong advocate of better funding for \nveterans health care, military pay, active duty health care, education \nand housing.\n  The Johnson amendment continues these efforts led by Senator Warner, \nSenator Levin, and others to address these important quality of life \nissues.\n  Senator Warner's modified amendment incorporates an important part of \nS. 2003--the extension of TRICARE to Medicare-eligible retirees and \ndependents. I applaud the Senator for his work.\n  However, only my amendment fulfills the promise of health care for \nmilitary retirees while illustrating to current active duty personnel \nthat our country supports its commitments to men and women in the \nmilitary.\n  I am also concerned that Senator Warner's modified amendment \nterminates in 2004. This could leave military retirees once again \nwondering where their health care will come from. The Johnson amendment \ndoes not terminate.\n  I understand the rationale for Senator Warner's amendment. I am going \nto support the amendment of Senator Warner. It is a good-faith effort \nto do the best that can be done on the health care issues, within the \ncontext of the budgetary marching orders that have been imposed on \nSenator Warner's committee. I understand that. I understand he is doing \nthe best he can within the fiscal envolope that he has been afforded.\n  But it frustrates me, as I know it frustrates tens of thousands of \nmilitary retiree and active duty personnel, that for years and years we \nhave been told: Yes, we know we have a commitment to you for health \ncare but we can't afford it. The Nation's budget is in the red. We are \nrunning deficits. We simply cannot afford to live up to those promises.\n  That was never entirely true. In fact, in the context of a $1.5 \ntrillion budget, we could have reoriented priorities, I believe, in \nsuch a way that we could have kept our promises to military personnel \nand retirees. But there was an element of truth to the fact that we \nwere running red ink and we were running massive deficits.\n  Those days are gone for a lot of different reasons. We have had much \ndebate on this floor as to why we now find ourselves running \nsignificant budget surpluses over and above that attributable to Social \nSecurity and why those surpluses, projected out 10 years from now, will \nrun in the $3 trillion range, some $700 billion to $1 trillion over and \nabove what is required for Social Security because we are certainly in \nagreement we are not going to dip into anything that is attributable to \nSocial Security. That is off the table, and rightfully so. There is the \nquestion about what will we do with the $700 billion to $1 trillion \nbudget surplus that is being projected by both the White House and by \nthe congressional budget experts.\n  The amendment pending is an expensive amendment. I understand that. \nIt could run around $3 billion next year and $9 billion a year after \nthat, according to our friends at the Congressional Budget Office. That \nis a significant expense. What I am asking is if this is not a time \nwhen we can afford to live up to our promises to our military retirees \nand our military personnel, then when will that time ever occur?\n  There are those who see other uses for that $700 billion to $1 \ntrillion surplus over and above Social Security. I have other things I \nwould like to do as well, including some tax relief. There are those \nwho want tax relief in the range of essentially the entire surplus. I \nam suggesting there is room for tax relief, there is room for paying \ndown the debt, there is room for education, and a number of other \nthings. If we do this right, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \nto utilize some of that projected surplus to, in fact, finally--\nfinally--live up to our commitment to our military personnel \nand retirees, many of whom, frankly, have gone to their graves without \nthe benefits they were promised. We do have that once-in-a-lifetime, \nunique opportunity this year to do something constructive, to make a \ncommitment that we will fund this, not out of military readiness, not \nout of active duty budgets, but, in fact, out of this projected surplus \nthat the CBO and OMB people tell us is headed our way.\n\n  Military retirees and veterans are our Nation's most effective \nrecruiters. Unfortunately, poor health care options make it difficult \nfor these men and women to encourage the younger generation to make a \ncareer of the military. In fact, in Rapid City, SD, which is outside of \nEllsworth Air Force Base, a very significant B-1 military base in my \nState, I was talking to military personnel and talking to retirees who \nare as loyal and as patriotic, who have paid a price second to none for \nour Nation's liberty, and they told me: Senator, I can't in good faith \ntell my nephews, my children, young people whom I encounter, that they \nought to serve in the U.S. military, that they ought to make a career \nof that service because I see what the Congress has done to its \ncommitment to me, to my family, to my neighbors. The health care \npromises were never lived up to, and we don't think you ever will live \nup to them. You have no credibility with us. It has gone decades, it \nhas gone generations, and you have not lived up to the health care \nobligations and responsibilities that you said, if we put our lives in \ndanger, we would have. How can I in good faith tell these young people \nthey ought to make a career of the military, that it is a distinguished \nprofessional option they ought to consider, when you treat us shabbily?\n  That is the message I hear from active duty as well as retired \nmilitary personnel in my State. It is the same in the mail and e-mail I \nget from all across the country saying: 2003 is the only legislative \noption we see that truly lives up to Congress' obligations.\n  No more excuses. The money is there. The only question is, Is the \npolitical will there? Is this a priority or is it not? I am pleased we \nare having this debate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Johnson has been working on this \nissue for a long while. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a critical need. \nI ask him if he sees in South Dakota what we know and see in North \nDakota with respect to the veterans' health care system. The system is \nnot working. We have a fellow in north central North Dakota who went to \nVietnam and took a bullet in the brain and is severely disabled for \nlife. Because of that, he has muscle atrophy and a range of other \nhealth problems and had to have a toe removed.\n  The VA system said to his father: Haul him over to Fargo, ND, and we \nwill do that in the VA system.\n  In other words, take this severely disabled person, put him in a car, \ndrive him nearly 200 miles to the east and have this procedure done--\nnot a major procedure--and then drive him 200 miles back, and that is \nthe only way we will cover that expense.\n  The father said: Is this the way to treat a son who served his \ncountry in\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\nVietnam and was shot in the head and is now consigned to a very \ndifficult life? Is this a way to treat him? It is not. The health care \nsystem is not working. The VA system is not able to meet the needs.\n\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, is it not the case, in his \nopinion, that the cost of veterans' health care is part and parcel of \nthe cost of defending this country? It ought to be part of the cost of \ndefense because it is a promise we made and have not kept to veterans \nin this country when we said: Serve your country, and we will provide \nyou a health care system that works for your needs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senator is exactly right. We have a \nproblem both on the VA health care side and on the military retiree \nside; that is, those who have served their 20 years in the military and \nrely on TRICARE currently, previously CHAMPUS, for their health care \nneeds in both instances.\n  These people who have served this Nation in such an extraordinary \nfashion have, in all too many instances, not received the quality, the \naccessibility, or the affordability of health care they deserve. It is \ndoubly difficult in rural States, such as our own, but it is a problem \neverywhere.\n  It is suggested as a compromise that we simply extend TRICARE to \nthose who are age 65 and older. That is an additional option which I \napplaud, but that does not extend the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nSystem to either people prior to 65 or older and, frankly, up until \nnow, TRICARE is not viewed in my State with great enthusiasm by many of \nour military retirees. I understand it is a new program, and it may \nimprove as time goes on. Simply doing that alone falls far short of \nliving up to the obligations Congress made during times of war when we \nwere not sure if our Republic was going to survive World War II, when \nwe did not know what would happen and we called these people into \nservice, followed with Korea, Vietnam, and other conflicts, with people \ndying for our liberty. We were quick to make promises at that time: If \nyou help us out, if you work for almost nothing, disrupt your families \nand serve this Nation, we will provide you with quality health care.\n  They did their share. They came home and we said: Wait a minute, this \nis a little more costly than we thought, and we have decided to forget \nabout it.\n  We are not going to live up to those obligations. That is what this \nCongress has said through administrations of both political parties \nover the years.\n  We have an opportunity now to bring that, at last, to a halt and to \ndeal with our military retirees with a spark of integrity, at last. \nThat is what this amendment is about.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a last question?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  I assume he agrees with me we are not in any way attempting to \ndenigrate the wonderful men and women who work at the VA health care \ncenters around the country. Many of them do an extraordinary job. But \nthey are not funded well enough. We do not have the resources to do the \njob we should.\n  I just want to mention, on a Sunday morning some while ago, I was at \na VA hospital presenting medals that had been earned, but never \nreceived by an American Indian. His family came, but also at this VA \nhospital, the doctors and the nurses came into his room. I pinned those \nmedals on the pajama tops of this man named Edmund Young Eagle. He died \n7 days later. He was very ill with cancer. But it was an enormously \nproud day for him because he served his country in Africa and Europe in \nWorld War II. The fact is, this man served this country around the \nworld. He never complained about it.\n  The day I pinned the medals on his pajama tops, you could see the \npride in his eyes. I appreciated the fact that at this VA hospital the \ndoctors and nurses came around and were part of that small ceremony.\n  But there are so many people such as Edmund Young Eagle and others \nwho served their country, have never asked for much, but then need \nhealth care, only to discover that the system for delivering that \nhealth care is not nearly funded well enough, while in the Congress, \nsomehow we are more eager to say that defense relates to the things in \nthe Defense Department and that the VA health care system is somehow \nnot part of that obligation. It is part of that obligation. That is why \nI am pleased to support this amendment.\n  As I mentioned, I say to Senator Johnson, he has been working on \nthese issues for a long while. I hope the Congress will embrace this \napproach now so that we can be as proud of what we are doing for \nveterans and for their health care needs as Edmund Young Eagle was \nproud that day of serving his country.\n  Isn't it the case that we have dramatic needs--underfunding in these \nfacilities--and that the Senator's approach to dealing with this would \nsay it is a priority in this Congress to address the health care needs \nof veterans and we believe the health care needs of veterans are part \nand parcel of this country's defense requirements?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I think the Senator from North Dakota raises an \nexcellent point. He himself has been a champion for veterans and \nmilitary retirees.\n  Obviously, when we come to the point of the VA-HUD appropriations \nissues, we will do the very best we can within the VA context, while at \nthe same time trying to address the military retiree issues. They go \nhand in hand. They are both very much part and parcel of our overall \neffort towards military recruitment, retention, and readiness. They are \npart of that same package. I certainly commend the Senator from North \nDakota for his leadership in that regard.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I certainly yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want very much for the Senator to have a full \nopportunity to present his viewpoints, of course, in the time \nremaining. But at some point I think it would be very helpful to the \nother Senators following this debate to frame exactly what the \ndifferences are between the Senator's approach and the approach I have \nin my amendment. If he could indicate in the course of his presentation \nwhen we can bring that into sharp focus for the benefit of our \ncolleagues, I would like then to get into a colloquy, on my time for \nsuch portion of the colloquy as I expend in my statements.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The chairman, the Senator from Virginia, has a very \nconstructive suggestion. I certainly will not put words in his mouth \nrelative to the interpretation of his legislation. I applaud him for \nhis legislative efforts. But I will draw some distinctions as to his \npending amendment and my amendment.\n  I intend to vote for both amendments. My amendment is farther \nreaching and, as I am sure the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nwould note, is more costly. Because of that, it runs into additional \nparliamentary issues perhaps. But I will attempt, in closing, to draw \nsome distinctions between what it is we are trying to do.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would indicate such time it would be \nconvenient for him to proceed to questions, then I would seek \nrecognition.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Very good.\n  The opponents of S. 2003, in my amendment, again would claim that it \nsimply costs too much; roughly $3 billion in fiscal year 2001, and, \nover 10 years, CBO estimates an average cost of $9 billion a year to \nfulfill our promise of health care for military retirees. This does not \ncome cheaply. I am very up front on that fact. However, we are talking \nabout a $200 billion budget surplus--$9 billion here; $200 billion \nsurplus--$800 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years. That is a \nconservative estimate.\n  So if we look at the larger scheme of things, in terms of where this \nought to be within our budget, and also with the possibility of some \nreprioritization of the existing budget, I believe the argument that we \nsimply can no longer afford to live up to our promises to military \npersonnel who sacrificed so much, including families of those who have \ndied defending our right to be here debating this issue today, simply \nno longer holds.\n  We invest billions of dollars each year to build new weaponry, and \nrightfully so. But all the weapons in the world will be rendered \nuseless or less useful without the men and women in uniform and without \nthe high-quality, qualified personnel we need to operate them.\n  I believe a promise made should be a promise kept. We owe it to our \ncountry's military retirees to provide them\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nwith the health care they were promised. The effort behind this \namendment has been 100-percent driven by military retirees taking \naction on the benefits to which they are entitled. It is the right \nthing to do. No more tests; no more demonstration projects; no more \nexperiments.\n  I think we need to act now on a program that works, building on the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan system. On average, 3,784 \nmilitary retirees are dying each month. The time to act is now. These \nretirees have mobilized in a grassroots lobbying campaign throughout \nthe country to fight for lifetime health care.\n  I hope we do not leave this floor today without giving true access to \nhealth care to these soldiers, sailors, and airmen who have \npatriotically served our country. We have a long way to go. I will \ncontinue to work with Senators Warner and Levin, and my colleagues, to \nbe sure that our country's active-duty personnel, military retirees, \nand veterans receive the benefits they deserve.\n  Senator Warner has suggested we draw some clear distinctions between \nthe amendments. I think that is a very constructive suggestion. I am \nsure he will elaborate on the differences.\n  A difference, as I understand it, is that my amendment would allow \nthose who retired before June 7, 1956, to have fully paid participation \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That is the plan in \nwhich all Federal employees, including Members of this body, \nparticipate. Frankly, it is a very successful and very popular health \nsystem. Ask any Federal employee. They will tell you the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan is an excellent one. It provides every \ncitizen with an option, a menu, from a ``Cadillac'' to lower-priced \noption, depending on how extravagant they feel in relation to their \nshare of premiums in the health care plan.\n  For those who retired before 1956, we will say, if you want to \ncontinue to participate in TRICARE, you certainly can, but your other \noption is to move over to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, \nlike other Federal employees and like your Senator. What is good for \nyour Senator is good for you.\n  For those who retired after the magic date of June 7, 1956, we say, \nyou, too, have the option of participating in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan, or you can continue to use TRICARE. You will, \nhowever, pay premiums similar to what Federal employees pay.\n  It is not entirely free, but you will have this additional option, \nand you may continue to stay there post age 65 in retirement.\n  Our plan builds on utilization of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan, fully premium paid for those older military personnel \nwith premiums for the somewhat younger personnel, optional. And it is \nperpetual. This is not a pilot project. This is not an experiment. We \nwill not take this away from you 2 years down the road because we ran \nout of money. This is a commitment. You have to decide what your \nretirement plans are. You have to plan for that. We don't want to be \njerking the rug out from under you. We have a plan. It is there. You \nchoose it, if you choose it. No more demonstration projects that apply \nto some parts of the country and not other parts or it is in for a \ncouple years and then we will assess it and decide whether to continue \nit or not. We are not interested in that.\n  The Warner amendment, which I think is certainly a step ahead of \nwhere we are now, does move the health care benefits down the road in a \nconstructive way. I applaud the Senator for that. But as I understand \nthe Senator's amendment, it essentially allows those who are 65 and \nolder, rather than to be pushed out of TRICARE on to Medicare, to \ncontinue their participation in TRICARE health care services post 65. \nThat is an additional option. I am all for options. I think that is a \ngood thing.\n  It does cost some money. Senator Warner's amendment does fit within \nthe current budget resolution, but in order to get it within the budget \nresolution, it would terminate in 2004. It may be, if this is \nsuccessful, there will be additional revenue, and maybe we will \ncontinue it post-2004. But there is no certainty to that within the \nlegislation. It fits within the current budget resolution because it \nhas been chopped short in fiscal year 2004. So while TRICARE works \nbetter for some people than for others, it has not worked terribly well \nin my home State. My State is a rural State, which may be a bit \ndifferent. Trying to make managed care work in my State is a little \nmore difficult than it might be in other areas. I certainly concede \nthat. But in my area, even if we gave people a continued TRICARE \noption, I am not sure they would beat a path to it particularly. Some \nmay. Again, I certainly applaud the option.\n  That is the basic difference between Senator Warner's amendment, \nwhich is constructive and does give an additional option to those who \nare post 65, and my plan, which builds on the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan, applies both to pre-56 and post-56--pre-56 with premiums \npaid--and on into retirement, and gives people those options.\n  Frankly, most people I talked to, if they had a choice between \nTRICARE and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, they would run \nas fast as they can go to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, \nthe plan their Senators and Congressman have, and, for that matter, all \nFederal employees in their hometown have.\n  As I see it, put very shortly and perhaps not with as much detail \ntowards the plan of the senior Senator from Virginia, that is the basic \ndifference from which we have to choose. They are not inconsistent \nnecessarily, but I do believe that 2003 is a far, far more expansive \nand permanent approach to the urgent crisis we have for military \nretiree health care.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia has suggested that he may \nwant to comment at this stage on his amendment. I think it is \nappropriate that we discuss both of them in this context.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I advise my colleagues that at an appropriate time \nsomeone from the Budget Committee on this side of the aisle will make a \npoint of order.\n  Mr. President, we are almost parallel in thought here, certainly \nparallel in thought for the need to help the retirees. I have been \nprivileged to be in this institution 22 years. This is the first time, \nI say to my colleague, we have ever taken a step to provide for \nretirees. No one can refute that. If I may say, to push aside a little \nhumility, it came from this side of the aisle. It was not in President \nClinton's budget. It hasn't been in any of his budgets. We took the \ninitiative. We have done it carefully step by step. I commend my \ncolleague for his leadership on this issue. Indeed, it is the interest \nin his bill which has been garnered across our land that has helped our \ncommittee to, step by step, begin to increase these provisions.\n  I see my colleague wishes to make a point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for one quick comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The provision in the bill that provides the prescription \ndrug benefit for retirees was a bipartisan effort in our committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Senator said it came from a certain side of \nthe aisle. It was not in the President's budget, but it was a \nbipartisan effort in committee which I now believe the President \nsupports.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once we took the initiative on our side of \nthe aisle in the committee, we had bipartisan support across the board. \nThe Senator is absolutely right. The point is where we are. We are \nfaced with constraints in military spending, as we are in all other \navenues. Let's make it clear--let's see if the Senator and I can \nagree--the CBO, in costing out my bill, said it would be about $40 \nbillion over 10 years. Will the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is as I understand it.\n  Mr. WARNER. The CBO, looking at the Senator's bill, said it would \ncost about $90 billion over 10 years.\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Nine billion per year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct. So the difference between the two approaches is \nvery significant in terms of dollars. In fact, the distinguished \nSenator's bill would cost along the following lines: He said $3 billion \nin fiscal year 2001; $5.7 billion in 2002; up to $8.3 billion in 2003; \n$9.4 billion in 2004; and going out to 2010, $12 billion. So those are \nthe figures. I think we are in agreement as to the dollar consequences \nof the two bills.\n  Yesterday, my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of this \ncommittee, when I raised the amendment, said that a point of order \nwould rest. The inference was clearly that it would be brought against \nmy amendment. Whereupon, I thought it imperative that I take my \namendment and amend it, which I did, to just go out to the year 2004. \nBy so doing, the expenditures under my bill, as they flow out through \nthese years, bring it within the Senate budget resolution and, \ntherefore, does not make it subject to a point of order.\n  I think we can agree on that point.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am in agreement with the Senator on that issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. But my distinguished colleague proposing this amendment \nhas decided not to try to take a similar action with regard to his \namendment. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The retiree community, in particular, following this, \nwill say to the Senator from Virginia: Why did you cut short to 2004? I \nsimply say: Because the likelihood of getting 60 votes was in doubt, \nand I didn't want to have that doubt. I wanted to make sure we got \nstarted on some major incremental series of benefits for retirees. That \nis why I did it. I made that calculation. I take full responsibility \nfor having done it.\n  Now, let's see if we can narrow the differences between the approach \nof my colleague and the one I take. I summarize it as follows: I have \nprovided in my bill, albeit only through 2004, every provision the \nSenator has. Particularly, I commend him for waiving the 1964 law--not \nwaiving it, but taking it off--which was essential. We did that \ntogether.\n  The main difference is the coverage that is given to these retirees \nunder the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; would I be correct \nin that?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I believe that is a key difference. Also is the fact \nthat this legislation of mine does address the issue of free medical \ncare.\n  Mr. WARNER. But my point is, had it been able to go out 10 years, we \ncontinue to use that baseline. I am absolutely confident that this \nissue of retiree health care will be injected into the Presidential \ncampaign. Each candidate will be asked what position he wants to take \non that. I am certain they will. And should my amendment be adopted by \nthe Senate and become the law of the land, and given that it has to \nstop in 2004, the first question I would ask the candidates is, Are you \ngoing to support rewriting the Warner amendment such that it goes out \nin perpetuity? I forewarn the candidates to be prepared to answer that \nquestion.\n  I support, of course, that action by the Congress, with the support \nof the next President, to make it in perpetuity. But going back to the \nSenator's point, coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram is what takes my bill from $40 billion to yours to at $90 \nbillion; are we correct on that? Let's address the situation.\n  We passed--I believe it was 2 years ago--a program to allow the \nretirees to decide whether or not they wanted to go into this Federal \nhealth program. Interestingly, we allowed up to 66,000 to enter under \nthat experimental test program. Mr. President, astonishingly, only \n2,500 of those eligible opted to do it, indicating to our committee \nthat they felt if they could get the full benefits offered to them when \nthey were on active duty in their retired status, they preferred to \nhave that rather than to go into the Federal health program. What \nclearer evidence could there be? We offered 66,000 a chance to do it \nand only 2,500 accepted.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator will yield on that point, apart from the \nfact that the military retiree organizations themselves are telling us \nin no uncertain terms that they prefer the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan coverage, I think the following points need to be made. \nFirst, relative to this 66,000 test program, there was, in fact, I am \ntold, a lack of timely delivery of accurate, comprehensive information \nabout the Federal Employees Health Benefits Test Program. Some of those \nsurveyed claimed that townhall meetings sponsored by the Department of \nDefense to promote the test were poorly planned and publicized. Many \nretirees noted the inability to get accurate information and forms from \nthe Department of Defense call center.\n  Frankly, there has been a fear of the unknown with the test program. \nRetirees are being asked to change health programs for a test program \nthat ends in 2002. Many retirees are worried they would have to simply \nchange back at the end of the test period. One retiree responded to the \nmilitary coalition survey by saying, ``I just could not risk having to \ntry to get insurance at age 73 should the demonstration fail to be \nrenewed.'' That may have been a misperception, but it was one that \nskewed the results of the 66,000-member test. There is no doubt about \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, clearly some of that may have \ntaken place. It is better that retiree organizations should certainly \nhave tried to give them the information and explain it. They have done \na magnificent job in explaining what my colleague is offering in his \namendment.\n\n  I wish to return to the following. Here we go. We are now taking the \nretirees who are given only Medicare, and the Warner bill now restores \nthem to the full rights they had when they were on active duty in terms \nof health care. My good friend, Senator Johnson, wants to offer them \nalso the chance to go into the Federal program, and the cost of that is \nlargely borne by the Federal Government. That raises his amendment up \nto twice the cost of mine, using the 10-year average. But we are giving \nthem both.\n  At the same time, I project that the Congress is going to be called \nupon, should the Warner amendment or the Senator's amendment become \nlaw, to begin to add funds for the existing military health care \nprogram so that it can absorb back this community. That is not an \ninsignificant expenditure. Now, having done that, which we have to do \nunder either amendment, then to offer them the chance to go into the \nFederal program, you put the infrastructure in place, they don't avail \nthemselves of it, they go into the Federal employees program, and you \nhave built a big medical program that will not be fully utilized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator will yield for a moment, one of the \nbenefits of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is it doesn't \nrequire a large, new infrastructure to be set up. People simply choose \nthe insurance policy of their wish and they go to whomever they wish, \nwhether managed care or fee for service, and you are not left with \ntrying to create a new Federal bureaucracy or structure.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. But am I not also correct that if \nwe mandate by law that the existing military health program has to \nabsorb back into it this class of retirees, they will have to augment \ndoctors, nurses, perhaps modest increase in facilities, and all of the \nother infrastructure that is necessary to give these people fair, good \nquality health care; am I not correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am not sure I understand the Senator's point on this. \nIn fact, it would seem to me that more military retirees will have \ntheir own personal health care services taken care of, and there would \nbe less reliance on the existing military health care structure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the number of retirees over 65 is roughly \n1.4 million persons. Under the Warner amendment, as well as the Johnson \namendment, they are now taken back into the existing infrastructure \nthat cares for active duty and under-65 persons. Anyone would know that \nwith 1.4 million now given the opportunity to come back in, you would \nhave to augment and refurbish that system. This will be a justifiable \nissue before the Congress very quickly. I am certain the Secretary of \nDefense--the next Secretary--in the posture statement of the next \nPresident will say: All right, Congress; you said we are to take them \nback. We are happy to take them back, but give us the funds to \nrefurbish and\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\naugment that system. That will be done.\n  That system will be prepared to take back these people, and at the \nsame time, you are saying to these people while we put the \ninfrastructure in place, you may decide not to use it and go off here \nand avail yourself of other taxpayer dollars--namely, paying a premium \nof 70-plus percent, in most cases, to go into the private sector. Of \ncourse, there is no augmentation to the private sector. The private \nsector could probably absorb this class. There could be a competition \nbetween the private sector and the military infrastructure. But the \nmilitary infrastructure has to be put into place. As you say, very \nlittle would have to be done in the private sector to absorb them.\n\n  So that is the reason, I say to my colleagues, no matter how \nlaudatory the amendment would be. I suggest we go a step at a time in \ntreating these people fairly. And we have taken the initiative to do \nit. Let's do it a step at a time and first refurbish the existing \nmilitary system to accept them back and give it a period of several \nyears under my amendment to see how it works before we take the next \nleap and put on the American taxpayers double the amount of money that \nmy amendment would cost.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is to clarify the differences between the approaches. \nI understand there is another difference between the two, which is that \nTRICARE would be available to all over 65 under both proposals, but \nunder the proposal of the Senator from Virginia, TRICARE would only be \navailable for those who pay Part B.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is accurate in his statement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Whereas, under the Johnson proposal, Part B would not have \nto be paid for by retirees in order to have TRICARE provided to them.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe the Senator indicated before that TRICARE was \navailable to all retirees under both proposals, that this would be one \ndifference in that regard, and that under your proposal, Part B would \nnot have to be paid for by the retiree; whereas, under the proposal of \nthe Senator from Virginia, it would have to be. I am not arguing the \nmerits or demerits, but factually that is a difference; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would you give both times?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 46 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I join Chairman Warner in expressing \nmy gratitude to Senator Johnson for his leadership on this issue. He \nmade some very salient points on which I hope to reflect in my comments \nin support of the Warner-Hutchinson amendment.\n  The question here is not one of sentiment. It is not one of seeing \nthe problem. It is not one of wanting to act and to act now. The \nquestion is, What is the realistic way?\n  The fact that the Johnson amendment will cost over $90 billion and \nwill be subject to a budget point of order, which Senator Levin saw fit \nto raise in regard to the underlying Warner-Hutchinson amendment which \nwould have made this permanent but has not seen fit to raise against \nSenator Johnson, but undoubtedly that is going to happen, that is a \nhuge barrier, as we know, and a big problem.\n  I think we have to do something this year. That is why I am glad to \nrise and join Senator Warner in introducing the Warner-Hutchinson \namendment for the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n2001.\n  I want to comment also on Senator Dorgan's points concerning the VA \nhealth care system; that it was this Congress last year that increased \nVA medical care spending by over 10 percent, the largest single \nincrease in VA health care spending in over a decade; that, indeed, \nwith our veterans, as well as with our military retirees, our \ncredibility is in tatters when it has been this Congress that has been \ndetermined to take the steps necessary to restore that credibility and \nto restore that confidence--with the pay raise last year, with the 10-\npercent increase in VA medical spending, far above the President's \nbudget request, and now with this enormous step. Let us not, in \ncomparing it with Senator Johnson's broad amendment, try to minimize \nthe significance of the step that will be taken under the Warner-\nHutchinson amendment. I am glad to be a sponsor of this amendment in \nintroducing it.\n\n  In my experience as the Armed Services Committee Personnel \nSubcommittee chairman, and in my experience as a member of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee--I have served on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee in the House and in the Senate since I came to Congress--I \nvisit regularly with retired military personnel on a broad range of \ntopics.\n  Time and time again when speaking with military retirees, or \nresponding to letters of concern, the subject of adequate health care \ncoverage comes up. Senator Johnson is absolutely right about the \nfeelings expressed by our military retirees and their concerns since we \nhave broken our commitment and our promise to them.\n  The citizens of our country who have served proudly in the armed \nservices prefer to be doing other things than spending their time \npetitioning Members of the Senate. They are mature, humble, and they \nare patriotic by nature. But in this situation, they simply must speak \nout. These fine Americans have been slighted as the years have passed. \nThey have seen benefits erode. They have seen promises broken or the \nfulfillment of promises delayed.\n  No issue causes more distress than the lack of comprehensive medical \ncare as part of their retirement benefits. Military retirees are \nannoyed. They are more than annoyed. They are distressed. They feel \nbetrayed. They have witnessed bureaucratic stalling through trial \nprograms and tests that serve no purpose and simply nibble around the \nedges of the problem. They do not provide the kind of permanent and \ntangible fixes to the inadequacies and shortfalls of the medical care \nsystem.\n  I want to share a couple of quotes from several of the thousands of \nheartfelt letters I have received on the subject of military retirees \nin my home State of Arkansas. These letters from Arkansans who have \nserved faithfully in our Nation's Armed Forces are a mere \nrepresentation of the sentiments expressed by military retirees all \nacross the Nation.\n  Col. Bob Jolly, of Hot Springs, AR, echoes the feelings of many \nothers when he writes:\n\n       Thousands of military retirees are dying each month while \n     denied the health coverage our government willingly gives all \n     other federal retirees. We older retirees, now in our sixties \n     and seventies, cannot wait for your Senate colleagues to \n     prescribe years of tests to receive the care we were promised \n     and have earned through decades of fighting our nation's \n     wars.\n\n  Then, in a letter Mr. Stewart Freigy, a retired Air Force pilot from \nHardy, AR, writes:\n\n       My decision to make a career of the Air Force was based on \n     two things. First a sense of patriotism instilled in me as a \n     child. The second factor was a promise by my government that \n     if I served twenty years, I would receive half of my base pay \n     plus free medical and dental care for myself and my \n     dependents for the rest of my life. By the time I retired, \n     the dental benefits were already gone. Since then I have \n     watched the erosion of my benefits through Champus and then \n     through Tri-Care. In short, like many other military \n     retirees, I feel I have been deceived by a government that I \n     served faithfully.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time we let retired military personnel know that \nthe Senate hears their plea for justice and equity. How we handle this \nissue will not only send a message to these Americans that correction \nis on the way, but it will also send the proper message to those on \nactive duty and to those young people who are considering whether or \nnot they want to enter the Armed Forces or whether they want to make a \ncareer of the military.\n  I have heard from recruiters time and time again since I assumed the \nposition as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee that the most \nimportant pool from which to attract military recruits is the children \nof those who had\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\ncareers in the military. When their parents feel betrayed, it becomes \nincreasingly less likely that they are going to make the choice to go \ninto the military themselves. It is important that Congress and the \nAmerican people demonstrate that we are going to honor our promises to \nour military personnel.\n  The Warner-Hutchinson amendment will permit military retirees to be \nserved by the military health care system throughout their lives \nregardless of age and active duty or retirement status. That is an \nincredibly huge and important step for this Congress to take. Under our \nproposal, the current age discrimination will be eliminated. No one \nwill be kicked out of the military health care system just because they \nturn 65.\n  Let us not minimize and let us not underestimate the dramatic step of \nthe Warner-Hutchinson proposal: No more age discrimination, no more \nkicking military retirees out of the health care system and forcing \nthem to leave the doctors and the system with which they have been \nserved for many years and with which they are familiar. Beneficiaries \nwill continue their health care coverage in a system with which they \nare comfortable and will not be forced to pay the high cost of \nsupplemental insurance premiums to ensure their health care needs are \nadequately provided. Medicare will pick up what Medicare pays for, and \nTRICARE will be the supplemental plan to pick up the remainder.\n  It is a dramatic, important, and positive step and commitment we are \nmaking. This initiative will act as a statement of our absolute \ncommitment to the promises made to those who have faithfully served the \nUnited States of America in our Armed Forces.\n  As Senator Warner stated, improving the military health care system \nhas been the top priority of the Senate Armed Services Committee this \nyear.\n  Last year, we did the pay raise. Personnel chiefs tell me that has \nmade an enormous difference in their ability to go out and recruit. It \nhas improved morale in the Armed Forces. This is the next big step: \nImproving the health care system both with the prescription drug \ncomponent as well as this very major step we are taking for our retired \nmilitary. Hearings have been held on this issue, and input from \nretirees has been received and has been heard loud and clear.\n  Time and again, our extensive review of the situation has highlighted \nthe importance of retiree access to the health care system and to \npharmaceuticals, with pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs being the \nNo. 1 concern for retirees. This already addresses the issue of \npharmaceutical actions by providing a pharmacy benefit with no \nenrollment fee for both the retail and mail order programs. On a \nbipartisan basis, that has been included. It is an important provision \nwith overwhelming support.\n  The Warner-Hutchinson amendment complements that pharmacy benefit and \ncontinues the efforts of the committee to provide a comprehensive \nsolution to the issue of health care for America's deserving military \nretirees. By adopting this amendment the Defense authorization bill \nwill provide a comprehensive health care benefit for all of our \ncountry's military retirees.\n  As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I am well aware of the \nother legislative alternatives that have been proposed. There has been \na very positive, productive colloquy and debate on the floor on these \nalternatives. However, I believe strongly that the Warner-Hutchinson \namendment provides the most effective and realistic remedy in a \nfiscally responsible manner. America's military retirees were promised \na health care benefit. They served our country and we, as a nation, \nneed to fulfill our duty by honoring the commitments made to them. This \namendment does that.\n  I applaud Senator Warner and his leadership on this issue, his \nwillingness to take this bold step. I believe this amendment will pass \nwith overwhelming support. I appreciate Senator Johnson's continued \nleadership. I know this will be a debate that continues in the years to \ncome. It should not preclude first taking this step. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I applaud the work the Senator from Arkansas and the \nSenator from Virginia have done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I certainly yield to the ranking member.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I assure my friend from Arkansas, when I inquired \nyesterday about whether or not the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia was subject to a point of order, that was the only amendment \nthat was at the desk to which I could make such an inquiry to which the \nParliamentarian could respond.\n  Now that the Johnson amendment is there, I ask the same question: Is \nthe Johnson amendment subject to a point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). In the opinion of the \nParliamentarian, it is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While we are on the subject, there is now apparently some \nindication that there may still be a point of order problem with the \nWarner amendment which we are trying to assert.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, I will address that issue. In the course of \nour floor consideration, we frequently ask the CBO for their estimates. \nThey gave me estimates yesterday which they have now revised this \nmorning.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3173, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia \nmay modify his amendment. I have sent to the desk such an amendment, \nwhich reduces the year of my amendment from 2004 to 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, so we are all very clear, because there has been some discussion \nas to the differences between the two amendments, if this modification \nis made, the length of time that the Warner provision would be in \neffect, then, would be the years 2002 and 2003 instead of 2002, 2003, \nand 2004. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have no objection. I think it is important everyone \nunderstand.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Michigan. We all have to rely \non these estimates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3173), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 701 through 704 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 701. CONDITIONS FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR CHAMPUS UPON THE \n                   ATTAINMENT OF 65 YEARS OF AGE.\n\n       (a) Eligibility of Medicare Eligible Persons.--Section \n     1086(d) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) The prohibition contained in paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply to a person referred to in subsection (c) who--\n       ``(A) is enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance \n     program under part B of such title (42 U.S.C. 1395j et seq.); \n     and\n       ``(B) in the case of a person under 65 years of age, is \n     entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act pursuant to subparagraph (A) \n     or (C) of section 226(b)(2) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 426(b)(2)) \n     or section 226A(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 426-1(a)).''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``paragraph (1) who \n     satisfy only the criteria specified in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (B) of paragraph (2), but not subparagraph (C) of such \n     paragraph,'' and inserting ``subparagraph (B) of paragraph \n     (2) who do not satisfy the condition specified in \n     subparagraph (A) of such paragraph''.\n       (b) Extension of TRICARE Senior Prime Demonstration \n     Program.--Paragraph (4) of section 1896(b) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ggg(b)) is amended by striking \n     ``3-year period beginning on January 1, 1998'' and inserting \n     ``period beginning on January 1, 1998, and ending on December \n     31, 2001''.\n       (c) Effective Dates.--(1) The amendments made by subsection \n     (a) shall take effect on October 1, 2001.\n       (2) The amendment made by subsection (b) shall take effect \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Adjustment for Budget-Related Restrictions.--Effective \n     on October 1, 2003, section 1086(d)(2) of title 10, United \n     States Code, as amended by subsection (a), is further amended \n     by striking ``in the case of a person under 65 years of \n     age,'' and inserting ``is under 65 years of age and''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. My amendment is now modified so it is not subject to a \npoint of order.\n  Our distinguished colleague is subject to a point of order, and at an \nappropriate time he will raise that point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3191\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I make a clarification relative to my \namendment. There may have been some confusion earlier. I wish to make \nit very clear that under my amendment those who entered the armed \nservices prior to June 7, 1956, would be eligible for Federal employee \nhealth benefit plan coverage with the Government paying 100 percent of \nthe premiums. Those who entered the armed services after June 7 of 1956 \ncan choose Federal employee health benefit plans with premiums or \nTRICARE. I want to make sure that point is very clear.\n  There has been reference to points of order, and the Senator from \nVirginia is very correct that a point of order will be raised on my \namendment. My amendment does cost more. It does more and it costs more. \nIt is perpetuating. It is not a 2-year commitment.\n  A point of order, while not taken up lightly, is simply an \nopportunity to determine whether 60 votes in this body believe the \nissue at hand is of sufficient importance that it ought to have that \nfirst level of concern, that priority.\n  The question is, Are we going to pass or waive a point of order with \n60 votes and invade surplus dollars that otherwise are available for \ntax cuts or are we going to put our money where our mouth is? Do we \nhave the 60 votes to say we will use those dollars, at least that part \nof it that is required, that $90 billion out of the $800 billion or so \nthat is available, for this purpose?\n  One of the things that makes this debate interesting, and the \nparliamentary process interesting, I don't know if we have the 60 votes \nto waive the order or not. After all these years of Veterans Day and \nMemorial Day rhetoric about how important our veterans are, this at \nlast will be an opportunity for every Member of this body to stand up \nand be counted. Is that rhetorical support or are you willing to put \nthese priorities ahead of other budget priorities, including tax \nrelief? Are you willing to waive the Budget Act and make this happen or \nnot? If you are not, I respect your views. Members can go home and \nexplain that. That is certainly your prerogative.\n\n  It is long overdue. We have an opportunity for some accountability \nfor the American public to understand who is willing to truly make this \na budget priority and who is not. If you are not, then you have those \njustifications that you can make. That is what the nature of this is. \nThis is not because it is more costly, that this is an impossible \nprogram. It will require 60 votes, assuming that the point of order is \nraised, rather than the 50 votes of the Senator from Virginia.\n  It will allow the Senate to make a determination in this body whether \nthese priorities are ahead of other priorities that people have, a \nthousand other things for which they want to use the budget surpluses. \nNo doubt almost all of them are worthy causes. But is this only one of \nmany, many causes, one that we are going to cut short after only 2 \nyears, and then provide less than the full level of commitment to the \npromises made to our veterans or is this, in fact, a first priority and \nwe are complying with our promises, albeit belatedly, but a full \ncommitment permanently, and in order to do that invade into surpluses \ndollars that no doubt other people on both sides of the aisle have \nother purposes for which they can use the dollars? That is the question \nwith which ultimately we have to contend.\n  My colleague from New York has come to the floor and has a 1 minute \nrequest on an unrelated issue. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nNew York be permitted 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let's have clarified the amount of time \nremaining under the control of the Senator from South Dakota and the \namount of time under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 33 minutes. The \nSenator from South Dakota has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is 17 and 33. I say to my friend, I am prepared to \nyield back a considerable amount of my time because I think our \ncaucuses are about to meet. It is very important. If he would give me \nsome estimate of what he desires, and I will just do basically half \nthat time remaining and do a quick wrapup?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, we have no additional speakers on my side. I agree we ought \nto expedite this debate at this point, unless the Senator has other \nspeakers to whom I would choose to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I am ready.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I will be open to conveying back my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Let's clarify one other thing. Senator Levin \nbrought up the points of order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that it be in \norder for the Senator from Virginia to raise a point of order that the \nJohnson amendment, No. 3191, violates section 302(F) of the Budget Act, \nand that would take effect after my vote. Then there would be a point \nof order, and the Senator could, at this time, ask for the waiver.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order. Mr. \nPresident, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. So at the conclusion of the brief remarks from my \ncolleague, say not more than 2 minutes on my behalf, we then proceed to \nthe votes as they have been ordered previously? That order, of course, \nis we will vote--I think the Presiding Officer should state the order \nof votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote will be on the Warner amendment \nNo. 3173, followed by a vote on the waiver of the budget point of \norder. If the waiver vote is successful, that is to be followed by a \nvote on the Johnson amendment. If it is not successful, the vote will \nbe on the Warner amendment, No. 3184, followed by a vote on the Kerrey \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Does the Senator have anything further? Otherwise, I will just say \ntwo words.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. It is my understanding, then, the Johnson amendment, the \nwaiver vote on the Johnson amendment, will be the first vote? If that \nis successful----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be the second vote, following the \nvote on the Warner amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Warner vote then is the first vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Followed by the point of order on the Johnson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The waiver.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes. And we would each be permitted 2 minutes apiece at \nthat time, at the time of that vote--that is my understanding--if that \nis acceptable?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will follow my colleague with maybe 2 \nminutes of remarks if he has any concluding remarks before we proceed \nto the sequence of votes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, you yield such time under your control?\n  I am prepared to yield my time, reserving a minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say once again I thank the Senator from South \nDakota. He has been a leader on this issue. Indeed, his amendment has \nbeen widely supported throughout the retirement community.\n  I have come in with the second-degree simply to say we should take \nthese steps incrementally, one after another. Let us bring the retirees \nback into the fold of the military health care system. Let us build the \ninfrastructures necessary to take care of them and try that out in the \nlight that only 2,500 ever opted for the Federal program out of 66,000 \neligible. Let us try that out for the 2 or 3 years my program would be \nin effect.\n  The next President will have to address this situation. The next \nCongress will address this situation. But we will have made enormous \nprogress if the Senate will adopt the Warner amendment. Indeed, it \nrepresents well over two-thirds of the amendment by our distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota.\n  The only thing remaining is whether or not we should give both at \nthis point in time, which would double the cost over a 10-year period. \nIt would double\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nthe cost if we gave them the option of the Federal program in addition \nto what we are giving them under the Warner amendment; namely, now back \ninto the system which has taken care of them for the period of their \nactive duty and that period between the termination of their active \nduty and retirement up to age 65.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is making important strides in \nworking to improve health care benefits for our military retirees. A \ncase in point is the Defense Authorization measure before the Senate \ntoday, which includes significant improvements in pharmacy benefits for \nmilitary beneficiaries as well as several demonstration projects \nintended to evaluate long range health care solutions for military \nretirees.\n  But more needs to be done. We recognize that, and we are working to \nremedy the current situation. Senator Warner's proposal to permit \nmilitary retirees aged 64 or older to remain under CHAMPUS and TRICARE \nby requiring these plans to be secondary payers to Medicare is a good \nstep in the right direction, a responsible step, and I strongly support \nit.\n  I also commend Senator Johnson for the laudatory goal of his \namendment, but absent a plan to pay for such a sweeping reform, I fear \nthat we are getting ahead of ourselves. The Senate has not set aside \nany money to pay for this proposal, and without a sure source of \nfunding, we are offering our military retirees little more than an \nempty promise. For this reason, I am opposed to waiving the budget \npoint of order against the Johnson amendment.\n  The Senate has been moving toward improved medical benefits for all \nmembers of the military, active and retired, over the past several \nyears. Health care benefits remain a top priority. Senator Warner's \nproposal to provide specific enhanced health benefits for older \nretirees for a three-year period while continuing to explore, test, and \nevaluate a long term solution is a prudent course of action. It gives \nus the opportunity to address the immediate health care needs of \nmilitary retirees, while also giving Congress needed time to assess the \nbest long-term solution, and to provide the necessary funding for \nwhatever solution we reach.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate has just spoken on one of the \nmost important national security issues facing this Nation today--the \nquality of health care services we provide for those who have so \nselflessly served this Nation. As pointed out during this debate, we \npromised millions of Americans lifetime, quality healthcare as partial \ncompensation for their service to this country. Sadly, for far too many \nof America's veterans, this promise remains unfulfilled.\n  The amendments just voted on by the Senate represent efforts by their \nsupporters to keep that commitment. These measures adopted a \nfundamentally different approach toward solving this problem. And \nalthough I had some reservations about each, I supported both.\n  I would like to briefly discuss my reasons for doing so. However, \nbefore getting into the specifics of these very different amendments, I \nwould like to commend the efforts of Senators Johnson and Warner. As a \nresult of their hard work, we are much closer than ever before to \nkeeping our health care commitment to this Nation's veterans. They are \nboth to be commended for keeping this issue alive and forcing the \nSenate to deal with it on the bill currently before us.\n  Under current law, military retirees under the age of 65 are eligible \nto enroll in TRICARE Prime or to use TRICARE's insurance programs. \nThose who use TRICARE's insurance may also seek care at a military \ntreatment facility, MTF, on a space-available basis. Once retirees turn \n65, they are no longer eligible to use TRICARE, though they may \ncontinue to seek care at an MTF when space is available. The same \neligibility rules apply to survivors of veterans. Unfortunately, the \nshortcomings of the current system are well known to thousands of \nAmerica's veterans. I receive letters virtually every week describing \nthe failures of TRICARE.\n  Senator Johnson's amendment would address some of these failures and \nincrease health insurance benefits for retirees. Specifically, retirees \nwho entered military service before June 7, 1956 and their spouses \nwould be able to use military health insurance and enroll in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP. Those enrolling in \nFEHBP would pay no out-of-pocket premiums. Military retirees who \nentered the service after June 7, 1956 and their survivors would be \neligible for increase coverage regardless of their age. They could \neither enroll in FEHBP or use TRICARE's insurance program.\n  Senator Johnson's amendment clearly would provide better health care \ncoverage for millions of veterans. My concerns with it are twofold and \nboth are cost-related. First, I am somewhat troubled by the overall \ncost of this proposal. Although I believe no price is too high to keep \nour commitment to America's veterans--and Senator Johnson's amendment \ncertainly represents a giant step in that direction--I wonder whether \nthere may be a more cost effective means of doing so. Second, I am \nconcerned that for those retirees who entered service after 1956 and \nwho choose FEHBP, the Government would only pick up about 70 percent of \nthe premium. Retirees and their families would be expected to pick up \nthe remaining 30 percent. Depending on the plan chosen, this could \nrepresent an annual out-of-pocket expense of $2,000 or more--not an \ninsignificant expenditure for many.\n  Senator Warner's amendment also has merit as well as one fundamental \nflaw. Under the Warner amendment, all Medicare-eligible retirees would \nbe allowed to remain in TRICARE. In other words, TRICARE would be a \nsecond-payer to Medicare, covering certain costs above and beyond those \ncovered by Medicare. This change would greatly improve the quality of \nhealth care provided to our Nation's veterans. Unfortunately, in order \nto comply with a flawed Republican budget resolution, Senator Warner \nwas forced to sunset this new benefit in 2003. In other words, the \nWarner amendment provides veterans a new health benefit with one hand \nand, two years later, takes it away with the other.\n  As I said at the outset, I supported both of these amendments despite \nthe flaws I have just discussed. I did so because I believe it is \nimportant we focus on the forest and not the trees and because both of \nthese amendments would bring us closer to keeping this Nation's \ncommitment to its military retirees. And I did so because I believed it \nwas the right thing to do. I commend Senators Warner and Johnson for \ntheir work on behalf of our veterans and look forward to working with \nthem to fulfill the promise we made to those who sacrificed so much to \nserve this Nation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner. \nIt takes the next step toward honoring the promise of lifetime health \ncare for our military retirees. It removes the Title 10 provision that \nlimits eligibility for military health care benefits to retirees under \nthe age of 65.\n  The amendment expands health care benefits for Medicare-eligible \nmilitary retirees by removing the age limitation on who qualifies for \nmilitary health care programs. It gives all military retirees one \nconsistent health care benefit, with TRICARE supplementing Medicare \nafter the retiree reaches the age of 65. This is the right thing to do \nfor our retirees.\n  I also support the amendment offered by Senator Johnson. It corrects \nan inconsistency in access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram. Currently, our retired service members do not have the \nopportunity to participate in this program. While the out-of-pocket \ncosts for some health plans offered under FEHBP may make this approach \nless attractive to senior military retirees, they should be given the \noption to join. Again, this is only fair. One, consistent health care \nprogram for all beneficiaries makes sense and is the right thing to do.\n  I commend Senator Warner and Senator Johnson for their leadership in \nthis important area. I support their amendments, and I urge my \ncolleagues to approve them.\n  This year is, indeed, the Defense Department's ``Year of Health \nCare!'' In the Armed Services Committee, we began the year considering \nhow to improve health care for active duty service members and their \nfamilies, and to address the well-documented health\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\ncare needs of military retirees, especially those over the age of 65.\n  The Administration's budget request was a major positive step for \nactive duty service members and their families. It proposed to expand \nTRICARE Prime to the families of service members who live far from \nmilitary hospitals. It also proposed to eliminate the co-payments by \nactive duty service members' families for medical care by civilian \nhealth care providers in TRICARE Prime.\n  We heard testimony from Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, the Service \nSecretaries, and each of the Service Chiefs, that the availability of \nhealth care for senior military retirees is a serious problem. They are \nconducting a variety of TRICARE demonstration programs to find the best \nway to address it. We also heard from retirees and the organizations \nthat represent them that the problem is urgent, and that Congress needs \nto act now.\n  A promise of lifetime health care was made to our service members at \nthe time of their enlistment. We have an obligation to meet that \ncommitment. It is wrong that service men and women who have dedicated \ntheir lives serving and defending our country should lose their \nmilitary health care benefits when they reach the age of 65. We must \nfix this injustice, and we must do it now.\n  The pending DOD Authorization Bill takes a first step towards \nhonoring this promise by giving military retirees a retail and mail-\norder pharmacy benefit. Almost a third of them already have this \nbenefit. 450,000 military retirees over the age of 65 have a pharmacy \nbenefit under the base closing agreement. It provides a 90-day supply \nof prescription drugs by mail for an $8 co-payment, or a 30 day supply \nof prescription drugs from a retail pharmacy network for a 20 percent \nco-payment. The pending Defense Authorization Bill expands this benefit \nto all 1.4 million Medicare-eligible retirees. It makes sense, and it \nis fair that all military retirees over 65 have the pharmacy benefit, \nnot just those affected by the base closing process.\n  This pharmacy benefit addresses one of the most important concerns of \nthe military retiree community--the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  All of us are pleased that the Senate is taking this step to make \ngood on our promise of health care to military retirees. But we should \nnot forget the millions of other senior citizens who need help with \nprescription drugs too.\n\n  It's long past time for Congress to mend another broken promise the \nbroken promise of Medicare. Medicare is a guarantee of affordable \nhealth care for America's senior and disabled citizens. But that \npromise is being broken every day because Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs. It is time to keep that promise.\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1965, only three percent of private \ninsurance policies offered prescription drug coverage. Today, ninety-\nnine percent of employment-based health insurance policies provide \nprescription drug coverage--but Medicare is caught in a 35-year-old \ntime warp.\n  Fourteen million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries--one-\nthird of the total have no prescription drug coverage today. The most \nrecent data indicate that only half of all senior citizens have drug \ncoverage throughout the entire year.\n  The only senior citizens who have stable, secure, affordable drug \ncoverage today are the very poor, who are on Medicaid. The idea that \nonly the impoverished elderly should qualify for needed hospital and \ndoctor care was rejected when Medicare was enacted. Republicans say \nthey want to give prescription drugs only to the poor. But senior \ncitizens want Medicare, not welfare.\n  Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the \nmedicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses.\n  Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or \ndon't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs.\n  Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the \ndrugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while \nalmost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from \nnegotiated discounts.\n  Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to \nMedicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or \ncannot afford to take them correctly.\n  Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures \nfor a host of dread diseases. But millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nwill be left out and left behind if Congress fails to act. In 1998 \nalone, private industry spent more than $21 billion in conducting \nresearch on new medicines and bringing them to the public. These \nmiracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing \nunnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery.\n  All patients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, \nMedicare, which is the nation's largest insurer, does not cover \noutpatient prescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with \ndisabilities pay a heavy price for this glaring omission.\n  The ongoing revolution in health care makes prescription drug \ncoverage more essential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs \nunder Medicare is as essential today as was coverage of hospital and \ndoctor care in 1965, when Medicare was enacted. Senior citizens need \nthat help--and they need it now.\n  So I say to my colleagues--while we are making good on broken \npromises, it's long past time to cover prescription drugs under \nMedicare for all elderly Americans. If we can cover military retirees, \nwe can cover other senior citizens too.\n  Elderly Americans need and deserve prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their \nchildren and grandchildren. It is time to make this need a priority as \nwell.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nneed for responsible military health care reform.\n  There is a critical need for real military health care reform. I am \nconcerned that if this amendment passes today, that this body, as well \nas the lower chamber, will wipe their hands of this problem and move on \nto other issues. Our servicemembers past, present, and future deserve a \nworld class military health care delivery system, and the Congress \nshould accept no less.\n  When the defense bill before us today came out of committee, I voted \nagainst it for several reasons. One of the most pressing reasons was \nthat the health care legislation included in the defense authorization \nbill did not address the broken ``promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over age 65. Voting for its passage would have \nbeen an abrogation of my responsibility as a Senator to let our \ndeclining military health care system continue without a responsible \nlegislative remedy.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern among military retirees and \ntheir families is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over age 65. While the Committee included some key \nhealth care provisions, they failed to meet what I think is the most \nimportant requirement, the restoration of this broken promise.\n  This week, we recognize the anniversary of the invasion of the \nEuropean continent to free hundreds of millions of people from the \ngrasp of a tyrannical dictator. Our servicemembers have served \ncourageously in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and other locations \nthroughout the world. We owe our servicemembers, past, present, and \nfuture a health care delivery system that adequately supports those who \nhave served with honor and courage throughout the years.\n  Today, our military health care delivery system is facing some very \ndifficult and costly challenges. One of these is how best to \nreconfigure the military health care delivery system so that it might \ncontinue to meet its military readiness and peace-time obligations at a \ntime of continuous change for the armed forces. In the process of \ndeciding how to proceed, I have met with and heard from many military \nfamily members, veterans and military retirees from around the country. \nI have been inundated with suggestions for reform.\n  In every meeting and in every letter, I encountered retired service \nmen and women who have problems with every aspect of the military \nmedical care system--with long waiting periods, with access to the \nright kind of care, with access to needed pharmaceutical drugs, and \nwith the broken promise of lifetime health care for military retirees \nand their spouses. I heard these\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nconcerns expressed as I have traveled across the United States over the \npast year. I was proud to introduce S. 2013, the Honoring Health Care \nCommitments to Service Members Past and Present Act of 2000.\n\n  S. 2013 was drafted with the help of the Military Coalition and the \nNational Military and Veterans Alliance. The Military Coalition has \nstrongly endorsed S. 2013, stating, ``We applaud your leadership in \nintroducing comprehensive legislation aimed at correcting serious \ninequities in the military health care benefit.'' I am proud of the \nwork on S. 2013, and I was prepared to re-introduce key provisions of \nthis bill as an amendment to the defense authorization bill.\n  However, the Warner amendment, and the more comprehensive Johnson, \nCoverdell, and McCain amendment, are coming up for a vote today, and I \nwould like to comment on their attributes and my concerns.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues, Senators Johnson and \nCoverdell, whose amendment fully restores the ``broken promise'' to our \nmilitary retirees and their families. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment, as well as their companion bill, S. 2003.\n  This amendment fully restores the ``broken promise'' by providing \nfree military medical health care to military retirees and their \nspouses. I am a strong proponent of this amendment, because it gives \nthe retirees what they were promised, military medical health care for \nlife. This health care would be provided through the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program (FEHBP). I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment. Our service members deserve our support, and we have an \nobligation not to renege on a promise made to them many years ago.\n  As I have mentioned, I was prepared to offer an amendment today--a \nversion of S. 2013--that builds on the limited health care improvements \nprovided in the defense authorization bill. However, I have decided to \nwithhold my amendment at this time to fully support the Johnson \namendment, as well as vote for the Warner amendment. The Warner \namendment provides a substantial increase in the health care benefit \nprovided to over-65 military retirees and their families that current \nlaw and the Armed Services Committee-reported bill, S. 2549, have \nfailed to address. The Warner amendment is not a perfect solution, but \nit is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their efforts to address \nmany of these important military health care challenges. Not lost on \nany of us is the urgent need to address the over-age-65 issue, since \nthere are reportedly 4,000 World War II, Korean and Vietnam War-era \nmilitary retirees dying every month. It is imperative that as changes \nare made to our nation's armed forces, Congress not only stay focused \non bringing health care costs under control, but that steps be taken to \nretain the health care coverage so critical to our nation's active duty \npersonnel, their families, retirees, and survivors.\n  Make no mistake, retiree health care is a readiness issue as well. \nToday's servicemembers are acutely aware of retirees' \ndisenfranchisement from military health coverage, and exit surveys cite \nthis issue with increasing frequency as one of the factors in members' \ndecisions to leave service. In fact, a recent GAO study found that \n``access to medical and dental care in retirement'' was a significant \nsource of dissatisfaction among active duty officers in retention-\ncritical specialties.\n  Mr. President, this year will be, in the words of the Joint Chiefs, \nthe year of health care reform. Whether we are successful or not will \ndepend on several factors: Congress' ability to realize real health \ncare reform and provide the necessary resources, the Pentagon's ability \nto work with private industry to control costs on pharmaceuticals and \nhealth insurance plans, and the military retirees who utilize the \nsystem coming together and galvanizing support for the future of \nmilitary health care.\n\n\n            Vote on Amendment No. 3173, as further modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the Senate just conducted two very \nsignificant and unprecedented votes--unprecedented in the respect that, \nas the good chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee has pointed \nout, this is the first time that the Congress has taken steps to \nprovide health care equity for our Nation's military retirees. This \neffort was not led by the White House. It was led by Congress and by \nmilitary retirees across the country.\n  I have been deeply involved in this issue for many years now. As my \ncolleagues know, I am the lead cosponsor of S. 2003, Senator Johnson's \nbill to restore the broken promise of lifetime health care made to \nmilitary retirees. The mere presence of this bill, as Chairman Warner \nnoted, drove the debate on military retiree health care this year and \nmoved us to the point where we are today--on the verge of enacting the \nfirst comprehensive solution to the military retiree health care issue. \nThis is a matter of fairness for military retirees, but our goal must \nbe accomplished without destroying the fiscal discipline that has made \nthis day possible.\n  As a result, even though I am the lead cosponsor of S. 2003 and fully \nsupport its objectives, I could not vote to waive the budget point of \norder raised against the amendment today. The Senate has budget rules \nthat must be protected if we want to ensure, year-in and year-out, that \nall of the Nation's priorities are fairly and appropriately funded. \nThese are the fiscal rules of the road that have enabled us to balance \nthe budget, to create unprecedented surpluses for the first time in \ndecades, and to contemplate any funding for a military health care \nproposal such as this. Once the rules are broken, fiscal discipline \nwill evaporate. Deserving long-term priorities would be pitted against \nthe politically popular causes of the moment in a rush to tap the \nsurplus dollars first.\n  We must also remember that we are working with the fourth consecutive \nbalanced budget that protects Social Security--a tremendous exercise in \nfiscal restraint that the Senate must not abandon. Preserving Social \nSecurity has been a priority for the American people for a long time \nand it took the Congress many years to make it a reality. If we begin \nour fiscal work by\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\neviscerating the budget rules, we will put the Social Security surplus \nand the retirement benefits for millions of senators at great risk.\n  I could have taken the politically expedient route, the easy route by \ncasting my vote to waive the budget rules. But that vote would not have \nchanged the outcome or brought us closer to passage of S. 2003. Had the \nmotion to waive the budget rules prevailed, it would have set a \ndangerous precedent and ultimately would make it more difficult to \nprotect the funding needed to restore the broken promise. My vote today \nto preserve the budget rules, notwithstanding my strong support for \nmilitary retirees, represents my view that the work of the Nation must \nmove forward and that it will not unless the Senate works responsibly \nwithin the budget process in order to balance competing demands for \nfunding.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the gains on this issue today would \nnot have been achieved without the introduction of S. 2003. At the \nbeginning of this Congress, we were at ground-zero on this issue--the \nsame place as in every previous Congress. We made headway this year in \nthe Armed Services Committee and with our colleagues on the Budget \nCommittee. Today, Senator Warner's amendment, while not everything we \nwanted, did take an important step forward by giving military retirees \none part of what they deserve--the ability to keep their military \nhealth benefits when they reach Medicare eligible age. I believe the \nSenate has demonstrated a new found commitment to our Nation's military \nretirees and I look forward to continuing our work to restore the \nbroken promise in full.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3191\n\n  Mr. WARNER. We are ready for the vote on a point of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of the two leaders, that the next \ntwo votes be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a point of order has been raised on the \namendment of the Senator from South Dakota. I would like to have \nSenator Gramm of Texas recognized to argue that point of order and that \nhis name replace my name on having made it. He is on the Budget \nCommittee. I simply made it on behalf of the Budget Committee. He makes \nit in his own right, my name to be deleted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind everyone that 4 years ago we \nmoved to begin to correct an injustice in military medicine, and the \ninjustice was that if you served in the military for 20 or more years, \nyou received a commitment, at least in your mind and I believe in \nreality, that you and your dependents would have access to military \nmedicine for the rest of your life. When Medicare came in and the \nfederal government started making the military pay Medicare payroll \ntaxes, it stopped allowing retirees over 64 to use military medicine. \nThat was a breach of faith. Then we started an experiment 4 years ago \nto allow them to use their Medicare coverage to obtain treatment at \nbase hospitals again. The Warner amendment we just adopted will allow \npeople who served a career in the military to get treatment at base \nhospitals from military doctors, and have Medicare pay the cost. It is \na good idea and I strongly support it.\n  Now, Senator Johnson has offered an amendment that on its face has \nmerit, and that is to put military retirees into FEHBP. Maybe in the \nlong run that is the answer to the problem. But the problem with \nSenator Johnson's amendment today is that it busts the budget by $92 \nbillion. So I urge my colleagues, whether they support the FEHBP \nsolution or not, to not bust the budget today. Let's stand with the \ntaxpayers today, and let's also complete the Medicare subvention \nexperiment, and let's take up Senator Johnson's proposal when we know \nhow to pay for it. I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I join Senator McCain and the other \ncosponsors in support of this legislation. We have a fundamental \nquestion before us, and that is whether the military retirees of this \nNation deserve to have the same kind of health care system that Members \nof this body have, or other Federal employees, through the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan. That is the amendment that the military \nretiree organizations are asking to have and we can, once and for all, \nbe done with the question about whether we are going to live up to our \ncommitment to our military personnel in terms of the medical care that \nthey were promised and which they deserve.\n  I think there is an across-the-board agreement in this body that if \nwe are truly going to live up to this obligation, this legislation is \nwhat we have to pass. It would involve a waiver, and the fundamental \nquestion we have, then, is whether we have 60 votes in this body to get \ninto the surplus dollars, or whether those surplus dollars will remain \navailable for tax cuts and other purposes.\n  If you believe that military health care is a first priority, ought \nto come first, rather than the crumbs that come after we have made \nother budget decisions, you will support the Johnson-McCain amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we had a very good debate on this. I see \nit slightly different. What we are doing in the Johnson amendment is \ngiving two health care programs to military retirees. We are giving \nthem the military health care program and then asking the taxpayers to \nadd on the tax burdens of the Federal program. So it is not the same as \nwe get; we do not get the military program. I have to correct the \nSenator. There are two systems if you vote for that. That is why his is \n$90 billion over 10 years versus the Warner amendment, which is $40 \nbillion.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, given Senator Warner's observation, I ask \nunanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Saying our military retirees would beat a path to the \nFederal system offering TRICARE as an alternative--frankly, that is an \nunpopular option. This Johnson amendment is what the military retirees \nwant and deserve.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the issue before us is whether we are going \nto waive the budget point of order. I insist on the point of order and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Buget Act. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my understanding we are now to turn to the \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, after the \nnext two votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Following that, after the two votes, if two votes are \nnecessary, the Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. After the amendments of the Senator from Nevada are \ndisposed of, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized as the manager of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3184\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for 5 consecutive years, the Senate has \nput language into law with the President's signature reserving these \nnumbers, which the distinguished Senator from Nebraska now wishes to \nstrike from 5 years of consecutive law signed by the President.\n  The Warner amendment simply says that the President, whether it be \nPresident Clinton or the next President, should follow a very careful \nprocedure before changing the numbers, of strategic systems; namely, to \ndo a QDR process which takes into consideration not only the strategic \nweapons but the conventional weapons and then do an updated posture \nstatement regarding exclusively the strategic.\n\n  Those are prudent steps that should be taken. In essence, this \nChamber recognized that in the 5 consecutive years we have kept this \nlanguage in.\n  Given the nyet--no, no, no--that our President received in Moscow on \nthe ABM issue, he may well need the leverage given by the 5 consecutive \nyears of law. My amendment gives the President the right of waiver, but \nit imposes on him the need to take a prudent managerial course of \naction before any decision is made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, with great respect to the Senator from \nVirginia, both the underlying law and his amendment push the President \nin the wrong direction. Both Russia and the United States have more \nnuclear weapons than we need. This has been studied to death. There are \nplenty of studies, plenty of reviews, plenty of evaluation. Gov. George \nW. Bush, with Henry Kissinger, with George Shultz, with Brent \nScowcroft, and with Colin Powell, has it right. It requires new \nthinking. We will not only be pushing President Clinton in the wrong \ndirection, but if Governor Bush wins, we push him in the wrong \ndirection. We are forcing the Russians to maintain nuclear weapons in \nexcess of what they can control. As a consequence, we are increasing \nthe risk, threat, and danger to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues, in as strong a language as possible, to vote \nagainst the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The yeas and nays have \nnot been ordered on the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on the \nunderlying amendment, as amended. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have worked out, hopefully, a mutually \nagreed upon unanimous consent request. I will slowly propound it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous order for Senator Warner to \nbe recognized to offer an amendment on working capital be laid aside to \nrecur following the disposition of the BRAC amendment.\n  I further ask that on the Reid amendment, it be limited to 1 hour, \nwith 45 minutes under the control of Senator Reid and 15 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Warner, and no second-degree amendment in order \nprior to the vote in relation to the amendment.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the Reid \nissue, Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his HMO amendment, and \nthat there be 2 hours equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the \nvote.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Kennedy issue, \nSenators McCain/Levin be recognized to offer their amendment, re: BRAC, \non which there will be 2 hours equally divided, under the same terms as \noutlined above; namely, an hour under the control of Senators McCain \nand Levin, and 1 hour under the control of Senator Warner.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Warner amendment, \nSenator Wellstone be recognized to offer his amendment, re: Child \nsoldiers, on which there will be 30 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form and under the same terms as outlined above.\n  I further ask consent that during the debate today or tomorrow, the \nfollowing Members be recognized for debate only: John Kerry for up to \n60 minutes and Senator Feingold for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate the distinguished chairman and his interest in accommodating \nthe many colleagues who want to offer amendments. I think we are almost \nthere. I don't think we are quite able to reach agreement yet on this \nside. I wonder if it would be appropriate, given the fact that we could \nnot yet agree to that sequencing, if we might proceed with the \namendment to be offered by the Senator from Nevada, and while that \namendment was being considered, address the other parts of the \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nconsent request just propounded by the Senator from Virginia. If he \nwould be interested in pursuing that approach, we might be able to find \nsome final resolution to the other elements of the proposal he \nsuggested.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly respect the contribution by \nour distinguished minority leader. I don't have any other recourse.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the other side has advised Senator Warner \nthat the unanimous consent can be accepted provided that paragraph 3 \nrelating to Senator Kennedy be taken out. I agree to that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not--\nwe agreed that Senator Kennedy would have an amendment or amendments \nsequenced at a later time.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I am not \nsure I will--I ask for a continuation of the quorum call for another 3 \nminutes, if I may. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again propound the amended unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n  (Purpose: To permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \n     service-connected disability to receive military retired pay \n          concurrently with veterans' disability compensation)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid), for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McCain, \n     Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3198.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. CONCURRENT PAYMENT OF RETIRED PAY AND COMPENSATION \n                   FOR RETIRED MEMBERS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Concurrent Payment.--Section 5304(a) of title 38, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) and \n     section 5305 of this title, compensation under chapter 11 of \n     this title may be paid to a person entitled to receive \n     retired or retirement pay described in such section 5305 \n     concurrently with such person's receipt of such retired or \n     retirement pay.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     and apply with respect to payments of compensation for months \n     beginning on or after that date.\n       (c) Prohibition on Retroactive Benefits.--No benefits shall \n     be paid to any person by virtue of the amendment made by \n     subsection (a) for any period before the effective date of \n     this Act as specified in subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 109 years ago, for reasons no one can quite \nunderstand, a law was passed that prevented someone who had a service-\nconnected disability from drawing disability at the time they were \ndrawing retirement pay from the U.S. military.\n  If someone is injured, for example, in combat, they are eligible for \na disability pension. If they have military service for 20 or 30 years, \nthey are eligible for retirement. But under a quirk in the law that has \nbeen around for 109 years--let's assume the disability is $200 a month, \nand the retirement is $500 a month--the person who has been injured in \ncombat must either waive his entire disability or take $200 from \nretirement to receive the $200 of disability.\n  To say the least, this is certainly not an incentive for someone to \nstay in the military, in addition to its basic unfairness. For example, \nsomeone can retire from the Forest Service or the Department of Energy \nor the Department of Treasury --any executive office--and have a \ndisability from the military. They could draw both retirements. But if \nyou retire from the military, you can't. Certainly this is a \nnonincentive to stay in the military.\n  If an individual leaves the military and begins a career in the \nexecutive branch, that person may receive both entitlements, but not if \nthey choose to serve our country in the U.S. military.\n  It seems unusual to me at a time when the military is having \ndifficulty retaining personnel. This is, to say the least, ridiculous. \nThis amendment will encourage improvement and retention for armed \nservices.\n  This bill has been introduced in its substantive form in this body. \nThere is a similar measure in the House of Representatives that has \napproximately 250 sponsors.\n  In effect, this amendment will permit retired members of the armed \nservices who have a service-connected disability to receive military \nretired pay concurrently with veterans' disability compensation.\n  The original law was passed in 1891 to prohibit concurrent receipt. \nIt is time we eliminate this unfair law that has been an injustice for \n109 years. This law discriminates against military men and women who \ndecide to serve their country as a career, whereas a civil service \nretiree's pension may be received in its total in addition to the \ndisability from the U.S. military.\n  Totally unfair.\n  This discriminates unfairly against disabled career soldiers. In \neffect, they must pay their own disability as a result of this quirk in \nthe law. Military retirement pay and disability compensation are earned \nand awarded for entirely different purposes: One is for having served \nyour country for a specific period of time; the other is for having \nbeen injured while you were a member of the U.S. military.\n  Retirement with service disability compensation for injury incurred \nin the line of duty certainly is deserved. This amendment represents an \nhonest attempt to correct an injustice that existed for far too long. \nIt affects approximately 437,000 disabled military men and women. Each \nday, this great country of ours loses 1,000 patriots who served as \nmilitary combatants in World War II. Every day, there are 1,000 deaths \nof World War II veterans. Each day we delay the passage of this \nlegislation, thousands of men and women are denied their benefits.\n  Some say this is too expensive. I say no amount of money can equal \nthe sacrifices these military men and women have made. Yesterday, in \nthis Senate, Strom Thurmond, who is approaching 100 years of age, spoke \neloquently of his feelings about World War II. Following his statement, \nSenator Durbin of Illinois gave a very compelling statement regarding \nStrom Thurmond. Strom Thurmond is an example of the sacrifices people \nmade in World War II. Even though he was over the age where people \nwould normally go into the armed services, he went into the armed \nservices as a combat military man and, in a glider, went into Europe \nwhere he was injured and still suffers some disability from his \ninjuries.\n  In this Chamber there are many others who sacrificed significantly as \na result of World War II: Senator Dan Inouye, who I am happy to say is \ngoing to receive a Congressional Medal of Honor for his valiant service \nin Italy; Senator Fritz Hollings served valiantly in World War II; \nSenator Warner served toward the end of World War II, as he stated on \nthe floor today. This amendment recognizes the people who served in \nWorld War II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, and the other skirmishes we \nhave had since then. People who have been injured and have service-\nconnected disability who have been able to finish their full term in \nthe U.S. military deserve both benefits. That is what this amendment is \nall about.\n  Recently, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus \nof about $160 billion. A few of those dollars should be used to take \ncare of this\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\nanomaly in the law. The best use of the budget surplus is to support \nthis concurrent receipt legislation. Our veterans earned this. Now is \nour chance to honor their service to our Nation. It comes a little late \nfor many of these service-connected veterans.\n  This amendment is supported by veteran service organizations: the \nDisabled Veterans, the American Legion, and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica.\n  The interesting thing about this law that prevents this concurrent \nreceipt now is that nobody knows why it originally was passed. There is \na lot of conjecture. Maybe it was to relate to the fact that we didn't \nhave large standing armies in 1891; maybe it was that only a small \nportion of what we did have in the military consisted of career \nsoldiers. We don't know. What we know now, 109 years later, is it is \nunfair. It is unfair that a person who served this country, was \ndischarged honorably, and has a service-connected disability, can't \ndraw both benefits. That is what this amendment does.\n  The present law discriminates against career military men and women, \nwhen you consider when they retire from some other branch of our \nGovernment they can draw both benefits.\n  I respectfully request of the managers of this legislation that this \namendment be accepted. I am happy to have a vote, if that is what is \nrequired. I think if there were ever an example of where we should send \nthis to the House by unanimous vote, this is it. This is fair. This \namendment is supported by many veterans organizations; to name only a \nfew, the Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, and Paralyzed \nVeterans of America. They and the American public deserve to have this \ninjustice corrected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  How much of the 45 minutes have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada used 9 minutes and 20 \nseconds of the 45 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment by the distinguished \nminority whip, the Senator from Nevada, is one I intend, as manager of \nthe bill, to accept because it has in it some provisions we have \nstudied for many years. I think it is important we study it in the \ncontext of the conference. I am strongly in favor of a number of the \nconcepts the Senator has raised.\n  At the appropriate time I will indicate the acceptance of the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask the Senator, would it be appropriate, then, \nif the Senator accepts my amendment, that following accepting this \namendment, the Senator from Wisconsin have 12 minutes and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. If I might inquire, for the purpose of addressing \nthe Senate--not for putting in an amendment?\n  Mr. REID. For debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is 12 minutes and 10 minutes. That falls within the \nperiod the Senator has reserved. We will put that in the form of a \nunanimous consent request.\n  I thank the Senator for reference to those who served in World War \nII. I don't want to put myself in any category of the heroism displayed \nby Senator Inouye. I was a simple sailor serving in training command, \nwaiting for the invasion of Japan. I always want to be careful.\n  Mr. REID. I only say to my friend, we are all aware of the work the \nSenator has done and the love the Senator has for the military, having \nbeen one of our Secretaries.\n  Yesterday was a very moving day, to see our President pro tempore \nstep down here and speak with the strong voice that he has, recognizing \nthe sacrifices made by others. He didn't, of course, mention his own \nname, but he is an example of what has made our country great.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for that reference to Senator \nThurmond. Indeed, he crossed the beaches in a glider and crashed and \nwas wounded. He got out and took right on his duties.\n  Also, late last night, Senator Carl Levin and I put in an amendment \nwhich was accepted, was cosponsored by all the veterans of World War II \nwho are now in the Senate, some eight or nine, and it provided $6 \nmillion toward the memorial that is being constructed on The Mall.\n  Earlier that day, our former distinguished majority leader and \ncolleague, Robert Dole, accepted a $14.5 million contribution. Together \nwith the $6 million of the Senate, and my understanding from Senator \nDole, with whom I spoke late last night, that brings within completion \nthe budget they had for design, construction, and otherwise for that \nmemorial.\n  It was a historic day.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, following the acceptance of my \namendment, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, be recognized for \n12 minutes on general discussion, not to offer an amendment; following \nthat statement, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, be \nrecognized for 10 minutes to speak on an unrelated subject and not to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwant to advise Senators that was in the timeframe allocated to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada for the purpose of his amendment. \nThat is how this time was freed up. Otherwise, Senator Levin and I are \nanxious to keep this bill moving.\n  Following presentations by two distinguished colleagues, we should \nproceed, then, to the McCain-Levin amendment on base closure.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, he is absolutely right. The only reason \nwe are doing it this way is just to make the process a little more \norderly.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Has my amendment been accepted then?\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3198) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4635-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4635-S4636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nZimbabwe Democracy Act of 2000. I am very pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Frist, in cosponsoring this legislation and sending an \nunambiguous signal to the current government of Zimbabwe that the \ninternational community will not passively stand aside while that \ncountry's great promise is squandered; the United States will not \nremain silent while the rule of law is undermined by the very \ngovernment charged with protecting a legal order; this Congress will \nnot accept the deliberate dismantling of justice and security and \nstability in Zimbabwe.\n  Since the ruling party lost the outcome of a February referendum, in \nwhich voters rejected a new constitution which would have granted \nPresident Robert Mugabe sweeping powers, a terrible campaign of \nviolence has gripped the country. Veterans of Zimbabwe's independence \nstruggle and supporters of the ruling party have invaded a number of \nfarms owned by white Zimbabweans. When the courts ordered the police to \nevict the invaders, President Mugabe explicitly continued to support \nthe invasions, and called on the police force to ignore the court. \nPredictably, confusion and violence have ensued, and the rule of law, \nthe basic protections upon which people around the world stake their \nsafety and the safety of their families, has been seriously eroded.\n  This is not a race war. Let me repeat that--this is not a race war. \nRace is not the critical issue in Zimbabwe today. And no one need take \nmy word for that. One need only look at the facts on the ground. One \nneed only observe the disturbing frequency with which members of the \nopposition have been the targets of violence. It is the Movement for \nDemocratic Change, an opposition party that has been rapidly gaining \nthe support of the disillusioned electorate, that is the real target of \nPresident Mugabe's campaign. It is the electorate that rejected the \nruling party's proposed constitution that is suffering, and this is not \nunprecedented. In the early 1980s, supporters of a rival political \nfaction were brutally slaughtered in Matabeleland--a dark period\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nin the young country's history for which there is still not a \nsatisfying public account. So we must not be intimidated by the scape-\ngoating of the power-hungry. Once there was a struggle against a \nterrible system of oppression, grounded in racial discrimination, in \nthe country now called Zimbabwe. But that is not the heart of the \nmatter today.\n  Nor is this crisis really about land tenure reform, although there is \nno question at all that land tenure reform is desperately needed and \nlong overdue in Zimbabwe. But the government's past efforts at land \nreform have too often involved distributing land to key supporters of \nthe ruling party, not the landless and truly needy. Fundamentally, land \nreform is about improving quality of life for the people of Zimbabwe--\nsomething that is utterly undermined by the violent tactics of the \nruling party today.\n  So while this is not about race and it is not, at its core, about \nland, what this is about is an increasingly discredited President, who, \nwatching his legacy turn increasingly into a source of shame rather \nthan celebration, has hatched a desperate campaign to cling to power, \neven though this campaign, if successful, would render him the leader \nof an utterly broken country. Runaway government spending has led to \nhigh inflation and unemployment. Corruption infects the state. And, at \nthis time of economic strain and hardship, the Government of Zimbabwe \nis spending over $1.5 million a month on its participation in the Congo \nconflict.\n  The Zimbabwe Democracy Act indicates that the U.S. will have no part \nof the terrible campaign of violence now compounding Zimbabwe's \ntroubles. The bill suspends U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe while carving \nout important exceptions--humanitarian relief, food or medical \nassistance provided to non-governmental organizations for humanitarian \npurposes, programs which support democratic governance and the rule of \nlaw, and technical assistance relating to ongoing land reform programs \noutside the auspices of the government of Zimbabwe. And it articulates \nclear conditions for ending this suspension of assistance--including a \nreturn to the rule of law, free and fair parliamentary and presidential \nelections, and a demonstrated commitment on the part of the Government \nof Zimbabwe to an equitable, legal, and transparent land reform \nprogram.\n  The bill also offers assistance to the remarkable forces working \nwithin Zimbabwe in support of the rule of law, in support of democracy, \nand in support of basic human rights for all of Zimbabwe's citizens. It \nestablishes a fund to finance the legal expenses for individuals and \ninstitutions challenging restrictions on free speech in Zimbabwe, where \nthe latest campaign has also included a media crackdown. The fund would \nalso support individuals and democratic institutions who have accrued \ncosts or penalties in the pursuit of elective office or democratic \nreform.\n  I had the chance to be in Zimbabwe in December, and I do not believe \nthat I have ever encountered a more dynamic, committed, and genuinely \ninspiring group of civil society leaders than the group I met in Harare \na few months ago. These forces must not be abandoned in Zimbabwe's time \nof crisis.\n  And, very responsibly, this legislation recognizes that Zimbabwe will \nneed the assistance of the international community when it seeks to \nrebuild once the crisis has passed. It authorizes support for ongoing, \nlegally governed land tenure reforms, and authorizes an innovative \napproach to facilitating the development of commercial projects in \nZimbabwe and the region.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I commend \nSenator Frist and his staff for their efforts on this matter. Right now \na country of great promise and a people of tremendous potential are \nenduring a terrible campaign of lawlessness and oppression. Right now, \none of the most important states on the African continent, economically \nand politically, is in crisis. To write off Zimbabwe, to lose this \nopportunity to speak and act on the matter, would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  States descend into utter chaos in stages. Let us move to arrest \nZimbabwe's descent today, not next year, when the problems will be more \ncomplex and more deeply entrenched, and not after 5 years of crisis, \nwhen Afro-pessimists will undoubtedly ignore the country's proud \nhistory and cynically assert that Zimbabwe cannot be salvaged. Let us \nbe far-sighted, let us act now, pass this legislation, and stand firmly \nbehind the forces of law, of democracy, and of justice in Zimbabwe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4636-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4636-S4637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this Senate has been engaged in more \nthan a decade of discussion about reforming the campaign finance system \nin the United States. Indeed, the Senate has not only debated the issue \nbut has focused attention on McCain-Feingold, attention that brought \nabout a national debate about how to change this system. The Senate may \nbe on the verge of yet another discussion in the coming days.\n  I take the floor today because, while I praise Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold and, indeed, once again pledge my vote for their \nreform legislation, I believe it is a disservice for the Senate to \nbelieve there are no other contributions that can be made to solving \nthe campaign finance dilemma.\n  McCain-Feingold, and the former comprehensive legislation, would be \nthe best answer. It is not the only answer. There are a variety of very \nreal problems to enacting this legislation that begin with legitimate \nconstitutional problems, decisions by the Federal courts, legitimate \ndifferences on philosophical questions about how to conduct elections \nin America, and some real political problems. The reality is that \nwhether I believe in McCain-Feingold or not, whether the entire \nDemocratic caucus votes for it or not, it is not going to be enacted. \nThat leads many to believe that simply, then, nothing will happen; \nthere can be no change because there are not enough votes.\n  I believe that is not necessary, that does not have to be the final \nword.\n  Yesterday's primary election in the State of New Jersey, now setting \na record of $31 million in expenditures in a single partisan primary, \nagain focuses the Nation on the problem. Our campaign finance laws in \nthe United States are recognized in the breach. There is no national \ngoverning system of campaign finance laws. They are misunderstood, \nviolated, contradictory, and incomplete. Regrettably, there is a \nfailure to look at the contributions that others can make and the \nalternatives that exist in law given the current deadlock in this \nSenate acting on campaign finance.\n  Indeed, to listen to the network anchors each evening--Mr. Rather, \nMr. Brokaw, and Mr. Jennings--one would believe there are no other \nanswers; this is simply a case of political candidates raising as much \nas can be raised in a complete vacuum of other considerations.\n  I believe that until this Congress acts and there is a majority for \ncampaign finance reform, there are things that others can do and, \nindeed, it begins with the media itself. The costs of these campaigns \nare staggering, but I have never met a candidate for political office \nwho wanted to raise money beyond what was actually required to win the \nrace. It is not only a question of how much is being raised; it is how \nmuch the campaigns cost.\n  As my friend, Mitch McConnell, has pointed out on a variety of \noccasions, America is not suffering from too much political discussion. \nThere is not too much debate. Campaigns are simply too expensive. That \nbegins with an analysis of where the money is going.\n  In New York City today, a 30-second prime time advertisement can cost \n$50,000. In Chicago, the same advertisement is $20,000. A 30-second ad \non the late news in New York is $6,000; in Chicago, $4,500. The effect \nof this is obvious.\n  Year in and year out, the networks charge more money for the same \nadvertisements for the use of the public airwaves, and an endless \nspiral of costs is driving campaign fundraising in America. Indeed, the \nsame network anchors who rail against campaign fundraising almost every \nnight are the principal beneficiaries of the campaign fundraiser. I do \nnot know any candidate in\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nAmerica who wants to raise this money voluntarily if they had a choice. \nThere is no other means of communicating with the American people but \nto buy network television advertising, and I have never seen the cost \nof advertising go down.\n  The New York Times estimates that the 2000 elections in the United \nStates will cost $3 billion. That is a 50-percent increase over 1996. \nMr. President, $600 million of that advertising, or 20 percent, will be \nspent directly on network television advertising. That is a 40-percent \nincrease over what the networks absorbed only 4 years ago.\n  Isolating the Presidential campaign in 1996, President Clinton and \nSenator Dole spent $113 million on television ads. Half of all the \nmoney they spent went to network television. This is done for a reason. \nIt is not only the spiraling cost of network advertising far beyond the \nrate of inflation; far beyond the rate of increase of the cost of \nanything else in political campaigns is the networks themselves. They \nare the principal generating force in the rising cost of \ncampaign finance.\n\n  They are part of the problem not in one dimension but in two. From \nLabor Day through election day in 1998, ABC, CBS, and NBC aired 73 \npercent fewer election stories than they did in the same period in \n1994. The amount of advertising is going up and the cost is going up \nbecause candidates' ability to communicate with the American people \nthrough legitimate news stories is going down. It is not going down \nmarginally; it is not going down significantly; it is going down \noverwhelmingly. There is a 73 percent reduction in the amount of \nlegitimate news stories aired over the public airwaves to inform the \nAmerican electorate.\n  What, Mr. Rather, Mr. Jennings, and Mr. Brokaw, are candidates for \nelective office in the Democratic and Republican Parties to do? The \namount of legitimate free news stories to inform the electorate is in a \nstate of collapse. The number of Americans reading newspapers is \ndeclining. There is a similar reduction in the amount of newsprint for \nlegitimate news stories, and your rates are skyrocketing.\n  The result is clear: Costs of campaigns are soaring. Indeed, there is \na solution. The most obvious solution is we could change the national \ncampaign finance laws. For constitutional reasons, philosophical \nreasons, and political reasons I have suggested, that is not about to \nhappen. I suggest the networks, therefore, look at themselves and their \nown ability unilaterally to reduce the cost of advertising on the \npublic airwaves. After all, the public airwaves are not their own \nprovince. It is not something for which they paid and own exclusively. \nThese are the public airwaves, licensed to ABC, CBS, and NBC, with a \npublic responsibility to the American people, a responsibility they do \nnot meet.\n  No other democracy in the Western world allows private corporations \nto use the public airwaves exclusively for their own benefit charging \ncandidates for national office what approach commercial rates to \ncommunicate with the people themselves. Use the people's airwaves, \ncharge exorbitant rates to candidates for public office to communicate \nin a national election--it would not happen in Canada, and it does not \nhappen in Britain, Germany, Italy, or France. It happens nowhere, but \nit happens here.\n  While we wait for this Congress to act, I challenge the network \nexecutives: Be part of the solution, not the principal cause of the \nproblem. Act unilaterally until this Congress can act. But they do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator from Nevada yield me an additional 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. According to Senator Warner, we have 45 minutes. We have \nused 31. That will be appropriate. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from New Jersey be allowed to speak for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  One can recognize why the networks are in this extraordinary \nhypocrisy. They are for campaign finance reform. They are against \nspending in national political campaigns increasing. Indeed, we all \nshare that concern, but they are also the principal beneficiaries.\n  In 1998, automotive ads were 25 percent of all national advertising. \nRetail sales were 15 percent. Political advertising was 10 percent of \nall revenues. They are offended at the cost of national political \ncampaigns, but it is the third largest source of their funding.\n\n  Similarly, it is not a stable problem. Political ads are a rapidly \nrising, indeed, the largest increasing, source of network revenues, \nfrom 3 percent in 1990 to approaching 10 percent of all network \nrevenues in the year 2000. What an extraordinary hypocrisy.\n  But it gets worse. They are for campaign finance reform, but they \nwant the advertising revenues. What could be worse? The National \nAssociation of Broadcasters last year spent $260,000 in PAC money and \nsoft money, often supporting candidates who are against campaign \nfinance reform, and hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying to \nprotect their right to use the public airwaves at retail costs for \npeople who need to communicate with the American electorate.\n  I applaud Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for coming to this \nfloor and fighting for campaign finance reform. I applaud my colleagues \nwho have the courage to stand for it and fight for it. I always will. \nBut changing the American political system in America to reduce money \nin the equation is not our fight; it is everybody's fight.\n  I could understand it if the networks were to be neutral, but to \nengage in this headlong daily criticism of the process while they \nprofit by it is inexcusable.\n  My friends in the networks, join the fight. Help us reform the \nsystem. Lead by example. Reduce the costs of the public airwaves for \nthe public good. Allow candidates to communicate ideas without \nexorbitant costs. And meet your public responsibilities by dedicating \nmore--not less--time to discussions of the issues. Make that a \nlegitimate discussion of real choices before the American people--not \nhorse races, an accounting simply of expenditures in races. Be \npositive, be responsible, and be part of the process of change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4637-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4637-S4649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the \ndistinguished ranking member and to the distinguished minority whip.\n  We are endeavoring to ascertain the remainder of the amendments that \ncould be brought before the Senate in connection with this bill. There \nare strong initiatives on this side. We are going to put out a hotline \non our side. We are urging Senators to contact the respective \ncloakrooms and to indicate--in the event they have a desire to have a \nmatter covered on this bill by amendment--their desire to speak in \nrelation to this bill or other procedural steps so that we can try to \nproject the conclusion for this bill. We hope by 6 o'clock tonight is \nto get a unanimous consent request to lay down a list of amendments to \nbe considered for the remainder of time on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the request for our colleagues to \ncontact the cloakrooms about their intentions relative to amendments \nand speaking on the bill. It will help us to organize the rest of the \ntime we will need on the bill.\n  I particularly thank Senator Reid. He has been working hard on our \nside. I know that kind of effort is being made also on the Republican \nside to see if we cannot come up with a finite list at the end of the \nday of amendments that Members intend to offer.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we have made progress. Sometimes it \nhas been painfully slow. But this is a very big and important bill. We \nhave a number of Senators on the minority side who expressed their \ndesire to offer some amendments. We have a hotline\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\ngoing out from our cloakroom asking that we try to develop a finite \nlist of amendments. Once that is done, we will be in a better position \nto determine approximately how long it will take to complete this bill.\n  I should say to both managers of this bill that the minority is \ndesirous of having this bill completed as quickly as possible.\n  As the managers of this bill know, in the past this bill has taken a \nlong time. We are going to try to move it more quickly than in the \npast. But we still have a lot of amendments. But by the end of the day, \nI hope we will be in some kind of position to indicate to the managers \nof the bill how many amendments we have on this side. We hope the \nmajority will tell us how many amendments they have.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the expression from \nour distinguished leader on the minority that it is the minority's \ndesire to move this bill to completion. That is very reassuring.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a pending unanimous consent request. \nWe are not in a position at this time to agree to that. We are getting \nvery close. As soon as that is possible, we will notify the manager of \nthe bill and enter into that unanimous consent agreement to take care \nof some things tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure our distinguished leadership on \nthis side that Senator Lott, I, and others believe very strongly that \nthis bill is essential for the United States and essential for the men \nand women in the Armed Forces. I think considerable bipartisanship has \nprevailed up to this moment. I hope it continues and we can complete \nthis bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my staff just handed me some interesting \nstatistics, since we have a moment. Over the last 10 years, we have \naveraged 5\\1/2\\ days on the Defense authorization bill and 116 \namendments, on average. We are actually doing pretty well. We are \nmaking some progress. We may beat the average even. We never know.\n  Mr. REID. Especially considering the fact that we didn't start this \nbill until late yesterday afternoon. We have only been on this bill a \nlittle more than one day.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a hotline will be going out to both \ncloakrooms. I thank my colleagues. We are still awaiting the arrival of \nSenator McCain, at which time we will proceed to the McCain-Levin \namendment, which is described in detail in the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I propose today is one which \nwe have attempted on several occasions in the past. It authorizes two \nrounds of U.S. military installation realignments and closures to occur \nin the years 2003 and 2005--in other words, BRAC, or Base Realignment \nand Closure.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Levin, Robb, Voinovich, Reed, DeWine, \nand Wyden as cosponsors.\n  We have heard for the last several years of the severe problems that \nexist in the military. We addressed one of those problems, food stamps, \nearlier in the proceedings on this legislation. We have heard in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee repeated testimony of plunging \nreadiness and modernization programs that are decades behind schedule \nand quality-of-life deficiencies so great that we can't retain or \nrecruit quality personnel necessary to defend this Nation's vital \nnational security interests.\n  Statistics are sometimes numbing but sometimes interesting also. The \nAir Force will be 2,000 pilots short by the end of next year, the Navy \nSEALS are losing two-thirds of their officer corps, and the Army is \nstruggling to retain its captains. In the last few weeks, there was a \nwell publicized study conducted by the Army which shows an \nunprecedented exodus of Army officers at the rank of captain from the \nU.S. Army.\n  The consequences of losing the majority of your junior officers at \nthat rank are indeed disturbing and even alarming. Equipment is falling \nin disrepair. The Marine Corps spends more time fixing broken equipment \nthan it does training on it. And the Air Force is discovering that its \nF-16 fleet is only safe to fly for 75 percent of its original planned \nservice life. The Army is in need of new engines for its entire M-1 \ntank fleet.\n  Modernization of our military equipment has all but ceased for the \nvery large and risky programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter, \nComanche helicopter, and excessively expensive ship and submarine \nprograms of questionable design and questionable requirement.\n  There is no doubt that many of the woes of our military can be \naddressed in areas other than the budget, but more judicious use of the \nmilitary by the national command authority and reduced operational \ntempo will help with personnel retention.\n  Any person in the military will tell you today that our military \npersonnel, both active duty as well as Guard and Reserve forces, are \nbeing deployed all too frequently at the expense of their lifestyles, \ntheir family lives, and ultimately their desires to continue to serve \nthe country in the uniform of the military.\n  Streamlined training and greater attention to exercise management \nwill result in less strain on our service members and their equipment. \nBut ultimately we must pay for the last 7 years of chronic underfunding \nof our military. Finding these dollars at a time when we must also \ncarefully attend to the health of our Social Security system and other \nmuch needed social benefits will be absolutely difficult.\n  It is against this backdrop that we should acknowledge the absolute \nrequirement to close unneeded military bases. The armed services is \ncarrying the burden of managing and paying for an estimated 23-percent \nexcess infrastructure costing at least $3.6 billion a year. Let me \npoint out again, Mr. President, keeping these bases open is not without \nsignificant cost. In fact, about $3.6 billion every year could be saved \nwhen these unnecessary bases are ultimately closed.\n  By the year 2003, these costs will grow to a total of over $25 \nbillion. If Congress allows the military to streamline its \ninfrastructure, these costs can be realized as real savings that can be \nused to address the military's readiness shortfalls. Many have heard \nstrong testimony supporting further BRAC rounds from the service \nchiefs, all the service Secretaries, and the Secretary of Defense. \nPotential savings are dramatic. The savings in 1 year alone would more \nthan pay for the proposed personnel pay benefits--including health \ncare, buy over 36 new F-22 strike fighters for the Air Force, fully \nfund our Nation's ballistic missile defense program, or pay for 75 \npercent of the next generation aircraft carriers.\n  Savings over the next 4 years are conservatively estimated to reach \n$25 billion. The annual net savings from previous BRAC rounds have \ngrown from $3 billion in 1998 to $5.6 billion to $7 billion a year by \n2001. That is an important statistic because so many of the opponents \nof a base-closing round argue that money is not only not saved but \nspent because of the cleanup costs that are associated with base \nclosings.\n  There are two points to be made. One is that these cleanups, although \nlengthy and difficult sometimes, depending on the type of operations \nthat took place on that military base, have now been completed to a \nlarge degree, and the money is being saved. As I mentioned, between \n$5.6 to $7 billion will be saved next year. Also, it should disturb us \nif these bases are not cleaned up anyway, whether they are open or \nclosed. It is an expense that probably will continue to grow. To say \nthat we shouldn't close bases because of the cleanup costs then, I \nguess, using a certain logic, would mean we would want areas that are \nhazardous to ourselves and our children's health to remain unaddressed.\n  These savings are, as I said, real. They are coming sooner and they \nare greater than anticipated.\n  The GAO recently noted that in most communities where bases were \nclosed, incomes were actually rising faster and unemployment rates were \nlower than the national average. In my own home State of Arizona there \nwas great wailing and gnashing of teeth as Williams Air Force Base \nappeared on the base-closing list several years ago. It is now called \nWilliams Gateway Airport and it is generating sizably more revenue for \nthe community and the State of Arizona than it was when it was a \nmilitary installation. That is true at bases throughout the Nation.\n\n  There is a provision in this bill that allows for the no-cost \ntransfer of property from the military to the community in areas \naffected by closures. This amendment authorizes two additional rounds \nof base closure in 2003 and 2005. The amendment is similar to that \nintroduced last year except the rounds are 2003 and 2005 instead of \n2001 and 2003. Why did we change the date from 2001, which would then \nobviously mean it would take action well into the next administration? \nDue to the justifiable mistrust, particularly on this side of\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nthe aisle, about this President's nonpoliticization of the process. \nThere are credible arguments that the last base-closing round, as far \nas Kelly Air Force Base in Texas and McClellan up in Sacramento, were \npoliticized.\n  Last year, when Senator Levin and I and others brought this amendment \nup, the distinguished chairman of the committee said: There will be \nimmediately ``acting'' in the bowels of the Pentagon to somehow \npoliticize this process. I say to my friend from Virginia, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, they won't be acting in the \nbowels of the Pentagon, at least until the year 2003, under this \nproposal.\n  So we are talking about an evolution that would not take place. The \nround would not take place for 3 years, 3 years from now, and then \nobviously those recommendations would not be implemented until \nbeginning with the final determination of the base-closing commission \nand approval by the President and the Congress.\n  Additionally, under this proposed legislation, privatization in place \nwould be permitted only when explicitly recommended by the Commission, \nwhich I hope would prevent a recurrence of the kind of machinations, \nwhether legitimate or not, that were conducted by the present \nadministration, which has caused so much skepticism about the results \nof the last Base Closure Commission.\n  Finally, the Secretary of Defense must consider the total cost the \nfinal base closure rounds have on the Government, not just cost or \nsavings to the Department of Defense. We can continue to maintain a \nmilitary infrastructure that we don't need or we can provide the \nnecessary funds to ensure our military can fight and win future wars. \nOur men and women are deployed and continuing to train and prepare for \nupcoming deployments, many to active combat regions. They are \nundermined, increasingly short on critical weapon systems, and are \nstruggling to overcome a multitude of readiness deficiencies.\n  Recently, one of the Army divisions was declared in the lowest \ncategory of readiness. It struck home to a lot of us in this body who \nhappen to still revere the great and wonderful Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nDole, who was our majority leader, who served and sacrificed in the \nfamous 10th Mountain Division. He, among others, was surprised when a \ndivision with that glorious and wonderful history was declared, for all \nintents and purposes, unfit to be deployed into a combat situation.\n  The cost associated with maintaining excess infrastructure represents \nreal money that is not available for essential programs and for \nalleviating real defense programs.\n  Earlier this year, the Armed Services Committee met to discuss the \nneed to add critical funds to the defense account for much needed \nmodernization projects. I was amazed that although there were arguments \nfor the need for increased defense spending, no one could see that \ncritical defense reforms such as further BRAC rounds were required. \nThese rounds could provide long-term funding for modernization and \nreadiness programs without risking other key programs.\n  We must finish the job we started by authorizing a new round of base \nclosures. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this amendment and \nwork diligently to put aside politics for what is clearly in the best \ninterests of our military forces in our Nation.\n  We had kind of an unusual occurrence last year in that the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, in what was deemed by most observers as a rather \nunusual move, they testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat they had significant shortfalls in funding.\n  The committee asked for detailed responses as to what were those \nshortfalls in funding. The Army came up with some $5.5 billion in \nunfunded requirements they thought were necessary. This comes from the \nuniformed heads of the services. The Army needed $5.5 billion for \nprograms ranging from Longbow Apache to night vision goggles, to UH-60 \nBlackhawk procurement. The list is very detailed and very long: The \nNavy needed about $5.8 billion; the Marine Corps needed $1.6 billion; \nthe Air Force needed $3.5 billion; the Special Operations Command \nneeded $260 million; the Army National Guard needed $800 million; and \nthe Air National Guard came in with a requirement for $2.4 billion.\n  We are taking strides to improve funding for our military. But when \nyou add all of this up, it comes to a very significant amount of money, \nabout $20 billion, that the military chiefs have submitted in written \ntestimony to the Congress as to the needs of the individual services.\n  I have to be sort of candid. I am not sure we are going to come up \nwith $20 billion that the services need. We are increasing funding, and \nthat is the first time in some years. But I do not see that in the \nrealm of this $20 billion, when you look at the additional costs which \nare already basically there without us being able to do anything about \nit--first, the funding for the new fighter aircraft, funding for the \nadditional ships, planes, tanks, et cetera, that will be necessary to \nreplace existing aging equipment and modernize our armed forces.\n  So here is $20 billion the chiefs say they need. I do not see a huge \nincrease of that size, frankly, in the future, as far as the Congress \nis concerned, nor, at least under this administration, do I see that \nsizable additional request.\n  Obviously, as I pointed out earlier, it would be a savings of some \n$25 billion over a period of the next 4 years. The savings are \nconservatively estimated to reach about $25 billion. I do not want to \nhave any of my colleagues be misled. That would be the case if we had a \nbase-closing commission that declared its decisions today. But if the \nbase-closing commission, in the year 2003, made its decisions, we could \nsave over the following 4 years some $25 billion. I want to make it \nclear.\n  Yes, there will be initial costs for cleanup of these bases. That is \na sad fact--and at that time an unexpected--experience that we had. But \nI also argue, with the perspective of time, we have found there is now, \nas a result of the earlier base closings, annual net savings which are \ngrowing from $3 billion in 1998 to $5.7 to $7 billion per year by next \nyear.\n  I would be distressed if Yuma Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma were \non the base-closing list. I would be distressed if Luke Air Force Base \nin Phoenix were on the base-closing list. I would be distressed if \nDavis Mountain Air Force Base in Tucson were on the base-closing list. \nI see my friend from Nevada here, one of the cosponsors of this \namendment. I am sure he would be deeply distressed if Nellis Air Force \nBase in Reno were on the base-closing list. There is not, I believe, a \nSenator or very few Senators who would not feel the impact of a base-\nclosing commission.\n  But I challenge the opponents of this amendment to find me one--I say \none--credible military expert who resides outside of the Congress of \nthe United States who will not say that we need to have a base-closing \ncommission to decide on the elimination of unneeded infrastructure in \nthe reform of bases that the military does not need.\n  I ask any of us to pick up the phone and call up Gen. Colin Powell; \ncall up Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf; call up Cap Weinberger; call up Dick \nCheney; call up Zbigniew Brzezinski; Call up anyone, anyone today, who \nis a person who has credentials as far as military readiness is \nconcerned, and I think you would be hard pressed to find anything but \nthe overwhelming majority--perhaps not totally but the overwhelming \nmajority of opinion on this issue by credible military experts is that \nwe have excess infrastructure in the form of too many bases which we do \nnot need and which should be closed in order to use those funds for \nbadly needed military requirements.\n\n  I apologize to this body, to keep going back to the plight of the \nservice men and women in the military today. But we do have service men \nand women in the military on food stamps. We do have service men and \nwomen in the military in my own State residing in barracks that were \nbuilt during World War II. We do have service men and women in the \nMarine Corps who are, for example, retreading military vehicle tires so \nthey can get additional money in order to have ammunition with which to \npractice.\n  The stories go on and on.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the distinguished chairman at \nany time, including now.\n  Mr. WARNER. At an appropriate time.\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER. Since he and I joined together several years ago on a \npiece of legislation to initiate the BRAC process--you remember that, \nand I will not go into the chronology--I share with the Senator \nappreciation of the need for an assessment of our base structure. That \nshould be made in the context of the demands of the armed services. \nThere is no one--you just had an amendment that succeeded \noverwhelmingly in the Senate on food stamps. You begin to address these \nproblems. I commend my old friend and colleague.\n  This comes to my mind. There is no one who is a stronger fighter for \nthe prerogatives of the President of the United States. You fought hard \nhere recently on an amendment which I had with Senator Byrd. I think \nyou took the line we could be strapping the President of the United \nStates.\n  Factually speaking, with no criticism towards President Clinton, \nthere will be an election in this country and a new President elected \nin a few months. He will take office. Should we not accord him the \ncourtesy to address this question, address it in the context of the \nneeds that you have stated, address it in the context of a QDR, his own \nanalysis of the military structure of the United States? Address it in \nthe context of what his direction will likely be with respect to the \nArmed Forces of the United States?\n  My colleague, above all, and I are strong supporters of one \nparticular candidate. He has spoken out very forcefully on the need to \nfurther strengthen our military. I think if we were to start the \nprocess now, it could in some ways impede or indeed thwart the next \nPresident's, what I consider, complete freedom to look at this issue.\n  My colleague was right. He was talking about the $20 billion this \ncould possibly generate. He was correct in assessing the needs of the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others. Just moments ago we \nmissed by a few votes a $90 billion program for retirement, which was \ntough for those who had to go against it, but we had to resist that.\n  I am suggesting: What is the reason we should start now versus just \nallow the next President to frame this legislation in terms of his own \nneeds and aspirations?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership and the \ncourage he has displayed on a number of occasions on a number of \nissues.\n  First, I respond to my friend from a practical standpoint. This \namendment authorizes a base-closing commission. The President of the \nUnited States does not have to appoint the Commissioners and the \nPresident of the United States can reject the findings of the \nCommission. So I do not believe we are forcing the next President of \nthe United States in that respect.\n  My second point is, it is well known the advisers, at least to the \nparty on this side of the aisle, to the person we believe will be the \nnext President of the United States--George Shultz, Brent Scowcroft, \nCondolleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Robert Zoellick----\n  Mr. WARNER. And I suggest yourself.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Addressing every one of those individuals, if the \nchairman and I picked up the telephone and said, ``Do you think we \nshould have a base-closing commission?'' they would say yes. They would \nsay yes.\n  I argue, even though I understand and appreciate and sympathize with \nthe position of our nominee for President of the United States not to \ninterfere too much with what goes on in the Congress, I believe he \nwould be very supportive as well.\n  On the other side of the aisle, if it should occur that the nominee \nfrom the other side of the aisle were elected President of the United \nStates, the fact is very well known the Vice President of the United \nStates supports a base-closing commission as well and has voted on this \nfloor for the appointment of a base-closing commission.\n  By the way, I want the Record to be very clear that I have the \ngreatest respect and friendship for the Vice President of the United \nStates.\n  It is the decision of the people of this country who will be the next \nPresident of the United States. I had respect for the Vice President \nand his involvement in military issues when he and I served together, \nas we did, in the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he served on our committee with the Vice \nPresident.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Vice President of the United States, who is the \nnominee of the other party on the other side of the aisle, is also \nsupportive of and would support a base-closing commission. I believe \nwhoever will be President of the United States supports at this time \nauthorizing further base-closing commissions. I believe the advisers to \nboth individuals also support a base-closing commission, and if that \ncommission were authorized, it still would not require the next \nPresident of the United States to act even in the appointment of \ncommissioners, much less accepting the recommendations of that \ncommission. I yield to the Senator from Virginia, if he has any \nadditional comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I think Senator McCain answered my question. We both \nmade our points. Mr. President, the time that I consumed will be \nchargeable to those in opposition to the McCain amendment. I shall \neventually vote in opposition to the McCain-Levin amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I simply conclude by saying I hope we can \nauthorize this. It is important, not only because of the money we save \nwhich is critical for defense, but we as a body should understand that \nit does not enhance our reputation about our concerns about the needs \nof the military when we refuse to take what is a very logical step, and \nthat is to approve a base closure commission which would make \nrecommendations which could be either accepted or rejected by the \nPresident of the United States and rejected by this body if this body, \nin its wisdom, decided those recommendations were invalid.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield me 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan \nwhatever time he uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again, it is necessary for Senator \nMcCain and I and a number of colleagues he has specified to make an \neffort to authorize an additional two rounds of base closings. On this \nissue, the Congress simply can run but it cannot hide.\n  Every time we speak about the need for additional resources, be it \nfor health care in the military for retirees or active duty people, \nwhether it is for modern equipment, whether it is for a reasonable, \ndecent cost-of-living allowance or a pay increase for our active duty \npeople, whatever it is we talk about as being needed in our military, \nit seems to me to be a little bit hollow if we are not willing to make \nthe savings that clearly are essential and can be made and are \nrequested by our uniform military to help pay for those additional \nexpenditures. We can run but we simply cannot hide from our \nresponsibilities in this area.\n  The amendment would implement the recommendation of the Quadrennial \nDefense Review. We have heard a lot about Quadrennial Defense Review \ntoday and how important it is that review take place, and it is \nimportant. The recommendation of the Quadrennial Defense Review was \nthat we have additional rounds of base closings. The National Defense \nPanel recommended additional rounds of base closings. The Joint Chiefs \nof Staff have recommended additional rounds of base closings. The \nSecretary of Defense has made the same recommendation.\n  The way to respond to the need for resources for our military is to \neliminate the expenditures which are not essential.\n  This amendment would authorize two base-closure rounds: one in 2003 \nand one in 2005. The first round would take place well into the next \nadministration. The second round would take place in the administration \nafter that.\n\n  The amendment Senator McCain and I and others are offering would \nfollow the base-closure process that was used previously in 1991, 1993, \nand 1995, with three main exceptions: First, because 2005--which is the \nsecond round under this amendment--will be the first year of a new \nadministration, the schedule in 2005, which again would be the second \nround, would start and end about 2\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nmonths behind the schedule that would be used in 2003. The 2003 \nschedule would basically mirror the 1995 schedule, except that it would \nstart and end about 2 weeks later than in 1995. We include a 2-month \nslip in the timetable of the whole process in 2005 to allow a new \nadministration time to decide whether they want to have a base-closure \nprocess and to make its appointments to the commission.\n  As our friend from Arizona pointed out, this process we would \nauthorize is simply that--we authorize the process. The President would \ndecide whether or not to trigger the process by the appointments of the \nmembers of the base-closing commission and then would have a fail-safe \nmechanism to reject the recommendations of the commission.\n  The second exception to the general rules that were followed in the \nlast rounds' process is this amendment also includes the language to \naddress the problem of privatization in place for future BRAC rounds. \nIt would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize in place the \nworkload of a closing military installation only when it is \nspecifically recommended by the Base Closure Commission. That would \naddress the issue which has been raised about the previous round when \nsome thought that round was politicized when there was privatization in \nplace, which was allowed. This cures that problem by saying no \nprivatization in place unless the Base Closure Commission itself \nspecifically recommends that course of action.\n  The third main difference between this and the previous rounds is \nthat this amendment specifies we look at the costs and savings not just \nof the one agency but total costs and savings to the Federal \nGovernment. That is important so that we do not simply save money in \none Federal Government pocket but cost money in another Federal \nGovernment pocket; that we look at the costs and the savings to the \nentire Government from a proposed closing when these recommendations \nare made and not just to the Department of Defense.\n  In 1997, the Congress mandated there be a report on base closures. \nSecretary Cohen, in compliance with that, issued a report in April of \n1998. That report, which we insisted on, contains a convincing analysis \nof 1,800 pages of detailed backup material. It is responsive to those \nwho said last year that we needed a thorough analysis before we could \nreach a decision on the need for more base closures.\n  What that report reaffirms is that the Department of Defense simply \nhas more bases than it needs. Since 1989, we have reduced the total \nactive duty military end strength by one-third, but even after four \nbase-closure rounds, DOD's base structure in the United States has been \nreduced by only 21 percent. We have a disconnect. We have too much \nstructure. There are too many bases and facilities which are operating \nwhich we can no longer afford to operate and which must be \nconsolidated.\n  Each of us in States that have faced those closures understand the \nshort-term pain involved. We have lost all of our Strategic Air Command \nbases in Michigan. We understand what is needed in the aftermath to \ncushion the impact of those so-called realignments, which were \nclosures, of our three SAC bases, but we succeeded. We are on our way \nback in all three areas.\n  The Department of Defense is telling us they have 23-percent excess \ncapacity in current base structure. It seems to me we cannot hold our \nheads up and talk about the need of additional resources for the \nDepartment of Defense if we are not willing to close or at least put a \nprocess in motion which would fairly recommend the closure of some of \nthis 23-percent excess capacity which the Department of Defense \nanalysis says we have.\n  Mr. President, in relation to the excess capacity we have in our \ndefense structure, the Department of Defense analysis concludes that we \nhave 23 percent excess capacity in its current base structure. Just a \nfew examples now of that excess capacity which I think are \nindefensible, again, particularly for those who are urging additional \nresources in the defense budget.\n  How do we justify the Army having reduced classroom training \npersonnel by 43 percent while classroom space is only reduced by 7 \npercent? What we are doing by not allowing additional rounds of BRAC is \ntelling the Army: You have to maintain all that classroom space even \nthough you have no personnel to run it. So the classroom training \npersonnel is reduced 43 percent; classroom space is only 7 percent \nreduced.\n  The Navy will have 33 percent more hangars for aircraft than it \nrequires. We are telling the Navy--unless we allow these additional \nrounds of BRAC--you have to maintain those extra hangars even though \nyou do not have the aircraft or the need for it.\n  The Air Force has reduced the number of fighters and other aircraft \nby 53 percent since 1989, while the base structure for those aircraft \nis 35 percent smaller. So they have to keep 18 percent more base \nstructure than they need because we have been unable to show the \npolitical will to allow the military to do what they are pleading with \nus to allow them to do.\n  The chiefs come over here, the Secretary of Defense comes over here, \nyear after year, and they say: We need additional rounds of base \nclosures. So far, for the last few years at least, since the last \nround, we have been unwilling to show that political will to make those \nsavings possible.\n  The report of Secretary Cohen has demonstrated some significant \nsavings. People say: What about the savings? Can you really demonstrate \nsavings? First of all, it seems to me, there is a commonsense \ndemonstration that if you have four stores and you are making a profit \nin three, you are going to close one of those stores.\n  So many of us always tell the Defense Department they ought to \nemulate the private sector more, to act a little bit more as a \nbusiness, be a little bit more businesslike, to show some savings in \norder to make it possible for us to fund some other things needed in \nthe defense budget.\n  The Department of Defense estimates--these are not ours, these are \nthe Department of Defense estimates--that BRAC, so far, has saved us \n$14.5 billion net. After 2001, when all of the four BRAC actions must \nbe completed, what we call steady state savings, the savings will be \n$5.7 billion per year. Those are not our estimates; those are the \nDepartment of Defense estimates: $5.7 billion every year saved, \nstarting after 2001, as a result of the four rounds we have had so far.\n  The CBO and the GAO reviewed the Department of Defense report. So our \nBudget Office and our General Accounting Office reviewed that report, \nand they agreed that base closure saves substantial amounts of money.\n  Based on the savings from the first four BRAC rounds, every year that \nwe delay another base closure round, we deny the Defense Department, \nthe taxpayers, and our Nation's defense about $1.5 billion in annual \nsavings we can never recoup.\n  Again, I know base closings can be painful. I know that probably as \nwell as anybody because all three SAC bases, as I said, in my home \nState have been closed, and we are still working hard to overcome the \neconomic blow to those communities. But we are working successfully. \nThere is no question that the BRAC process is the fairest, most open, \nmost objective way to close bases. Without it, we are not going to \nclose bases. That is what history has shown.\n\n  Furthermore, in last year's bill we took steps to make the conveyance \nof BRAC property even easier for local communities. We have taken care \nof the objectionable part which surfaced last time when there was \nprivatization in place which many thought had not been provided for by \nthe Base Closure Commission but which the administration nonetheless \nallowed. We have cured that in this bill by saying the next Base \nClosure Commission must specifically authorize privatization in place \nfor a closed facility or else it cannot occur.\n  Our forces need quality training. They need precision weapons. They \ndo not need extra military bases. We just simply have higher priorities \nfor our defense dollars than funding bases we no longer need.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, we have paid a lot of attention, \nand should pay a lot of attention, to the chiefs' unfunded requirement \nlists. We should give, and do give, great weight to them. The Senator \nfrom Arizona listed the shortfalls the chiefs listed, totaling \napproximately $20 billion.\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\n  There are a number of ways to fund those unfunded requirements. One \nis to use some of the surplus we have worked so hard to achieve by just \nsimply adding to the budget for the Defense Department, to the so-\ncalled top line. But we are not limited to that approach, and it is a \ndifficult approach.\n  Whether or not we pay down the national debt, whether or not we \nprotect Medicare, whether or not we have a tax cut, or whether or not \nwe spend some of that on education, there are very important competing \ninterests for the surplus. We don't have to simply say: We will use the \nsurplus and add money to the defense budget. We can find savings and \nreapply those savings to higher priorities. That is what past BRAC \nrounds are already doing for us, and that is what the BRAC rounds in \nthis amendment will do for us in the future, if we are willing to do \nwhat the Secretary is asking us to do, not for himself but for his \nsuccessors and, more importantly, for the men and women who will be \nserving under his successors.\n\n  Secretary Cohen said recently that his biggest disappointment as \nSecretary has been that the Department of Defense still has too much \noverhead and he has not been able to persuade his former colleagues, \nmeaning us, to do what needs to be done to have more base closures. We \nall know Secretary Cohen. He was a colleague of most of us. I think \nevery one of us trusted his judgment. We all know that BRAC affected \nhim and his State when he served in this body, so this is not a request \nSecretary Cohen makes lightly. He knows what he is talking about and \nwhat he is asking of us.\n  We can't have it both ways. We can't say we want additional billions \nfor health care, which we said today with the Warner amendment. We \ncan't say we want additional billions for disability compensation, \nwhich was provided for in Senator Reid's amendment. We can't talk about \nan additional pay raise for the military and all the other things we \nrightfully talk about and are concerned about and at the same time we \nmaintain in place unneeded bases and structure. It is inconsistent. We \ncan't have it both ways. It is an issue of political will and \novercoming back-home concerns, understandable concerns but nonetheless \novercoming those concerns to meet our long-term security needs.\n  Are we willing to do the necessary thing, the right thing to avoid \nthe wasteful spending which is inherent when we maintain base structure \nwe don't need, when we have reduced the size of our force by a third \nbut our base structure by only 20 percent, and when we have classrooms \nand hangars that are no longer needed, a hundred other things that are \nno longer needed, because we don't have the political will to put in \nplace an outside base-closing commission whose recommendations can be \ntotally rejected if they are unfair by either the President or by us? \nThat is a reasonable amount of political will for which to ask in order \nto achieve the billions of dollars of savings that will be achieved by \nadditional rounds of base closings.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we now have a unanimous consent request. \nPiece by piece we are working and succeeding in putting forth UC \nrequests to keep this bill moving forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. on Thursday, June 8, the \nSenate temporarily lay aside any pending amendments and Senator Daschle \nand/or his designee be recognized to offer his amendment re: HMO, and \nthat there be 2 hours, equally divided, prior to the vote in relation \nto the amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  I further ask consent that during today's or tomorrow's session, \nSenator Inhofe be recognized for up to 10 minutes and Senator Snowe be \nrecognized for up to 30 minutes, each for general debate on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge all Senators--we are trying to move \ntowards a 6 o'clock deadline tonight with respect to first-degree \namendments. We are making considerable progress on both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the manager of the bill, I have \nbeen working with our manager. We are working very hard to come up with \na finite number of amendments. It is as the Senator indicated. The \naverage number of amendments on this bill is about 111, and 5 and a \nhalf or 6 days on the bill. We would certainly hope to beat that \nrecord. But at the present time we are trying to get a list of \namendments. We hope to have that sometime later tonight or the first \nthing in the morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's continue to work toward 6 o'clock tonight. I think \nit is important we do so. So many Senators have plans, and we want to \naccommodate them.\n  Mr. REID. We will do our best.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time which \nis utilized by the Senator from Oklahoma come from the side of the \nopponents of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wouldn't want anything I say to be \nmisinterpreted by anyone as to how I am going to be voting on the \ndefense authorization bill under consideration. I am going to strongly \nsupport it, although it is strongly inadequate for the needs we are \nfaced with right now. I am realistic enough to know that when we get \ninto a rebuilding program, that is going to have to happen under a \ndifferent administration than the administration we have had over the \nlast 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986; my first term \nwas 1987. It happened that a very smart young Congressman from Texas \nnamed Dick Armey made the decision that we were going to have to do \nsomething about excess infrastructure and devised a way, this smart guy \nwho got his Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma, to take politics out \nof the base realignment and closing process. I strongly supported him.\n  The first round voted on, I believe, in 1987, to be implemented in \n1989, about which I spoke on the floor of the House and supported, was \none that I felt this country did need. So for the first two of the four \nrounds we have already had, it was cherry-picking time. Yes, we closed \nbases and installations that resulted in a tremendous savings, and it \nwas good.\n  The third and the fourth rounds didn't work out that way. We have to \nkeep in mind that it had always been virtually impossible politically \nto close installations because of the politics involved. There are \nalways Members of the House and Senate who don't want anything closed \nin their States. Consequently, this system that was devised, this BRAC \nprocess, was to take politics out. Everyone agreed, even though they \ndidn't like the results, that there had to be a process free from \npolitics to do that. It worked out for the first four rounds.\n  The last round that came through in 1995 was one where, among other \nthings, the BRAC committee evaluated the air logistics centers. There \nare five of them in the United States, and each one was operating at \nthat time at 50-percent capacity. Any logical business conclusion would \ndemand that we close two of them and transfer the workload to the \nremaining three. I heard the distinguished Senator from Michigan talk \nabout the process, about the fact that privatization in place is \nsomething that would be precluded in the next BRAC round, if he is \nsuccessful in getting that authorized. I suggest that if somebody in \nthe White House wants to violate the integrity of this process, it is \nnot only privatization in place that will happen. He can find out some \nother way of doing it.\n  We are going to have, it now appears, one of two people as the next \nPresident of the United States. It will either be Vice President Al \nGore or George W. Bush. In the case of Vice President Gore, let's \nremember what happened in the 1995 round. They made the recommendation \nto close two and transfer the workloads of the remaining three. They \nevaluated all five air logistics centers and determined that the two\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nleast efficient ones were at McClellan Air Force Base in California and \nKelly Air Force Base in Texas.\n  That being right before the election and both being in vote-rich \nswing States, the President and the Vice President went to McClellan \nand then to Kelly and said: Don't worry; even though they said that we \nare going to close your bases, we are not going to let that happen. We \nare going to--and just out of the air he grabbed a phrase--``privatize \nin place.'' Well, that made it very clear that if you really want to \nfigure out a way to politicize the system, you can do it.\n  Who was it at that time who made the announcement out at McClellan in \nCalifornia and at Kelly in Texas? It wasn't President Clinton. It was \nVice President Al Gore. I said when I began that one of those two \nindividuals, Gore or Bush, is going to be the next President. I will \nfight to the bitter end, until at least the time we know who the next \nPresident is going to be, before I will vote to authorize future BRAC \nrounds in that one of the candidates, Vice President Al Gore, has \nalready demonstrated that he will induce politics back into a system \nthat is supposed to be free of politics. I think that has to be \nconsidered.\n  The second issue is, in this rebuilding process, I believe that if \nthe next President of the United States is George W. Bush, having had \npersonal conversations with him, he recognizes that we are in the same \nhollow force situation we were in in 1980 when Ronald Reagan became \nPresident and had to start a massive rebuilding program.\n  What is a massive rebuilding program today? The Joint Chiefs have all \nsaid, in testimony before our committee, with Senator Levin and myself \npresent, that we need to have an additional $140 billion over the next \n6 years to reach the minimum expectations of the American people. What \nare the minimum expectations of the American people? It is to defend \nAmerica on two regional fronts. This has been a concept most Americans \nthink we can do today, and we cannot do that simultaneously.\n  So if we start this rebuilding process and it is going to be as \nsignificant as we think it is going to be, then we need to be looking \nat what our infrastructure needs will be then, not what they are today. \nIf we have artificially lowered our force strength in this country to \nan artificially low level, we don't want to bring our infrastructure \ndown to the same level because when we start to rebuild, we don't know \nwhat our infrastructure needs will be.\n  That is the whole point. We will know with the new administration, \nand we will be able to project in the future what that is going to be. \nThe argument is used that we can't have it both ways and we need to \nhave more money. That is true. I think we need to have a lot more money \nthan we have right now. In fact, we have testimony from the service \nchiefs that, even with the budget we have today, we are still \ninadequate to the degree of about $11 billion-plus a year in order to \nstart the rebuilding process and get to the point we just described.\n  Why would we be in a hurry to do this? When they talk about the fact \nthat we are going to have savings, we know those savings aren't even \ngoing to take place in the best scenarios until, at the earliest, 2008. \nIn fact, I will read out of a March 2, 2000, news article that quotes \nBill Cohen. He said it will be somewhere between 2008 to 2015.\n  Now that is beyond the point, hopefully, that we have a crisis in \nthis country. Our crisis is here today. There are a lot of people who \nwould like to believe there is not a threat out there because the cold \nwar is over. I look wistfully back to the days of the Cold War. At \nleast we knew who the opposition was. We had two superpowers, and we \nhad good intelligence on both sides. We knew what they had, and they \nknew what we had. We were able to address it. Today, we have all these \nrogue nations that all have weapons of mass destruction. We have \ncountries that possess missiles that will reach to the United States of \nAmerica, China, Russia, North Korea, and maybe others--warheads that \ncould blow us up.\n  I come from Oklahoma, and I think most of the people realize it was \njust 5 years ago in April that we had the most devastating domestic \nterrorist attack in the history of America. It happened in Oklahoma. \nWhen you saw the pictures of that Murrah Federal Office Building, you \nsaw parts of bodies that were stuck to the wall in that flaming \nbuilding and the absolute devastation, and you stopped to realize that \nthe smallest nuclear warhead known to man today is 1,000 times that \npowerful.\n  So here we are vulnerable, with no defense system at all on an \nincoming missile. Secondly, we are at one-half the force strength in \n1991 during the Persian Gulf war. We have one-half of the Army \ndivisions, one-half of the tactical air wings, one-half of the ships \nfloating out there. Our force strength is down. At the same time, under \nthis administration, we have had more deployments in the last 7 years \nthan we had in the previous 40 years collectively. They have been in \nareas where we don't have national security interests. So we are taking \nthese rare assets we have, and we are putting them into places such as \nKosovo and Bosnia, where we should not have gone in the first place.\n  So facing that 1980 dilemma our rebuilding is going to have to start \nimmediately for national security reasons. I would like to think that \nby 2008 we would be back where we were in 1986 after the rebuilding. I \nhave no way of knowing that for sure, but let's hope that is the case.\n  Anyway, while the Senator from Arizona said it is not at all sure, he \nsaid, to be perfectly candid, that we are going to be able to save $20 \nbillion over that period of time. There is one thing I suggest we are \nsure of, which is that the cost over the next 5 years is going to be \n$2.6 billion. That means it is going to be negative during this time \nthat we have to start the rebuilding process. Things, right now, are in \na much more deplorable condition than America wants to believe.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have had occasion to go to all the military installations \naround the world, and I don't like what I see. We have RPMs, real \nproperty maintenance accounts, that are supposed to be done \nimmediately, taken care of, and they are not doing it. We have barracks \nin Fort Bragg where when it rains--and I was there when it rained--the \nroof has been leaking now for years. They are unable to fix that \nbecause they don't have the money to do it. Our troops are actually \nlying down over their equipment to keep it from rusting. It is a \ncrisis.\n  You can go to the 21st TACOM over in Germany and look at our M-915 \ntrucks. Many of them have over a million miles on them. They are \nspending as much in maintenance on each one over the next 3 years as it \nwould take to buy a brand new truck. It is a crisis that we don't have \nthe money to buy new trucks when we need them. It is not feasible to do \nit that way, but that is our only choice.\n  We don't have spare parts for airplanes. The cannibalized rate is \nhigher than ever before. That means they bring in a crated F-100 engine \nto be put into an F-l6, and in order to keep the F-l6 there running \nwith a fairly recent engine, they have to rob parts from this. It is \nhighly labor intensive. Consequently, we are having a problem in \nretention that is not only with pilots, which is an-all time low, but \nalso the mechanics putting those parts in.\n  Our pilot retention in the Navy right now is below 20 percent. It \ncosts between $6 million and $9 million to train each one of them. Yet \nover 80 percent of them are leaving and not taking the second full tour \nof duty. The mechanics fixing the planes are leaving, too. I have \ntalked to these people, and they say this country has lost its sense of \nmission. It is not keeping its strength. We can't buy bullets for guns. \nTalk to the Air Force people who go out to the red flag exercises at \nNellis in the desert. They have cut them down so they don't believe \nthey are getting the necessary training to be combat ready and to \ncompete.\n  Look at our modernization program. Now we have been cutting back on \nthe Crusader Program, which the Army believes is the crown jewel--that \nthing we have to have for our launching capability on the ground. Look \nat our modernization program in airplanes. I was never more proud of a \nfour-star general than I was the other day when he stood up and said \nAmerica needs to know that the Russians now have the SU-34, an air-to-\nair, air combat vehicle\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\nthat is better than anything we have, including the F-15.\n  The average American would say we are fine and we have the very best \nof equipment. We used to, but we don't now. Look at the ranges we have \nnow. We are faced with an issue of having to close--temporarily, I \nhope--the firing range on Vieques. That is going to have a dramatic \neffect on which installations to keep open. We won't have anyplace to \nhave live fire training. We will lose such ranges as Cape Wrath in \nScotland, Capo Teulada in southern Sardinia. Why? Because there is no \njustification to allow us to fire our artillery if we are not willing \nto do it on our own lands.\n  All of these things form a crisis. When I said I look back wistfully \nat the days of the cold war, it isn't just me. I was redeemed the other \nday at our subcommittee meeting when we had George Tenet, the Director \nof Central Intelligence, there. This happened to be telecast live on C-\nSPAN. I said:\n\n       Right now, we are in the most threatened position that we \n     have been in as a Nation in the history of this country since \n     the Revolutionary War. Would you respond to that?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Absolutely correct. We are in the most threatened position.\n\n  It is because of the combined reasons of deployments, force strength \nand, of course, not having the national missile defense systems. All \nthose will be elements of rebuilding. Who knows what our needs are \ngoing to be when we start this rebuilding. I hope the next President \nwill be a Republican, and that we will be in a position to rebuild our \ndefense system. When that happens, we don't know what the elements of \nthat system are going to be.\n  Lastly--and I don't want to overdo the time here--we are asked this \nquestion by the distinguished Senator from Arizona: I challenge my \ncolleagues to name any military expert who says we should not have \nanother BRAC round.\n  You can name a lot of them.\n  The Assistant Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan said in an \narticle in the Washington Post on May 14, 1998, when we were having the \nsame debate, that Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is correct when \nhe says that the Department of Defense needs the support of Congress to \nhave a cost-effective national defense. But the Secretary is blaming \nCongress for problems that are not of its making. More importantly, \nCohen is ignoring the administration's own complicity in creating \nfunding difficulties for defense and vastly is exaggerating the \npotential problems that could occur if Congress fails to heed his \nadvice. Cohen wants Congress to authorize two new rounds of base \nclosures to free up an additional $3 billion a year for buying badly \nneeded new weapons. But what Cohen has not stated is that these savings \nwould not begin until a decade from now.\n  I think that is the significant thing. These savings would set in \nafter a period of time that we would be going through this rebuilding \nprocess.\n  I hold him up as one expert who says we should not do a round at this \ntime.\n  Another is the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Jim Jones, who \nsaid that he knew of no Marine installation he would recommend for \nclosure. He said: We cannot give it away or we will never get it back.\n  I don't think anyone is going to say that Gen. Jim Jones is not a \nmilitary expert. He has one of the most distinguished careers of any of \nthem.\n  Adm. Jay L. Johnson, the CNO, said his view was ``not far'' from that \nof Jones. He said he is concerned about permanently losing training \nranges, air space, and access to the sea.\n  The Chief of the Army, General Shinseki, said he would support some \nclosures in the future but said that the Army needs to decide what its \nfuture force level is going to be before it can judge base \nconsolidation with certainty.\n  We have three of the four chiefs of our services saying if we are \ngoing to do it we should wait and do it after we determine what our \nforce strength should be in the future and not do it before that time.\n  For the combination of those reasons, there is certainly no rush to \ndo it and do it in this bill. Certainly I would be willing to talk \nabout this after the next administration comes in. It wouldn't make any \ndifference anyway because the first round wouldn't be until 2003.\n  I think Dick Armey did a wonderful job back in 1987. I think it \nserved a very useful purpose--particularly the first three BRAC rounds \nthat we were able to accomplish. They saved a lot of money. We are now \nenjoying some of the savings. However, the amounts that we saved have \nfar exceeded what we lost by the cleanup costs. I don't think those \nestimates would be anymore accurate if we were to go through two new \nrounds.\n  Keep in mind that every succeeding round is going to yield fewer \nbenefits than the round before. I certainly think the Senator from \nRhode Island, with his background and experience, knows that if you are \ngoing to start a closing process, you pick off the cherries to start \nwith and accumulate those savings.\n  I conclude by saying that we need to look at them in the next \nadministration after we find out what our force strength is going to \nbe, and after we find out what degree of rebuilding we will have to \nundergo in order to protect America and meet the minimum expectations \nof the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I seek to be recognized under the time of \nSenator McCain.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield the Senator from \nRhode Island whatever time he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to authorize two \nrounds of base closings in the years 2003 and 2005. I commend \nparticularly Senator McCain and Senator Levin, the prime sponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  We all realize that base closing is a very sensitive issue because it \naffects dramatically all of the communities that have military \ninstallations. My home State, as some States, has not been immune to \nbase closings. We had a significant presence of the Navy in \nNarragansett Bay. That presence has been diminished over the last \nseveral years. But we still have a strong and vibrant naval presence in \nthe form of the Naval War College, and the Naval Underseas Warfare \nLaboratory. All of these contribute significantly not only to our \nnational defense but to our economy in Rhode Island.\n  We approach this understanding that it is a very sensitive issue. But \nit is an issue that we must address. It is an issue that requires \ndetermination at this point so we can, indeed, free up the resources \nthat are necessary for the modernization of our services.\n  The reality is quite compelling that we have excess capacity in our \nmilitary establishment in terms of infrastructure. We have reduced the \nforce structure by 36 percent since 1989. Yet we only managed to reduce \nthe infrastructure--the buildings and the facilities--by 21 percent. \nThis mismatch is obvious. This mismatch causes us to continue to spend \nin maintenance and operational expenses hundreds of millions of dollars \na year minimally for facilities that we don't need. As a result, I \nthink we have to recognize that we should authorize another round of \nbase closings. The Department of Defense estimates they are maintaining \n23 percent of excess infrastructure which is sapping resources that \nthey could use for a host of critical needs--modernization, training, \nand quality of life for servicemen and servicewomen throughout our \nmilitary.\n  Indeed, we hear so often that one of the persistent complaints is \nthat Government should be as business; that Government should be run as \nefficiently as business. No business would suggest that it reduce its \npersonnel dramatically and not make comparable reductions in the \ninfrastructure and the facilities that have been in place for more than \n50 years, in many cases.\n  We still have the residue of the World War II buildup. There were so \nmany posts put up because we had to at that point train millions of \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and coastguardsmen to staff an Army that was \nmany, many times larger than it is today and a Navy that was comparably \nlarger. Yet those facilities are still on our rolls because we had been \nunable to effectively initiate base-closing rounds after our first few \nrounds.\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\n  We know that the base-closing process yields savings. It has been \nestimated by the Department of Defense that past closures will produce \nnet savings of about $14 billion by the end of the fiscal year 2001, \nand they estimate annual savings thereafter will be about $5.7 billion. \nThis is the result of decisions we already made, base-closing rounds \nthat have already taken place, and the bases that have already been \nclosed. That is a lot of money, particularly as we all are concerned \nabout additional resources for defense.\n\n  Another way to look at that is to consider how much more difficult it \nwould be to buy new platforms, to provide pay increases, and to enhance \nthe quality of life through improved houses and through improved health \ncare if we were still maintaining and spending billions of dollars on \nthese facilities that have been closed.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that two additional rounds of \nbase closings would generate annual savings of about $23 billion after \nthey are implemented. Again, those are significant resources that can \nbe used for programs that we consider to be critical to the defense of \nthe Nation and the well-being of our men and women in uniform.\n  Both the Congressional Budget Office and the GAO agree that the \nDepartment of Defense continues to maintain excess capacity and that \nbase closings will result in substantial savings. These are objective \nanalyses of the current situation with respect to bases in our country.\n  The argument has been made that, well, we go out and we close these \nbases, and all of the savings are just eaten up by environmental \nremediation. I remind everyone that the requirement to remediate the \nenvironment is not a function of closing the bases. It is an ongoing \nresponsibility of the Department of Defense. It is mandated regardless \nof whether a base remains open or closed. It is part of our lore.\n  The Defense Department, as every other Federal entity and private \nentity, has responsibilities to restore degraded environment.\n  What happens in a base closing is, as part of the process not only to \nclose the base but also to make the base useful for civilian pursuits \nand community economic development, this environmental cleanup is \naccelerated. One could argue that accelerated environmental cleanup \nsimply discharges a duty that already exists and also, importantly, \nmakes these facilities much more amenable to economic development and \nprivate benefit for the local communities, which is a plus, not a \nminus.\n  The issue before the Senate should be addressed, as we so often \naddress it, in the context of advice we have received from individuals \ncharged with the administration of our military policy. The Secretary \nof Defense, the service secretaries, and many others have commented \nupon the desirability of the additional base closing rounds. In his \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee on February 8 of this \nyear, General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs stated: We continue \nto have excess infrastructure, and any funds applied toward maintaining \nunneeded facilities diminish our capacity to redirect those funds \ntowards higher priority modernization programs.\n  At the same hearing, Secretary of Defense Cohen requested funding to \nimplement two more BRAC rounds, so that: scarce defense dollars will \nnot continue to be spent on excess infrastructure; rather, on the vital \nneeds of our Armed Forces.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that the base-closing process is \nappropriate, the need is there, but the base-closing process in 1994 \nwas politically tainted; that politics and not sound defense policy \ndictated what would stay open, what would be closed, and the schedule \nfor closures.\n\n  This amendment clearly obviates the potential for that by declaring \nthat the base-closing rounds will take place in the year 2003 and in \n2005. There will be a new administration. Any aspersions to the \noperations of this administration should have no effect whatever when \nwe consider the legislation included in this amendment.\n  I believe we can go forward with the notion that if we act today, we \nwill have a much firmer picture of our strategic challenges, our \nstrategic posture by the year 2003, so that we will in fact be \nanticipating those strategic decisions by giving our military leaders, \nboth civilian and military, the tools to implement their concepts to \nmeet the new challenges, the new threats we see all around the world.\n  This issue, as I said, is difficult. It impinges on the communities \nwe all represent. Anytime we authorize a base closing round, \nessentially we put all of our facilities in play. We all run the risk \nof losing a facility which is a vital part of our community, disrupting \nour community. But that is the very narrow view, a very parochial view.\n  The broader national view is that we need to eliminate the excess \ncapacity. We need to free up resources for higher priority initiatives \nof the Department of Defense. We need, also, to move away from this \nessentially still World War II infrastructure to a much more reduced \nbut more efficient logistical and facility base for the future of this \nnew century. Until we are able to eliminate some of these older posts, \nsome of these posts that were designed for and that were extremely \nimportant in World War II and throughout the cold war years, we will \nnot have the resource to do what we have to do to face the future.\n  I suggest we adopt this amendment because it gives us the ability to \nfund higher priority functions. It gives us the ability to eliminate \nunnecessary facilities. We simply can't have it both ways. We can't \ncontinue to argue for modernization, for enhancement of the quality of \nlife for our troops, for additional training dollars, and still cling \nto facilitates that are not needed, still insist that we maintain a \nWorld War II and cold war infrastructure as we face the challenges of \nthis new century.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, give our defense \nleaders the tools to reduce their overhead as they have reduced the \nforce structure, so that we have a more efficient, more effective \nmilitary force for this new century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do the proponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I rise today to support the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Levin.\n  Between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001, defense spending in \nour Nation will increase by more than 6 percent, nearly three times the \nrate of inflation. Under normal circumstances, I would likely oppose \nlegislation that would increase defense spending at such a rate. \nHowever, we have a crisis in the military right now with respect to \nreadiness, recruitment, retention, procurement, modernization; and the \ncrisis must be met immediately. I will support more money for defense.\n  Having said that, I believe in the long term the Defense Department \nmust focus on those activities that will help bring down their overall \ncosts. Part of the problem we run into in this body is our inability to \nadmit that priorities can and should be established by the Department \nof Defense. We need to focus on ways in which the Department can cut \nback on some of its expenditures and use the moneys allocated more \nwisely. In other words, we need to get a bigger bang for our buck. We \nneed to work harder and smarter, and we need to do more with less.\n  One of the ways we can do that is to eliminate those military \nfacilities that no longer serve a useful purpose. I know that is not \neasy. We have experienced the pain of closing bases in Ohio with the \nclosure of Newark Air Force Base, Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base, \nand the Defense Electronic Supply Center. Even with the closures and \nthe pain we went through, we understood that it was necessary if we \nwere going to allocate resources where they were really needed in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  According to a 1998 Department of Defense report, and as stated by \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen, our Armed Forces currently have 23 \npercent more military base capacity than is needed in this Nation. \nThink of that, 23 percent. Keeping this much extra capacity adds up. \nRight now, we spend billions of dollars annually. We will keep on \nspending that money until we\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\nacknowledge that we have excess capacity and exercise the will to shut \nit down.\n  As difficult as this may sound, we have been through this process \nbefore. We know that. The Department of Defense reports that because of \nthe base closings that have been conducted, we will have saved $14 \nbillion a year by the end of 2001. The projected net savings, annual \nsavings, for the first four rounds have been estimated at nearly $5.7 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001, a savings that should occur annually. We \nhave that money, and it has been reallocated.\n  This amendment initiates another two rounds of base closings in 2003 \nand 2005. In his testimony earlier this year before the Armed Services \nCommittee, Secretary Cohen stated that if we initiate two more rounds \nof base closings, this will save about $3 billion per year that we can \nuse for some of the needs we have today in our Defense Department.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nthink there are those who say we ought not to do it at this time. I \nthink we all know that if we don't get started now and start the \nprocedure and do it today, do it this year, we are not going to be able \nto move forward in 2003 and 2005 when we project the base closings will \noccur.\n  I say again, I know this is a tough amendment to support for some of \nmy colleagues, but for the good of our Nation I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this \namendment that seeks to authorize two additional BRAC rounds in fiscal \nyears 2003 and 2005.\n  I have been a steadfast opponent to future BRAC proposals. This \nAdministration has proposed BRAC legislation for the last 3 years. Each \nyear, this administration has asked us to address the same issue. Yet \nover the last three years, nothing has changed.\n  First, the estimated savings achieved by closing bases are just \nthat--estimated; and second, the inconsistent application of the BRAC \nprocess--which this Administration so readily demonstrated after the \n1995 round, will result in lost training areas or access to airspace or \nthe sea space by our military forces. This will result in degraded \nforce readiness and will be to the overall detriment of our Armed \nForces.\n  Advocates of base closures allege that billions of dollars will be \nsaved, despite the fact that there is no consensus on the numbers among \ndifferent sources. These estimates vary because, as the Congressional \nBudget Office explains, BRAC savings are really ``avoided costs.'' \nBecause these avoided costs are not actual expenditures and cannot be \nrecorded and tracked by the DoD accounting systems, they cannot be \nvalidated which has lead to inaccurate and overinflated estimates.\n  For example, as revealed by the General Accounting Office, land sales \nfrom the first base closure round in 1988 were estimated by Pentagon \nofficials to produce $2.4 billion in revenue, however, as of 1995, the \nactual revenue generated was only $65.7 million. That is about 25 \npercent of the expected value. And what was the real up-front cost to \ngenerate these so called savings? No one really knows.\n  This type of overly optimistic accounting establishes a very poor \nfoundation for initiating a policy that will have a permanent impact on \nboth the military and the civilian communities surrounding these bases.\n  I also want to address the issue of the up-front costs involved in \nthe base closure process. This appears to be noticeably absent from the \ndebate. The facts reveal that there are billions of dollars in costs \nincurred to close a base.\n  This includes over $1 billion in Federal financial assistance \nprovided to each affected community--a cost paid by the Federal \nGovernment, not through BRAC budget accounts, and therefore is not \ncounted in the estimates. And more significantly, there is $9.6 billion \nin environmental cleanup costs as a result of the first four BRAC \nrounds--a conservative figure according to a December 1998 GAO report--\na number that will continue to grow.\n  The administration and proponents of additional BRAC rounds are quick \nto point out that reducing infrastructure has not kept pace with our \npost cold war military force reductions. They say that bases must be \ndownsized proportionate to the reduction in total force strength.\n  However, this thinking is based on the 1997 Quadrennial Defense \nReview. Since the end of the cold war we have reduced the military \nforce structure by 36 percent and have reduced the defense budget by 40 \npercent. But now I ask you how much are we employing that force?\n  Let me point out that although the size of the armed services has \ndecreased, the number of contingencies that our service members have \nbeen called upon to respond to has dramatically increased--the Navy/\nMarine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingency missions between \n1980 and 1989, and between 1990 and 1999 they responded to 192--a \nremarkable threefold increase!\n  During the cold war, the U.N. Security Council rarely approved the \ncreation of peace operations. The U.N. implemented only 13 such \noperations between 1948 and 1978, and none from 1979 to 1987. Since \n1988, by contrast, 38 peace operations have been established--nearly \nthree times as many than the previous 40 years.\n\n  In hearing after hearing this year, the Armed Services Committee has \nheard from our leaders in uniform how our current military forces are \nbeing stretched too thin, and that estimates predicted in the fiscal \nyear 1997 QDR underestimated how much the United Sates would be using \nits military. Clearly, the benefits of the peace dividend are not being \nrealized.\n  So, we are seeing first hand that the 1997 QDR force levels \nunderestimated how much our military force was intended to be used, \nthat our military force is being called upon now more than what \nmilitary strategies estimated, and that our forces are being stretched \nto cover a wide range of operations.\n  These force levels have to be revisited, and if the trend for current \ndeployments remains true, I would expect that these force levels may \nhave to be increased. So would we then go and buy back this property \nthat we have given up in future BRAC rounds to build new bases--I think \nnot.\n  Before we legislate defense-wide policy that will reduce the size and \nnumber of training areas critical to our force readiness, the \nDepartment of Defense needs a comprehensive plan that identifies the \noperational and maintenance infrastructure required to support the \nservices national security requirements. The peacekeeping and \nhumanitarian missions clearly require a greater force structure than \nexpected.\n  It has become clear that we are committing more military forces--and \nmore often--than we had planned or anticipated. There is no straight \nline corollary between the size of our forces and the infrastructure \nrequired to support them.\n  We must realize that once property is given up and remediated, it is \npermanently lost as a military asset for all practical purposes. In the \nwords of the Chief of Naval Operations, ``we cannot give it away or we \nwill never get it back''.\n  In the full committee hearings and the subcommittee hearings that the \nArmed Services Committee held this past year, the Chief of Naval \nOperations and fleet commanders testified that the QDR established \nforce levels are not sufficient to support their operational \nrequirements. A report released earlier this year by the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the submarine force levels \nneeded to be raised from the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and I \nanticipate that the next QDR will support an increase in the ``300 \nship'' Navy as well.\n  Therefore, given the elasticity in the QDR numbers, it would be \npremature and costly to base permanent BRAC decisions on estimates that \nwe know are not being realized.\n  Finally, it would be hypocritical to say that opponents of additional \nBRAC rounds are politicizing the process. Politics weigh heavily on \nboth sides of the debate. In December 1998, the General Accounting \nOffice reported that of the 499 recommendations made by the four BRAC \ncommissions, 48 were amended and removed from the closure list. And we \nare all well aware of the Administration's ``intervention'' in the last \nround that resulted in the ``privatization-in-place'' of the McClellan \nand Kelly Air Force Base depots instead of their closure.\n  I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational \nassets. I\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nwant to protect the home port berthing for our ships and submarines, \nthe airspace that our aircraft fly in and the training areas and ranges \nthat our armed forces require to support and defend our Nation. We \ncannot degrade the readiness of our armed forces by chasing illusive \nsavings.\n  I reaffirm my opposition to legislation authorizing additional BRAC \nrounds and encourage my colleagues to join me to vote against it. I \nurge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe, I believe, desires some \ntime, and then I will yield to Senator Hatch for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if I can respond to a couple of the \nstatements of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Rhode Island, \nfirst of all, I know the Senator from Rhode Island is sincere when he \nsays this would not take place until 2003; it would be a new \nadministration. But we have to keep in mind that administration could \nvery well be a Gore administration. It was Vice President Gore who was \nvery instrumental in politicizing the system before. I think that is \nsignificant.\n  I would say also to my friend from Ohio, while there are savings that \nwould be effected, the savings, according to Secretary Cohen, would not \neven start until 2008. By that time, we are hoping we will have been \nable to use every available dollar to get us out of the situation we \nare in right now. I think that is very significant. Our crisis is now. \nOur crisis is a rebuilding program for the next 4 to 5 years.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as somebody who lived through the last BRAC \nprocess, and lived through it in a very intensive way, I have to say \nthe process did not work. Everyone lost: the taxpayers, the workers in \nUtah, as well as those in the losing states of California and Texas, \nand the Air Force's state of military readiness. The process was too \npoliticized, as I elaborate upon in my later remarks. It was a pitiful \nexercise, in many respects.\n  There were some good things about it, I have to acknowledge, but most \nof it was not.\n  Utah had the Air Force's highest rated air logistics command in the \nnation, bar none. Nobody could compare with it. It was listed No. 1. It \nmade the top of every chart. The workforce and its achievements were \nmodels of efficiency. But, after the President finished tampering with \nthe BRAC results, we had to fight like dogs against raging wolves to \nprove repeatedly what the BRAC had already determined.\n  No sooner did we get through all that process--time after time \nappearing at hearings, appearing at major meetings considering BRAC, \nand considering what should be done, making our case over and over, and \nwinning, winning, winning--this administration came in and immediately \nundertook questionable steps to sully the BRAC process.\n  My experience gives me little confidence in this process. And it's \nnot done yet: we won't have the process completed until late 2001, six \nyears after the BRAC decision. I do not care who is in charge. When you \npoliticize the base closing process, it just leads to the type of \nanquish I and my colleagues are expressing here today.\n  How can we forget the major problems between San Antonio and \nMcClellan, both of which were installations important to their \nrespective States but did not reach the high standards of Utah's Hill \nAir Force Base. If Hill Air Force Base had come in last, I would not be \nhere arguing today, nor back then, to keep it alive.\n  Let's not forget that we need high military readiness--it is a \ndeterrent that allows for peace through strength. But that means having \na system that accentuates everything that is good about our military, \nlike Hill Air Force Base. I would not back a base that was not doing \nthe job.\n  But in this particular case, McClellan had been judged by the Air \nForce and the BRAC commssion as deficient, as was the San Antonio Air \nLogistics Center at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Yet, we wanted to help \nKelly, if we could, because it had a high percentage of Hispanic \nworkers. But the brutal facts showed that Kelly could not measure up. \nNeither did McClellan.\n  Then came the administration's misguided and downright wrongful \nattempts to save some of those jobs.\n  Mr. President, Ronald Reagan immediately comes to mind when I \nconsider today's debate on BRAC . . . ``Here we go again.'' We're being \nasked to engage in the same type of taxpayer deception that \ncharacterized the 1995 BRAC. We promise savings, and deliver nothing. \nAll BRAC produces is a politicized outcome that makes a mockery of the \nindependent commission process.\n  We need to remind ourselves why we sought a BRAC in the first place: \nIt was because we did not feel Congress could be trusted. In fact, it \nwas the President who couldn't be trusted. Let's look at some facts, \nfacts especially painful to states which lost bases, and those that had \nto defend what they had won again, again and again. I refer to Utah's \nOgden Air Logistics Center at Hill AFB--three times we had to compete \nfor workloads that the BRAC awarded us, but which the President delayed \nsending to Utah.\n  The President intervened in the BRAC 95 process to secure \nCalifornia's 54 electoral votes in the 1996 election. My good friends \nfrom California--Senators Boxer and Feinstein--publicly stated that \nthey would get relief from the White House after BRAC decided to close \nMcClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento. They succeeded, and at the cost \nof work that ought to have gone to Georgia and Utah, but which was \ndelayed.\n  The President called the BRAC decision to close McClellan an \n``outrage'', in a Rose Garden statement. He actually rejected the \ndecision of his own independent commission. In its place, the President \nput great pressure on the Air Force to sully an already messy \nsituation. He called this ``privatization in place.'' He attempted to \nkeep the jobs which were intended to be distributed to Utah, Oklahoma \nand Georgia in California by forcing a public-private competition that \nGAO rejected as unfair. It had the effect of leaving in California as \nmany as 3,200 jobs for as long as six years after the BRAC decision, or \nconveniently after the year 2000 presidential election.\n  The BRAC monies designated to move jobs and equipment to Utah and \nelsewhere were mismanaged. They were spent to improve the very \nfacilities at McClellan AFB that the BRAC had intended to close! This, \nthe President and his gang thought, would make it easier for the base \nto attract private contractors to perform the privatized work in place.\n  The delay caused by this contrived competition cost the taxpayers an \nadditional $500 million, according to GAO, to sustain the bases' \nworkloads in place, despite the decision of BRAC to ship the workloads \nto the other Air Force depots.\n  In May 1998, as many of you will remember, the Secretary of the Air \nForce was embarrassed by a memo written by his office urging that the \nLockheed-Martin bid for the California work win the award. This \nbehavior, to my mind, remains one of the most egregious violations of \nthe Ethics Reform Act I have seen in my 24 years in the Senate. This \nact prohibits precisely the type of collusion in which the Secretary of \nthe Air Force participated.\n  It was so outrageous that Secretary Bill Cohen, to his everlasting \ncredit, removed the Secretary of the Air Force from the selection team \nthat would oversee the public-private competition for the McClellan \nworkload.\n  But this was not the end of the Clinton Administration's meddling: \nthey directed the Air Force to deny the GAO, the congressional watchdog \nagency responsible for overseeing the expenditure of taxpayers' funds, \naccess to the cost-data and other information used by the Air Force to \nput together competition for the McClellan workload.\n  As might be expected, the long-term effect of this mischievous \nmeddling had a cost on readiness. Delays in workload transfer were \ndirectly responsible for a severe F-16 parts shortage in 1999. Also, \nthere is a suspicious relationship between the delayed workload \ntransfer and the KC-135 tanker problems early this year when the fleet \nwas grounded because of a rear stabilizer malfunction, a problem akin \nto the cause of the Alaskan Airline aircraft off the California coast. \nMy personal inquiry into the KC-135 issue demonstrated that if the \nentire KC-135 team responsible for\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nthe repair of this part of the aircraft had been transferred to Utah in \na timely way, as directed by the BRAC, the design flaw would probably \nnever have occurred.\n  There is an answer to BRAC: let Congress endorse the decisions of the \nmilitary services, without the filter of presidential intervention, \nwhether by a BRAC-like commission or any other procedure. The military \nservices know better than any other body the best and the worst of \ntheir installations, the ones that pay their own way, and the ones that \ndrain the taxpayers' pockets. After my state's experience with the BRAC \nprocess, I am more inclined to trust this body to evaluate the \nservices' recommendations.\n  I see that we have a very important guest. I will be happy to yield \nthe floor at this time for Senator Helms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4649-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVISIT TO THE SENATE BY THEIR MAJESTIES KING ABDULLAH II AND QUEEN RANIA \n             AL-ABDULLAH OF THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am trying to move things forward. \nSenator Helms and I are working out language. I think we will have an \nagreement, but I thought I would start speaking on this amendment so we \ncan move this forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nthat deals with the importance of condemning the use of child soldiers \nin dozens of countries around the world. It is also about very \nimportant protocol that is being developed and the importance of \nbuilding support for it and moving forward as expeditiously as possible \non this question.\n  Today, there are 300,000 children who are currently serving as \nsoldiers in current armed conflicts. Child soldiers are being used in \n30 countries around the world, including Colombia, Lebanon, and Sierra \nLeone. Child soldiers witness and are often forced to participate in \nhorrible atrocities.\n  I am talking about 10-year-olds being abducted, forced to participate \nin horrible atrocities, including beheadings, amputations, rape, and \nthe burning of people alive. These young combatants are forced to \nparticipate in all kinds of contemporary warfare. They wield AK-47s and \nM 16s on the front lines. They serve as human mine detectors. They \nparticipate in suicide missions. They carry supplies and act as spies, \nmessengers, or lookouts.\n  One 14-year-old girl abducted in January 1999 by the Revolutionary \nUnited Front, a rebel group in Sierra Leone, reported to human rights \nobservers:\n\n       I've seen people get their hands cut off, a ten-year-old \n     girl raped and then die, and so many men and women burned \n     alive * * * So many times I just cried inside my heart \n     because I didn't dare cry out loud.\n\n  Mr. President, no child should experience such trauma. No child \nshould experience such pain.\n  Last year, I introduced a resolution expressing the sense of the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nthat U.S. policy permit consensus on language on this optional protocol \non child soldiers, directing the State Department to work positively to \naddress its concerns, in language within the United Nations Working \nGroup on Child Soldiers. Today I thank the State Department for its \nwork, and I thank the Department of Defense for its conscientious work, \nand I thank the Joint Chiefs of Staff for signing off on this protocol. \nI think it is terribly important work.\n\n  On January 21 in Geneva, representatives from more than 80 countries, \nincluding the United States, worked out an agreement raising the \nminimum wage for conscription in direct participation in armed conflict \nto 18 and prohibiting the recruitment and use in armed conflict of \npersons under the age of 18 by nongovernmental armed forces. The \nagreement calls on governments to raise the minimum wage for voluntary \nrecruitment above the current standard of 15 but still allows the armed \nforces to accept voluntary recruits from the age of 16, subject to \ncertain safeguards.\n  The Pentagon, and again the State Department, Harold Cohen in \nparticular, have been great to work with. I believe this is a \nhumanitarian crisis that we ought to address now. It is absolutely \nunbelievable that in the year 2000 we see people as young as age 10 \nabducted--I have talked to some of the mothers of these children who \nare abducted--and forced to commit atrocities. It is unbelievable that \nwe see children age 10 cutting off the arms of other people, engaging \nin murder. It is unbelievable the extent to which young women are \nabducted, and they themselves are terrorized and raped. This is a \npractice that takes place in 30 countries around the world involving \n300,000 children.\n  Finally, after years of work, the United Nations has put together an \nimportant protocol. We are, I believe, close to supporting this.\n  In conclusion, this is just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the \nCongress joins in condemning the use of children as soldiers by \ngovernmental and nongovernmental armed forces. We talk about the \nimportance of taking this action. We make it clear that it is essential \nthat the President consult closely with the Senate in the objective of \nbuilding support for the protocol, and we also urge the Senate to move \nforward as expeditiously as possible.\n  I think it is important that all of us support this. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so. I want colleagues to know that Congressman Lewis \nand Congressman Lantos on the House side have a very similar \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I commend my colleague for bringing this issue to our \nattention. I think it is particularly timely that he would raise this \non the floor of the Senate. In a trip to Africa just a few months ago, \nI discovered the ravages of the AIDS epidemic. There are some 10 \nmillion AIDS orphans. These children are likely to become the soldiers \nin these armies the Senator from Minnesota has just described. The \nyoung girls are likely to become either victimized or prostitutes \nthemselves, who are going to really, in a way, continue this cycle of \ndisease and dependency and death.\n  I commend my colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, for calling this important moral issue to the attention of \nthe Senate. I rise in strong support. I ask him if he has considered \nthe impact of the AIDS epidemic and similar health problems that have \ncreated so many orphans in Africa, and now we have the fastest growth \nof HIV infection in the world in India, and the impact this could have \non the issue he has raised.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the time I have remaining let me say \nto my colleague from Illinois, I believe my colleague from Illinois, \nthe Senator from California, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others \nhave really brought to our attention the number of citizens, not just \nchildren, who are HIV infected, struggling with AIDS. It is a \nhumanitarian crisis of tremendous proportions.\n  I think for too long the world has just turned its gaze away from \nthis and from the whole question of how to get affordable drug \ntreatment to deal with this, prescription drug treatment, to ways in \nwhich our country ought to be more engaged, to ways in which we can \nencourage governments in Africa to deal directly with this. Finally, we \nare doing so. My colleague is right, it is also true, for the worst of \neconomic reasons or reasons of desperation, that these young people, \nincluding young people infected with AIDS, are the recruits. They \nbecome the child soldiers--again, colleagues, 300,000 children, many of \nthem abducted, in 30 countries, used as child soldiers.\n  This resolution, I think, is terribly important. Our Department of \nDefense and State Department have worked hard. A year ago, our \nGovernment was not supporting this. I think we now have language that \nis important language. This simply urges the Senate to condemn this \npractice and talks about the importance of the President moving forward \nand building support for this protocol, and it calls upon the Senate to \nact expeditiously on this matter.\n  I hope there will be 100 votes for this. I thank my colleague Senator \nHelms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for working with \nme. We have changed some language, and I think we have a good \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nme to speak from my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have prepared the best speech you will never hear. I \nwas prepared to have to oppose my friend from Minnesota, but we have \ncome to an understanding about this matter. We have agreed to amend and \nmodify the proposed amendment in a way that makes it satisfactory to \nme.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3211\n\n (Purpose: To express condemnation of the use of children as soldiers \n and expressing the belief that the United States should support and, \n    where possible, lead efforts to end this abuse of human rights)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 3211.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 462, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1210. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE USE OF CHILDREN AS \n                   SOLDIERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the year 2000 approximately 300,000 individuals \n     under the age of 18 are participating in armed conflict in \n     more than 30 countries worldwide;\n       (2) many of these children are forcibly conscripted through \n     kidnapping or coercion, while others join military units due \n     to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, \n     or for their own personal safety;\n       (3) many military commanders frequently force child \n     soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or \n     torture against their enemies, including against other \n     children;\n       (4) many military commanders separate children from their \n     families in order to foster dependence on military units and \n     leaders, leaving children vulnerable to manipulation, deep \n     traumatization, and in need of psychological counseling and \n     rehabilitation;\n       (5) child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and \n     risk physical injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, \n     malnutrition, deformed backs and shoulders from carrying \n     overweight loads, and respiratory and skin infections;\n       (6) many young female soldiers face the additional \n     psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n     being enslaved for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n     forced to endure severe social stigma should they return \n     home;\n       (7) children in northern Uganda continue to be kidnapped by \n     the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which is supported and \n     funded by the Government of Sudan and which has committed and \n     continues to commit gross human rights violations in Uganda;\n       (8) children in Sri Lanka have been forcibly recruited by \n     the opposition Tamil Tigers movement and forced to kill or be \n     killed in the armed conflict in that country;\n       (9) an estimated 7,000 child soldiers have been involved in \n     the conflict in Sierra Leone, some as young as age 10, with \n     many being\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\n     forced to commit extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, and \n     amputations for the rebel Revolutionary United Front;\n       (10) on January 21, 2000, in Geneva, a United Nations \n     Working Group, including representatives from more than 80 \n     governments including the United States, reached consensus on \n     an optional protocol on the use of child soldiers;\n       (11) this optional protocol will raise the international \n     minimum age for conscription and direct participation in \n     armed conflict to age eighteen, prohibit the recruitment and \n     use in armed conflict of persons under the age of eighteen by \n     non-governmental armed forces, encourage governments to raise \n     the minimum legal age for voluntary recruits above the \n     current standard of 15 and, commits governments to support \n     the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers, and \n     when possible, to allocate resources to this purpose;\n       (12) on October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary General \n     Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United Nations \n     peacekeeping personnel that are made available by member \n     nations of the United Nations;\n       (13) United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace-\n     keeping, Bernard Miyet, announced in the Fourth Committee of \n     the General Assembly that contributing governments of member \n     nations were asked not to send civilian police and military \n     observers under the age of 25, and that troops in national \n     contingents should preferably be at least 21 years of age but \n     in no case should they be younger than 18 years of age;\n       (14) on August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning \n     the use of children in armed conflicts;\n       (15) in addressing the Security Council, the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary General for Children and \n     Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global \n     three-pronged approach to combat the use of children in armed \n     conflict, first to raise the age limit for recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict from the present age of 15 to \n     the age of 18, second, to increase international pressure on \n     armed groups which currently abuse children, and third to \n     address the political, social, and economic factors which \n     create an environment where children are induced by appeal of \n     ideology or by socio-economic collapse to become child \n     soldiers;\n       (16) the United States delegation to the United Nations \n     working group relating to child soldiers, which included \n     representatives from the Department of Defense, supported the \n     Geneva agreement on the optional protocol;\n       (17) on May 25, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly \n     unanimously adopted the optional protocol on the use of child \n     soldiers;\n       (18) the optional protocol was opened for signature on June \n     5, 2000; and\n       (17) President Clinton has publicly announced his support \n     of the optional protocol and a speedy process of review and \n     signature.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress joins the \n     international community in--\n       (A) condemning the use of children as soldiers by \n     governmental and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and\n       (B) welcoming the optional protocol as a critical first \n     step in ending the use of children as soldiers.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) it is essential that the President consult closely with \n     the Senate with the objective of building support for this \n     protocol, and the Senate move forward as expeditiously as \n     possible;\n       (B) the President and Congress should work together to \n     enact a law that establishes a fund for the rehabilitation \n     and reintegration into society of child soldiers; and\n        (C) the Departments of State and Defense should undertake \n     all possible efforts to persuade and encourage other \n     governments to ratify and endorse the new optional protocol \n     on the use of child soldiers.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to colleagues, I will not require \na recorded vote. If we want to go forward with a voice vote, that will \nbe fine with me if it is fine with my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly urge we consider this matter by \nvoice vote.\n  I urge the question.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3211) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3210\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit granting security clearances to felons)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. \n3210 at the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Do I understand there is a pending Warner amendment which \nis being temporarily laid aside for this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending Warner amendment. There \nwas just an agreement that Senator Warner be recognized to offer an \namendment. If he does not seek recognition, he waives that right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just ask that be temporarily laid aside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is being temporarily laid aside if \nthere is not a pending amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the right to offer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The right to offer the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So as I understand it, after the disposition of the Smith \namendment, there would be an opportunity for Senator Warner to offer an \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Am I correct, as the manager of the bill he would have \nthat opportunity in any event? If he sought recognition, he would be \nfirst to be recognized after the leadership; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment No. 3210--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3210.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICIES.\n\n       No officer or employee of the Department of Defense or any \n     contractor thereof, and no member of the Armed Forces shall \n     be granted a security clearance unless that person:\n       (1) has not been convicted in any court of a crime \n     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year;\n       (2) is not an unlawful user of or addicted to any \n     controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act);\n       (3) has not been adjudicated as mentally incompetent;\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is really \nquite simple. It involves the issue of whether or not a felon should \nget a security clearance. That is the essence. If you favor felons \nhaving a security clearance, you would vote against my amendment. If \nyou think it is wrong that convicted felon should have a security \nclearance, then you would vote with me.\n  On April 6 there was a hearing the Armed Services Committee held that \ntouched upon an important and urgent issue, that of the longstanding \nprotections set in place to guard the most vital secrets of the Nation \nand of our national security community. But we had a virtual security \nmeltdown in this administration, from our DOE labs to people without \nclearances getting White House passes, to the recent scandal of missing \nand highly classified State Department laptops. It goes on and on. \nWhile we couldn't possibly begin to address all our Nation's security \ndeficiencies within this one authorization bill, I believe we can make \nprogress in one very specific area.\n  A reporter by the name of Ed Pound of USA Today has done an \noutstanding job with recent news reports and investigative reporting on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles written by Mr. \nPound from USA Today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nProbe of Security Clearances Urged--Senator Says Contract Hirings Pose \n                                a Threat\n\n                          (By Edward T. Pound)\n\n       WASHINGTON.--Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., urged the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee Tuesday to investigate why the Defense \n     Department is granting high-level security clearances to \n     employees of military contractors who have long histories of \n     problems, even criminal activity.\n       Smith, a senior member of the armed services panel, asked \n     its chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., to conduct the inquiry \n     and hold a hearing. In a letter to Warner, Smith\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n     said industrial espionage is on the upswing. ``One person can \n     cause immeasurable damage to national security,'' he wrote.\n       Smith said that white felons can't vote in some states, \n     they have been allowed by the Pentagon to retain access to \n     sensitive classified information. ``This doesn't pass the \n     smell test,'' he said.\n       Warner could not be reached Tuesday for comment.\n       Smith is chairman of the Environment and Public Works \n     Committee. He is the second senior senator to seek reform in \n     the wake of a USA TODAY story last week. It detailed how the \n     Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, or DOHA, regularly \n     granted clearances to contractors with histories of drug and \n     alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct, financial problems or \n     criminal activity.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, urged Defense Secretary William \n     Cohen last week to correct the situation. ``All necessary \n     steps must be taken to correct this problem immediately,'' he \n     said in a statement. ``Our nation's security depends on it.''\n       The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of \n     Congress, also will review DOHA and other Pentagon clearance \n     agencies. While defending DOHA, a Pentagon spokesman said \n     that any problems uncovered by the GAO would be corrected.\n       In his letter, Smith also asked Warner to explore why the \n     Defense Department is struggling to process security \n     background investigations, which serve as the basis for \n     issuing clearances. The Pentagon has a backlog of more than \n     600,000 investigations for renewals of clearances. Smith and \n     others say the problem poses a national security risk because \n     spies usually are trusted insiders.\n       Smith said many clearances granted by DOHA violated an \n     executive order issued by President Clinton in 1995. It \n     requires that clearances be issued only to those whose \n     history indicates ``loyalty in the United States, strength of \n     character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion \n     and sound judgment.''\n       Clearance officials evaluate security applicants under \n     ``adjudicative guidelines,'' the standards for granting \n     clearances. They cover, among other matters, allegiance to \n     the United States, foreign influence, security violations, \n     sexual behavior, financial problems criminal conduct, and \n     drug and alcohol abuse.\n       Smith said the armed services panel could force reform. ``I \n     would strongly urge you to task your staff to investigate'' \n     the clearance problems, Smith wrote Warner. He said an \n     inquiry could ``restore integrity and quality control'' to \n     the clearance process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Dec. 29, 1999]\n\n               Felons Gain Access to the Nation's Secrets\n\n                          (By Edward T. Pound)\n\n       WASHINGTON.--As a teenager, he was in trouble many times \n     and built an imposing rap sheet: delinquency, disorderly \n     conduct, resisting arrest, attempted theft, possession of a \n     deadly weapon, possession of marijuana, five counts of \n     burglary and three of theft. He got jail time and probation.\n       In 1978, at age 21 and a heavy drug user, he and two \n     accomplices kidnapped, robbed and murdered a fellow drug \n     user. He was charged in the murder, convicted and sentenced \n     to 30 years in prison.\n       Today, at 42, he is out of prison and working in a white-\n     collar job in the defense industry. He remains on parole \n     until 2006. As a convicted felon, he can't vote in many \n     states. But under federal law, he can and does hold a \n     government-issued security clearance, a privilege that allows \n     access to sensitive classified information off-limits to most \n     Americans.\n       His case is not exceptional. A USA Today review of more \n     than 1,500 security clearance decisions at the Department of \n     Defense shows that a Pentagon agency regularly grants \n     clearances to employees of defense contractors who have long \n     histories of financial problems, drug use, alcoholism, sexual \n     misconduct or criminal activity.\n       Applicants have been given sensitive clearances despite \n     repeatedly lying about past misconduct to Defense Department \n     investigators. One employee lied at least four times about \n     his drug history, including twice in sworn statements. \n     Officials didn't refer the matter to the Justice Department \n     for prosecution, something they rarely do; instead, they \n     allowed him to retain his secret-level clearance.\n       In other instances, contractor employees involved in \n     significant criminal frauds were granted clearances. So, too, \n     were applicants who had violated state and federal laws by \n     not filing income tax returns for several years, including a \n     woman who had not submitted timely returns for 11 years \n     because she was depressed.\n       Another employee mishandled classified material during a \n     five-year period but didn't lose his top-secret access. A \n     clearance official excused his actions because he had been \n     working in a ``pressure-cooker environment.''\n       All of these clearances were approved by the Defense Office \n     of Hearings and Appeals, or DOHA, a little-known Pentagon \n     agency that decides whether to grant or deny clearances to \n     employees of defense contractors. The decisions were made by \n     DOHA (pronounced DOUGH-ha) administrative judges. They rule \n     in cases in which applicants seek to overturn preliminary \n     decisions denying them access to classified information.\n       DOHA's quasi-judicial program, now in its 40th year, was \n     developed to give employees of contractors the right to \n     review the evidence against them and to challenge denials in \n     hearings, if they so choose, before an administrative judge. \n     Most clearance decisions are made by other DOHA officials and \n     never reach the judges.\n       About two-thirds of the time, the judges decide against \n     granting clearances. However, their approval of clearances \n     for some employees with deeply troubled histories concerns \n     other clearance officials in the military as well as security \n     investigators in the Defense Department.\n       They argue that DOHA has gone too far, granting clearances \n     to unstable people who might pose a risk to national \n     security. They worry that some employees with pressing \n     financial problems might sell secrets to foreign powers or \n     that others, vulnerable because of embarrassing personal \n     problems, could be blackmailed into espionage.\n       Army and Navy clearance officials criticize the agency for \n     being too ``lenient.'' Along with former DOHA officials, they \n     complain that the agency sometimes ignores the government's \n     ``adjudicative guidelines''--the standards for granting \n     clearances--in issuing decisions.\n       ``To be honest with you, I think DOHA often finds in favor \n     of the individual and not national security,'' says Edwin \n     Forrest, executive director of the Navy's Personnel Security \n     Appeal Board, which reviews clearance appeals from Navy \n     employees. ``What we see coming from DOHA are decisions that \n     go outside the envelope--outside the adjudicative \n     guidelines.''\n       Howard Strouse, a former senior DOHA official who retired \n     last January, is blunt: ``Any Americans who looked at these \n     DOHA decisions would be horrified. To know that we are giving \n     clearances to some of these people is just intolerable.''\n       But DOHA officials strongly defend their program and say \n     they put national security first. ``The decisions speak for \n     themselves,'' says Leon Schachter, the agency's director the \n     past 10 years. ``Do I believe in, or agree, with every \n     decision? Of course not. But it is important to treat people \n     fairly, and we have a system designed to be fair.''\n       He says the idea is not to punish security applicants for \n     past misconduct. ``The goal is to understand past conduct and \n     predict the future on it,'' he says. ``We are being asked to \n     use a crystal ball. It is a very difficult job.''\n       Indeed it is. On the one hand, President Clinton, in an \n     August 1995 executive order governing access to classified \n     information, directed that government clearances should be \n     given only to people ``whose personal and professional \n     history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, \n     strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, \n     discretion, and sound judgment.''\n       But the guidelines for granting clearances give \n     administrative judges and other federal clearance officials \n     leeway to consider ``mitigating'' circumstances: an applicant \n     who had committed a crime, for instance, might get a \n     clearance if the crime was not recent and there was evidence \n     of rehabilitation.\n       DOHA reviews cases involving access to classified \n     information at three levels of sensitivity: top-secret, \n     secret and confidential. A presidential directive says top-\n     secret information, if disclosed, could cause ``exceptionally \n     grave damage'' to national security; secret, if disclosed, \n     could cause ``serious damage''; and confidential, if \n     revealed, could cause ``damage.''\n       Classified material covers a lot of ground. It includes the \n     design plans and other data on dozens of weapons systems, \n     such as bombers and nuclear submarines, and information on \n     spy satellites, sophisticated technology and communications \n     systems. But it also includes such things as the composition \n     of the radar-absorbing coatings on Stealth bombers and the \n     names of employees who work on sensitive projects.\n       People within the contracting community with access to \n     classified information aren't jut top officials. They include \n     consultants, scientists, computer specialists, analysts, \n     secretaries and even blue-collar workers such as janitors and \n     truck drivers with access to classified areas.\n       The quality of DOHA's decisions is vital. Though none of \n     the cases involved DOHA decisions, according to agency \n     officials, a government report says 12 contractor employees \n     have been convicted of espionage in the past 17 years. And in \n     the aftermath of the Cold War, industrial espionage is on the \n     upswing. Spies from dozens of nations--some of them \n     friendly--have stepped up efforts to gather industrial \n     intelligence on technologies used in U.S. weapons systems.\n       Meanwhile, the Pentagon is struggling to process security \n     background investigations, which serve as the basis for \n     clearance decisions. It has a backlog of more than 600,000 \n     periodic reinvestigations--cases in which defense employees \n     and contractor personnel are to be re-evaluated.\n       The backlog is significant. Spies traditionally are trusted \n     insiders. Many cases reviewed by DOHA involve requests to \n     retain clearances. This backlog was disclosed last summer by \n     USA Today in an examination of the Defense Security Service, \n     another Pentagon agency, which conducts the background \n     checks.\n       In its inquiry into DOHA's actions, USA Today reviewed \n     decisions issued by the agency's 15 administrative judges \n     since 1994. Under the Privacy Act, DOHA deletes the names and \n     other identifying information from the files. The judges \n     review 300 to 400 cases a year. USA Today requested \n     interviews with two senior judges, but the Pentagon wouldn't \n     make them available.\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\n       In the case involving the murder, government lawyers sought \n     to block the clearance, but Administrative Judge Paul Mason \n     wrote that the man had earned a college degree and had \n     reformed.\n       ``Against the heinous nature of the crime,'' he wrote, \n     ``are the positive steps applicant has taken over the years \n     in making himself a productive member of society.'' He said \n     he was persuaded the ``applicant was genuinely remorseful'' \n     and would not resume a criminal career.\n       The man's lawyer, James McCune of Williamsburg, Va., won't \n     discuss the criminal case. But, he says, clearance decisions \n     must be weighed carefully because employees often lose their \n     jobs when they lose their clearances. ``It is really a black \n     mark,'' he says.\n       A sampling of other approvals:\n       On Aug. 27, 1997, Administrative Judge John Erck ruled that \n     a 43-year-old man who had participated in a scheme to defraud \n     the Navy of $2 million could keep his secret-level clearance. \n     The man was employed at the time of the fraud, in 1991, as a \n     ship's master for a company that operated ships for the Navy \n     in the U.S. Merchant Marine program. He and other employees \n     submitted false time sheets for overtime to assist their \n     financially troubled company. Judge Erck wrote that the fraud \n     was not recent and that although it amounted to ``serious \n     criminal activity,'' he was ``impressed'' with the \n     applicant's ``honesty and sincerity.''\n       That same year, Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman \n     allowed a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor to \n     keep his secret clearance, even though he was a convicted sex \n     offender and on probation. The man was convicted in a state \n     court of two felony charges of criminal sexual contact with a \n     minor in June 1996, less than a year before the \n     administrative judge's decision.\n       The case file shows the man fondled his 8-year-old \n     stepdaughter and on 50 occasions entered her bedroom and \n     masturbated while she was asleep. Braeman said there were \n     ``mitigating'' circumstances: the man, she wrote, had \n     completed counseling in a sex-offenders program and his \n     therapist did not believe the pedophilia with his \n     stepdaughter would recur. According to Braeman, the therapist \n     concluded the man would always have a sexual interest in \n     children but had learned through therapy to control himself.\n       A 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor was given a \n     secret clearance by Chief Administrative Judge Robert Gales, \n     although earlier in his career, as an investor, he had been \n     convicted of bank fraud, imprisoned and ordered to pay \n     $150,000 restitution. According to DOHA files, the man ``made \n     false entries'' on loan forms to obtain $2.3 million in \n     mortgages. He pleaded guilty in December 1994. Two years \n     later, while the man remained on probation in the criminal \n     case, Judge Gales approved his clearance; Gales cited his \n     cooperation with prosecutors and said he had ``clean(ed) up \n     his act.''\n       Judge Erck approved a secret clearance for the 53-year-old \n     owner of a defense contracting business despite his long \n     history of violent altercations with others. In one case, the \n     decision shows, the man tried to bulldoze another car \n     blocking his exit from a parking lot. In another incident, \n     Erck wrote, he ``challenged'' a state court judge in court \n     after the judge ruled in favor of the other party in a civil \n     lawsuit. Police were called and ``an altercation occurred,'' \n     according to Erck. The man was arrested and jailed for \n     resisting arrest. In a third incident, he left a threatening \n     message on his ex-wife's answering machine advising her he \n     had a ``shotgun and two Uzis'' and was coming to her house to \n     get his son. Police arrested him at his former wife's house \n     and he was jailed on an assault conviction.\n       ``There is an obvious nexus between Applicant's criminal \n     conduct and the national security,'' Erck wrote in his \n     decision. ``An individual who repeatedly loses his temper and \n     breaks the law is much more likely to violate security rules \n     and regulations.'' Nonetheless, Erck granted the clearance. \n     He said the man had become active in the church and had \n     learned to control his temper. He was, Erck wrote, a \n     ``changed man.''\n       In February 1996, a 44-year-old computer software engineer \n     was allowed to retain his top-secret clearance despite a 10-\n     year history of sexual exhibitionism. Once, in the early \n     morning, he stood naked outside the kitchen door of a 26-\n     year-old woman and masturbated. The police were called and he \n     was charged with two felonies, including ``gross lewdness.'' \n     The man's ``history of exhibitionism reflects adversely on \n     his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness,'' \n     Administrative Judge Elizabeth Matchinski wrote. But, she \n     added, ``his contributions to the defense industry in \n     combination with his recent pursuit of therapy'' justified \n     giving him a clearance.\n       Those cases are not unusual. There are other similar \n     decisions in DOHA's files.\n       The DOHA process grew out of the abuses of the McCarthy era \n     in the 1950s when many people were attacked for alleged \n     Communist ties. President Eisenhower, acting after the \n     Supreme Court ruled that contractor employees had the right \n     to a hearing if their clearances were jeopardized, issued an \n     executive order requiring hearing procedures.\n       The vast majority of cases processed by DOHA never go \n     before the agency's 15 judges.\n       When they do review cases, the judges deny clearances in \n     many egregious cases, or their approvals are overturned by \n     the DOHA Appeal Board composed of three of their own members. \n     One example: a 59-year-old man convicted of sexually abusing \n     his granddaughter, a felony, was approved for a clearance by \n     an administrative judge. The appeal board reversed the \n     decision. It said the judge's decision was ``arbitrary, \n     capricious, and contrary to law.''\n       Judges and other government clearance officials make \n     decisions based on government-wide adjudicative guidelines. \n     The guidelines cover, among other things, allegiance to the \n     United States, foreign influence, sexual behavior, financial \n     considerations, alcohol and drug use, security violations and \n     criminal conduct. Applicants are evaluated under the ``whole \n     person'' concept, which requires both favorable and \n     unfavorable information to be considered.\n       Clearance officials are urged to make ``common sense'' \n     determinations. ``The individual may be disqualified if \n     available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern \n     of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally \n     unstable behavior,'' the guidelines state.\n       They also require clearance officials to err on the side of \n     national security. ``Any doubt as to whether access to \n     classified information is clearly consistent with national \n     security,'' they state, ``will be resolved in favor of the \n     national security.''\n       Most people pass the guidelines without a hitch. Tens of \n     thousands of military and contractor personnel are cleared \n     each year. The Defense Department says only 2% to 4% of its \n     applicants are denied a clearance or have their existing \n     access revoked. In 1998 the Pentagon denied or revoked \n     clearances in 3,516 cases, including 628 contractor \n     employees. About 2.4 million people hold Pentagon-issued \n     clearances.\n       DOHA's role is not limited to contractor employees. Its \n     judges also review appeals from military personnel and \n     civilian employees of the Defense Department. The judges \n     issue ``recommended decisions,'' but those opinions are not \n     binding. Final decisions are made by clearance boards \n     established by the Pentagon. Each branch of the service and \n     the Pentagon's administrative arm, Washington Headquarters \n     Services, have their own clearance boards, known as Personnel \n     Security Appeal Boards, or PSABS.\n       Those PSABs often reject the judges' recommendations to \n     grant clearances to people with background problems. DOHA \n     statistics show that the judges recommended granting \n     clearances in 271 of 740 cases they have reviewed since \n     1995. The PSABs rejected the advice in 120 cases, or 44% \n     of the time.\n       The PSABs say they are tougher.\n       ``We are not saying that everybody who drinks too much is a \n     security threat,'' says K.J. Weiman, executive secretary of \n     the Army's PSAB. But, he says, screeners must be concerned \n     when people have financial problems, histories of drug use or \n     heavy drinking.\n       ``For instance, are you a quiet drunk or are you a \n     talkative drunk?'' he asks. ``Are you the kind who will have \n     too many drinks and you are sitting in a bar and saying, `Did \n     you know this, that, there is a terrorist threat out for \n     Y2K?' ''\n       Private lawyers who represent clients in clearance cases \n     defend DOHA. They say the military process doesn't give \n     applicants all the rights they should have and say the \n     importance of the whole-person concept cannot be over-\n     emphasized.\n       Sheldon Cohen, an attorney in Arlington, VA., says the \n     government must evaluate the whole person in deciding whether \n     to approve or reject a clearance: ``The use of a variety of \n     drugs by a person in high school or college, even to a \n     substantial degree, might not disqualify that person, while a \n     single use of marijuana by an adult while that person held a \n     security clearance would probably cause loss of a \n     clearance.''\n       Adds Elizabeth Newman, a Washington lawyer. ``The fact we \n     don't want them as neighbors does not mean they will misuse \n     classified information.''\n       But some former DOHA employees believe there has been too \n     much ``lawyering.'' A clearance is a privilege, not a right, \n     and the Supreme Court has so ruled, they say.\n       Howard Strouse, the retired DOHA official who was based in \n     Columbus, Ohio, supervised the preparation of many \n     administrative cases against contractor employees over a 14-\n     year-period. He is frank in his assessment of the agency.\n       DOHA is doing a lousy job, he says.\n       ``DOHA is due process heaven, and I'm not proud of that,'' \n     he says. ``You want due process, yes, but these attorneys and \n     judges who work for DOHA have to realize they work for the \n     government, and we are talking about national security.''\n       Strouse says there were countless times when he and his \n     staff pressed cases against applicants with questionable \n     backgrounds but were overruled by the headquarters office in \n     Arlington, VA.\n       ``In looking at some of these administrative judge \n     decisions,'' he says, ``you are only seeing the tip of the \n     iceberg.''\n       He says he had frequent disputes with senior DOHA lawyers \n     and Schachter, the agency's director, over ``liberal'' \n     decisions. He says Schachter talked about how no spies have \n     ever been cleared by DOHA. But, Strouse says: ``Of course, he \n     can't be disputed because there hasn't been a spy to come up. \n     But I'm sure they are out there. Industry has long been a \n     problem for spying.''\n       Schachter declined to answer many questions. In a letter to \n     USA Today, he wrote: ``Sensationalizing a few cases distorts \n     the overall record of seriousness, professionalism and \n     dedication reflected throughout the DOHA staff and judges.''\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\n       But Thomas Ewald, who directed security background \n     investigations for the Defense Department before retiring in \n     1996, worries that some DOHA decisions will come back to \n     haunt the agency. ``There is no question that all of us in \n     the business felt that many clearances should be denied that \n     weren't,'' he says. ``It only takes one person to cause \n     untold damage to national security.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the USA Today, Jan. 4, 2000]\n\n         Easy Access to Nation's Secrets Poses Security Threat\n\n       GAO, USA TODAY reports show erosion of standards for \n     clearances.\n       ``No one has a right to a national security clearance.'' At \n     least, that is what the Supreme Court said in 1988, ruling \n     that the government should grant clearances ``only when \n     consistent with the interests of national security.''\n       Yet, as an outraged Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, noted, citing \n     a special report in USA TODAY last week, the Pentagon \n     ``apparently has an `ask don't care' policy when it comes to \n     contractor security clearances.'' And this week, Congress' \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) announced that it is \n     undertaking a new inquiry to determine whether the Defense \n     Department consistently complies with government guidelines \n     for issuing clearances.\n       There's good reason to wonder. The USA TODAY report \n     detailed numerous instances of defense contractors' workers \n     receiving top-secret clearances despite long histories of \n     financial problems, drug use, alcoholism, sexual misconduct \n     and even criminal activity.\n       One was awarded a clearance while on probation for bank \n     fraud. Another was allowed to keep his high-level clearance \n     after taking part in a $2-million fraud against the Navy. \n     Another had a history of criminal sexual misconduct for which \n     he was still receiving therapy.\n       Such behavior runs counter to President Clinton's 1995 \n     executive order requiring that recipients of clearances have \n     a personal and professional history showing ``loyalty to the \n     United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, \n     honesty, reliability, discretion and sound judgment.''\n       And it's not the first example of the Pentagon's relaxed-\n     fit attitude when it comes to maintaining the integrity of \n     the security-clearance system that is designated to protect \n     the nation's top secrets. As previous USA TODAY and GAO \n     investigations have shown in recent months, the Pentagon has \n     a backlog of more than 600,000 investigations for renewals of \n     clearances. The GAO also concluded that ``inadequate \n     personal-security investigations pose national security \n     risks.'' It found that 92% of the investigations it audited \n     were deficient on matters including citizenship and criminal \n     history.\n       Oversight wasn't the problem with the cases cited by USA \n     TODAY last week. Those individuals received clearances \n     because special judges in the Defense Office of Hearings and \n     Appeals overruled Pentagon investigators and the office's own \n     lawyers.\n       Hearings before such judges provide a needed level of \n     protection against the arbitrary and capricious denial of \n     security clearances by the government. People can correct \n     facts and provide mitigating evidence to prove they aren't a \n     threat to national security.\n       But prove that they must. And standards shouldn't be \n     lowered for private contractors' employees. Defense \n     contractors build the nation's advanced weapons. They develop \n     the software and hardware for guarding the country's \n     infrastructure and mapping attack or defense plans. Their \n     secrets are as important as any at the Pentagon.\n       Harkin is demanding that the Pentagon demonstrate that it \n     is taking steps to ``ensure that security clearance is not \n     granted to people likely to abuse the privilege.''\n       As a start, investigators, hearing judges and defense \n     contractors should consider the Supreme Court's message a \n     reminder. Don't allow national security clearances to \n     endanger national security.\n\n\n                            a security check\n\n       In deciding whether to grant security clearances, federal \n     guidelines require judges to consider the following factors: \n     Allegiance to the United States, Foreign influence, Sexual \n     behavior, Personal conduct, Financial considerations, Alcohol \n     consumption, Drug involvement, Emotional, mental and \n     personality disorders, Criminal conduct, Security violations, \n     Outside activities, and Misuse of information technology \n     systems.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. At the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals, USA Today reported that felons, convicted felons--I want my \ncolleagues to listen carefully here--convicted felons, including a \nmurderer, individuals with chronic alcohol and drug abuse problems, a \npedophile, an exhibitionist--all received security clearances in order \nto work for defense contractors.\n  I want to repeat that because I think most people would say, you have \nto be kidding, that really happened? The answer is yes, which is why \nthis amendment is so urgently needed. This was investigative reporting \nby USA Today that reported that a murderer, people with chronic alcohol \nand drug abuse problems, a pedophile, and an exhibitionist received \nsecurity clearance to work for defense contractors.\n  There was another individual who was awarded a clearance while on \nprobation for bank fraud. Yet another was allowed to keep his clearance \nafter taking part in a $2 million fraud against the U.S. Navy. Another \nhad a history of criminal sexual misconduct for which he was still \nundergoing therapy.\n  For goodness' sake, I say to my colleagues, most of us and the \nAmerican people would say: Gee, to get a security clearance, that is a \nbig deal; you get to see all the secrets. At least that is what the \npeople think. We have different levels of security clearances, from \nconfidential, to secret, to top secret, to code level. These are \nsecurity clearances for individuals who have no right to get those \nclearances, and I think every American would agree: $2 million in fraud \nagainst the U.S. Navy, pedophiles, murderers, chronic alcohol and drug \nabusers getting security clearances to see the highest classified \nmaterial on various defense contracts.\n  An even more egregious example is that an administrative judge at the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals--that is who hears these cases--\ngranted a clearance to a defense contractor's project manager who had a \nlengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse, including two convictions of \nselling cocaine for which he served two separate terms in Federal \nprison. Overriding Government lawyers who said this man's criminal past \nmade him ineligible for a clearance, the judge at this defense hearing \nruled this individual ``had no desire to ever engage in criminal \nconduct again.''\n  I repeat. This is an individual who was granted a clearance by an \nadministrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. He \nhad a lengthy history of drug and alcohol abuse, including two \nconvictions for selling cocaine and served two separate prison terms \nfor it. The Government lawyers said: No, this guy should not have a \nclearance; what are you talking about here?\n  They were overridden. The judge ruled the individual ``had no desire \nto ever engage in criminal conduct again.'' Therefore, we will give him \nhis clearance.\n  The case in point, when somebody else comes along tomorrow and says: \nYes, I robbed a couple of banks, killed a couple of people, but I am \nsorry; I will not do it again if you will just give me my security \nclearance, that is what I am talking about. That is the logic: Yes, I \nsold a little cocaine, maybe I used a little cocaine; I am sorry. Can I \nhave my clearance? I want to get access to classified secrets so I can \nwork for a defense contractor.\n  It is unbelievable to think this is happening in our Government, but \nit is. Common sense dictates that one convicted murderer or one \nconvicted drug dealer with a security clearance is one too many.\n  I have been told by at least one former DOD official that the USA \nToday's reported cases of felons granted security clearances is \nprobably only the tip of the iceberg. These are the ones we know about.\n  I am also informed that the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals is \nthe only organization dictated to by attorneys, while in the others--\nfor example, the military services--the security specialists are in \ncharge. We want the security specialists to be in charge, and \napparently they are not.\n  A frequent complaint is when there is reasonable doubt about an \napplicant, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals judges rule in \nfavor of the applicant rather than the national interest. This is a \nvery important point. Do you err on the side of national defense, \nnational security, national interest, or do you err on the side of the \nindividual?\n\n  This is not rocket science, and it is not a big deal about how they \ndo this. Yet it is happening. In other words, err on the side of the \nindividual; he will be OK; he is sorry; he is not going to do it again; \ndo not worry about the cocaine; do not worry about the murder; do not \nworry about that; it is fine; we think he will be OK so we are going to \nerr on his side, not on the side of national security.\n  I say to my colleagues, we all have staff who get security \nclearances. My colleagues know how tough it is to get them and how long \nthey wait and what they put these guys and gals through. My colleagues \nknow what is on the forms and how long it takes to get a\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\nclearance. It is an outrage this is occurring.\n  The adjudicative guidelines require that national security be the \nfirst priority. Those are the guidelines. These guidelines are not \nbeing enforced. As my colleagues watch me, they must be thinking: This \ncannot be true; he has to be blowing smoke; no way.\n  It is true. I have researched these cases. Senator Harkin, who has \ndone an outstanding job, has also researched these cases. Senator \nHarkin is with me on this amendment. In fact, he first helped bring \nthis to my attention.\n  When I repeatedly questioned the DOD general counsel at the April 6 \nhearing about whether it is acceptable to grant a clearance to an \nindividual who committed a cold-blooded murder, he would not say no to \nmy question.\n  I said to him: Is it acceptable ever to grant a clearance to an \nindividual who committed a cold-blooded murder? I wanted him to say no. \nI gave him every opportunity to say no, but he refused to say no.\n  If you do not say no, it has to mean there is a time when it is in \nthe interest of the individual, never mind national defense, to grant \nthe clearance because he may not commit a murder anymore and he might \nbe great. He could be the greatest contractor employee the Defense \nDepartment ever saw, but do we want to take the chance? Do we want to \ntake a chance?\n  If my colleagues had a staff member who was asking for a security \nclearance--I do not know if they would be working for them if he or she \ncommitted a murder, but if they did and tried to get one, good luck. We \nknow they would not get it. Therefore, if that is the rule for staff, \nthen it ought to be the rule for those contractors who work for the \nDefense Department.\n  Senator Harkin's press release about this scandal when it broke \nargued very persuasively:\n\n       No one has a right to a national security clearance.\n\n  No one has a right to it. Senator Harkin, who testified at the SASC \nhearings on the DSS and DOHA, argued people go through intense scrutiny \njust to serve on the Commission on Library Sciences, and they do not \nhave to handle any Government secrets. We should at least have the same \nhigh standards for those holding security clearances as we require of \nthose serving on the Commission of Library Sciences. Senator Harkin is \nabsolutely right. I agree with him.\n  Additionally, there were examples of the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals granting clearances to people with recent drug and alcohol \naddictions. Why is the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, knowing \nthere will always be risks that some people with clearances will betray \ntheir country for money or for ideology, placing an additional risk \ninto the system by giving these felons clearances? Why do we take the \nrisk? There are many good, decent people who have never committed a \ncrime in their lives who do not gain access to classified material \nbecause they do not need to know and, therefore, they do not get their \nclearances because they do not need to know. Why does a convicted \nmurderer, rapist, or convicted drug dealer need to know? The answer is \nsimply they do not.\n  You might say: We should give this person a chance. No, we should \nnot, no, no, no; not if we are going to risk the national defense of \nour country, we should not give them a chance.\n  As Senator Harkin has said: It is not a right. It is a privilege that \nyou earn. Additionally, there were examples of, as I said, clearances \nfor those with recent drug and alcohol problems. Why would we want \nthese convicted lawbreakers given access to these secrets? We know how \nmuch damage just one individual can wreak on national security. We have \nheard the stories--the legacy of Aldrich Ames, Jonathan Pollard, and \nthe Walkers, the Rosenbergs. Go back as far as you want to go. It is \nwell known to all of us who have dealt with national security issues, \nwe simply cannot afford to have loose standards when it comes to \nprotecting our secrets and protecting lives. They are loose enough as \nit is.\n  We have had stolen secrets from our atomic weapons labs going to the \nChinese. We certainly do not need to invite people into critical areas, \nwhere sensitive technology and sensitive information is bandied about, \nto have a person who would have that kind of a background to get a \nsecurity clearance.\n  I emphasize, again, I know in America we are all in favor--and I am, \ntoo--of giving people a break, giving a person a chance, giving them a \nsecond chance, but not when it comes to national security.\n  I guarantee you, for every cocaine dealer you think is fine now and \nwould be a great person to work for a Government contractor--I \nguarantee you--there are 100 who never had any cocaine convictions who \nwould be just as good. I guarantee it. We ought to start looking down \nthe line to find them.\n  In some States, an individual would lose his or her right to vote \nbased on a felony conviction. The 1968 Gun Control Act stripped \nindividuals convicted of felonies of their constitutionally protected \nsecond amendment right. I have known of an instance where a Capitol \nHill staffer was denied a clearance because he was a few months behind \nin his student loan payment.\n  Keep in mind, a security clearance is not a right; it is a privilege. \nIn fact, it is more than that. It is an honor. That says something \nabout this person, that this is a special person who can be trusted \nwith the secrets, sensitive information about the U.S. Government, \nabout the weapons we make.\n  To say that we would dumb those standards down at that level is a \ndisgrace and, frankly, it is an embarrassment to our country, to our \nGovernment, to our Defense Department, to our administration, to \neverybody involved, and, yes, even an embarrassment to the members of \nthe Armed Services Committee of the Senate that this is happening. It \nis an embarrassment. The only way to correct it is to stop it and say \nit is wrong.\n  Right now you can have a felony conviction and still be granted a \nclearance and access to sensitive secrets; and that does not pass the \ncommonsense test. It does not pass the smell test, folks, that a \nconvicted murderer can be granted a security clearance. Believe it or \nnot, they had an explanation for it. It was not a good one. They had an \nexplanation for it: He's reformed now. He's OK now.\n  In conclusion, the bottom line is, my amendment is very simple. It \nwould prevent DOD from granting security clearances to those who have \nbeen convicted in a court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a \nterm exceeding 1 year. It would also disallow a clearance for anyone \nwho is an unlawful user or addicted to any controlled substance or has \nbeen adjudicated as mentally incompetent or has been dishonorably \ndischarged from the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n  It is sad, though, that we have to pass an amendment on the floor of \nthe Senate, add language to the DOD authorization bill that says the \npeople who do these things--the people who review these cases, who \nreview these individuals--we have to pass an amendment which is nothing \nmore than common sense that says you cannot put murderers and felons \nand cocaine dealers, people who have been convicted of these crimes, in \npositions where they have access to national security information. We \nhave to pass an amendment because the people we put in charge are not \ndoing this, are not stopping this. Can you imagine that?\n  That is what it has come to. I am embarrassed by it. But I will tell \nyou what. I would rather be embarrassed by it than have it continue to \nhappen, where our secrets get compromised because somebody could be \ncompromised as a result of this kind of background.\n  We cannot take all the risks out of the system no matter how good we \nare, no matter how good the DOHA, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals. No matter how good they are, they are going to make mistakes. \nThat is human. Sometimes people such as Pollard and Walker get \nclearances, unfortunately. And they ought to pay the price for it when \nthey are caught. But let's not take this kind of ridiculous risk and \ndumb down the entire operation.\n  I might add--it does not say this in the amendment--if we have people \nwho are looking at these cases, and assessing the risks, and they are \nconcluding that people with these kinds of backgrounds can get security \nclearances, we may want to change some of the people who are doing the \nevaluating as well. That may be the next step if it does not stop.\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\n  I regret that many of the committee members missed the DSS, the \nDepartment of Security Services, and the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals hearing that we had because it was an eye-opener for me. Even \nthough I read the press articles relating to the scandal, I was \nsurprised those individuals I questioned--when I gave them the \nopportunity when I questioned them--still said they would not say no \nwhen I asked them whether they believed it would be all right to give \nsomebody such as that a clearance. They would not say no, which gives \nme the impression there would be circumstances where they should be \nable to get the clearances.\n  That is my amendment. I know the manager of the bill is not prepared \nto vote at this time. But at this point, Mr. President, I ask for the \nyeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I will take this moment to thank my colleague, Senator Warner, the \nchairman of the committee, for the outstanding leadership he has \nprovided as the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and simply say we are \nendeavoring and working with the other side of the aisle to see if we \nmight come up with some clarification to his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3214 To Amendment No. 3210\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \npending amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3214 to amendment No. 3210.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Feingold, and Senator Lieberman.\n  This amendment would mandate that the names of contributors to \nentities operating under section 527 of the Tax Code be disclosed. This \namendment is simple. It is straightforward. It would impose no \nsubstantial burdens on any entity. And most importantly, it is \nconstitutional and in no way infringes on the free speech of any \nindividual or group.\n  Before I discuss the matter further, I thank my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Feingold, for all they have done to close this \n527 loophole. They have been stalwarts in this effort, and their hard \nwork and dedication deserves note and praise. In fact, Senator \nLieberman has separate legislation supported by myself and Senator \nFeingold on this very issue.\n  On May 18 of this year, USA Today stated:\n\n       What's happening? Clever lawyers for partisan activists, \n     ideological causes and special interests have invented a new \n     way to channel unlimited money into campaigns and avoid all \n     accountability. Hiding behind the guise of ``issue advocacy'' \n     and an obscure part of the tax law, nameless benefactors with \n     thick bankrolls can donate unlimited sums to entities known \n     as ``section 527 committees,'' beyond the reach of the \n     campaign-reporting laws designed to curb such abuses.\n       If the Chinese Army had discovered this tactic first, its \n     infamous contributions of 1996 would have been quite legal. \n     It wasn't supposed to be this way. Post-Watergate reforms a \n     quarter-century ago required that all donations of $200 and \n     more be publicly reported by name. There would be no more \n     ``hidden gifts'' of $2 million and up like those that helped \n     fuel the illegal activities of Richard Nixon's re-election \n     campaign. At least voters would know where a candidate's \n     political debts lay.\n       But that is not the way the system has evolved. And today \n     no one knows how many anonymous contributors are exploiting \n     the loopholes in the law or how much these loopholes are \n     adding to the swamp of money in politics.\n\n  USA Today sums it up well. This is a dark, uncontrolled sector of the \npolitical landscape. It is a danger to our electoral system. \nUnfortunately, unless we act, the problem will only grow worse.\n  The Associated Press reported on June 6:\n\n       At crucial moments in the presidential campaign, George W. \n     Bush has benefited from millions of dollars in advertising \n     paid for by mysterious groups and secret donors.\n       Similar ads have also boosted Vice President Al Gore, but \n     they generally were done by well-established organizations \n     with clear agendas. Still, their donors remained secret, too.\n       It's a new form of political warfare that's quickly \n     becoming the tool of choice for people looking to influence \n     Election 2000, made possible by a once-obscure provision in \n     the tax code that lets anyone form a group and spend money on \n     campaign-style ads without saying who is paying for them.\n\n  This amendment in no way restricts the ability of any individual or \norganization from spending money to influence a political or electoral \nsystem. I believe 527 should be abolished completely. I am not sure \nthat at this moment in time we have sufficient votes to do that in the \nSenate.\n  This amendment protects free speech but recognizes that the public \nhas a right to know who is speaking. This amendment gives the American \npublic an answer to the question raised by the Associated Press story; \nnamely, who is paying for these multimillion-dollar ad campaigns?\n  While the rhetoric of speech being protected is sometimes bantered \naround without much thought, it is not actually speech that is \nconstitutionally protected but the individual who is protected to speak \nhis or her thoughts. Speech is not naturally occurring. It is not \ncreated of matter and therefore exists outside of the human realm. It \nis the individual who is protected. Under this amendment, the \nindividual is protected. He or she can speak their will. Again, the \npublic is given the right to know who is speaking.\n  The 2000 Federal election cycle has brought a new threat to the \nintegrity of our Nation's election process: the proliferation of so-\ncalled stealth PACs operating under section 527 of the Tax Code. These \ngroups exploit a recently discovered loophole in the Tax Code that \nallows organizations seeking to influence Federal elections to fund \ntheir election work with undisclosed and unlimited contributions at the \nsame time as they claim exemption from both Federal taxation and the \nFederal election laws.\n  Section 527 of the Tax Code offers tax exemption to organizations \nprimarily involved in election-related activities such as campaign \ncommittees, party committees, and PACs. It defines the type of \norganization it covers as one whose function is, among other things, \n``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, \nelection, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or \nlocal public office. . ..''\n\n  Because the Federal Election Campaign Act uses near identical \nlanguage in defining entities it regulates, organizations that spend or \nreceive money ``for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal \noffice,'' section 527 formerly had been generally understood to apply \nonly to those organizations that register as political committees \nunder, and comply with, Federal election campaign laws, unless they \nfocus on State or local activities and do not meet certain other FECA \nrequirements.\n  Nevertheless, a number of groups engaged in what they term ``issue \nadvocacy campaigns'' and other election-related activity recently began \narguing that the near identical language of FECA and section 527 \nactually mean two different things. In their view, they can gain \nfreedom from taxation by claiming they are seeking to influence the \nelection of individuals to Federal office but may evade regulation \nunder FECA by asserting they are not seeking to directly influence an \nelection for Federal office.\n  Let me repeat that. This is what these organizations are saying: They \ncan gain freedom from taxation by claiming they are seeking to \ninfluence the election of individuals to Federal office, but they evade \nregulation under Federal election laws by asserting they are not \nseeking to directly influence an election for Federal office.\n  As we have seen in the past, they simply avoid using the infamous six \nwords noted in the Buckley decision as\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\na footnote; namely, ``vote for, vote against, support'' or ``oppose.'' \nAs a result--because unlike other tax exempt groups such as 501(c)(3)s \nand (c)(4)s, section 527 groups don't even have to publicly disclose \ntheir existence--these groups gain both the public subsidy of tax \nexemption and the ability to shield from the American public the \nidentity of those spending their money to try to influence our \nelections.\n  Indeed, according to news reports, newly formed 527 organizations \npushing the agenda of political parties are using the ability to mask \nthe identity of their contributors as a means of courting wealthy \ndonors who are seeking anonymity in their efforts to influence our \nelections.\n  There are some in this body who would fully regulate 527s under the \nFECA. This amendment doesn't do that. While I would personally support \nsuch an effort, this amendment does not impose the burdens mandated \nunder FECA to 527 organizations. This amendment would, however, require \n527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, to file \npublicly available tax returns, and to file with the IRS or make public \nreports specifying annual expenditures of over $500 and identifying \nthose who contribute more than $200 annually to the organization. What \ncould be more simple? What could be more fair, honest, and \nstraightforward?\n  The Washington Post recently stated:\n\n       For years, opponents of campaign finance reform have been \n     saying that disclosure is disinfectant enough. Don't enter \n     the swamp of trying to regulate the raising and spending of \n     campaign money, they say; just require the prompt reporting \n     of contributions, and let the voters perform the regulatory \n     function at the polls.\n\n  This is an argument that has been made continuously by my colleagues. \nOn September 26, 1997, the senior Senator from Kentucky stated, in \nregards to contributor information reported by the Democratic National \nCommittee:\n\n       Disclosure would have been the best disinfectant.\n\n  On the same day, on the floor of the Senate, the majority leader \nstated:\n\n       Why don't we, instead, go with freedom, open it up, have \n     full disclosure and let everybody participate to the maximum \n     they wish?\n\n  I believe this amendment is 100 percent in accordance with Senator \nLott's comments. For the information of my colleagues, the amendment \nplaces no new restrictions of any kind on giving to so-called 527 \norganizations or how they spend their money. It merely mandates full \ndisclosure.\n  Senator Lott stated on May 13, 1992:\n\n       It seems to me that something that has that big an \n     influence on an election, campaign election, should at least \n     be reported. Disclosure. That is the key. Let us always \n     disclose to the American people where we are getting our \n     money, where it is being spent. That is the answer.\n\n  On September 26, 1997, Senator Bennett stated:\n\n       So, if you are going to look for a local example of \n     something that works, you could say, based on my state's \n     experience, that we ought to open the whole thing up and let \n     corporate contributions come in as well as individual \n     contributions. The one thing that we do have in Utah that has \n     made it work is full and complete disclosure so that \n     everybody knows that, if the Utah Power and Light company is \n     giving to X campaign, that is on the public record. And when \n     the Governor goes to deal with utility regulation, everybody \n     knows how much the power company gave him.\n\n  Under this amendment, 527 entities would disclose their contributors \nexactly in the manner Senator Bennett claims should be done.\n  Senator Craig, on February 24, 1998, stated:\n\n       Instead [of McCain-Feingold] full and immediate public \n     disclosure of campaign donations would be a much more logical \n     approach.\n\n  To be fair, Senator Craig was referring to contributions to \ncandidates. But we all recognize that political ads that run under the \n527 loophole are designed to accomplish the exact same goal as \ncandidate-run ads: to elect or defeat candidates or causes and, as \nsuch, the contributors to 527s, such as contributors to candidates, \nshould be immediately and fully disclosed.\n  The clarion call for greater disclosure has been heard and it is time \nwe acted. This amendment is not designed to give any one party any \nadvantage over the other. As I noted earlier in my remarks, both \nparties are the beneficiaries of 527 expenditures.\n  As the Washington Post editorialized:\n\n       Both parties use these Section 527 committees. The failure \n     to disclose is insidious, the ultimate corruption of a \n     political system in which offices if not the office holders \n     themselves, are increasingly bought. At least, they could \n     vote for sunshine. Or is the truth too embarrassing for \n     either donors or recipients?\n\n  Many times, I have stood on the floor of the Senate and argued for \nthe constitutionality of the so-called McCain-Feingold legislation. I \nstrongly believe that campaign contributions should not only be \ndisclosed but that they can be constitutionally limited. Recent Supreme \nCourt decisions clearly affirm that fact.\n  But there was dissent noted in the most recent Supreme Court case on \ncampaign finance reform. I want to note for the Record that in Justice \nKennedy's dissent he stated:\n\n       What the Court does not do is examine and defend the \n     substitute it has encouraged, covert speech funded by \n     unlimited soft money. In my view, that system creates dangers \n     greater than the one it has replaced. The first danger is the \n     one already mentioned: that we require contributors of soft \n     money and its beneficiaries mask their real purpose. Second, \n     we have an indirect system of accountability that is \n     confusing, if not dispiriting, to the voter. The very \n     disaffection or distrust that the Court cites as the \n     justification for limits on direct contributions has now \n     spread to the entire discourse.\n\n  In his dissent, Justice Kennedy also points out:\n\n       Among the facts the Court declines to take into account is \n     the emergence of cyberspace communication by which political \n     contributions can be reported almost simultaneously with \n     payment. The public can then judge for itself whether the \n     candidate or the officeholder has so overstepped that we no \n     longer trust him or her to make a detached neutral judgment. \n     This is a far more immediate way to assess the integrity and \n     the performance of our leaders than through the hidden world \n     of soft money and covert speech.\n\n  In his dissent concerning the same campaign finance reform case, \nJustice Thomas paraphrases the Buckley case and states:\n\n       And disclosure laws ``deter actual corruption and avoid the \n     appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and \n     expenditures to the light of publicity.''\n  Based on the dissent issued in the Missouri case and what was clearly \nstated by the majority, the kind of disclosure mandated by this \namendment would not only be constitutional but is clearly in the \npublic's best interest.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is the right thing to do. It is not as \ncomprehensive an approach as I believe is necessary to deal with the \nnumerous problems associated with our current campaign finance system. \nI believe much more needs to be done, and I intend to continue my fight \nwith my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to truly reform our \ncampaign finance laws. But it is a simple, easy-to-understand solution \nto one specific problem that currently plagues our electoral system. It \nis a solution we can enact today or tomorrow. It is a solution to a \nproblem that has just begun and one that is easily solved. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this amendment.\n  I have been in elected office since 1983. I first came to the other \nbody and then to this one. If at the time I first came to the Congress \nof the United States you told me tickets would be sold by fundraisers \nfor $500,000, that we would have organizations that took part in our \npolitical system and directly intervened in our elections, where it was \nnot even required for contributors to disclose unlimited amounts of \nmoney, if you had told me that we would have a situation which would \ncause so much concern and anger and discontent, as in the 1996 election \nwhere money poured in even from foreign sources, that huge amounts of \nmoney from a Communist country, China, would pour into our elections--\nwe may never know how much--that, in my view, would have been illegal \nand deserved the appointment of an independent counsel. The \nmachinations that went into the Justice Department to prevent that from \nhappening have been revealed.\n  If we don't require full disclosure of these 527s, then we will say \nas a body that it is legal for money to come from anywhere, from \nanyone, and it doesn't even have to be disclosed to the American \npeople. That is a sad state of affairs, a very sad state of affairs.\n  I see my friend, Senator Feingold, here waiting to speak, and I know \nothers want to speak on this. I have said a\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\ncouple of times on the floor of the Senate that I learned a lot in the \nlast campaign in which I was involved. The most disheartening thing \nthat I learned--which was affirmed long before I learned it by the 1998 \nelection, which had the lowest voter turnout in history of the 18 to \n26-year-olds in this country--was that particularly young Americans are \nbecoming more and more disconnected and even alienated from their \nGovernment. Young Americans don't believe they are represented anymore. \nYoung Americans in a focus group conducted by the Secretaries of State \nof America--those responsible for our elections in every State --the \nfocus groups of young people were very alarming in their results. A lot \nof young people said they thought we were corrupt. A lot of young \npeople said they would never run for public office. There is an \nunwillingness to serve the country--at least in the area of public \nservice today--because young Americans believe that we no longer \nrepresent their hopes, dreams, and aspirations.\n  This situation has gradually evolved, as any evil does in life. We \nstarted out with a situation where soft money was set up that required \nfull disclosure, and different organizations calling themselves \n``independent'' began to accept unlimited amounts of money. But at \nleast they fell under laws that required full disclosure. Now we have \nthis new, burgeoning industry. I have no idea if it is tens of millions \nor hundreds of millions of dollars that will go into this political \ncampaign under the guise of 527. I intend, later in the debate, to \nquote from news articles describing the dramatic growth of these 527s. \nMr. President, it has to stop.\n  A funny thing is happening in the world. Today, the former Chancellor \nof the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Helmut Kohl, is in disgrace in \nhis nation--the man who led his nation through a great deal of the cold \nwar for 16 years. Helmut Kohl is in disgrace in the eyes of his \ncountrymen because Helmut Kohl refuses to disclose the names of the \npeople who gave him money for political purposes while he was the \nChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n  In the United States of America, the beacon of home and freedom and \nthe institutions of democracy throughout the world, we now have a \nsituation where it is legal for anyone to give unlimited amounts of \nmoney which will directly affect American political campaigns. There is \nnot even disclosure. It is evil in itself that unlimited amounts of \nmoney are able to be contributed because it is a direct violation of \nthe $1,000 contribution limit which the U.S. Supreme Court just upheld \nas constitutional. But now we have reached a point where the Washington \nPost says failure to disclose is insidious, the ultimate corruption of \na political system in which offices, if not the officeholders \nthemselves, are increasingly bought. At least we could vote for \nsunshine.\n  I would like to yield to my friend from New York briefly because \nSenator Feingold is waiting.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator a question to \nclarify. His amendment is one of disclosure. Is that the same as the \none the Senator from Connecticut introduced? It would not affect first \namendment rights. It would not affect limits on how much you give but \nsimply disclose what is given. Am I correct in that assumption?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from New York is correct. I would like to say \nto the Senator from New York that we are doing this because perhaps we \ncan't sell the whole package; perhaps we can't do the whole thing. This \nis in no way an indication that Senator Feingold and I or the Senator \nfrom New York or the Senator from Connecticut are not equally committed \nto McCain-Feingold soft money elimination, et cetera. But at least \nlet's get this ill cured.\n  How in the world a vote can be cast against disclosure of this is not \ncomprehensible to me.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think it is an excellent idea. I would like to speak \nlater in support of the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to again be on the \nfloor with my colleague and friend, the Senator from Arizona, and to \njoin with him in offering this amendment.\n  I am especially pleased also to be offering this amendment with the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, who has offered a bill in this \nsame form.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, \nbe added as a cosponsor of the amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if there is one thing on which the \nentire Senate should be able to agree, it is that we need to have full \ndisclosure by groups participating in the electoral process by running \nadvertisements that mention candidates.\n  This is a first step. In fact, it is only a first step on this bill. \nWe intend to offer other steps, including our McCain-Feingold \nlegislation concerning soft money, on this bill. But this is the first \nstep.\n  The so-called 527 organizations that this amendment addresses are the \nnewest wrinkle in the breakdown of our campaign finance laws.\n  These 527 groups are now openly and proudly flouting the election \nlaws by running phony issue ads and refusing to register with the FEC \nas political committees or disclose their spending and contributors. It \nis time that Congress called a stop to this, not to try to keep anyone \nfrom speaking or otherwise participating in elections, but to give the \nAmerican people information that they desperately need and deserve \nabout who is behind the ads that are already flooding our airwaves, six \nmonths before the election.\n  There is no reason that our tax laws should give protection to any \ngroup that refuses to play by the election law rules. For that reason, \nI have cosponsored and wholeheartedly endorse S. 2582, a bill \nintroduced earlier this year by Senators Lieberman, Daschle, McCain, \nand others to restrict the tax exempt status available under section \n527 of the Internal Revenue Code only to those groups that register and \nreport with the FEC. This amendment is even more mild. But at the very \nleast, the public deserves more information on the financial backers \nand activities of groups that benefit from this tax exempt status, and \nthat is what this amendment attempts to provide. This amendment simply \nseeks disclosure. It would be a small step towards addressing one of \nthe loopholes in our current campaign laws that is eroding the public's \nfaith in our electoral system. It's a small step, but an important \nstep. It is the first step, and the second step is the ban on soft \nmoney.\n  Time and time again when we have debated reform here on the floor of \nthe Senate, the opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill have said that \nthey favor full and complete disclosure of campaign contributions and \nspending.\n  The Senator from Arizona did a fine job of sharing with us some of \nthe quotes from Senators who said they would support disclosure even if \nthey couldn't support a ban on soft money.\n  Well, those Senators who so confidently proclaim that full disclosure \nis the answer to our campaign finance problems should realize that they \ncannot be consistent in that view if they don't support this amendment. \nAll this amendments seeks is disclosure, the most basic and commonsense \ntenet of our campaign finance laws, by groups that are spending \nmillions of dollars to influence elections. It is said that sunshine is \nthe best disinfectant. Here is our chance to throw some sunshine on \nthis latest effort to cast a dark cloud on our campaign finance system.\n  Sadly, what to me is perhaps the most shameful thing about this whole \nprocess is we know that many Members of Congress are involved in \nraising money for these 527s.\n  Recently, there was a very disturbing report in the Washington Post \nabout the majority leader urging hi-tech companies to contribute to a \nnew group called Americans for Job Security that is now running ads \nsupporting one of our colleagues who is up for reelection. Americans \nfor Job Security is almost certainly claiming a tax exemption under \nsection 527, but at the same time it will not disclose its contributors \nor its spending. And we all know of the highly publicized connections \nbetween the majority whip in the House, Mr. DeLay, and various 527 \norganizations.\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n  These groups pose a special danger to the political process because \nif Members of Congress can organize them or raise money for them, the \nreal possibility of corruption emerges. What is the difference between \na million dollar contribution directly to a candidate and a million \ndollar contribution requested by a candidate that goes to a group that \nplans to run ads to support that candidate or, more likely, attack his \nor her opponent? There really is no difference when you come right down \nto it, but right now, the first contribution is illegal, as it should \nbe, and the second contribution is not. It is legal. Our amendment does \nnot prohibit that second contribution, it just asks that it be made \npublic.\n  As groups proliferate, the chances of scandal increase as well. It \nwill not be long before reports of legislative favors received by big \ndonors to 527 groups start making the headlines. Or foreign money or \nmoney derived from organized crime making its way into our election \nprocess by way of 527s. The 527 loophole is a ticking time bomb of \nscandal.\n  As noted in the recent Common Cause report, ``Under the Radar: The \nAttack of Stealth PACs on our Nation's Elections,'' here are some of \nthe groups that are taking advantage of the 527 loophole to collect \nunlimited contributions and use them to influence federal elections \nwithout any disclosure. Saving America's Families Everyday, the \nRepublican Majority issues Committee, Citizens for Better Medicare, \nRepublicans for Clean Air, Shape the Debate, Business Leaders for \nSensible Priorities, the Peace Voter Fund, citizens for Reform, and the \nSierra Club. When the American people see an ad by one of these groups, \nthey will know it is coming from a Stealth PAC, a 527, but that's all \nthey will know because these groups are currently not reporting \nanything to the FEC or the IRS.\n  Money, politics, and secrecy is a dangerous mixture. Mr. President. \nThe least we can do is address the secrecy ingredient in this potion \nwith this amendment. There is no justification whatsoever for allowing \nthese groups to operate under the radar. None. Citizens deserve to know \nwho is behind a message that is being delivered to them in the heat of \na campaign. These groups that hide behind apple pie names are trying to \nobscure their identities from the public. The public is entitled to \nthat information. And it is entitled to withhold a tax exemption from \nany group that would refuse to provide the information.\n  I think I have heard from almost every one of my colleagues recently \nthat they believe this campaign finance system is completely out of \ncontrol, that they sense it is about to completely explode. We all know \nit. It is completely out of control. This is a first step to try to \nbring that control back and then to move on quickly to the effort to \naddress the other even more enormous problem at this point--the problem \nof soft money being contributed to political parties.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and my colleagues on the floor, the \nSenators from Connecticut and New York, for their work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of it and to join with him and the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, my friend, and also my colleague from New York.\n  This is a bold but absolutely necessary step which was initiated by \nthe Senator from Arizona, based on some work a bipartisan group did \ntogether earlier in the year to try to respond to this latest threat to \nthe integrity of our Nation's election process, and that is the \nproliferation of so-called ``stealth'' PACs operating under section 527 \nof the Tax Code.\n  As my colleagues have indicated, these groups exploit a relatively \nrecently discovered loophole in the Tax Code that allows organizations \nseeking to influence Federal elections to fund those elections with \nundisclosed and unlimited contributions at the same time as they claim \nexemption from both Federal taxation and the Federal election laws.\n  As I say these words, and as I have listened to my colleagues, I \nwonder about the folks listening to the proceedings on C-SPAN. People \nmust justifiably be scratching their heads or, I hope, standing up in \noutrage at what is happening within our political system.\n  I was taught as a student at school long ago about the power of \nwater, the natural force of water, to move and find weakness and then \nmove through that weakness to continue to go forward. The flow of money \nin our political system today, which is not as natural as the movement \nof water through nature, seems to follow the same kind of unstoppable \nmovement where it pursues a point of weakness in our legal system and \npushes through, to the detriment of our democracy.\n\n  Section 527 is the latest point of vulnerability that has been found \nby the forces and flow of money in our political system. Section 527 \noffers tax exemption to organizations, primarily involved in election-\nrelated activities such as campaign committees, party committees, and \nPACs. That is what the law says it is supposed to do. It defines the \ntype of organization it discovers as one whose function is, among other \nthings, ``Influencing or attempting to influence the selection, \nnomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, \nState, or local public office.''\n  Because the Federal Election Campaign Act uses nearly identical \nlanguage to define the entities it regulates, section 527 formally had \nbeen generally understood to apply only to those organizations that \nregister as political committees under the Federal Election Campaign \nAct.\n  Nevertheless, the flow of money moves to find a point of \nvulnerability in our existing legal system. A number of groups engaging \nin what they term ``issue advocacy campaigns'' and other election-\nrelated activities, have begun arguing that the near identical language \nof our Federal Election Campaign Act and section 527 actually mean two \ndifferent things. This would be hilarious if it wasn't so serious. In \ntheir view, these groups gain freedom from taxation by claiming they \nare seeking to influence the election of individuals to Federal office, \nbut they claim they can evade regulation under the Campaign Act by \nasserting that they are not seeking to influence an election for \nFederal office.\n  They are going two ways at once, trying to claim the benefit of two \ninconsistent laws, and, for the time being, getting away with it. As a \nresult, unlike other tax-exempt groups, section 527 groups don't even \nhave to publicly disclose their existence. They gain both the public \nsubsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the American \npublic the identity of those spending their money to try to influence \nour elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly formed 527 \norganizations pushing the agenda of political parties are using the \nability to mask the identity of their contributors as a means of \ncourting wealthy donors who are seeking anonymity in their efforts to \ninfluence our elections.\n  This is so venal, an end run on the clear intention of our laws, that \nI cannot believe we will let it continue. Section 527 organizations are \nnot required to publicly disclose their existence. It is impossible to \nknow the precise scope of this problem. The Internal Revenue Service \nprivate letter rulings, though, make clear that organizations that are \nintent on running what they call ``issue ad campaigns'' and engaging in \nother election-related activities are free to assert section 527 \nstatus. Of course, there have been numerous news reports that provide \nspecific examples of groups taking advantage of these rulings.\n  Common Cause recently issued a report which is engaging in unsettling \nreading, under the title ``Under the Radar: The Attack of the Stealth \nPACs on Our Nations's Elections,'' which offers details on 527 groups \nset up by politicians, industry groups, right-leaning ideological \ngroups, and left-leaning ideological groups. The advantages conferred \nby assuming this 527 form, which are the anonymity provided to both the \norganization and its donors, the ability to engage in unlimited \npolitical activity without losing your tax-exempt status, and \nsignificantly the exemption from gift tax which otherwise would be \nimposed on large donors, leaves no doubt that\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nthese groups will continue to proliferate as the November election \napproaches.\n  No one should doubt that the expansion of these groups poses a real \nand significant threat to the integrity and the fairness of our \nelection system. One of the basic promises that our system makes is for \nfull disclosure. Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have spoken of \ncomments that have been made on this floor and elsewhere by those who \nopposed other forms of regulating and limiting campaign finance \ncontributions, limits on expenditures, but at least support disclosure, \nsunshine, the right to know. The identity of the messenger, the \nidentity of the contributor supporting a message, naturally, would help \na citizen, a voter, reach a judgment on the quality and the effect of \nthat message.\n  The risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even further than depriving \nthe American people of critical information. I believe it threatens the \nvery heart of our democratic political process because allowing these \ngroups to operate in the shadows poses a real and present danger of \ncorruption and makes it difficult for anyone to vigilantly guard \nagainst that risk. The press has reported that a growing number of 527 \ngroups have connections to, or even have been set up by, candidates and \nelected officials who are otherwise limited--clearly, at least so is \nthe intention of the law--by other laws. Allowing individuals to give \nto these groups and allowing elected officials to solicit money for \nthese groups without ever having to disclose their dealings to the \npublic, at a minimum leads to exactly the appearance of corruption that \nthe Supreme Court in some of its election law cases has warned against \nand sets the conditions clearly that would allow corruption to thrive.\n  If people in public life are allowed to continue seeking money \nsecretly, particularly sums of money that exceed what the average \nAmerican makes in a year, there is no telling what will be asked for in \nreturn. And there is no predicting how many more tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands, millions of our fellow citizens will turn away \nfrom our political system because they reach the conclusion that there \nis not actually equal access to our Government; that an individual or \ngroup or corporation that gives hundreds of thousands of dollars \nsecretly to this kind of political committee clearly have more \ninfluence than they do, and it is not worth even turning out to vote.\n  In the hopes of forestalling this growing cancer in our body politic, \na bipartisan group of Members of the Senate earlier this year \nintroduced two bills to deal with this 527 problem. The first was what \nwe called our aspirational bill. It would have completely closed the \n527 loophole by making clear that tax exemption under 527 is available \nonly to organizations regulated under the Federal Elections Campaign \nAct. It was pretty straightforward and, in my opinion, eminently \nsensible and logical. If this bill were ever enacted, groups would no \nlonger be able to tell one thing to the IRS to get a tax benefit and \nthen deny the same thing to the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, \nin order to evade Federal Election Campaign Act regulation.\n  But recognizing that a complete closing of this ever growing 527 \nloophole might not be possible to achieve in this Congress, we also \noffered a second alternative, slightly narrower. That is what this \namendment is before the Senate now. It is aimed at forcing section 527 \norganizations simply to emerge from the dark shadows, from the secret \ncorners, and let the public know who they are--that is not asking too \nmuch--where they get their money--that is a fundamental right--and how \nthey spend it.\n  This amendment would require 527 organizations to disclose their \nexistence to the IRS, to file publicly available tax returns and to \nfile with the IRS and make public reports specifying annual \nexpenditures of at least $500 and identifying those who contribute at \nleast $200 annually to the organization. That is not asking very much. \nIt is simple fairness, basic facts, respecting the public's right to \nknow.\n  No doubt opponents of this amendment may claim the proposal infringes \non their first amendment rights, perhaps, to free speech and \nassociation. But nothing in this amendment infringes on those cherished \nfreedoms in the slightest bit. This amendment does not prohibit anyone \nfrom speaking. It does not force any group that does not currently have \nto comply with the Federal Elections Campaign Act or disclose \ninformation about itself to do either of those things. This amendment \nspeaks only to what a group must do if it wants the public subsidy of \ntax exemption, something the Supreme Court has made clear that no one \nhas a constitutional right to have. We in Congress, Representatives of \nthe people, makers of the law, have the right to attach conditions in \nreturn for the public subsidy of tax exemption. As the Supreme Court \nexplained in Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington, a \n1983 case:\n\n       Both tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of \n     subsidy that is administered through the tax system, [and] \n     Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for \n     entitlement to this sort of largess is obviously a matter of \n     policy and discretion. . . .\n\n  That is policy and discretion to be exercised in the public interest \nby this Congress. Under this proposal, any group not wanting to \ndisclose information about itself or abide by the election laws would \nbe able to continue doing whatever it is doing now. It would just have \nto do so without the public subsidy of tax exemption conferred by \nsection 527. Again, that is not asking too much.\n  We have become so used to our campaign finance system's long, slow \ndescent that I fear it is sometimes hard to ignite the kind of outrage \nthat should result when a new loophole starts to shred the very spirit \nof yet another law aimed at protecting the integrity of our system.\n  I suppose if there is any direct relevance of this proposal to the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act on which it is offered, it is \nthat generations of Americans have fought, been injured, and died for \nour political system, our principles, our values: The right to exercise \nthe franchise, the right to know. We are witnessing, without acting to \ncorrect it, the corruption and erosion of those basic freedoms.\n  This new 527 loophole should outrage us and we should act, I hope \nunanimously, across party lines, by adopting this amendment to put a \nstop to it.\n  Mr. President, I urge all our colleagues to join us in supporting \nthis proposal.

Mr. President, It is neither an understatement, nor a \nmisstatement of fact, to say that the United States Senate is an \nimpressive, awe inspiring, and unique institution for many different \nreasons. Certainly one of the biggest reasons that the Senate is such a \nspecial place is the talented, dedicated, and bright men and women who \nwork in support of us and our duties. I rise to pay tribute to one of \nthese individuals, Steve Benza, who is retiring today after thirty-two \nyears of service as an employee of the United States Senate.\n  Though he retains some of the mannerisms and accent that one would \nexpect to find in someone who was born in the Bronx, New York City, \nSteve Benza is for all intents and purposes a native of the Senate. His \nfamily moved to the Washington area in 1958 and he began working in the \nSenate while a high school student, spending his summer breaks as a \nPage. Following graduation, Steve spent time working on the Grounds \nCrew and in the Senate Post Office before seizing the opportunity to \nwork as a staff photographer, and his career was launched. As an aside, \nI would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Senate service is \na family tradition with the Benzas, Steve's mother Christine Benza has \nserved with the Architect of the Capitol for the past forty-years.\n  Beginning his career as a ``shooter'', even before the contemporary \nPhotographic Studio was established back in 1980, Steve Benza has \nbecome a familiar and well liked member of the Senate family. During \nhis career here, Steve has met hundreds of Senators, taken probably \nmillions of pictures, and has become an instantly recognizable \ninstitution with trademark mustache and trusted camera slung over his \nshoulder. In his almost thirty-years of working as an official \nphotographer, Steve Benza has seen and chronicled everything from the \nmundane and routine to the unusual and historic. Confirmation hearings \nfor Supreme Court Justices, the Fiftieth Anniversary of the D-Day \nInvasion, the Inaugurations of four Presidents, dozens of State of the \nUnion Addresses and Joint Sessions of Congress, and the Impeachment \nTrial of President Clinton are all among the events that have been \ncovered by Steve Benza.\n  In 1997, Steve was promoted from his position of supervisor of the \nSenate Photographers to Manager of the Senate Photo Studio where he has \nproven himself not only to be an able administrator, but someone of \nvision. Under his direction, the Senate Photographic Studio has \ninvested in new equipment and technology, embracing the revolution in \ndigital photography which has allowed for many innovations including \nquicker turn around time on orders, the creation of an image data base, \nand expanded services that ultimately benefit us and our constituents. \nAlso under his direction, the Senate Photo Laboratory facilities were \nupgraded and training opportunities for staff were increased. All in \nall, the contributions and leadership of Steve Benza have turned the \nPhoto Studio into a modern operation, equipped with the technology of \nthe new century, and as a result, he has increased the efficiency of \nthis vital Senate support service. He unquestionably leaves an \nimpressive legacy of dedication to his job, and he has set an excellent \nexample for others to emulate.\n  It is hard to believe that after more than three-decades, Steve Benza \nhas decided to retire. I know it is safe to say that he will missed by \ncountless individuals including all one-hundred Senators, but I am \ncertain that each of us will remember him. I had the pleasure of having \nSteve travel with me to the People's Republic of China when I led a \ndelegation to that nation in 1997. Beyond putting together an \nimpressive collection of images that chronicled our journey, Steve's \nrelaxed disposition and ready sense of humor made what was a \npleasurable journey all the more enjoyable.\n  As many of us know, Steve Benza is a devoted family man. Though I \nunderstand that he has not made-up his mind as to what he will do in \nhis retirement, I am certain that spending time with his wife Alma, and \nchildren George and Annie, will be a big part of his activities, as \nwill pursuing his passions of fishing and golfing. Regardless of what \nSteve chooses to do in the future, I wish him many years of health, \nhappiness, and success, and I want him to know that I am grateful and \nappreciative for his many years of loyal service to the United States \nSenate. It has been a pleasure to know him and I will certainly miss \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4661-5", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4661-S4662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO COLONEL TERESA M. PETERSON, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional \ndedication, vision, and public service of\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nColonel Teresa M. Peterson who is leaving the 14th Flying Training Wing \n(14 FTW) after two years of devoted service to become the Director of \nTransportation on the Air Force staff in the Pentagon. It is a \nprivilege for me to recognize her many outstanding achievements at \nColumbus Air Force Base, and to commend her for the superb service she \nhas provided the Air Force and our great Nation.\n  As Commander of the 14th Flying Training Wing, Colonel Peterson \nspearheaded the training and education of our Nation's next generation \nof Air Force pilots. The epitome of an Air Force officer and \naccomplished pilot, she provided our Nation's future warriors with \ninspirational leadership and an outstanding training environment. Her \ntalents were showcased in every aspect of Columbus AFB operations and \nhighlighted through outstanding performances on command inspections \nsuch as the 1998 Headquarters Air Education and Training Command (AETC) \nOperational Readiness Inspection.\n  Colonel Peterson's quality of life initiatives for Columbus AFB \nprovided the installation with $56 million in improvements. Those \ninitiatives included construction of a $6.3 million Unaccompanied \nOfficer Quarters and a $25 million, 202 unit, highly sensitive family \nhousing complex. She deftly negotiated resolution of several complex \ncontracting challenges on the family housing project and ensured that \ncontractor issues were handled quickly and efficiently. Her vision and \noversight of numerous facilities construction and renovation projects \nsignificantly enhanced the training environment and living conditions \nof Columbus AFB personnel.\n  Under Colonel Peterson's leadership and guidance, Columbus AFB was a \nshowcase for visitors which included the Secretary of the Air Force, \nmembers of Congress, foreign dignitaries, numerous flag officers, and \nfriends and families of the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training \nProgram. Her dedication to the Air Force and her people and the vision \nshe established for Columbus AFB are her greatest assets, netting \nColumbus unprecedented recognition with AETC and the Air Force.\n  She aggressively met the increased Air Force pilot demand through \nactivation of the first reserve associate squadron, seamlessly \nintegrating reservists with active duty instructor pilots to mitigate \nforce reduction problems. Colonel Peterson managed the second busiest \nmilitary airfield east of the Mississippi River, with more than 200,000 \naircraft operations annually. Her area of responsibility included \n49,000 square miles of airspace in close coordination with 13 civilian \nsatellite airports. Under her command, Columbus AFB has remained one of \nthe safest flying operations in the AETC.\n  She astutely enhanced pilot training at its initial phase by \nestablishing co-equal T-37 squadrons with an operating concept for \nsynchronized training and operations under two distinct supervisors. \nShe managed pilot training and support operations for USAF and \ninternational officers using a fleet of 247 T-37B, T-38A, T-1A and AT-\n38B aircraft and 14 instrument simulators. Her extraordinary aviation \nskills, coupled with her vast experience and boundless warrior spirit, \nensured that Columbus AFB was aggressively able to meet the challenge \nof increased Air Force pilot demand. Her efforts produced 585 \nSpecialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and 481 Introduction to \nFighter Fundamental student pilots who flew 146,795 sorties totaling \n198,722 hours during her tenure.\n  As Colonel Teresa Peterson leaves Columbus Air Force Base, she leaves \nbehind a legacy of excellence and ``firsts.'' She was the first woman \nin the Air Force to command a flying squadron; the first active duty \nwoman to command an Air Force flying wing; and, the first woman pilot \nto make the rank of brigadier general. She is recognized as an honorary \nmember of the Tuskegee Airmen (Alva N. Temple Chapter) and a member of \nthe Mississippi University for Women's National Board of Distinguished \nWomen. Colonel Peterson is an outstanding officer and a credit to the \nUnited States Air Force and our great Nation. I call upon my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle to recognize her service to Columbus Air \nForce Base and wish her well in her next assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4662-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of 30,020 Pennsylvanian Wal-Mart associates. These \ndedicated individuals, along with 870,000 other Wal-Mart associates \nnationwide, raised more than $14 million for the National World War II \nMemorial Campaign.\n  This outstanding achievement brought the World War II Memorial\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nFund to more than $90 million. This donation brings the fund \nincreasingly closer to its goal of $100 million. On June 6, 2000, \nBarbara Ritenour and Bonnie Cowell from Belle Vernon, PA joined 40 \nother Wal-Mart associates to present this contribution to former \nSenator Robert Dole, National Chairman of the World War II Memorial \nCampaign on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n  The purpose of this event on June 6 was to thank those who went above \nand beyond the call of duty to help meet this financial goal. It was \nthe small contributions of bake sales and parking lot carnivals that \nmade such a difference.\n  Wal-Mart employs over 1,900 World War II veterans. They recognize the \nimportance of constructing a memorial to salute the men and women who \nfought in the war as well as those who supported it from the home \nfront.\n  I commend the efforts of those so dedicated to the memory of those \nwho served in World War II, and I wish the World War II Memorial \nCampaign continued success as they work to meet the remainder of their \n$100 million goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4663-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4663-S4665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RYAN WHITE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the Ryan White CARE \nReauthorization Act. I commend everyone in the Senate who has worked so \neffectively on the issue of HIV and AIDS, beginning with Senator \nJeffords, who has been a champion on this issue since the CARE Act was \nfirst authorized in 1990. I also thank the sponsors of this bill and \nour colleagues on the Health Committee who have sounded the alarm about \nthe HIV/AIDS crisis through their unwavering support of the CARE Act \nreauthorization.\n  There is no stronger or more effective support than a full Senate \nunanimous vote today to show that, in each and every one of our states, \nwe stand behind a bill that will enable so many citizens to receive the \nbenefits of advances in therapies and support developed through our \nefforts over the past ten years.\n  At times of great human suffering or great tragedies or epidemics, it \nhas often been the leadership of the federal government that has helped \nour fellow citizens deal with difficulties. It is in that very \nimportant tradition that this legislation was originally enacted and I \nurge the Senate to approve this important reauthorization of it today.\n  Ryan White, the young boy after whom the CARE Act was named, would \nhave celebrated his twenty-eighth birthday this year. If we had we been \nas far along as we are now in providing life-prolonging and life-saving \ntherapies, Ryan might well have been here with us, thanking each of us \nfor the lifeline and the hope provided through the CARE Act.\n  Since the beginning of this epidemic, AIDS has claimed over 400,000 \nlives in the United States, and an estimated 900,000 Americans are \nliving with HIV/AIDS today. AIDS continues to claim the most vulnerable \namong us. Like other epidemics before it, Aids is now hitting hardest \nin areas where knowledge about the disease is scarce and poverty is \nhigh. The epidemic has dealt a particularly severe blow to communities \nof color, which account for 73% of all new HIV infections. Women \naccount for 30% of new infections. Over half of all new infections \noccur in persons under 25. This means that HIV infection of the \nnation's youth is a national crisis.\n  AIDS continues to kill brothers and sisters, children and parents, \nfriends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives. From the \n30,000 AIDS orphans in New York City to the 21 year old gay man with \nHIV living in Iowa, this epidemic knows no geographic boundaries and \nhas no mercy.\n  An estimated 34% of AIDS cases in the U.S. are in rural areas, and \nthis percentage is growing. We know the challenges faced in rural \ncommunities where pulling together in the face of adversity is \ncommonplace in other case. But where too often today there is silence \nand isolation because of the fear of condemnation over AIDS.\n  In addition, access to good medical care is often a significant \nbarrier for many of our citizens with disabling diseases, who have to \ntravel to urban centers to receive the care they need and deserve. As \nthe AIDS crisis continues year after year, it has become more and more \ndifficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem. In a \nvery real way, we are all living with AIDS or are directly touched by \nAIDS.\n  The epidemic still kills over 47,000 persons a year. But we have good \nreason today to feel encouraged by the extraordinary medical advances \nmade over the past ten years. AIDS deaths declined by 20% between 1997 \nand 1998. Many people with HIV and AIDS are leading longer and \nhealthier lives today.\n  In addition, we have witnessed the smallest increase in new AIDS \ncases--11% in 1998, compared to an 18% increase in 1997. More families \nare leading productive lives in our society, in spite of their HIV \ndiagnosis. This is the good news. But unfortunately, the number of \npeople living with AIDS who can't afford expensive medical treatment is \ngrowing which means that greater demands are being placed on community-\nbased organizations and state and local governments that serve them.\n  The advances in the development of life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs has \ncome with an enormous price tag and these advances have been costly. An \nestimated 30% of person living with AIDS do not have health care \ncoverage to pay for costly treatments. For these Americans, the CARE \nAct continues to provide the only means to obtain the health care and \nthe treatment they need.\n  In Massachusetts we have seen an overall 77% decline in AIDS and HIV-\nrelated deaths since 1995. At the same time, however, like many other \nstates, the changing HIV/AIDS trends and profiles are serious problems. \nAIDS and HIV cases increased in women by 11% from 1997 to 1998. 55% of \npersons living with AIDS in the state are person of color. State \nbudgets often provide funds for prevention, screening and primary care. \nBut no state could provide the major financial resources needed to help \nperson living with HIV disease to obtain the medical and support \nservices they need, without the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  By passing this legislation, we are making clear that the AIDS \nepidemic in the United States will receive the attention and public \nhealth response it deserves. The CARE Act reauthorization brings hope \nto over 600,000 persons each year in dealing with the devastating \ndisease. It also brings hope and help to their families and their \ncommunities.\n  The enactment of this legislation in 1990 was an emergency response \nto the devastating effects of HIV on individuals, families, \ncommunities, and state and local governments. The Act targets funds to \nrespond to the specific needs of specific communities. Title I targets \nthe hardest hit metropolitan areas in the country. Local planning and \npriority-setting requirements under Title I assure that each of the \nEligible Metropolitan Area can respond effectively to the local HIV/\nAIDS needs.\n  Title II funds emergency relief to states. It helps them to develop \nHIV care infrastructure, and to provide effective and life-sustaining \ndrug therapies through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to over 61,000 \npersons each month.\n  Title III funds community health centers and other primary health \ncare providers that serve areas with a significant and disproportionate \nneed for HIV care. Many of these community health centers are located \nin the hardest hit areas, serving low income communities. Title IV of \nthe CARE Act meets the specific needs of women, children, and families.\n  This reauthorization builds on these past accomplishments, while \nrecognizing the challenge of ensuring access to HIV drug treatments for \nall who need them. Our goal is to reduce health disparities in \nvulnerable communities, and improve the distribution and quality of \nservices. Senator Jeffords and I have worked together to address new \nchallenges we face in the battle against AIDS. This reauthorization \nwill create additional funding for states that have had to limit access \nto new therapies due to lack of resources. The bill also targets new \nfunds to smaller metropolitan areas and to rural and urban communities, \nwhere the epidemic is growing and adequate infrastructure is lacking.\n  In addition, the bill funds early intervention services to promote \nearly diagnosis of HIV disease, referral to health\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\ncare, and initiation of effective treatments to reduce the onset of the \nillness and its progression. Health disparities in communities of color \nwill be reduced by requiring states and local communities funded by the \nAct to plan, set priorities, and fund initiatives to meet documented \nlocal needs in dealing with the epidemic. The reauthorization will also \nestablish quality and accountability in HIV service delivery, by \nstrengthening quality management activities to make them consistent \nwith Public Health Service guidelines.\n  Our action yesterday affirmed our long-standing commitment to \ncitizens with HIV/AIDS and to sound public policy for all citizens, \nfamilies and communities touched by this devastating disease. We have \nthe resources to continue to battle AIDS. We must continue to deal with \nthis disease with the same courage shown to us ten years ago by the \nvaliant ten year old, Ryan White, who spoke out against the ignorance \nthe discrimination faced by so many people living with AIDS. The lives \nsaved by our efforts through the CARE Act will mean a chance for real \nhope as medical research comes closer and closer to finding a cure.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am delighted that last night \nthe Senate voted to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act, S. 2311. I am \nproud to count myself as one of the cosponsors of this legislation in \nthe Senate and strongly support its swift passage by the House.\n  The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to take a high toll on Americans \ninfected with HIV and their families. HIV/AIDS has affected Oregon in \nmany ways. Almost five thousand Oregonians have been diagnosed with \nAIDS--resulting in almost 3,000 deaths. In addition, those infected \nwith HIV number up to 8,500 in Oregon. This epidemic has touched people \nin every part of my State--rural and urban, rich and poor, senior \ncitizens and newborns.\n  Although the story of each of these individuals living with HIV/AIDS \nis different, they all have one thing in common: they all benefit from \nthe Ryan White CARE Act. Oregon received almost $8.5 million federal \ndollars last year to fund programs through the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Passage of the Ryan White CARE Act will allow Oregonians living with \nHIV to have timely access to life-prolonging medications and necessary \nhealth care and support services, regardless of income level or \ninsurance status. The Ryan White CARE Act will also improve access for \nHIV positive Oregonians to clinical trials, with the potential for \nadditional scientific breakthroughs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.\n  I call for the House to join the Senate in a similar quick passage of \nthe Ryan White CARE Act that will allow hundreds of thousands of HIV \npositive Americans to remain healthy, productive members of their \ncommunities, while slowing the spread of the AIDS epidemic.\n  I would like to thank my friend Terry Bean of Portland, Oregon for \ntalking to me about the good things the Ryan White Act does for \nOregonians living with HIV/AIDS. Terry is a long time board member of \nthe Human Rights Campaign and has been a highly valued advisor on \nissues affecting the Gay and Lesbian community in Oregon.\n  Terry's thoughts and wisdom on hate crimes, ENDA and fighting against \nall types of discrimination have provided me with an ethical marker for \ndoing what is right on the Senate Floor for Oregonians. I do feel lucky \nthat Terry's advice is dispensed on a golf course--though the only \ncriticism I may have for Terry is that he lacks the political savvy to \nlose to a United States Senator. I thank him anyway for his strong \nsupport and good advice.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate reauthorized a \nvery important piece of legislation: the Ryan White CARE Act. I want to \nthank Senators Kennedy and Jeffords for their work and commitment to \nreauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  The CARE Act provides access to health care for tens of thousands of \nlow-income people living with HIV and AIDS. This vital Act is set to \nexpire on September 30, 2000. We must move quickly to ensure that it is \nreauthorized. Without the CARE Act, access to important health-related \nservices could be jeopardized for hundreds of thousands of people \nliving with HIV/AIDS.\n  Since 1990, the CARE Act has helped establish a comprehensive, \ncommunity-based continuum of care for uninsured and under-insured \npeople living with HIV and AIDS, including access to primary medical \ncare, pharmaceuticals, and support services. The CARE Act provides \nservices to people who would not otherwise have access to care.\n  The CARE Act is particularly important to communities of color. The \nHIV epidemic is devastating communities of color. Currently, AIDS is \nthe leading cause of death among African American men and the second \nleading cause of death among African American women between the ages of \n25 and 44. Comparably, AIDS is the fifth leading cause of death among \nall Americans in this age group. A disproportionate number of African \nAmericans and Hispanic/Latinos are also living with AIDS. Whereas \nAfrican Americans represent only 13 percent of the total U.S. \npopulation, they represent 36 percent of reported AIDS cases. Likewise, \nLatinos represent 9 percent of the population but 17 percent all of \nAIDS cases.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act is important to thousands of Californians. \nTwo of California's largest cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, are \namong the top four metropolitan cites with the highest number of AIDS \ncases in the United States. California has the second highest number of \nAIDS cases, with over 40,000 Californians currently living with AIDS. \nThrough the CARE Act, Los Angeles has provided services to over 43,160 \nclients since 1996. San Francisco has provided services to 47,440 since \n1996. These numbers alone demonstrate the significant impact the CARE \nAct has had on California.\n  A majority of newly diagnosed AIDS cases in California are among \npeople of color. Through 1998, over half of all AIDS cases are reported \namong racial and ethnic minorities in California. In Los Angeles, and \nOakland that number rises to over 60 percent, according to the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act state profiles.\n  Los Angeles County and San Francisco County were among the first \nsixteen eligible metropolitan areas to receive Title I emergency Ryan \nWhite CARE Act funds in 1991. California has been significantly \nimpacted by the HIV/AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, and has \ngreatly benefitted from the Ryan White CARE Act since 1990.\n  The CARE Act has been very successful in the past decade. Over the \nlast several years, the CARE Act has:\n\n       Helped to reduce AIDS mortality by 70 percent. Due to \n     combination anti-retroviral therapies being made more widely \n     available through the CARE Act, the AIDS death rate in 1997 \n     was the lowest in nearly a decade.\n       Helped to reduce mother-to-child transmission by 75 \n     percent.\n       Helped to reduce the number and length of expensive \n     hospitalizations by 30 percent. It has also helped decrease \n     the use of medical speciality care.\n       Helped 97,000 individuals access drugs through the AIDS \n     Drug Assistance Program in 1997.\n       Helped 315,234 people receive HIV testing and counseling \n     services in 1997.\n       Helped 66,000 people access dental care in 1998.\n       Promoted health and well-being which has enabled many \n     people living with HIV to return to work and remain healthy, \n     and actively participate in society.\n\n  The CARE Act is more important now than ever. HIV/AIDS remains a \nhealth emergency in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control \nestimates that 40,000 new cases are reported annually. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are \ncurrently infected with HIV while the number of AIDS cases has nearly \ndoubled over the past five years. According to Dr. Fauci at the \nNational Institutes of Health, the worse is yet to come in the 21st \ncentury. The state of the epidemic points to the need for an increase, \nrather than a decrease, in health care and drug treatment for people \nliving with HIV/AIDS. Communities of color and women will continue to \nbe the most heavily impacted in the 21st century.\n  We have made many advances in testing, treatment, and research since \nthe early days of the disease and the beginnings of the Ryan White CARE \nAct. Drugs now exist that can prolong and improve the quality of life. \nThese drugs are not a cure, but they enable\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nmany people to lead a more ``normal'' life. Our job is not done, \nhowever, until we have made certain that all people have access to \nthese life-prolonging medications.\n  The work we were able to accomplish in San Francisco for people \nliving with HIV/AIDS is one of my proudest achievements as Mayor of the \nCity and County of San Francisco. In 1981, when there were only 76 \ndiagnosed cases, we provided $180,000 for prevention and social \nservices for people living with HIV/AIDS. These were some of the first \npublic funds allocated for AIDS in the United States. In 1987, during \nmy last full year as mayor, 20,000 AIDS deaths were reported in San \nFrancisco and we increased funding to $20 million. There was no federal \nRyan White program then; I struggled to find this money in the city \nbudget. Fortunately, for cities and States across the country, we now \nhave the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  I pledge to do all I can to eliminate AIDS. As I have said time and \ntime again: I was there in the beginning and I plan to be there in the \nend. In the meantime, we must make certain that the uninsured and \nunder-insured have access to life-prolonging HIV treatments. The Ryan \nWhite CARE Act has proven to be an essential and effective Federal \nprogram for the uninsured and under-insured. We must ensure the \ncontinuation of the Ryan White CARE Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4665-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

ORTIZ\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwell-respected and remarkable public servant, Staff Sergeant Ana V. \nOrtiz, who has been chosen to receive the 2000 National Image Salute to \nHispanics Award. Not only is Staff Sergeant Ortiz an upstanding and \ndedicated member of the Connecticut Air National Guard, but she is also \nthe principal of the Betances Elementary School in Hartford and an \nactive and vital member of her community.\n  Staff Sergeant Ortiz has dedicated nine years of service to the \nConnecticut Air National Guard, displaying the qualities of a natural \nleader and setting an example for others to follow. She participated in \nthree Air Force contingency operations that have sent her around the \nworld. In 1996, she supported Operation Decisive Endeavor in Italy; \n1998 found her in Panama playing a role in Constant Vigil; and just \nlast year she worked in Southwest Asia for Operation Guarded Skies. \nStaff Sergeant Ortiz previously attended the Air National Guard \nDiversity Conference, as well as the National Guard Bureau's National \nDiversity Program. A vocal advocate for diversity within the Air \nNational Guard, she worked to build a solid foundation for minorities \nin the military, as well as a better understanding of the armed forces \namong both minorities and non-minorities. Her work in the Guard has \nearned her the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and two Air Force Achievement \nMedals.\n  Although her military feats are impressive, Staff Sergeant Ortiz is \nfurther known for her strong commitment to the Hartford schools and \ncommunity. As the principal of Betances Elementary School she keeps \nactively involved with her students and community. Staff Sergeant Ortiz \nis a member of the Language Arts Committee for the State of \nConnecticut, and a contributor to the Center for Youth After-School \nPrograms, the Center City Churches, and the Charter Oak Cultural \nCenter. She also encourages and maintains a partnership program with \nsuburban schools in the surrounding area, and is constantly working to \nimprove education and educational opportunities for her students.\n  Ms. Ortiz' commitment to her students extends far beyond the school \ngrounds. She was selected to serve on the Hartford Police Department \nTask Force for students at risk in the community, which strives to \nencourage children to find positive ways to overcome the dangers of \ndrugs and violence that face our communities today. Furthermore, Ms. \nOrtiz is actively involved in protecting Connecticut's park attractions \nthrough her membership on the board of directors of the Bushnell Park \nFoundation, again promoting the well-being of her school children, as \nwell as the entire community.\n  Ms. Ortiz' professional achievements are matched by an impressive \neducational background. She earned a Bachelors of Science degree in \nEducation with an English major from Central University in Puerto Rico, \na Masters degree in Reading from the University of Hartford, and a six \nyear degree in Supervision and Administration from the University of \nConnecticut. Her wide range of expertise has enabled her to better \nexcel in all aspects of her life, and the surrounding community has \nclearly benefitted as a result.\n  Staff Sergeant Ortiz strives to make the world a better place for \nall--through her military service, community work, and involvement with \nConnecticut schools. Her dedication and commitment appear to be \nboundless, and she is wholly deserving of the 2000 National Image \nSalute to Hispanics Award. Staff Sergeant Ortiz will travel to San \nJuan, Puerto Rico on Thursday, June 8, 2000 to receive her prestigious \naward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4665-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4665-S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF RICHARD W. CANNON\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on June 16th, family, friends \nand colleagues will gather to honor Richard W. Cannon, who has served \nthe Social Security Administration for 39 years, and is retiring as \nDistrict Manager of the Providence, RI office.\n  Mr. Cannon has demonstrated an exemplary record of service to New \nEngland and the Social Security Administration (SSA). He began his \ncareer with SSA as a Claims Representative in the Pawtucket, RI office \nin September, 1961. He quickly rose through the ranks, receiving \npromotions to field Representative, Operations Supervisor, Branch \nManager, Assistant District Manager, and finally to District Manager by \n1976. He has held the position of District Manager for 24 years in \nthree offices: New London, CT; Cambridge, MA; and since May 1987, \nProvidence.\n  Not only has Rhode Island benefited from Richard's services, but \nregions across the country have as well. He served stints in Social \nSecurity Administration offices in New York, California, and Hawaii, \nBut, it has been our good fortune that he continues to return to his \nhome state of Rhode Island.\n  He has shared his knowledge and expertise not only with his office \ncolleagues, but with members of the Rhode Island Federal Executive \nCouncil, which he led as chairman for two years, and the New England \nSocial Security Managers Association, where he also held office.\n  Lest we think that Richard's life was dedicated solely to the Social \nSecurity Administration, he also enjoys the outdoors.

Mr. President, I rise to honor one of the great \ncities in Missouri: Kansas City. On June 3, 1850, the Town of Kansas \nwas incorporated. Three years later, the town was reincorporated as the \nCity of Kansas and renamed Kansas City in 1889. Today, Kansas Citians \nare celebrating the sesquicentennial of Kansas City, Missouri.\n  Kansas City is situated at the point of entry at the confluence of \nthe Missouri and Kansas Rivers. In the beginning, Kansas City was known \nas the last point of civilization before venturing into the untamed \nWest. The settlement quickly prospered as an outfitting post for gold \nprospectors and homesteaders who were moving west.\n  Because of its geographical location in the middle of the United \nStates, Kansas City was destined to develop into one of our nation's \nmost important trading markets and distribution hubs for goods and \nservices.\n  As Kansas City began to grow and prosper it became a major region for \nraising and sending cattle to market. Kansas City quickly emerged as \nthe largest cattle market in the world. Since that time, each Fall, the \nAmerican Royal Festival is held to pay tribute to this rich cultural \nheritage.\n  Two words come to mind when people talk about Kansas City. Those two \nwords are Jazz and Barbecue. Kansas City is world renowned for both. \nOne also must not forget the grandeur of the Christmas lights that \nadorn Country Club Plaza, viewed annually by thousands.\n  Kansas City is home to the Liberty Memorial which honors America's \nsons and daughters who defended liberty and our country through their \nservice in World War I. This Memorial serves as a tribute to ensure \nthat the sacrifices made by those brave men and women are not \nforgotten.\n  Union Station was the gateway for many World War II service men and \nwomen passing through Kansas City on their way to service. Now newly \nrefurbished it still stands tall and stately as a major tourist \nattraction.\n  In the 1960s, Kansas City emerged as a powerhouse in professional \nsports. Lamar Hunt brought the Chiefs NFL football team to Kansas City, \nand Ewing Kauffman was awarded a major league baseball franchise. The \nKansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals have both captured world \npennants.\n  From its vibrant past to its glowing future, Kansas City is a \ncommunity that remains on the cutting edge of technology, industry, \nmedical research, manufacturing, and sports. At the dawn of a new \ncentury, Kansas City will continue to grow and prosper and rise to her \nhighest and best.\n  Mr. President, it is a distinct privilege to represent this great \ncity in the United States Senate. I request that my colleagues join me \nin recognizing Kansas City for its 150 years of contributions to our \ngreat land and paying tribute to the KC150 celebration, Kansas City's \nsesquicentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4666-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO CHARLIE HOWELL\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my \ncolleagues that a young man from my state, Charlie Howell, won the \nindividual National Collegiate Athletic Association golf championship \nthis past weekend. Charlie hails from Augusta, home of the Masters Golf \nTournament, and his achievement marks the beginning of another chapter \nin the great golf tradition of the Augusta area.\n  Charlie, a junior at Oklahoma State University, finished the event \nwith a final score of 265, a full 23 strokes under par. His score \nshattered the previous championship record of 17 under. Given the \nnumber of talented players who have won the title, including Tiger \nWoods, Charlie's accomplishment is nothing short of phenomenal.\n  Along with his win in the individual tournament, Charlie helped the \nOklahoma State team win the National Championship as well. This marks \nthe first time since 1990 that the individual champion was also apart \nof a national championship team.\n  While success on the professional golf circuit almost certainly \nawaits Charlie, he has decided that his future can wait. Charlie will \nreturn to OSU for his senior year, helping to lead his team in defense \nof their title, and more importantly, to complete his college \neducation.\n  Charlie's hard work and dedication to the sport have paid off \nhandsomely. He now joins an elite group of golfers that can call \nthemselves NCAA champions. I commend Charlie for his tremendous \naccomplishment, and wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4666-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING STUDENTS FROM GREEN RIVER HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1200 \nstudents from across the United States came to Washington, D.C. to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class \nfrom Green River High School in Green River, Wyoming, represented my \nstate in this national event. These young scholars worked diligently to \nreach the national finals and through their experience have gained a \ndeep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and \nvalues of our constitutional democracy.\n  The participating students were Richard Baxter, Natalie Binder, \nKatharine Bracken, Cameron Kelsey, Sandra Newton, Jacque Owen, Jeremy \nPitts, Benjamin Potmesil, Meagan Reese, Rachel Ryckman, Ryan Stewart, \nand Steven Ujvary. I also want to recognize their teacher, Dennis \nJohnson, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the team.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress, during which a panel of judges \nfrom a variety of appropriate professional fields probes the students \nfor their depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  The class from Green River represented the state of Wyoming well \nduring the finals, and I wish these ``constitutional experts'' the best \nof luck as they continue to cultivate their interest in the principles \nupon which our great country was founded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4666-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4666-S4667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize \nsome special students from my home state of Wyoming, Green River to be \nspecific, who have been spending a lot of their time studying our \nConstitution. They got so good at it, in fact, that they entered a \nnational competition here in Washington to test their knowledge against \nthe best of their peers and had a remarkable result.\n  Earlier this month students from around the country came to the \nnation's capital to compete on their understanding of our Constitution \nand our American Government. The students of Green River High School \ndid very well in that event. In fact, their understanding and grasp of \nthe fundamental principles of our Democracy and the meaning of our \nConstitution was judged to be among the best of the 50 teams that \nparticipated.\n  Programs like the one the students of Green River participated in are \nvital if we are to ensure that our future leaders have an understanding \nof the principles of our Constitution and the beliefs and values our \nFounding Fathers brought to the creation of our government. Such an \nunderstanding is an important part of our children's education for it \nwill help them understand that the rights and freedoms afforded by our \nConstitution bring with them certain duties and responsibilities - the \nduties and responsibilities of citizenship. That will help them \nunderstand their role as they become our local, state and national \nleaders and face the challenges of the new millennium.\n  Good work, Green River High School! Led by their teacher, Dennis \nJohnson, and supported by their State Coordinator, Dick Kean, and their \nDistrict Coordinator, Matt Strannigan, they did a great job and made \nWyoming proud.\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\n  I would also like to congratulate each member of the team, which \nincludes: Richard Baxter, Natalie Binder, Katharine Bracken, Cameron \nKelsey, Sandra Newton, Jacque Owen, Jeremy Pitts, Benjamin Potmesil, \nMeagan Reese, Rachel Ryckman, Ryan Stewart and Steven Ujvary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4667-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF WHITE PASS & YUKON RAILROAD'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nAlaskan institution as it nears its 100th birthday.\n  It is a major tourist attraction in Alaska, the eighth most popular \nin the state in 1998, boosting ridership in 1999 to about 274,000 \npassengers. It is an engineering marvel, having been named an \nInternational Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1994, such as the \nPanama Canal, Eiffel Tower, and the Statue of Liberty. It is an \nhistoric institution, its history tied directly to that of the \nTerritory and State of Alaska. It got its start because of the famed \nKlondike Gold Rush of 1898--the last great Gold Rush in North American \nhistory. But it is more.\n  The White Pass & Yukon narrow-gauge Railroad is a lasting monument to \nthe power of a dream, and to the ability of this country to mobilize \ntechnology. And it is proof positive that if you never give up, you can \naccomplish any worthwhile task, no matter how difficult the challenge. \nThat lesson is as important today, as it was in 1900, at the line's \ncompletion.\n  It was early in 1898 when two men came north intent upon solving a \ntransportation dilemma--intent upon moving men and supplies across the \ndaunting Coast Mountains of Southeast Alaska, so they could reach the \ngold fields of the Yukon to forge national wealth for both Canada and \nAmerica from the virgin wilderness. Sir Thomas Tancrede, a \nrepresentative of a group of British financiers and Michael J. Heney, a \nCanadian railway contractor, by chance met one night at a hotel bar in \nSkagway, Alaska.\n  Tancrede, after detailed surveys, had concluded that it was \nimpossible to build a railroad through the rugged St. Elias Mountains \nthat separate the interior of the Yukon from Alaska at the northern end \nof the Alaska Panhandle. But Heney had just the opposite view. After an \nall-night ``discussion,'' one of the world's great railroad projects \nwas no longer a dream, but an accepted challenge.\n  On May 28, 1898, construction began on the White Pass & Yukon Route. \nUtilizing tons of black powder and thousands of workers the project \nbegan. Two months later the railroad's first engine pulled an excursion \ntrain from Skagway north over the first four miles of completed track, \nmaking the WP, the northernmost railroad in the Western Hemisphere--\nthe first built above 60 degrees north latitude.\n  From there on, the going got tough. The railroad, truly an \ninternational undertaking, climbed from sea level at the docks in \nSkagway through sheer mountains to 2,865 feet at the summit of the \nWhite Pass. It faces grades as steep as 3.9 percent. Heney's workers \nhung suspended by ropes from the vertical granite cliffs, chipping away \nwith picks and planting black powder to blast a right-of-way through \nthe mountains. Heavy snow and temperatures as low as -60  deg.F \nhampered the work. And the mere whisper of a new gold find sent workers \nscurrying off in droves.\n  With all odds against it, the track reached the summit of White Pass \non Feb. 20, 1899 and by July 6, construction reached the headwaters of \nthe great Yukon River at Lake Bennett. While southern gangs blasted \ntheir way through the pass, a northern crew worked toward Whitehorse, \nlater the capital of the Yukon Territory. On July 29, 1900, the 110-\nmiles of rails met at Carcross, where a ceremonial spike was driven by \nSamuel H. Graves, the company's first president. It is that \nanniversary--the Golden Spike Centennial Celebration--that will take \nplace in Carcross, Yukon Territory, on Saturday, July 29 that is a \nreason for this statement.\n  Another reason, however, is simply to honor the White Pass, one of \nthe most historic and quaint railroads in the world. Through the years \nwhen Alaska was a territory and later a state, the railroad enjoyed a \nrich and colorful history. It hauled passengers and freight to the \nYukon; was a chief supplier for the U.S. Army's Alaska Highway \nconstruction project during World War II; and later was a basic freight \nrailroad, hauling metal from the mines of the Yukon to tidewater in \nAlaska. The company after WWII began modernizing itself, retiring the \nlast of its stream engines in 1964, switching to diesel locomotives. It \nbecame a fully-integrated transportation system, carrying freight \n(containers and highway tractor-trailer units) and passengers from \nAlaska to Canada's Interior.\n  In 1982, however, world metal prices plummeted and the major mines in \nthe Yukon shut down--metals being the most dependable freight during \nits first 82 years of service--causing the railroad's operations to be \nsuspended. It was six long years later that the railroad reopened to \nprovide tourist excursions for the 20.4 mile trip from tidewater to the \nsummit of the White Pass and back to Skagway. It also picks up hikers \nwho trek the famed Chilkoot Trail that ends at Lake Bennett and brings \nthem to the Klondike Highway for road transport home.\n  The railroad along the way paid homage to its heritage by saving old \nsteam engine No. 73, a 1947, 2-8-2 Mikado class steam locomotive, and \nlater restoring her for ceremonial service, so that passengers can \nventure from the docks in historic downtown Skagway--center of the \nKlondike Gold Rush National Historic Park--toward the old Gold Rush \ncemetery, just 1.5 miles away. In those few miles, tourists can feel \nthe rumble, hear the noise and experience the romance of historic \nAmerican train travel.\n  The White Pass embodies Alaska's ``boom-and-bust'' history, being \nborn as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush. It is the direct result of \nthe spirit and economic boom started in August 1896 when George \nWashington Carmack and his two Indian companions, Skookum Jim and \nTagish Charlie, found gold in a tributary of the Klondike, later named \nBonzana Creek outside of Dawson. The railroad experienced the \nterritory's malaise in the early 20th Century, until World War II \nreinvigorated it. It survived the downturn in North American mining \nindustry and is now benefiting from the growth of the nation's tourism \nindustry and America's renewed interest in its history.\n  All of America is better off for the railroad's presence. It today is \na slice of living history that helps fuel the imagination of Americans \nand a love for our nation's past. It is a national treasure that we all \nneed to protect and preserve. Happy Golden Anniversary to all the \nemployees of the railroad and may you have a second great century of \nexciting and historic travel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4667-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4667-S4668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3642) an act \nto authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of the \nCongress to Charles M.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve \nthe process used by the United States Postal Service to establish \npostage rates for nonprofit and other reduced-rate mailers.\n  Under the current rate setting procedure, nonprofit postage rates \nhave changed significantly, often rising more than corresponding \ncommercial rates. In fact, in some cases, nonprofit mail rates have \nincreased so much that the nonprofit rates are higher than similar \ncommercial rates. According to the Postal Service, the unpredictable \nrate changes experienced by nonprofit mailers stem from difficulties \nthe Service has had with gathering accurate cost data for small \nsubclasses of mail.\n  By establishing a structured relationship between nonprofit and \ncommercial postage rates, this legislation would protect all categories \nof nonprofit mail from unpredictable rate swings in the future. The \nbill would set nonprofit and classroom Periodical rates at 95 percent \nof the commercial counterpart rates (excluding the advertising \nportion), set nonprofit Standard A rates at 60 percent of the \ncommercial Standard A rates, and set Library and Educational Matter \nrates at 95 percent of the rates for the special subclass of commercial \nStandard B mail.\n  The Postal Service recently proposed to increase postage rates for \nall classes of mail, and this proposal is now pending before the Postal \nRate Commission. As part of its request, the Postal Service asked for \nnonprofit postage rates that are premised on the enactment of this, or \nsimilar, legislation to change the process for setting nonprofit mail \nrates. Without this legislation, nonprofit mailers will face potential \ndouble-digit rate hikes.\n  This bill achieves an appropriate balance between nonprofit and \ncommercial postage rates, and provides nonprofit mailers with much \nneeded rate predictability. It is a compromise solution that is \nsupported by the United States Postal Service and several major \ncommercial and nonprofit mailer associations, including: the Alliance \nof Nonprofit Mailers, the National Federation of Nonprofits, the Direct \nMarketing Association, the Magazine Publishers of America, and the \nAssociation of Postal Commerce.\n  I invite my colleagues to support this effort to protect nonprofit \nmailers by improving the method for establishing nonprofit postage \nrates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Native American Languages Act to provide \nfor the support of Native American Language Survival Schools, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n          native american languages act amendments act of 2000\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend the Native American Languages Act to provide authority for the \nestablishment of Native American Language Survival Schools. I am joined \nin co-sponsorship by Senators Akaka, Cochran, Dodd, Kennedy, Murray and \nSchumer.\n  Mr. President, for hundreds of years, beginning with the arrival of \nEuropean settlers on America's shores, the native peoples of America \nhave had to fight for the survival of their cultures. History has shown \nthat the ability to maintain and preserve the culture and traditions of \na people is directly tied to the perpetuation of native languages. Like \nothers, the traditional languages of Native American people are an \nintegral part of their culture and identity. They provide the means for \npassing down to each new generation the stories, customs, religion, \nhistory and traditional ways of life. To lose the diversity and vibrant \nhistory of many Indian nations, is to lose a vital part of the history \nof this country.\n  Mr. President, Native American languages are near extinction in the \nUnited States. Studies suggest that at one time several thousand \ndistinct Indian languages existed in what is now America. Today that \nnumber has dwindled to approximately 155 Indian languages. Of these 155 \nlanguages remaining, 45 are only spoken by elders, 60 are spoken only \nby middle-aged adults or older adults, 30 are spoken by all adults but \nnot children, and only 20 Native languages are spoken by most of the \nchildren. With so many Native communities facing the loss of their \nlanguages as elderly native speakers pass on before the language can be \ntaught to younger generations, it is little wonder that this tragedy is \ngrowing exponentially, day by day.\n  In the 1880s, as part of the United States' forced assimilation \npolicies towards Native Americans, a system of off-reservation boarding \nschools was initiated. Native American children were forcibly taken \nfrom their families, transported hundreds of miles to schools where \ntheir hair was cut notwithstanding the religious importance of hair \nlength in most native cultures, their clothes replaced with military-\nstyle uniforms, and they were forbidden to speak their native languages \nor practice their religion. Although this effort to eradicate Indian \nculture was not successful, it did separate several generations of \nNative Americans from their native languages.\n  The Native American Languages Act of 1990 officially repudiated the \npolicies of the past and declared that ``it is the policy of the United \nStates to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of \nNative Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American \nlanguages.'' The Act was amended in 1992 to provide financial support \nto Native American language projects.\n  Mr. President, this bill would bring the nation one step closer to \nassuring the preservation and revitalization of Native American \nlanguages by supporting the development of Native American Language \nSurvival Schools. These schools would provide a complete education \nthrough the use of both Native American languages and English. The bill \nalso provides support for Native American Language Nests, which are \nNative American language immersion programs for children aged six and \nunder. In addition, the bill provides authority for the following \nactivities: curriculum development, teacher, staff and community \nresource development, rental, lease, purchase, construction, \nmaintenance or repair of educational facilities, and the establishment \nof two Native American Language School support centers at the Native \nLanguage College of the University of Hawaii at Hilo, and the Alaska \nNative Language Center of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to \nassist the Native people of America in their efforts to reverse the \neffects of past Federal policies by reintroducing today's children to \ntheir Native languages and preserving Native languages for the \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2688\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to Andrew Jackson Higgins (posthumously), and to the \nD-day Museum in recognition of the contributions of Higgins Industries \nand the more than 30,000 employees of Higgins Industries to the Nation \nand to world peace during World War II; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                         ANDREW JACKSON HIGGINS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I speak today to honor an \ninnovative and patriotic American--the logger-turned-boatbuilder, who \nsingle-handedly transformed the concept of amphibious ship design when \nour nation and her Allies needed it most. Despite a series of \nbureaucratic obstacles set up by America's World War II war-machine, \nHiggins skillfully engineered Marine Corps landing craft, and \neventually won contracts to build 92 percent of the Navy's war-time \nfleet. The story of Andrew Jackson Higgins exemplifies the American \nDream, and merits full recognition of this body for his ingenuity, \nassiduous work, and devotion to our country.\n  In the late 1930's, Higgins was operating a small New Orleans work-\nboat company, with less than seventy-five employees.He quickly earned a \nreputation for fast, dependable work, turning out specialized vessels \nfor the oil industry, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. \nBiological Survey. But when he presented his plans for swift amphibious \nlanding crafts, he met hard resistance. The U.S. Navy had overestimated \nFrench and British abilities to secure France's ports from German \nencroachment, and had thus overruled decisions to create landing boat \ncrafts. As the U.S. Marine Corps discerned the need for mass production \nof amphibious vessels for both the Pacific and European theaters, top \nbrass began to lobby the Navy to abandon its internal contracting, and \nprocure ships from Higgins Industries, which boasted high performance \nquality, and unprecedented speed for turning out boats. In 1941, the \nNavy finally asked Higgins to begin designing a landing draft to carry \ntanks. Instead of a design, Higgins delivered an entire working boat. \nIt had only taken 61 hours to design and construct his first Landing \nCraft, Mechanized (LCM). Quickly, the Higgins firm grew to seven \nplants, eventually turning out 700 boats a month--\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nmore than all other shipyards in the nation combined. By the war's end, \nHiggins had turned out 20,000 boats, ranging from the 46-foot LCVP \n(Landing Craft, Vehicle & Personnel) to the fast-moving PT boats, the \nrocket-firing landing craft support boats, the 56-foot tank landing \ncraft, the 170 foot freight supply ships and the 27-foot airborne \nlifeboats that could be dropped from B-17 bombers.\n  Able to conceive various ship designs and mass-produce vessels \nquickly at affordable prices, Higgins not only transformed wartime ship \nbuilding acquisition, but sustained the universal faith American \ninvention and global power projection. Higgins landing craft crashed on \nthe shores of Normandy on June 6, 1944, launching the greatest \namphibious assault in world history, and commencing a eastward drive to \nliberate Europe from Nazi Germany. In addition to his contributions to \nAllied war efforts abroad, Higgins' manufacturing further changed the \nface of my own city of New Orleans, home to most of the firm's \nbusiness. I urge my colleagues to support provisions to award Andrew \nJackson Higgins the Gold Medal of Honor, in the tradition of our great \ninstitution.\n  Mr. President, in 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reflecting \non the success of the 1944 Normandy invasion to his biographer, Steven \nAmbrose. Andrew Jackson Higgins ``is the man who won the war for us,'' \nhe said. ``If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing \ncraft, we never could have gone in over an open beach. We would have \nhad to change the entire strategy of the war.'' to me, Mr. Higgins and \nhis 20,000-member workforce embody American creativity, persistence, \nand patriotism; they deserve to be distinguished for their critical \nplace in history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2689\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Andrew Jackson Higgins Gold \n     Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Andrew Jackson Higgins was born on August 28, 1886, in \n     Columbus, Nebraska, moved to New Orleans in 1910, and formed \n     Higgins Industries on September 26, 1930.\n       (2) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n     produced the ``Eureka'', a unique shallow draft boat the \n     design of which evolved during World War II into 2 basic \n     classes of military craft: high speed PT boats, and types of \n     Higgins landing craft (LCPs, LCPLs, LCVPs, LCMs and LCSs).\n       (3) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n     constructed 4 major assembly line plants in New Orleans for \n     mass production of Higgins landing craft and other vessels \n     vital to the Allied Forces' conduct of World War II.\n       (4) Andrew Jackson Higgins bought the entire 1940 \n     Philippine mahogany crop and other material purely at risk \n     without a government contract, anticipating that America \n     would join World War II and that Higgins Industries would \n     need the wood to build landing craft. Higgins also bought \n     steel, engines, and other material necessary to construct \n     landing craft.\n       (5) Andrew Jackson Higgins, through Higgins Industries, \n     employed a fully integrated assembly line work force, black \n     and white, male and female, of up to 30,000 during World War \n     II, with equal pay for equal work.\n       (6) In 1939, the United States Navy had a total of 18 \n     landing craft in the fleet.\n       (7) From November 18, 1940, when Higgins Industries was \n     awarded its first contract for Higgins landing craft until \n     the conclusion of the war, the employees of Higgins \n     Industries produced 12,300 Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel \n     (LCVP's) and nearly 8,000 other landing craft of all types.\n       (8) During World War II, Higgins Industries employees \n     produced 20,094 boats, including landing craft and Patrol \n     Torpedo boats, and trained 30,000 Navy, Marine, and Coast \n     Guard personnel on the safe operation of landing craft at the \n     Higgins' Boat Operators School.\n       (9) On Thanksgiving Day 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     stated in an address to the Nation: ``Let us thank God for \n     Higgins Industries, management, and labor which has given us \n     the landing boats with which to conduct our campaign.''.\n       (10) Higgins landing craft, constructed of wood and steel, \n     transported fully armed troops, light tanks, field artillery, \n     and other mechanized equipment essential to amphibious \n     operations.\n       (11) Higgins landing craft made the amphibious assault on \n     D-day and the landings at Leyte, North Africa, Guadalcanal, \n     Sicily, Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, and thousands of less well-\n     known assaults possible.\n       (12) Captain R.R.M. Emmett, a commander at the North Africa \n     amphibious landing, and later commandant of the Great Lakes \n     Training Station, wrote during the war: ``When the history of \n     this war is finally written by historians, far enough removed \n     from its present turmoil and clamor to be cool and impartial, \n     I predict that they will place Mr. (Andrew Jackson) Higgins \n     very high on the list of those who deserve the commendation \n     and gratitude of all citizens.''.\n       (13) In 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower told historian \n     Steven Ambrose: ``He (Higgins) is the man who won the war for \n     us. If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing \n     craft, we never could have gone in over an open beach. We \n     would have had to change the entire strategy of the war.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reduce the risk that innocent persons may be \nexecuted, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE INNOCENCE PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a few months ago, I came to this \nfloor to draw attention to a growing national crisis in the \nadministration of capital punishment and to suggest some solutions. You \nwill recall some of the shocking facts I described:\n\n       For every 7 people executed, 1 death row inmate is shown \n     some time after conviction to be innocent of the crime.\n       Many of those exonerated have come within hours of being \n     executed, and many have spent a decade or more in jail before \n     they were given a fair opportunity to establish their \n     innocence.\n       Capital defendants are frequently represented by lawyers \n     who lack the funds or the competence to do the job, or who \n     have been disbarred or suspended for misconduct, and, from \n     time to time, by lawyers who sleep through the trial, but the \n     courts turn a blind eye.\n       Inexpensive and practically foolproof means of proving \n     innocence are often denied to defendants.\n\n  The saddest fact of all, to me, is that the society facing this \ncrisis is not a medieval one; it is America, today, in the 21st \nCentury. As the Governor of Illinois told us when he placed a \nmoratorium on the death penalty in his State earlier this year, \nsomething urgently needs to be done to remedy this situation. That is \nwhy I have been talking with Senators on both sides of the aisle and \nall sides of the capital punishment debate. That is why I have been \nsearching for ways to reduce the risk of mistaken executions.\n  That is why I am so pleased that today, with my good friend, the \njunior\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nSenator from Oregon (Senator Gordon Smith), we are introducing the \nbipartisan Innocence Protection Act of 2000. This bill is a carefully \ncrafted package of criminal justice reforms designed to protect the \ninnocent and to ensure that if the death penalty is imposed, it is the \nresult of informed and reasoned deliberation, not politics, luck, bias \nor guesswork.\n  Every American child is taught that justice is blind. It is important \nto remember what justice is supposed to be blind to. Justice should \nnever be blind to the truth, it should never be blind to the evidence, \nand it should never be blind to the teachings of modern science. What \njustice should be blind to is ideology, politics, race and money.\n  Too often in this chamber, we find ourselves dividing along party or \nideological lines. The bill that Senator Smith and I are introducing \ntoday is not about that, and it is not about whether in the abstract, \nyou favor or disfavor the death penalty. It is about what kind of \nsociety we want America to be in the 21st Century.\n  I am optimistic about America's future. I have become all the more \noptimistic in the past few months as I have seen an outpouring of \nsupport across the political spectrum and across the country for \ncommon-sense measures to reduce the risk of executing the innocent.\n  Today, Senator Smith and I are joined by Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, by some who support capital punishment and by others who \noppose it. On the Republican side, I want to thank my friend Senator \nSusan Collins of Maine and my fellow Vermonter, Senator Jim Jeffords. \nOn the Democratic side, Senators Levin, Feingold, Moynihan, Akaka, \nKerrey, and Wellstone. I also want to thank our House sponsors William \nDelahunt and Ray LaHood, along with their 39 cosponsors, both \nDemocratic and Republican. Here on Capitol Hill it is our job to \nrepresent Americans. The scores of legislators who have sponsored this \nlegislation clearly do represent Americans, both in their diversity and \nin their readiness to work together for common-sense solutions.\n  The outpouring of bipartisan support we have seen in Congress \nreflects an emerging public consensus. Opinion polls show Americans \ndivided on the death penalty in the abstract. But they show \noverwhelmingly that Americans will not tolerate the execution of \ninnocent people, and that Americans expect their justice system to \nprovide everyone with a fair trial and a competent lawyer. A recent \nGallup Poll found that 92 percent of Americans believe that people \nconvicted before modern advances in DNA technology should be given the \nopportunity to obtain DNA testing if such tests might show their \ninnocence.\n  I am also encouraged by the growing chorus of calls for reform of our \ncapital punishment system by criminal justice experts and respected \nopinion leaders nationwide. George Will wrote in a April 6th column \nthat ``skepticism is in order'' when it comes to capital punishment. \nAnother conservative columnist, Bruce Fein, wrote in The Washington \nTimes on April 25th:\n\n       A decent respect for life . . . demands scrupulous concern \n     for the reliability of verdicts in capital punishment trials. \n     Otherwise, the death penalty game is not worth the gamble of \n     executing the innocent--a shameful stain on any system of \n     justice--and life sentences (perhaps in solitary confinement) \n     should be the maximum.\n\n       Mr. Fein writes as one who served as a senior Justice \n     Department official in the Reagan Administration.\n  More recently, on May 11th, the Constitution Project at Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center established a blue-ribbon National Committee to \nPrevent Wrongful Executions, comprised of supporters and opponents of \nthe death penalty, Democrats and Republicans, including six former \nState and Federal judges, a former U.S. Attorney, two former State \nAttorneys General, and a former Director of the FBI. According to its \nmission statement, this Committee is ``united in [its] profound concern \nthat, in recent years, and around the country, procedural safeguards \nand other assurances of fundamental fairness in the administration of \ncapital punishment have been significantly diminished.'' Many of the \nconcerns that the Committee has raised are addressed in the legislation \nthat Senator Smith and I are introducing today.\n\n  Just yesterday, the editors of The Washington Times noted that ``the \nincreased use of DNA analysis has in fact revealed some serious flaws \nin the way the justice system exacts the supreme penalty,'' and \nsuccinctly expressed the common sense view of nine out of ten Americans \nand the basic point that underlies our legislation: ``Surely no one \ncould reasonably object to making sure we execute only the guilty.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Times editorial be \nincluded in the Record at this point, together with the articles by \nGeorge Will and Bruce Fein, and editorials dated February 19 and 28 \nfrom the New York Times and The Washington Post, both praising the \nInnocence Protection Act.\n  As I describe some of the major reforms proposed by our legislation, \nI ask you to consider these issues from the perspective of a capital \njuror, an ordinary citizen who is asked by his government to do one of \nthe toughest things a citizen can do: sit in judgment on another \nperson's life. You would not want to make the wrong decision. You would \nwant the process to work so that you could make the right decision.\n  We need to enact real reforms to combat the very real risk in America \ntoday that an innocent person is being executed. I will now describe \nsome of the major reforms proposed by our legislation.\n  More than any other development, improvements in DNA testing have \nprovided the critical evidence to exonerate innocent people. In the \nlast decade, scores of wrongfully convicted people have been released \nfrom prison--including many from death row--after DNA testing proved \nthey could not have committed the crime for which they were convicted. \nIn some cases the same DNA testing that vindicated the innocent helped \ncatch the guilty.\n  As I already mentioned, 92 percent of Americans agree that we need to \nmake DNA testing available in every appropriate case. But this \nlegislation is not about public opinion polls--it is about saving \ninnocent lives.\n  A few months ago, I met Kirk Bloodsworth, a former Marine who was \nconvicted and sentenced to death in Maryland for a crime that he did \nnot commit. Nine years later, DNA testing conclusively established his \ninnocence.\n  On the same day, I met Clyde Charles. He spent 9 years pleading with \nthe State of Louisiana for the DNA testing that eventually exonerated \nhim. He missed the childhood of his daughter, he contracted diabetes \nand tuberculosis while in prison, and both of his parents died before \nhis release.\n  Just last Wednesday, the Governor of Texas pardoned A.B. Butler, who \nserved 17 years of a 99-year sentence for a sexual assault that he did \nnot commit before he was finally cleared by DNA testing. Butler spent \n10 years trying to have DNA testing done in his case.\n  One day later, the Governor of Virginia ordered new DNA testing for \nEarl Washington, a retarded man convicted of a rape-murder in 1982.\n  There are still significant numbers of convicted men and women in \nprisons throughout the country whose trials preceded modern DNA \ntesting. If history is any guide, then some of these individuals are \ninnocent of any crime.\n  If DNA testing can help establish innocence, there is no reason to \ndeny testing, and every reason to grant it. This is not about guilty \npeople trying to get off on legal technicalities. This is about \ninnocent people trying to prove their innocence--and being thwarted by \nlegal technicalities. Our bill will allow retroactive tests for people \ntried before DNA technology was available to them, and eliminate the \nprocedural bars that may prevent the introduction of new, exculpatory \nDNA evidence. Our bill will also ensure that inmates are notified \nbefore a State destroys a rape kit or other biological evidence that \nmay, through DNA testing, prove that an inmate was wrongfully \nconvicted.\n  What possible reason could there be to deny people access to the \nevidence--often the only evidence--that could prove their innocence? \nNow that we have DNA fingerprinting that can prove a person's \ninnocence, why should we as a society be willfully blind to the truth?\n  The sole argument I have heard advanced against the Leahy-Smith \nproposal is that it is somehow overly broad. As best I can understand \nthis objection, the point seems to be that in\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nsome cases, DNA evidence will only confirm the jury's guilty verdict. \nThat is the point that Virginia prosecutors have advanced in opposing \nDNA testing for death row inmate Derek Barnabei. But as the Washington \nPost pointed out in a March 20th editorial about the Barnabei case, the \npossibility that DNA testing will confirm an inmate's guilt is no \nreason to deny testing:\n\n       It is hard to see why a state, before putting someone to \n     death, would be unwilling to demonstrate a jury verdict's \n     consistency with all of the evidence. Indeed, this is \n     precisely the type of case in which the state should have no \n     choice. Under [the Innocence Protection Act], states would be \n     obligated in such circumstances to allow post-conviction DNA \n     testing. Such a law would not merely offer a layer of \n     protection to innocent people but would increase public \n     confidence in the convictions of guilty people.\n\n  I am grateful for the Post's endorsement.\n  As the Post has pointed out, this is a common sense reform. As \nopinion polls have shown, the idea of ensuring DNA testing is available \nin appropriate cases enjoys the support of the vast majority of \nAmericans. And as the recent cases that I have discussed make clear, \nthis is a matter of national urgency. I hope we can move forward \nexpeditiously.\n  Post-conviction DNA testing is an essential safeguard that can save \ninnocent lives when the trial process has failed to uncover the truth. \nAs the Governor of New York has recognized, DNA testing also serves as \na window into the systemic flaws of our capital punishment apparatus. \nIn May, Governor Pataki proposed the creation of a panel to investigate \nthe facts behind DNA exonerations and to determine what went wrong.\n  When DNA uncovers one miscarriage of justice after another, it is \nneither just nor sensible to stop at making post-conviction DNA testing \nmore available. It is unjust because innocent people should not have to \nwait for years after trial to be exonerated and freed. It is not \nsensible because society should not have to wait for years to know the \ntruth. When dozens of innocent people are being sentenced to death, and \ndozens of guilty people are working free because the State has \nconvicted the wrong person, we must ask ourselves what went wrong in \nthe trial process, and we must take what steps we can to make sure it \ndoes not happen again.\n  There is a recurring theme in wrongful conviction cases--incompetent \nand grossly underpaid defense counsel. That theme is well illustrated \nby the case of Federico Macias. He spent nine years on Texas's death \nrow and came within two days of execution because his trial lawyer did \nalmost nothing to prepare for trial. No doubt, being paid less than $12 \nan hour was a disincentive for the lawyer to conduct a more thorough \ninvestigation.\n  This lawyer failed to call available witnesses who could have refuted \nthe State's case, and based his trial decisions on a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of Texas law. The lawyer also admitted he did no \ninvestigation at all for the sentencing phase. His only preparation was \nto speak to his client and his client's wife during the lunch break of \nthe sentencing proceeding.\n  Macias was eventually cleared of all charges and released from \nprison, thanks to volunteer work by a Washington lawyer who intervened \njust before the scheduled execution. Here is what the Federal Court of \nAppeals had to say when it overturned Macias's conviction:\n\n       We are left with the firm conviction that Macias was denied \n     his constitutional right to adequate counsel in a capital \n     case in which actual innocence was a close question. The \n     state paid defense counsel $11.84 per hour. Unfortunately, \n     the justice system got only what it paid for.\n\n  Federico Macias's case was not unique. In the Texas criminal justice \nsystem, there is a whole category of capital cases known as the \nsleeping lawyer cases, to which the majority of the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals has responded with apathy. This attitude was \nchillingly conveyed by one Texas judge who reasoned that, while the \nConstitution requires a defendant to be represented by a lawyer, it \n``doesn't say the lawyer has to be awake.''\n  But this is not just a Texas problem, this is a nationwide problem. \nIn case after case across the country, capital defendants have found \ntheir lives placed in the hands of lawyers who are hopelessly \nincompetent--lawyers who were drunk during the trial; lawyers who never \nbothered to investigate the case or even meet with their client before \ntrial; and lawyers who were suspended or disbarred.\n  Oklahoma spent all of $3,200 on the defense of Ronald Keith \nWilliamson; it got what it paid for when Williamson's lawyer failed to \ninvestigate and present to the jury a simple fact--the fact that \nanother man had confessed to the murder. Both Williamson and his \ncodefendant were eventually cleared of any crime.\n  In Illinois, Dennis Williams was defended by a lawyer who was \nsimultaneously defending himself in disbarment proceedings. Williams \nwas eventually exonerated in 1996, after 18 years on death row, with \nthe help of three journalism students from Northwestern University.\n  That is not how the American adversarial system of criminal justice \nis meant to work. Americans on trial for their lives should not be \ncondemned to rely on sleeping lawyers, drunk lawyers, disbarred \nlawyers, or lawyers who do not have the resources to do the job. In our \nsociety, lawyers and journalists both serve important fact-finding \nfunctions. But, as one of the Northwestern University journalism \nstudents so aptly said after proving the innocence of yet another death \nrow inmate, Anthony Porter, ``Twenty-one-year-olds are not supposed to \nbe responsible for finding the innocent people on death row.''\n  The need for competent and adequately funded lawyers to make our \nadversarial system work is not a novel insight, and the lack of such \nlawyers and funding is not a novel discovery. In 1991, Retired Chief \nJustice Harold Clarke of Georgia told the Georgia State Bar that:\n\n       Providing lawyers for poor people accused of crimes is a \n     state obligation. The Constitution teaches us that. But more \n     important, common sense and human decency tell us that. Yet \n     we haven't listened to those voices.\n\n  In repeated resolutions dating back to the 1980s, the Conference of \nChief Justices has urged States to do more to ensure that capital \ndefendants are provided quality representation. In 1995, for example, \nthe Chief Justices resolved that each State should ``establish \nstandards and a process that will assure the timely appointment of \ncompetent counsel, with adequate resources, to represent defendants in \ncapital cases at each stage of such proceedings.''\n  As we enter the 21st century, a few States have heeded this advice. \nBut many are still not listening to the voices of the people who know \nfirst hand what a mockery incompetent and underfunded defense lawyers \ncan make of our criminal justice system. I have described two cases, \nfrom Texas and Oklahoma, in which the State grossly underfunded \nappointed counsel and got what it paid for. There are many more \nexamples, including an Alabama case within the past year in which the \ncourt, after a full trial, limited the fee for investigating and \ndefending against a charge of capital murder to about $4,000. After \npaying his investigator and paralegal, the lawyer pocketed $1,212, \nwhich worked out to $5.05 an hour--less than the minimum wage.\n\n  We should not sit back and rely on 21-year-old journalism students to \nsave innocent people from execution. And a quarter of a century of \nexperience with the death penalty since the Supreme Court restored it \nin 1976 teaches us that we cannot sit back and rely on the States to \nprovide adequate counsel to those whom they seek to execute.\n  We in Congress can never guarantee that the innocent will not be \nconvicted. But we have a responsibility, at a minimum, to ensure that \nwhen people in this country are on trial for their lives, they will be \ndefended by lawyers who meet reasonable minimum standards of competence \nand who have sufficient funds to investigate the facts and prepare \nthoroughly for trial. That goal can be achieved by cooperation between \nthe States and the Federal Government whereby we give the States money \nto fund their criminal justice systems conditioned on their meeting a \nfloor of minimum standards, and leave the States free to improve on \nthose standards if they are so inclined. That is what our bill seeks to \nachieve.\n  What do we owe to the innocent people who are able to win their \nrelease\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nfrom prison? How do we compensate them for all the years they spent \nbehind bars, sometimes on death row, for all the lost wages, for all \nthe pain and suffering. In most cases, there is no compensation, or at \nleast not much. Federal law provides a miserly $5,000 in cases of \nunjust imprisonment, regardless of the time served. In the case of \nClyde Charles, who spent 18 years in Louisiana's Angola prison, that \nwould come out to about 75 cents a day. Is that what society owes to \nClyde Charles, for the walls placed between him and his family for 18 \nyears, for missing his daughter's childhood, and for the diabetes and \ntuberculosis he contracted in prison? Does that seem about right--75 \ncents a day?\n  How about nothing at all? In 36 States, people who have been unjustly \nconvicted and incarcerated for crimes they did not commit are barred \nfrom recovering any damages against the State. Louisiana, which \ndestroyed the life of Clyde Charles, has no compensation statute. The \nStates that have compensation statutes generally put a cap on payments, \nalthough none sets the cap as low as the current Federal cap of $5,000.\n  Let us step back and put this situation in perspective. A few years \nago, a Maryland jury found that three young men had been falsely \nimprisoned by a security guard at an Eddie Bauer clothing store. The \nguard detained these men for about 10 minutes on suspicion of \nshoplifting, and forced one of them to remove his shirt. How much did \nthe jury award for those 10 minutes of false imprisonment? $1 million.\n  Now compare what happened to Walter McMillian. In 1986, in a small \ntown in Alabama, an 18-year-old white woman was shot to death. Walter \nMcMillian was a black man who lived in the next town. From the day of \nhis arrest, McMillian was placed on death row. No physical evidence \nlinked him to the crime, and several people testified at the trial that \nhe could not have committed the murder because he was with them all \nday. All three witnesses who connected McMillian with the murder later \nrecanted their testimony. The one supposed ``eyewitness'' said that \nprosecutors had pressured him to implicate McMillian in the crime.\n  The jury in the trial recommended a life sentence, but the judge \noverruled this recommendation and sentenced McMillian to death. His \ncase went through four rounds of appeal, all of which were denied. New \nattorneys, not paid by the State of Alabama, voluntarily took over the \ncase and eventually found that the prosecutors had illegally withheld \nexculpatory evidence. A story about the case appeared on 60 Minutes in \nNovember 1992. Finally, the State agreed to investigate its earlier \nhandling of the case and admitted that a grave mistake had been made. \nMcMillian was freed into the welcoming arms of his family and friends \non March 3, 1993.\n  Despite many years of litigation, McMillian has never been given any \nrecompense for the years he was unjustly held on death row. His \nattorney has taken the issue of just compensation all the way to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, but to no avail.\n  Let us take another example in another State. In Oklahoma, 4 inmates \nhave been exonerated by DNA testing over the past few years. When you \nadd it up, they spent about 40 years in prison. Two of them were on \ndeath row. One came within 5 days of execution. None has received \ncompensation--not a dime.\n  Putting one's life back together after such an experience is \ndifficult enough, even with financial support. Without such support, a \nwrongly convicted person might never be able to establish roots that \nwould allow him to contribute to society.\n  We need to do more to help repair the lives that are shattered by \nwrongful convictions. The Innocence Protection Act does this by raising \nthe Federal cap on compensation, and by pushing the States to provide \nmeaningful compensation to any person who is unjustly convicted and \nsentenced to death.\n  Money damages will never compensate for the mental anguish of being \nfalsely convicted, for the lost years, or for the day-to-day brutality \nand deprivations of prison. But we must do what we can. Society owes a \nmoral debt to the wrongfully imprisoned; that debt should be paid.\n  Finally, we as a Nation need to go back to first principles when it \ncomes to deciding who is eligible for the death penalty. The United \nStates stands alongside Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as \nthe only nations still executing people for crimes committed as \njuveniles. Is this the company that we want to keep?\n  The execution of juvenile offenders is also barred by several major \nhuman rights treaties, including the U.N. Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights--perhaps the most \nimportant human rights documents in the world today. As a leader in the \nhuman rights community, it would be fitting if the United States agreed \nto respect the precepts of international humans rights law and comply \nwith the terms of these treaties.\n  This country should also stop executing the mentally retarded. People \nwith mental retardation have a diminished capacity to understand right \nfrom wrong. They are more prone to confess to crimes they did not \ncommit simply to please their interrogators, and they are often unable \nto assist their lawyer in preparing a defense. Executing them is wrong; \nit is immoral. In addition, the execution of the mentally retarded, \nlike the execution of juvenile offenders, severely damages U.S. \nstanding in the international community.\n  Today, 13 States with capital punishment forbid the execution of \ndefendants with mental retardation. The State Senator who sponsored the \nNebraska bill in 1998 later said that it should not have been necessary \nbecause ``no civilized, mature society would ever entertain the \npossibility of executing anybody who was mentally retarded.''\n  The legislation that I introduce today proposes that the United \nStates Congress speak as the conscience of the Nation in condemning the \ncontinued execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded.\n  There can be no longer be any question that our capital punishment \nsystem is in crisis. The Innocence Protection Act is the absolute \nminimum we must do to prevent and catch these mistakes and to restore \nthe public's confidence in our criminal justice system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a summary of the bill, and \nadditional material be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing \n     (referred to in this section as ``DNA testing'') has emerged \n     as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n     criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene.\n       (2) Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, \n     in some cases, conclusively establish the guilt or innocence \n     of a criminal defendant. In other cases, DNA testing may not \n     conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have \n     significant probative value to a finder of fact.\n       (3) While DNA testing is increasingly commonplace in \n     pretrial investigations today, it was not widely available in \n     cases tried prior to 1994. Moreover, new forensic DNA testing \n     procedures have made it possible to get results from minute \n     samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain \n     more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of \n     forensic DNA testing could produce. Consequently, in some \n     cases convicted inmates have been exonerated by new DNA tests \n     after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results.\n       (4) Since DNA testing is often feasible on relevant \n     biological material that is decades old, it can, in some \n     circumstances, prove that a conviction that predated the \n     development of DNA testing was based upon incorrect factual \n     findings. Uniquely, DNA evidence showing innocence, produced \n     decades after a conviction, provides a more reliable basis \n     for establishing a correct verdict than any evidence \n     proffered at the original trial. DNA testing, therefore, can \n     and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of \n     innocent men and women.\n       (5) In the past decade, there have been more than 65 post-\n     conviction exonerations in the United States and Canada based \n     upon DNA testing. At least 8 individuals sentenced to death \n     have been exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing, \n     some of whom came within days of being executed.\n       (6) The 2 States that have established statutory processes \n     for post-conviction DNA testing, Illinois and New York, have \n     the most post-conviction DNA exonerations, 14 and 7, \n     respectively.\n       (7) The advent of DNA testing raises serious concerns \n     regarding the prevalence of wrongful convictions, especially \n     wrongful convictions arising out of mistaken eyewitness \n     identification testimony. According to a 1996 Department of \n     Justice study entitled ``Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by \n     Science: Case Studies of Post-Conviction DNA Exonerations'', \n     in approximately 20 to 30 percent of the cases referred for \n     DNA testing, the results excluded the primary suspect. \n     Without DNA testing, many of these individuals might have \n     been wrongfully convicted.\n       (8) Laws in more than 30 States require that a motion for a \n     new trial based on newly discovered evidence of innocence be \n     filed within 6 months or less. These laws are premised on the \n     belief--inapplicable to DNA testing--that evidence becomes \n     less reliable over time. Such time limits have been used to \n     deny inmates access to DNA testing, even when guilt or \n     innocence could be conclusively established by such testing. \n     For example, in Dedge v. Florida, 723 So.2d 322 (Fla. Dist. \n     Ct. App. 1998), the court without opinion affirmed the denial \n     of a motion to release trial evidence for the purpose of DNA \n     testing. The trial court denied the motion as procedurally \n     barred under the 2-year limitation on claims of newly \n     discovered evidence established by the State of Florida, \n     which has since adopted a 6-month limitation on such claims.\n       (9) Even when DNA testing has been done and has \n     persuasively demonstrated the actual innocence of an inmate, \n     States have sometimes relied on time limits and other \n     procedural barriers to deny release.\n       (10) The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, \n     a Federal panel established by the Department of Justice and \n     comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific \n     experts, has issued a report entitled ``Recommendations For \n     Handling Post-Conviction DNA Applications'' that urges post-\n     conviction DNA testing in 2 carefully defined categories of \n     cases, notwithstanding procedural rules that could be invoked \n     to preclude such testing, and notwithstanding the inability \n     of the inmate to pay for the testing.\n       (11) The number of cases in which post-conviction DNA \n     testing is appropriate is relatively small and will decrease \n     as pretrial testing becomes more common and accessible.\n       (12) The cost of DNA testing has also decreased in recent \n     years. The typical case, involving the analysis of 8 samples, \n     currently costs between $2,400 and $5,000, depending upon \n     jurisdictional differences in personnel costs.\n       (13) In 1994, Congress authorized funding to improve the \n     quality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement \n     identification purposes. Since then, States have been awarded \n     over $50,000,000 in DNA-related grants.\n       (14) Although the Supreme Court has never announced a \n     standard for addressing constitutional claims of innocence, \n     in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), a majority of the \n     Court expressed the view that, ``a truly persuasive \n     demonstration of `actual innocence' '' made after trial would \n     render imposition of punishment by a State unconstitutional.\n       (15) If biological material is not subjected to DNA testing \n     in appropriate cases, there is a significant risk that \n     persuasive evidence of innocence will not be detected and, \n     accordingly, that innocent persons will be unconstitutionally \n     incarcerated or executed.\n       (16) To prevent violations of the Constitution of the \n     United States that the Supreme Court anticipated in Herrera \n     v. Collins, it is necessary and proper to enact national \n     legislation that ensures that the Federal Government and the \n     States will permit DNA testing in appropriate cases.\n       (17) There is also a compelling need to ensure the \n     preservation of biological material for post-conviction DNA \n     testing. Since 1992, the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. \n     Cardozo School of Law has received thousands of letters from \n     inmates who claim that DNA testing could prove them innocent. \n     In over 70 percent of those cases in which DNA testing could \n     have been dispositive of guilt or innocence if the biological \n     material were available, the material had been destroyed or \n     lost. In two-thirds of the cases in which the evidence was \n     found, and DNA testing conducted, the results have exonerated \n     the inmate.\n       (18) In at least 14 cases, post-conviction DNA testing that \n     has exonerated a wrongly convicted person has also provided \n     evidence leading to the apprehension of the actual \n     perpetrator, thereby enhancing public safety. This would not \n     have been possible if the biological evidence had been \n     destroyed.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) substantially implement the Recommendations of the \n     National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence in the \n     Federal criminal justice system, by ensuring the availability \n     of DNA testing in appropriate cases;\n       (2) prevent the imposition of unconstitutional punishments \n     through the exercise of power granted by clause 1 of section \n     8 and clause 2 of section 9 of article I of the Constitution \n     of the United States and section 5 of the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States; and\n       (3) ensure that wrongfully convicted persons have an \n     opportunity to establish their innocence through DNA testing, \n     by requiring the preservation of DNA evidence for a limited \n     period.\n\n     SEC. 102.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE EXECUTION OF \n                   JUVENILE OFFENDERS AND THE MENTALLY RETARDED.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the death penalty is \n     disproportionate and offends contemporary standards of \n     decency when applied to a person who is mentally retarded or \n     who had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of the \n     offense.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Innocence Protection Act of 2000--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 is a comprehensive \n     package of criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing the \n     risk that innocent persons may be executed. Most urgently, \n     the bill would (1) ensure that convicted offenders are \n     afforded an opportunity to prove their innocence through DNA \n     testing; (2) help States to provide competent legal services \n     at every stage of a death penalty prosecution; (3) enable \n     those who can prove their innocence to recover some measure \n     of compensation for their unjust incarceration; and (4) \n     provide the public with more reliable and detailed \n     information regarding the administration of the nation's \n     capital punishment laws.\n\n\n   title I--exonerating the innocent through federal post-conviction \n                                 review\n\n       Sec. 101. Findings and purposes. Legislative findings and \n     purposes in support of this title.\n       Sec. 102. DNA testing in Federal criminal justice system. \n     Establishes rules and procedures governing applications for \n     DNA testing by convicted offenders in the Federal system. An \n     applicant must allege that evidence to be tested (1) is \n     related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in \n     the applicant's conviction; (2) is in the government's actual \n     or constructive possession; and (3) was not previously \n     subjected to DNA testing, or to the form of DNA testing now \n     requested. The court may, in its discretion, appoint counsel \n     for an indigent applicant.\n       Because access to DNA testing is of no value unless \n     evidence containing DNA has been preserved, this section also \n     prohibits the government from destroying any biological \n     material in a criminal case while any person remains \n     incarcerated in connection with that case, unless such person \n     is notified of the government's intent to destroy the \n     material, and afforded at least 90 days to request DNA \n     testing under this title.\n       Sec. 103. DNA testing in State criminal justice system. \n     Conditions receipt of Federal grants for DNA-related programs \n     on an assurance that the State will adopt adequate procedures \n     for preserving biological material and making DNA testing \n     available to its inmates.\n       Sec. 104. Prohibition pursuant to section 5 of the 14th \n     amendment. Prohibits States from (1) denying requests for DNA \n     testing that could produce new exculpatory evidence or (2) \n     denying inmates a meaningful opportunity to prove their \n     innocence using the results of DNA testing. Creates an \n     authority to sue for declaratory or injunctive relief to \n     enforce these prohibitions.\n\n\n      title ii--ensuring competent legal services in capital cases\n\n       Sec. 201. Amendments to Byrne grant programs. Conditions \n     Federal funding under the Byrne grant programs--when such \n     funding equals or exceeds an amount that is $50 million \n     greater than the amount appropriated for such programs in FY \n     2000--on certification that the State has established and \n     maintains an ``effective system'' for providing competent \n     legal services to indigent defendants at every stage of death \n     penalty prosecution, from pre-trial proceedings through post-\n     conviction review. The Director of the Administrative Office \n     of the United States Courts is charged with specifying the \n     elements of an ``effective system,'' which must include a \n     centralized and independent authority for appointing \n     attorneys in capital cases, and adequate compensation and \n     reimbursement of such attorneys.\n       Sec. 202. Effect on procedural default rules. Provides that \n     certain procedural barriers to Federal habeas corpus review \n     shall not apply if the State failed to provide the petitioner \n     with adequate legal services.\n       Sec. 203. Capital representation grants. Amends the \n     Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A, to make more \n     Federal funding available to public agencies and private non-\n     profit organizations for purposes of enhancing\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n     the availability and competence of counsel in capital cases, \n     encouraging the continuity of representation in such cases, \n     decreasing the cost of providing qualified death penalty \n     counsel, and increasing the efficiency with which capital \n     cases are resolved.\n\n\n             title iii--compensating the unjustly condemned\n\n       Sec. 301. Increased compensation in Federal cases. Raises \n     the total amount of damages that may be awarded against the \n     United States in cases of unjust imprisonment from $5,000 to \n     $50,000 a year in a non-death penalty case, or $100,000 a \n     year in a death penalty case. Identifies factors for court to \n     consider in assessing damages.\n       Sec. 302. Compensation in State death cases. Encourages \n     States to permit any person who was unjustly convicted and \n     sentenced to death to be awarded reasonable damages, upon \n     substantial proof of innocence and formal exoneration, by \n     adding a new condition for Federal funding to assist in \n     construction of correctional facility projects.\n\n\n                        title iv--miscellaneous\n\n       Sec. 401. Accommodation of State interests in Federal \n     death-penalty prosecutions. Protects the interests of States \n     (including the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, \n     territory or possession of the United States) by limiting the \n     Federal government's authority to seek the death penalty in \n     States that do not permit the imposition of such penalty. \n     Department of Justice guidelines provide that in cases of \n     concurrent jurisdiction, ``a Federal indictment for an \n     offense subject to the death penalty will be obtained only \n     when the Federal interest in the prosecution is more \n     substantial than the interests of the State or local \n     authorities.'' Section 401 builds on that principle by \n     requiring the Attorney General or her designee to certify \n     that (1) the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to \n     assume jurisdiction over the defendant; (2) the State has \n     requested that the Federal government assume jurisdiction; or \n     (3) the offense charged involves genocide; terrorism; use of \n     chemical weapons or weapons of mass-destruction; destruction \n     of aircraft, trains, or other instrumentalities or facilities \n     of interstate commerce; hostage taking; torture; espionage; \n     treason; the killing of certain high public officials; or \n     murder by a Federal prisoner.\n       Sec. 402. Alternative of life imprisonment without \n     possibility of release. Provides juries in Federal death \n     penalty prosecutions brought under the drug kingpin statute, \n     21 U.S.C. Sec. 848(l), the option of recommending life \n     imprisonment without possibility of release. This amendment \n     brings the drug kingpin statute into conformity with the more \n     recently-enacted death penalty procedures in title 18, which \n     govern most Federal death penalty prosecutions. See 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3594.\n       Sec. 403. Right to an informed jury. Conditions Federal \n     truth-in-sentencing grants upon certification that, in any \n     capital case in which the jury has a role in determining the \n     defendant's sentence, the defendant has the right to have the \n     jury informed of all statutorily-authorized sentencing \n     options in the particular case, including applicable parole \n     eligibility rules and terms. The purpose is to give full \n     effect to the due process principles underlying the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154 \n     (1994), which held that a defendant who has been convicted of \n     a capital offense is entitled to an instruction informing the \n     sentencing jury that he is ineligible for parole under State \n     law.\n       Sec. 404. Annual reports. Directs the Justice Department to \n     prepare an annual report regarding the administration of the \n     nation's capital punishment laws. The report must be \n     submitted to Congress, distributed to the press and posted on \n     the Internet.\n       Sec. 405. Discretionary appellate review.

George \n     W. Bush did what had to be done. Where there is no shadow of \n     a doubt, the death penalty can sometimes be the right course \n     of action. Yet, where doubt, any doubt, remains, the \n     consequences are awesome. In the case of Ricky Nolan McGinn, \n     who was sentenced to death for raping and murdering his 13-\n     year-old stepdaughter in 1993, there seems to be some \n     uncertainty, in which case every means should be used to \n     establish the truth. When you take a man's life, you take \n     everything he's got. There simply is no way to make up for a \n     mistake made in the execution chamber.\n       Mr. Bush cannot be accused of being soft on criminals. \n     During his five and a half years in office, Mr. Bush has \n     presided over more executions than any other governor in the \n     country: 131, all told. Most famously, Mr. Bush refused to \n     reduce the sentence of Karla Faye Tucker in 1998. She had \n     been convicted of the particularly horrible execution-style \n     murder of two persons during a gas station robbery, and while \n     in prison had become a born-again Christian. Though religious \n     leaders such as Pat Robertson pleaded for her life, Mr. Bush \n     allowed the execution to go forward. The fact that he has \n     chosen to grant a 30-day reprieve in this one case can hardly \n     be said to indicate a change of heart on the death penalty.\n       Nevertheless, in the partisan heat of a presidential \n     election year, Mr. Bush has been accused of playing politics \n     with the death penalty. If this is the case, he is doing so \n     on the side of giving someone on death row a final chance. \n     This contrasts with Gov. Bill Clinton's decision to proceed \n     with the execution of a severely retarded Arkansas man during \n     the 1992 presidential election campaign, which was meant to \n     establish his tough-on-crime credentials.\n       But beyond the question of politics, there's science. Mr. \n     Bush is catching a nationwide movement, based on advances \n     that are making DNA testing increasingly sophisticated. The \n     increased use of DNA analysis has in fact revealed serious \n     flaws in the way the justice system exacts the supreme \n     penalty. The trend towards state moratoria on executions has \n     been led by Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican. In \n     Illinois, during the course of the 23 years since the death \n     penalty was reinstated, a dozen persons have been put to \n     death--but 13 have been cleared of capital murder charges \n     through DNA testing after having been sentenced to death. \n     This is a stunning and sobering fact. Unless Illinois is \n     vastly different from the rest of the United States, that \n     statistic ought to produce second thoughts for everyone. (One \n     of those second thoughts might be that for every innocent man \n     executed, a guilty man is still out there, unpunished.)\n       We do not suggest here that the United States should stop \n     punishing the guilty to the fullest extent of the law, even \n     if that means death. However, if this country is to have the \n     death penalty, we must be as certain as is humanly possible \n     that executions are restricted to the guilty. States should \n     be encouraged to make sure that is the case. Even if 66 \n     percent of Americans support the death penalty, it is no \n     argument to say (as some conservatives have done) that the \n     death of an innocent person here or there is not enough to \n     reconsider what we are doing. This argument has been put \n     forward by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Some have even argued that \n     this may be the price of the death penalty's deterrent \n     effect; Rep. Bill McCollum, Florida Republican, suggested as \n     much in an article for the Atlantic Monthly last year.\n       Perhaps the most cogent argument against the death penalty \n     is that it degrades the sensibilities of otherwise good and \n     reasonable men and women, who have come to believe in it so \n     obsessively that they would impose it on the innocent if that \n     is the only way to keep the death penalty in the law.\n       During a moratorium, the state would keep its electricity \n     and gas bills paid and its stockpiles of potassium chloride \n     intact against the day when the moratorium ends and \n     executions resume--presumably following improvements in the \n     way convictions are produced. Surely no one could reasonably \n     object to making sure we execute only the guilty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 2000]\n\n                         Innocent On Death Row\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       ``Don't you worry about it,'' said the Oklahoma prosecutor \n     to the defense attorney. ``We're gonna needle your client. \n     You know, lethal injection, the needle. We're going to needle \n     Robert.''\n       Oklahoma almost did. Robert Miller spent nine years on \n     death row, during six of which the state had DNA test results \n     proving his sperm was not that of the man who raped and \n     killed the 92-year-old woman. The prosecutor said the tests \n     only proved that another man had been with Miller during the \n     crime. Finally, the weight of scientific evidence, wielded by \n     an implacable defense attorney, got Miller released and \n     another man indicted.\n       You could fill a book with such hair-curling true stories \n     of blighted lives and justice traduced. Three authors have \n     filled one. It should change the argument about capital \n     punishment and other aspects of the criminal justice system. \n     Conservatives, especially, should draw this lesson from the \n     book: Capital punishment, like the rest of the criminal \n     justice system, is a government program, so skepticism is in \n     order.\n       Horror, too, is a reasonable response to what Barry Scheck, \n     Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer demonstrate in ``Actual \n     Innocence: Five Days to Execution and Other Dispatches From \n     the Wrongly Convicted.'' You will not soon read a more \n     frightening book. It is a catalog of appalling miscarriages \n     of justice, some of them nearly lethal. Their cumulative \n     weight compels the conclusion that many innocent people are \n     in prison, and some innocent people have been executed.\n       Scheck and Neufeld (both members of O.J. Simpson's ``dream \n     team'' of defense attorneys) founded the pro-bono Innocence \n     Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York \n     to aid persons who convincingly claim to have been wrongly \n     convicted. Dwyer, winner of two Pulitzer Prizes,\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n     is a columnist for the New York Daily News. Their book is a \n     heartbreaking and infuriating compendium of stories of lives \n     ruined by:\n       Forensic fraud, such as that by the medical examiner who, \n     in one death report, included the weight of the gallbladder \n     and spleen of a man from whom both organs had been surgically \n     removed long ago.\n       Mistaken identifications by eyewitnesses or victims, which \n     contributed to 84 percent of the convictions overturned by \n     the Innocence Project's DNA exonerations.\n       Criminal investigations, especially of the most heinous \n     crimes, that become ``echo chambers'' in which, because of \n     the normal human craving for retribution, the perceptions of \n     prosecutors and jurors are shaped by what they want to be \n     true. (The authors cite evidence that most juries will \n     convict even when admissions have been repudiated by the \n     defendant and contradicted by physical evidence.)\n       The sinnister culture of jailhouse snitches, who earn \n     reduced sentences by fabricating ``admissions'' by fellow \n     inmates to unsolved crimes.\n       Incompetent defense representation, such as that by the \n     Kentucky attorney in a capital case who gave his business \n     address as Kelly's Keg tavern.\n       The list of ways the criminal justice system misfires could \n     be extended, but some numbers tell the most serious story: In \n     the 24 years since the resumption of executions under Supreme \n     Court guidelines, about 620 have occurred, but 87 condemned \n     persons--one for every seven executed--had their convictions \n     vacated by exonerating evidence. In eight of these cases, and \n     in many more exonerations not involving death row inmates, \n     the evidence was from DNA.\n       One inescapable inference from these numbers is that some \n     of the 620 persons executed were innocent. Which is why, \n     after the exoneration of 13 prisoners on Illinois' death row \n     since 1987, for reasons including exculpatory DNA evidence, \n     Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, has imposed a moratorium on \n     executions.\n       Scheck, Neufeld and Dwyer note that when a plane crashes, \n     an intensive investigation is undertaken to locate the cause \n     and prevent recurrences. Why is there no comparable urgency \n     about demonstrable, multiplying failures in the criminal \n     justice system? They recommend many reforms, especially \n     pertaining to the use of DNA and the prevention of forensic \n     incompetence and fraud. Sen. Patrick Leahy's Innocence \n     Protection Act would enable inmates to get DNA testing \n     pertinent to a conviction or death sentence, and ensure that \n     courts will hear resulting evidence.\n       The good news is that science can increasingly serve the \n     defense of innocence. But there is other news.\n       Two powerful arguments for capital punishment are that it \n     saves lives, if its deterrence effect is not vitiated by \n     sporadic implementation, and it heightens society's valuation \n     of life by expressing proportionate anger at the taking of \n     life. But that valuation is lowered by careless or corrupt \n     administration of capital punishment, which ``Actual \n     Innocence'' powerfully suggests is intolerably common.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 25, 2000]\n\n                    Death Edict For the Guilty Only\n\n                             (By Bruce Fein)\n\n       Can reasonable people dispute that the government should \n     confine the death penalty to persons guilty of the crime \n     charged? And can reasonable people deny that the climbing \n     number of exonerations of death row inmates on the ground of \n     actual innocence creates chilling worries on that scores?\n       Those questions make both urgent and compelling enactment \n     of the cool-headed bill (S. 2071) by Sen. Patrick Leahy, \n     Vermont Democrat, to upgrade the reliability of verdicts in \n     capital cases.\n       Manifold reasons justify the death penalty (which the U.S. \n     Supreme Court has restricted to crimes of homicide): \n     retribution against offenders whose killings are earmarked by \n     shocking and barbaric wickedness, something akin to the Adolf \n     Eichmann example; to control prison inmates already laboring \n     under life sentences with no parole possibilities; to deter \n     the murder of police or crime witnesses in the hope of \n     escaping punishment of a lesser crime; and encouraging guilty \n     pleas contingent on cooperation with prosecutors in murder \n     conspiracy cases in exchange for a non-capital sentence.\n       Whether death sentences in general deter crime is hotly \n     disputed. but if they do, their effects would not even begin \n     to dent the crime problem.\n       A decent respect for life also demands scrupulous concern \n     for the reliability of verdicts in capital punishment trials. \n     Otherwise, the death penalty game is not worth the gamble of \n     executing the innocent--a shameful stain on any system of \n     Justice--and life sentences (perhaps in solitary confinement) \n     without parole should be the maximum.\n       The Leahy bill laudably aims to preserve the death penalty \n     by slashing the prevailing and highly worrisome risk of \n     executing the innocent through greater DNA testing and \n     competent defense counsel.\n       Unzip you ears to these facts. Since the Supreme Court in \n     1976 affirmed the constitutionality of the death penalty for \n     heinous and aggravated murders, 610 death sentences have been \n     implemented. Concurrently, 85 death row prisoners have been \n     released not for technical procedural flukes but because of \n     exculpatory evidence establishing their innocence. In other \n     words, for every seven executions approximately one capital \n     sentence has been levied on an innocent defendant.\n       Moreover, the detections of these grim injustices has been \n     more haphazard than systematic. The case Randall Dale Adams \n     and Antony Porter are emblematic.\n       The former was released after attracting the attention of \n     cinematic genius, Earl Morris. His gripping movie, ``The Thin \n     Blue Line,'' discredited the prosecution's case to a \n     nationally awakened audience.\n       Mr. Porter had lived with the Sword of Damocles for 16 \n     years, and in 1998 his hourglass fell to 48 hours. He was \n     saved from wrongful execution by the plucky work of \n     Northwestern University undergraduate journalism students, \n     who proved Mr. Antony's innocence, a verdict that the \n     State of Illinois conceded.\n       Quirks and citizen altruism, however, are woefully \n     inadequate safeguards against executing the innocent. While \n     nothing in life is absolutely certain but death and taxes, \n     the Leahy bill would add two muscular measures to make the \n     truth-finding process in capital cases as reliable as is \n     reasonably feasible.\n       First, post-conviction DNA testing of biological material \n     would be available to an inmate through court order upon a \n     demonstration that the test could provide noncumulative \n     exculpatory evidence; that the material is actually or \n     constructively possessed by the government; and that no \n     previous DNA test had been conducted or that new DNA \n     techniques might reasonably yield more accurate and probative \n     evidence. Jurisdictions also would be directed to preserve \n     biological material gathered in the course of an \n     investigation during the period of the criminal's \n     incarceration for the purpose of possible DNA testing.\n       Of vastly greater importance to reliable death penalty \n     verdicts, however, is securing competent defense counsel in \n     lieu of incompetence or worse. The U.S. Supreme Court has \n     repeatedly celebrated the indispensability of reasonably \n     skilled lawyers to reliable verdicts. In the infamous \n     Scottsboro, Ala., criminal justice farce, Powell vs. Alabama \n     (1932), Justice George Sutherland, speaking for a unanimous \n     court, lectured: ``Left without the aid of counsel [the \n     accused] may be put on trial without a proper charge, and \n     convicted on incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to \n     the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill \n     and knowledge to prepare his defense, even though he has a \n     perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every \n     step of the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be \n     not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does \n     not know how to establish his innocence.''\n       Capital cases generally feature indigent defendants. And \n     their court-appointed lawyers are frequently deficient \n     because of austere rates of reimbursement or plain laziness.\n       For instance, the lawyer appointed to represent Ronald \n     Keith Williamson was uncurious about the fact that another \n     had confessed to the crime. He neglected to raise the \n     exculpatory confession at trial, Williamson was convicted, \n     and was later proven innocent through DNA testing after a \n     1997 federal appeals court decision overturned the trial \n     verdict because of inert or anemic lawyering.\n       The Leahy legislation would end this blight in death \n     penalty prosecutions by instructing the director of the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts to creating \n     a scheme for credentialing attorneys and providing reasonable \n     pay in capital prosecutions against indigent defendants.\n       Aren't executions too definitive to be left to chancy \n     discoveries of innocence? If the government does not want to \n     pay the price of turning square corners in capital cases, \n     shouldn't the prosecution accept a lesser maximum punishment?\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 2000]\n\n                         Innocent on Death Row\n\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has introduced a bill that seeks \n     to strengthen safeguards against wrongful executions. Those \n     who support capital punishment should be as determined as its \n     opponents to ensure that innocent people are not executed. By \n     that logic, this legislation should enjoy wide support.\n       The bill would require both state and federal courts to \n     permit post-conviction DNA testing in cases in which there is \n     a significant question of innocence. It also would encourage \n     states to retain biological evidence, thereby ensuring that \n     there is a material to test when innocence questions arise. \n     Perhaps more important, the bill would make federal criminal \n     justice funds to the states contingent on their improving \n     legal representation for the accused in all stages of death-\n     penalty litigation.\n       This is a critical reform, as the absence of competent \n     counsel is a pervasive theme in wrongful convictions. The \n     bill would raise the insultingly low limit for damages \n     against the federal government--$5,000 per year in jail--for \n     those wrongly convicted of federal crimes. And it would \n     encourage states to offer reasonable compensation as well.\n       These are common-sense improvements to the basic \n     infrastructure of the death penalty. For those who favor the \n     abolition of capital punishment, they may seem inadequate. \n     But by focusing only on protecting the innocent--not on a \n     broader agenda of halting all executions--Mr. Leahy places \n     the spotlight on what should be bedrock principle for all\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n     who believe in due process. To support these reforms, one \n     need only believe that people accused of capital crimes \n     should have reasonably able counsel and that--when \n     substantial questions arise about the rightness of their \n     convictions--they should have the ability to prove their \n     innocence.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 19, 2000]\n\n                     New Looks at the Death Penalty\n\n       America is at last beginning to grapple honestly with the \n     profound flaws of the death penalty system. Late last month \n     Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, became the first \n     governor in a death penalty state to declare a moratorium on \n     executions, citing well-founded concerns about his state's \n     ``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting \n     them on death row.'' That has now been followed by moves in \n     Congress and the executive branch to review death penalty \n     policies from a national perspective.\n       Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin has urged President \n     Clinton to suspend all federal executions pending a review of \n     death penalty procedures similar to the one Governor Ryan has \n     initiated in Illinois. Problems of inadequate legal \n     representation, lack of access to DNA testing, police \n     misconduct, racial bias and even simple errors are not unique \n     to Illinois, Mr. Feingold noted.\n       The Justice Department has also initiated its own review to \n     determine whether the federal death penalty system unfairly \n     discriminates against racial minorities. At his news \n     conference this week, Mr. Clinton praised the death penalty \n     moratorium in Illinois, but indicated he thought a federal \n     moratorium was unnecessary. Mr. Feingold has urged him to \n     reconsider. Given his lame-duck status, the president can \n     afford to call a halt without worrying about being falsely \n     labeled soft on crime. Moreover, the fact that a Republican \n     governor was first to announce a moratorium should minimize \n     any concern about Vice President Al Gore being so labeled.\n       Congress need not wait for the administration to act. Last \n     week Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, introduced \n     legislation to address ``the growing national crisis'' in how \n     capital punishment is administered. This promising measure, \n     the Innocence Protection Act of 2000, stops short of \n     abolishing the death penalty, the course we hope the nation \n     will eventually follow. But key provisions would lessen the \n     chance of unfairness and deadly error by making DNA testing \n     available to both state and federal inmates, and by setting \n     national standards to ensure that competent lawyers are \n     appointed for capital defendants.\n       Without such protections, there is a grave possibility of \n     judicial error. Nationally, 612 people have been executed \n     since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in \n     1976. During the same period, 81 people in 21 states have \n     been found innocent and released from death row--some within \n     hours of being executed. That suggests that many who were \n     executed might also have been innocent.\n       Neither the states nor the courts are providing adequate \n     protection against awful miscarriages of justice. In Texas, \n     the nation's leader in executions, courts have upheld death \n     sentences in cases where defense lawyers slept during big \n     portions of the trial. Lately, Congress and the Supreme Court \n     have exacerbated the danger of mistaken executions by \n     curtailing appeal and habeas corpus rights. They have also \n     ignored the festering problem of inadequate legal \n     representation that caused the American Bar Association to \n     call for a death penalty moratorium three years ago. Even \n     death penalty supporters have to be troubled by a system \n     shown to have a high risk of executing the innocent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2000]\n\n                        On Virginia's Death Row\n\n       Derek Barnabei evokes no sympathy. He is on death row in \n     Virginia for the rape and murder of his girlfriend, Sarah \n     Wisnosky, in 1993. The evidence of his guilt seems strong. \n     But that strong probability of guilt makes Virginia's \n     unwillingness to permit DNA testing of potentially key \n     evidence all the more puzzling. Mr. Barnabei has maintained \n     his innocence, and the case has a few troubling aspects. In \n     light of this, it only makes sense to test bloodstained \n     physical evidence retained but never tested by investigators. \n     Yet Virginia balks on the grounds that Mr. Barnabei's guilt \n     is so clear.\n       The likelihood is that the blood is Ms. Wisnosky's, which \n     would neither bolster nor undermine the jury's verdict in the \n     case. It also could be Mr. Barnabei's, which would reinforce \n     the integrity of the verdict. But the presence of someone \n     else's blood would make Mr. Barnabei's claims more credible.\n       It is hard to see why a state, before putting someone to \n     death, would be unwilling to demonstrate a jury verdict's \n     consistency with all of the evidence. Indeed, this is \n     precisely the type of case in which the state should have no \n     choice. Under a bill being pushed by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-\n     Vt.), states would be obligated in such circumstances to \n     allow post-conviction DNA testing. Such a law would not \n     merely offer a lawyer of protection to innocent people but \n     would increase public confidence in the convictions of guilty \n     people.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am a supporter of the death \npenalty. I believe there are some times when humankind can act in a \nmanner so odious so heinous, and so depraved that the right to life is \nforfeited. Notwithstanding this belief--indeed, because of this \nbelief--I rise today to talk about the importance of protecting \ninnocent people in this country from wrongful imprisonment and \nexecution. Today, Senator Leahy and I are introducing the Innocence \nProtection Act of 2000 that will use the technological advances of the \n21st century to ensure that justice is served swiftly and fairly.\n  It has been difficult to open a newspaper in recent months without \nfinding discussion of the death penalty and possible miscarriages of \njustice. You have almost certainly seen or heard reports of inmates \nbeing freed from death row based on results of new genetic tests that \nwere unavailable at the time of trial. There have been a number of \ncases where this has, in fact, occurred.\n  This is a cause for concern for a number of cases. First and \nforemost, of course, is the possibility that an innocent person could \nlose his or her life if wrongfully convicted. In such cases, this also \nleads to the double tragedy that the true guilty party remains free to \nroam the country in search of future victims. Clearly, capturing and \nconvicting the true perpetrator of a crime is in everyone's best \ninterests.\n  The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 would provide a national \nstandard for post-conviction DNA testing of inmates who believe they \nhave been wrongly incarcerated. Although many inmates were convicted \nbefore modern methods of genetic fingerprinting were available, not all \nstates routinely allow post-conviction DNA testing.\n  This does not make sense. If we are to have a system that is just, \ntransparent, and defensible, we must make absolutely certain that every \nperson who is behind bars deserves to be there. One of the best ways to \ndo this is to make the most advanced technology available for cases in \nwhich physical evidence could have an influence on the verdict.\n  Making DNA testing available will result in some convictions being \noverturned. In such cases, people who have been unjustly incarcerated \nmust be afforded fair compensation for the lost years of their lives. \nThe Leahy-Smith Innocence Protection Act of 2000 has a provision that \nwould do this. Sometimes a person who has been wrongly imprisoned is \nreleased from prison with bus fare and the clothes on his or her back. \nThis practice simply heaps one wrong upon another.\n  While officers of America's courts and law enforcement work extremely \nhard to ensure that the true perpetrators of heinous crimes are caught \nand convicted, there have been instances where defendants have been \nrepresented by overworked, underpaid, or even unqualified counsel, and \nthis situation cannot be tolerated in a system of criminal justice. The \nLeahy-Smith Innocence Protection Act of 2000 would ensure that \ndefendants who are put on trial for their lives receive competent legal \nrepresentation at every stage in their cases.\n  The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 will allow us, as a nation, to \ncontinue our confidence in the American judicial system and in the fair \nand just application of the death penalty. We must have confidence in \nthe integrity of justice, that it will both protect the innocent and \npunish the guilty. This legislation will not prevent true criminals \nfrom being executed; rather, it will increase support for the death \npenalty by providing added assurances that American justice is \nadministered fairly across the country.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whether \nyou support or oppose capital punishment, to join Senator Leahy and me \nin backing the Innocence Protection Act of 2000, which will put the \nfingerprint of the 21st century on our criminal justice system, \nensuring that innocent lives are not unjustly taken in this country.\n  Ms. COLLINS Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the \n``Innocence Protection Act.''\n  Since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976, 610 people \nhave been executed in our nation. In that same period of time, an \nastounding 87 people who were sentenced to die have been found innocent \nand released from death row. Each of these individuals has lived the \nKafkaesque nightmare of condemnation and imprisonment for crimes they \nhave not committed. It is\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\ndifficult to imagine the despair and betrayal these individuals must \nhave felt as they were accused, tried, convicted and sentenced, all the \ntime knowing they were not guilty. And during all those years they \nremained in prison, the real perpetrators remained at large.\n  I am an opponent of the death penalty, and I am proud to be from the \nState of Maine which outlawed the death penalty in 1887. The \nlegislation we introduce today is, however, not an anti-death penalty \nmeasure.\n  The legislation we introduce today simply requires logical safeguards \nto be put in place to prevent wrongful convictions. Its two most \nimportant provisions compel DNA testing where it can yield evidence of \ninnocence, and puts in place a new process to ensure defendants receive \ncompetent counsel in death penalty cases.\n  The ``Innocence Protection Act'' calls on the federal government and \nthe states to make DNA testing available in circumstances where it \ncould yield new evidence of innocence. The incidents in which DNA \ntesting has exonerated individuals are not isolated--64 people have \nbeen released from prison or death row due to DNA testing.\n  Linus Pauling once said that ``science is the search for truth.'' \nThrough DNA testing, science provides a tool that can uncover the \ntruth, and lend certainty to our moral obligation in a civilized \nsociety--proper administration of our criminal justice system.\n  The legislation we introduce today assists the wrongfully convicted, \nand will help prevent the miscarriages of justices that have seemed \nsadly common. It will also serve the interests of justice and protect \ncrime victims. Justice is never served until the true perpetrator of a \ncrime is identified, convicted and punished. We owe it to the victims \nand their families to pursue every avenue to find and hold accountable \nthe true criminals who have injured them.\n  Our American ideals and sense of justice simply cannot tolerate the \ncurrent risk for mistaken executions. The case of Mr. Anthony Porter \nshould shock the conscience of America. Mr. Porter spent over 16 years \non death row, and at one point he was only two days short of receiving \na lethal injection, having been convicted of two murders. A determined \ngroup of journalism students investigated his case and uncovered \nevidence that exonerated Mr. Porter. It was only through their efforts \nthat the identity of the real murderer was determined, a review of the \ncase compelled, and Mr. Porter ultimately freed. The peculiar good \nfortune that lead to the release of Mr. Porter undeniably highlights a \nweakness in our system of justice that cries out for remedy.\n  Nothing that we can do here today can restore those years to Mr. \nPorter, or others who have been wrongly convicted, but we can demand \nsafeguards be put in place to protect the innocent from conviction, and \nprotect society from real criminals who may remain loose on our \nstreets. Regardless of one's views about the death penalty, I hope we \nall can agree to needed safeguards to help ensure that justice is \nserved.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, as a cosponsor of the Innocence \nProtection Act of 2000. I commend him for his leadership on this \nimportant legislation. The insight and unique experience that he brings \nto this issue as a former federal prosecutor is invaluable. I have no \ndoubt that because of his leadership and diligence, Americans have \nrecently become more aware of the important role that the certainty of \nscience can have in our criminal justice system. Improvements in DNA \ntesting have allowed us to determine with greater accuracy whether \ncertain offenders committed the crime that sent them to prison, \nincluding, very importantly, of course, those who have been condemned \nto death row.\n  Since the 1970s, 87 people sentenced to die were later proven \ninnocent. Some of those innocent death row inmates were able to prove \ntheir innocence based on modern DNA testing of biological evidence. \nBut, Mr. President, this is not just about ensuring that we not condemn \nthe innocent. DNA testing can also ensure that the guilty person not go \nfree. DNA testing can be a tool for the prosecution to determine \nwhether they have the right person.\n  Over the last several months, I have spoken often on the floor about \nthe serious flaws in the administration of capital punishment across \nthe nation. I strongly support Senator Leahy's bill. It is a much over-\ndue package of reforms that goes after some of the worst failings in \nour nation's administration of capital punishment--those that are \nunfair, unjust and plain just un-American.\n  Very simply, Senator Leahy's bill can help save lives. His bill would \nmake it less likely for an innocent man or woman to be sent to death \nrow, where biological evidence is central to the issue of guilt or \ninnocence. The bill also would make it more likely that a poor person \nreceive adequate defense representation and less likely that a poor \nperson gets stuck with a lawyer that sleeps through trial. Yesterday, I \nspoke on the floor about specific examples of such cases of egregious \nfailings of defense counsel.\n  We must ensure the utmost fairness in the administration of this \nultimate punishment. I hope our colleagues--both those who support the \ndeath penalty in principle and those who oppose it--will join together \nin fixing this broken system and restoring fairness and justice. All \nAmericans demand and deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very significant that this important \nbill now has bipartisan support. I want to thank and commend my \ncolleagues, Senators Gordon Smith, Susan Collins and James Jeffords, \nfor recognizing that flaws exist in our system of justice and \nacknowledging that something has to be done about it. I hope this is a \nsign that we can work together with the very real goal of passing this \nbill this year. Until we do so, the lives of innocent people literally \nhang in the balance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2691. A bill to provide further protections for the watershed of \nthe Little Sandy River as part of the Bull Run Watershed Management \nUnit, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n               The Little Sandy Watershed Protection Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Little Sandy \nWatershed Protection Act.\n  I promised Oregonians that my first legislative business when \nCongress reconvened after the Memorial Day Recess would be the \nintroduction of this bill.\n  Therefore, joined by my friends Senator Gordon Smith and Congressman \nEarl Blumenauer, I introduce this legislation to make sure that \nPortland families can go to their kitchen faucets and get a glass of \nsafe and pure drinking water today, tomorrow, and on, into the 21st \ncentury.\n  The Bull Run has been the primary source of water for Portland since \n1895. The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, Mount Hood National \nForest, was protected by Congressional action in 1904, 1977 and then \nagain, most recently, in 1996 (P.L. 95-200, 16, U.S.C. 482b note) \nbecause it was recognized as Portland's primary municipal water supply. \nIt still is.\n  Today I propose to finish the job of the Oregon Resources and \nConservation Act of 1996. That law, which I worked on with Senator Mark \nHatfield, finally provided full protection to the Bull Run watershed, \nbut only provided temporary protection for the adjacent Little Sandy \nwatershed. I promised in 1996 that I would return to finish the job of \nprotecting Portland's drinking water supply and intend to continue to \npush this legislation until the job is complete.\n  The bill I introduce today expands the Bull Run Watershed Management \nUnit boundary from approximately 95,382 acres to approximately 98,272 \nacres by adding the southern portion of the Little Sandy River \nwatershed, an increase of approximately 2,890 acres.\n  The protection this bill offers will not only assure clean drinking \nwater, but also increase the potential for fish recovery. Reclaiming \nsuitable habitat for our region's threatened fish populations must be \nan all-out effort.\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nThrough the cooperation of Portland General Electric and the City of \nPortland, the Little Sandy can be an important part of that effort.\n  My belief is that the children of the 21st century deserve water that \nis as safe and pure as any that the Oregon pioneers found in the 19th \ncentury. This legislation will go a long way toward bringing about that \nvision.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation aimed at protecting the \nLittle Sandy Watershed for future generations. The Little Sandy lies \nadjacent to the Bull Run Watershed, which is the primary municipal \nwater supply for the City of Portland, Oregon. The water that filters \nthrough these forests and mountainsides to the east of Portland is of \nthe highest quality in the nation and does not require artificial \nfiltration or treatment.\n  The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit was established by \ncongressional action in 1977, creating a management partnership between \nthe USDA Forest Service and the City of Portland for the review of \nwater quality and quantity. Additional protection was given to the Bull \nRun by the Northwest Forest Plan in 1993, restricting all timber \nharvests in sensitive areas. Neither of these actions, however, \nextended a satisfactory level of protection to the nearby Little Sandy \nWatershed. Population growth and heightened water quality expectations \nhave brought the preservation of the Little Sandy Watershed to the \nforefront of the public's interest in recent years.\n  The legislation that I have cosponsored would expand the boundary of \nthe Bull Run Watershed Management Unit to include the southern portion \nof the Little Sandy. This would add nearly 3,000 acres to the \nManagement Unit, including a number of acres currently managed by the \nBureau of Land Management (BLM). I am aware that questions have just \narisen as to whether some of this acreage is currently managed by O & C \nlands. If so, there are concerns that O & C land would be devalued by a \nchange in management designation. If this is the case, as the bill \nmoves through the legislative process, I will seek the redesignation of \nother lands outside the preserve in order to maintain the wholeness of \nO & C land and the timber base.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2692. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove safety of imported products, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nimported products safety improvement and disease prevention act of 2000\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \n``Imported Products Safety Improvement and Disease Prevention Act of \n2000.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this important legislation \nwhich guarantees the improved safety of imported foods, and I have high \nhopes that we will act on it this year.\n\n  The health of Americans is not something to take chances with. It is \nimportant that we make food safety a top priority. Every person should \nhave the confidence that their food is fit to eat. We should be \nconfident that imported food is as safe as food produced in this \ncountry. Cars can't be imported unless they meet U.S. safety \nrequirements. Prescription drugs can't be imported unless they meet FDA \nstandards. You shouldn't be able to import food that isn't up to U.S. \nstandards, either.\n  We import increasing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, \nseafood, and many other foods. In the past seven years, the amount of \nfood imported into the U.S. has more than doubled. Out of all the \nproduce we eat, 40% of it is imported. Our food supply has gone global, \nso we need to have global food safety.\n  The impact of unsafe food is staggering. There have been several \nfrightening examples of food poisoning incidents in the U.S. When \nMichigan schoolchildren were contaminated with Hepatitis A from \nimported strawberries in 1997, Americans were put on alert. Thousands \nof cases of cyclospora infection from imported raspberries--resulting \nin severe, prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, vomiting, chills and \nfatigue were also reported that year. Imported cantaloupe eaten in \nMaryland sickened 25 people. As much as $663 million was spent on food \nborne illness in Maryland alone. Overall, as many as 33 million people \nper year become ill and over 9000 die as a result of food borne \nillness. It is our children and our seniors who suffer the most. Most \nof the food-related deaths occur in these two populations.\n  These incidents have scared us and have jump-started the efforts to \ndo more to protect our nation's food supply. Now, I believe in free \ntrade, but I also believe in fair trade. FDA's current system of \ntesting import samples at ports of entry does not protect Americans. It \nis ineffective and resource-intensive. Less than 2 percent of imported \nfood is being inspected under the current system. At the same time, the \nquantity of the imported foods continues to increase.\n  What this law does is simple: It improves food safety and aims at \npreventing food borne illness of all imported foods regulated by the \nFDA. This bill takes a long overdue, big first step.\n  First, it requires that FDA make equivalence determinations on \nimported food. This was developed with the FDA by Senator Kennedy and \nmyself in consultation with the consumer groups.\n  Today, FDA has no authority to protect Americans against imported \nfood that is unsafe until it is too late. According to the GAO, the FDA \nlacks the authority to require that food coming into the U.S. is \nproduced, prepared, packed or held under conditions that provide the \nsame level of food safety protection as those in the U.S. This means \nthat currently, food offered for import to the U.S., can be imported \nunder any conditions, even if those conditions are unsanitary. The \nImported Products Safety Improvement and Disease Prevention Act of 2000 \nwill allow FDA to look at the production at its source. This means that \nFDA will be able to take preventive measures. FDA will be able to be \nproactive, rather than just reactive.\n  That means that when you pack your childrens' lunches for school or \nsit down at the dinner table, you can rest assured that your food will \nbe safe. Whether your strawberries were grown in a foreign country or \non the Eastern Shore, in Maryland, those strawberries will be held to \nthe same standard. You won't have to worry or wonder where your food is \ncoming from. You won't have to worry that your children or families are \ngoing to get sick. You will know that the food coming into this country \nwill be subject to equivalent standards.\n  Second, this bill contains strong enforcement measures. Last year, \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, under the leadership of \nSenator Sue Collins, held numerous hearings on the safety of imported \nfood. These enforcement measures are largely a product of those facts \nuncovered during those hearings.\n  Finally, this bill covers emergency situations by allowing FDA to ban \nimported food that has been connected to outbreaks of food borne \nillness. When our children, parents and communities are getting \nseriously sick, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can \nimmediately issue an emergency ban. We don't have to wait till someone \nelse gets seriously sick or dies. We no longer have to go through the \ncurrent bureaucratic mechanism that is inefficient and resource \nintensive. We can stop the food today, to protect our citizens.\n  My goal is to strengthen the food supply, whatever the source of the \nfood may be. This bill won't create trade barriers. It just calls for \nfree trade of safe food. It calls for international concern and \nconsensus on guaranteeing standards for public health.\n  This bill is important because it will save lives and makes for a \nsafer world. Everyone should have security in knowing that the food \nthey eat is fit to eat. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis \nto enact this legislation. I pledge my commitment to fight for ways to \nmake America's food supply safer. This bill is an important step in \nthat direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be added to the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\n                                S. 2692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am reintroducing this important bill because of the \nseriousness of the problem it addresses and to spur this Congress to \ntake action. I commend Senator Mikulski for her continued leadership on \nthis legislation to close the critical gaps in our imported food safety \nlaws.\n  Citizens deserve to know that the foods they eat are safe and \nwholesome, regardless of their source. The United States has one of the \nsafest food supplies in the world. Yet, every year, millions of \nAmericans become sick, and thousands die, from eating contaminated \nfood. Food-borne illnesses cause billions of dollars a year in medical \ncosts and lost productivity. Often, the source of the problem is \nimported food.\n  The number of reports in the press of illnesses caused by eating \ncontaminated imported foods has grown steadily over the past few years.\n  For example, in 1997, school children in five states contracted \nHepatitis A from frozen strawberries served in the school cafeterias. \nFecal contamination is a potential source of Hepatitis A, and the \nstrawberries the children ate came from a farm in Mexico where workers \nhad little access to sanitary facilities.\n  Earlier this year, cases of typhoid fever in Florida were linked to a \nfrozen tropical fruit product from Guatemala. Again, poor sanitary \nconditions appear to be at the root of the problem.\n  Gastrointestinal illness has been linked to soft cheeses from Europe. \nBacterial food poisoning has been attributed to canned mushrooms from \nthe Far East.\n  The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and an increase \nin the number of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, make \nmicrobial contamination of food a major public health challenge.\n  Ensuring the safety of imported food is a huge task. Americans now \nenjoy a wide variety of foods from around the world and have access to \nfresh fruits and vegetables year round. In 1997, the Food Safety \nInspection Service of the Department of Agriculture handled 118,000 \nentries of imported meat and poultry. The FDA handled far more--2.7 \nmillion entries of other imported food. Current FDA procedures and \nresources allowed for less than two percent of those 2.7 million \nimports to be physically inspected. Clearly, we need to do better.\n  The FDA lacks sufficient authority to prevent contaminated food \nimports from reaching our shores. The agency has no legal authority to \nrequire that food imported into the United States has been prepared, \npacked and stored under conditions that provide the same level of \npublic health protection as similar food produced in the United States. \nUnder current procedures, the FDA takes random samples of imports as \nthey arrive at the border. The imports often continue on their way to \nstores in all parts of the country while testing is being done, and it \nis often\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\ndifficult to recall the food if a problem is found. Unscrupulous \nimporters make the most of the loopholes in the law, including \nsubstituting cargo, falsifying laboratory results, and attempting to \nbring a refused shipment in again, at a later date or at a different \nport.\n  The legislation we are reintroducing today will give the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the additional authority needed to assure \nthat food imports are as safe as food grown and prepared in this \ncountry.\n  It will give the FDA greater authority to deal with outbreaks of \nfood-borne illness and to bar further imports of dangerous foods until \nimprovements at the source can guarantee the safety of future \nshipments. This authority covers foods that have repeatedly been \nassociated with food-borne disease, have repeatedly been found to be \nadulterated, or have been linked to a catastrophic outbreak of food-\nborne illness.\n  The legislation will also close loopholes in the law and give the FDA \nbetter tools to deal with unscrupulous importers.\n  In addition, the legislation will authorize the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to target resources toward enhanced surveillance \nand prevention activities to deal with food-borne illnesses, including \nnew diagnostic tests, better training of health professionals, and \nincreased public awareness about food safety.\n  Too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of food-borne \nillness. The measure we are proposing is designed to reduce that risk \nas much as possible, both immediately and for the long term. We know \nthat there are powerful special interests that put profits ahead of \nsafety. But Americans need and deserve laws that better protect their \nfood supply. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that it is enacted as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Res. 317\n\n       Whereas General George C. Marshall, President Roosevelt's \n     chief of staff, appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower, to \n     the war plans division of the United States Army in December \n     1941 and commissioned General Eisenhower to design an \n     operational scheme for Allied victory in World War II;\n       Whereas in January 1943, the plan was adopted and given the \n     code name Operation ``Overlord'';\n       Whereas the June 6, 1944, invasion of Europe, commonly \n     known as ``the D-Day invasion'', was the largest single \n     assault in the most massive military conflict in history;\n       Whereas participants in that invasion included 156,000 \n     British, Canadian, and United States servicemembers and \n     approximately 30,000 vehicles and 600,000 tons of supplies, \n     and those servicemembers, backed by paratroopers and bombers, \n     stormed a 50-mile stretch of beach in Normandy, France;\n       Whereas on June 6, 1944, D-Day, and in the seven months \n     that followed, approximately 3,500,000 British, Canadian, and \n     United States servicemembers embarked for Europe from \n     Southampton, England;\n       Whereas approximately 31,000 United States servicemembers \n     and more than 3,000 vehicles embarked for the D-Day invasion \n     on 208 vessels at Weymouth and Portland, England;\n       Whereas between 15,000 and 20,000 tons of bombs were \n     dropped in support of the D-Day invasion in the 24 hours \n     between the night of June 5 and the night of June 6, 1944;\n       Whereas landing forces in the D-Day invasion were compelled \n     to cross more than 200 yards of treacherous beach blanketed \n     by mines, heavy machine-gun fire, and rifle fire;\n       Whereas the D-Day invasion was supported by more than \n     13,000 fighter, bomber, and transport aircraft, against which \n     the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, was able to deploy fewer \n     than 400 aircraft of all types;\n       Whereas by June 11, 1944, the invasion force had \n     established a bridgehead 50 miles wide and 12 miles deep, \n     into which were landed 326,547 men, 54,186 vehicles, and \n     104,428 tons of supplies;\n       Whereas of the 156,000 British, Canadian, and United States \n     servicemembers who took part in the initial D-Day invasion \n     landings, 10,000 were casualties on the first day of the \n     invasion;\n       Whereas total United States casualties on D-Day numbered \n     6,303, including 2,499 casualties among members of two \n     airborne divisions participating in the invasion;\n       Whereas those casualties included 1,465 killed in action, \n     3,184 wounded in action, 1,928 missing in action, and 26 \n     prisoners of war;\n       Whereas the success of the D-Day invasion was responsible \n     for starting the liberation of occupied Europe from Nazi \n     Germany and marked the beginning of the end of World War II; \n     and\n       Whereas of the approximately living 25,000,000 United \n     States veterans, approximately 1,500 die each day of whom \n     two-thirds are veterans of World War II: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate to \n     congratulate and thank the members of the United States Armed \n     Forces who participated in the June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion \n     of Europe for forever changing the course of history by \n     helping bring an end to World War II.\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nthousands of America, British, Canadian, and French veterans of the \ngreatest amphibious invasion in military history. On June 6, 1944, the \nD-Day Allied Expeditionary Force included 150,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, \n5,300 ships and landing craft, 12,000 airplanes, and 20,000 airborne \ntroops. Ultimately, their task was to establish a western foothold on \nthe European continent, and commence an overwhelming thrust against \nFrance's Nazi occupiers. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was convinced \nthat launching Operation Overlord would hasten the end to World War II, \nas he stated on D-Day morning to his American troops, ``In company with \nour brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring \nabout the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of \nNazi tyranny over oppressed peoples in Europe, and security for \nourselves in a free world.''\n  The invasion of Normandy far surpassed its goals, accomplishing four \nmonumental tasks: it initiated the liberation of France and \ndismantlement of the Nazi Third Reich, established a critical milestone \nin military strategic history, inaugurated an era of American \npreeminence, and, ultimately, made the world safe for democracy. But \nvictory could not be achieved without any cost. By the end of D-Day, \nU.S. forces, including two deployed airborne divisions, suffered 6,603 \ncasualties, with 1,465 killed, 3,184 wounded, and 1,928 missing in \naction. To these men who paid the ultimate price for our freedom, the \nworld owes an incalculable measure of gratitude. Today, the people of \nthe United States salute their memory, and continue honoring the \ncourageous service of other D-Day veterans, like the senior senator \nfrom South Carolina, who risked similar fates in southern France.\n  Now, 56 years after the first Higgins Landing Craft beached on the \nNormandy shores, our country's first National D-Day Museum will open in \nmy hometown of New Orleans. Built in the heart of Downtown, this \ninstitution will not only commemorate an awesome military success, but \nexhibit the unified vision of a nation's political, strategic, and \nindustrial leaders. From the formulation of Operation Overlord to \ninnovations in amphibious technology, every aspect of war-planning and \nimplementation will be on display; contributors to our victory from \nvarious sectors of society will be studied--the decision-makers, the \nwar tacticians, the equipment manufacturers, and the Americans in \nuniform. Esteemed political scientist, Stephen Ambrose has dedicated \nthis museum to the American Spirit, the teamwork, optimism, courage and \nsacrifice of the men and women who won World War II. As they embarked \non their ``Great Crusade,'' Eisenhower reminded America's soldiers that \n``the eyes of the world are upon you.'' Well, today I say to the \nveterans of Normandy that the hopes and prayers of liberty-loving \npeople everywhere continue to march with you. Forever embodied in the \nNational D-Day Museum, we have distinguished one of America's finest \ngenerations with an indelible place in our country's history, \nsustaining a promising legacy for our country's future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4692-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4692-S4694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 318--HONORING THE 129 SAILORS AND CIVILIANS LOST \n ABOARD THE U.S.S. ``THRESHER'' (SSN 593) ON APRIL 10, 1963; EXTENDING \n THE GRATITUDE OF THE NATION FOR THEIR LAST, FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION; \nAND ACKNOWLEDGING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NAVAL SUBMARINE SERVICE AND \n       THE PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD TO THE DEFENSE OF THE NATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Warner, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \nKennedy) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\n                              S.

Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 129 composed of 16 \n     officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;\n       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of the \n     naval submarine service, military and civilian, in the \n     protection of the Nation;\n       Whereas at approximately 7:45 a.m. on April 10, 1963, at a \n     location near 41.46 degrees North latitude and 65.03 degrees \n     West longitude, the U.S.S.

Thresher.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that \nrecognizes the contributions and sacrifices to our nation's defense \nprovided by the men and women of the United States Naval Submarine \nService and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, and to \nspecifically recognize that ``last full measure of devotion'' shown by \nthe crew of the USS Thresher on April 10, 1963.\n  As you are aware, this year the U.S. Navy is celebrating the 100th \nyear of service to our country by the Naval Submarine Service. From the \nacquisition of its first submarine, the USS Holland, in April 1900 to \nthe present day, the U.S. Naval Submarine Service has served America \nbravely, gallantly, and steadfastly. We are all aware of the debt we \nowe the Submarine Service for their role in World War II when, in the \nimmediate dark days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the ``Silent \nService'' took the war to the enemy. Although they lost 52 submarines \nand more than 3,500 submariners, they accounted for 55 percent of all \nenemy ships lost and significantly contributed to the final victory in \nthe Pacific. Since that time the Submarine Service has continued to \nprotect the nation through its deterrence patrols and many other \nmissions. In just the past few years the ability of our submarines to \nprovide a stealthy, land-attack capability in support of operations in \nthe Persian Gulf and in Kosovo has proven once again that their \nadaptability and capability are vital to the security interests of this \nnation.\n  A significant supporter of the Submarine Service for the past 100 \nyears and this nation for the past 200 years has been the Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Beginning in 1800, the shipyard \nprovided the U.S. Navy with ``ships of the line'' and during the War of \n1812 it became a Navy command. But it is the shipyard's contributions \nto the Submarine Service that I want to talk about here today.\n  In April 1917, the first submarine built in a government shipyard, \nthe L-8, was launched at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and in the \nensuing 52 years, the shipyard launched another 133 submarines, \nincluding a record 31 in 1944 alone. In November 1971, the last \nsubmarine built in a government yard, the USS Sand Lance, was launched \nat Portsmouth before they took on their new role to overhaul, repair, \nand refuel nuclear submarines. But during their 52 years of building \nsubmarines Portsmouth delivered many firsts to the Submarine Service: \nFirst U.S. submarine built with an all-welded steel hull--the Snapper; \nfirst U.S. submarine built of high tensile steel--the Balao; first \nsnorkel installed in a U.S. submarine--the Irex; first truly \nsubmersible hull developed using dirigible form, a breakthrough in \nhydrodynamic design--the Albacore; and the first nuclear powered \nsubmarine built in a government shipyard--the Swordfish.\n  But the shipyard and the Submarine Service could not have \naccomplished these important contributions to our nation's security \nwithout the unfailing valor and unselfish service of the submarine \ncrews and shipyard workers that put them to sea. Perhaps there is no \ngreater example of our American virtue of standing together for the \ncommon defense than the story of the USS Thresher, a nuclear submarine \nlaunched at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960.\n  When she was launched the Thresher represented a new class of \nsubmarine for the Navy. The Thresher-class was designed to be the \nworld's first modern, quiet, deep-diving fast-attack submarine. Some of \nher innovative features included machinery rafts for sound silencing, a \nlarge bow-mounted sonar, torpedo tubes amidships and a hydrodynamically \nstreamlined hull. After two and a half years of trials, evaluations, \nand the development of new fast-attack tactics, the Thresher returned \nto her home yard. On April 9, 1963, she got underway for a series of \ndeep-diving trials to be held about 220 nautical miles east of Cape \nCod. On board was a crew of 129 made up of sailors, officers, \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard workers and contractors. Shortly after \nbeginning her dive, something went horribly wrong and the Thresher and \nall 129 souls on board were lost at sea.\n  But another example of our American character is the drive to create \nsuccess from adversity and from the loss of the Thresher came two \ninitiatives that have permitted the Submarine Service to gain \nunchallenged preeminence in undersea warfare.\n  First was the implementation of the SubSafe program. This standard \ndictates that every submarine, every hull integrity-related system and \nevery pressure-related part within those systems must be 100 percent \ncertified safe for use aboard the submarine. And since that time, no \nsubmarine has been lost because of a similar casualty.\n  Second, a recommendation by the Deep Submergence Systems Review \nGroup, which looked into the cause of the tragedy, was that a \ncurriculum be established to train engineers to design and develop \nsystems specifically for use in the ocean environment--the discipline \nof ocean engineering. Since that time ocean engineering programs have \nbeen established in Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Texas, \nVirginia, Hawaii and the Naval Academy. From these programs have come \nthe engineers who have designed and developed the Los Angeles, the \nOhio, the Seawolf and the Virgnia-classes of submarines. Engineers like \nretired Admiral Millard Firebaugh, a former ship superintendent at the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard, who earned a doctorate of science degree in \nOcean Engineering from MIT and went on to become the program manager \nfor the design and construction of the Seawolf.\n  We in this nation owe a great debt to the 129 crewmen of the USS \nThresher, to all who have served aboard submarines over the past 100 \nyears and to the civilians who have accepted the risk and sacrified \nalongside their submarine shipmates. When I learned that there had \nnever been a resolution passed in this body acknowledging the loss of \nthis gallant crew and expressing our gratitude for their sacrifice, I \nbelieved that in this 100th year of the Submarine Service and the 200th \nyear of their home yard, the Portsmouth\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nNaval Shipyard, it was entirely appropriate and timely of us to do so.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that an enrolled copy be \ntransmitted to and accepted by the commanding officer of Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard on behalf of the families and shipmates of the crew of \nthe USS Thresher, the crews of the Naval Submarine Service and the \nworkers of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4694-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 120--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n    REGARDING THE NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE PENALTIES ON \n                      PERPETRATORS OF HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 120\n\n       Whereas diversity and tolerance are essential principles of \n     an open and free society;\n       Whereas all people deserve to be safe within their \n     communities, free to live, work, and worship without fear of \n     violence and bigotry;\n       Whereas crimes motivated by hatred against persons because \n     of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability undermine the fundamental \n     values of our Nation;\n       Whereas hate crimes tear at the fabric of American society, \n     leave scars on victims and their families, and weaken our \n     sense of community and purpose; and\n       Whereas individuals who commit crimes based on hate and \n     bigotry must be held responsible for their actions and must \n     be stopped from spreading violence: : Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that Congress--\n       (1) needs to pass legislation that amends the Federal \n     criminal code to set penalties for persons who commit acts of \n     violence against other persons because of the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of any person;\n       (2) condemns the culture of hate and the hate groups that \n     foster such violent acts;\n       (3) commends the communities throughout our Nation that are \n     united in condemning such acts of hate in their \n     neighborhoods;\n       (4) commends the efforts of Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement officials; and\n       (5) reaffirms its commitment to a society that fully \n     respects and protects all people, regardless of race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a concurrent resolution \nurging Congress to enact meaningful hate crimes legislation. Today \nmarks the sad second anniversary of the killing of James Byrd, Jr., the \nvictim of a vicious hate crime in Texas. Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old \nAfrican-American man, was dragged for approximately two miles while \nchained to the back of a pickup truck by his white assailants. As a \nresult of this brutal attack, Mr. Byrd's head and right arm were \nsevered from his body.\n  Reflecting on this terrible act of deep hatred against the dignity of \na human being should strengthen our resolve to combat acts of bias in \nour society. We will not get to where we need to go in this country \nuntil we have eradicated the discriminatory hatred that lies in some \npeople's hearts. While we cannot legislate away the prejudice in a \nperson's heart or soul, we can certainly punish those who act upon \ntheir feelings of hatred and commit acts of utter brutality. Hate \ncrimes tear at the very fabric of American society and often scar, not \njust the victims, but the families and communities involved as well. \nThose who harbor hatred must know that America will punish them for \ntheir actions and that we will not tolerate their acts of inhumanity.\n  Our Nation is composed of a great diversity that contributes to our \neconomic and educational preeminence in the world. We will never \nachieve all that our Nation is capable of accomplishing unless we are \nunited in addressing the scourge of prejudice and hate crimes in our \nsociety. The Congress can lead on this issue by enacting comprehensive \nlegislation, such as the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, that expands \nexisting hate crimes law. Not only should those who are victimized by \nhate crimes because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability \nbe afforded access to appropriate justice, but we as a Nation should \nalso pursue swift and serious punishment against violent hate-mongers \nto send a message that we will not tolerate their hate.\n  Today, I join with colleagues from both the Senate and the House to \nintroduce this concurrent resolution and spur action to combat the \ncrimes motivated by bias which continue to shock the conscience of our \ncivil society. Federal hate crimes legislation provides another avenue \nfor prosecuting the perpetrators of violent hate, and I look forward to \nenacting a comprehensive Federal hate crimes statute. I am confident \nthat our abhorrence of hate crimes will move the Congress to action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/07/senate-section/article/S4694-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4694-S4716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                JOHNSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3191\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Wellstone) proposed \nan amendment to the bill (S. 2549) to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 2001 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \nfor military construction, and for defense activities of the Department \nof Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for \nthe Armed Forces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 241, strike line 17 and all that follows through \n     page 243, line 19, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 703. HEALTH CARE FOR MILITARY RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of \n     the uniformed services who entered service prior to June 7, \n     1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by \n     reason of a service-connected disability.\n       (2) Recruiters for the uniformed services are agents of the \n     United States government and employed recruiting tactics that \n     allowed members who entered the uniformed services prior to \n     June 7, 1956, to believe they would be entitled to fully-paid \n     lifetime health care upon retirement.\n       (3) Statutes enacted in 1956 entitled those who entered \n     service on or after June 7, 1956, and retired after serving a \n     minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected \n     disability, to medical and dental care in any facility of the \n     uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and \n     facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental \n     staff.\n       (4) After 4 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 \n     and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment \n     facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a \n     military medical treatment facility is virtually nonexistent \n     for many military retirees.\n       (5) The military health care benefit of ``space available'' \n     services and Medicare is no longer a fair and equitable \n     benefit as compared to benefits for other retired Federal \n     employees.\n       (6) The failure to provide adequate health care upon \n     retirement is preventing the retired members of the uniformed \n     services from recommending, without reservation, that young \n     men and women make a career of any military service.\n       (7) The United States should establish health care that is \n     fully paid by the sponsoring agency under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program for members who entered \n     active duty on or prior to June 7, 1956, and who subsequently \n     earned retirement.\n       (8) The United States should reestablish adequate health \n     care for all retired members of the uniformed services that \n     is at least equivalent to that provided to other retired \n     Federal employees by extending to such retired members of the \n     uniformed services the option of coverage under the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits program, the Civilian Health and \n     Medical Program of the uniformed services, or the TRICARE \n     Program.\n       (b) Coverage of Military Retirees Under FEHBP.--\n       (1) Earned coverage for certain retirees and dependents.--\n     Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in section 8905, by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(h) For purposes of this section, the term `employee' \n     includes a retired member of the uniformed services (as \n     defined in section 101(a)(5) of title 10) who began service \n     before June 7, 1956.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered \n     immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept \n     battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive \n     relationships;\n       (2) providing battered immigrant women and children who \n     were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection \n     against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders \n     against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law \n     enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against \n     their abusers and the abusers of their children without \n     fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or \n     threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit \n     under the abuser's control; and\n       (3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women \n     and children who do not have access to the immigration \n     protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which \n     means that their abusers are virtually immune from \n     prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result \n     of action by their abusers and the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter \n     how compelling their case under existing law.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons \n     who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against \n     immigrant women and children; and\n       (2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring \n     in family and intimate relationships that are covered in \n     State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and \n     family law statutes.\n\n     SEC. 503.

It also gives law \n     enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of \n     cooperating individuals during investigations, prosecutions, \n     and civil law enforcement proceedings. By providing temporary \n     legal status to aliens who have been severely victimized by \n     criminal or other unlawful activity, it also reflects the \n     humanitarian interests of the United States.\n       (C) Finally, this section gives the Attorney General \n     discretion to convert such nonimmigrants to permanent \n     resident status when it is justified on humanitarian grounds \n     or is otherwise in the public interest.\n       (b) Establishment of Humanitarian/Material Witness \n     Nonimmigrant Classification.--Section 101(a)(15) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (R);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (S) \n     and inserting ``;

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and \n     Drug Administration on the basis of testing and other \n     information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are \n     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective \n     alternative to brand-name pharmaceuticals.\n       (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly \n     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing \n     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-\n     name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of pharmaceuticals \n     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n       (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent \n     and 60 percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, \n     resulting in an estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on \n     each prescription filled.\n       (4) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both \n     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share \n     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name \n     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, \n     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United \n     States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health \n     care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by \n     encouraging the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric \n     drugs under those programs whenever feasible; and\n       (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals \n     by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where \n     appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is \n     the therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and \n     by affording national uniformity to that determination.\n\n          TITLE XLI--ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF GENERIC DRUGS\n\n     SEC. 4101.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE USE OF CHILDREN AS \n                   SOLDIERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in the year 2000 approximately 300,000 individuals \n     under the age of 18 are participating in armed conflict in \n     more than 30 countries worldwide;\n       (2) many of these children are forcibly conscripted through \n     kidnapping or coercion, while others join military units due \n     to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, \n     or for their own personal safety;\n       (3) many military commanders frequently force child \n     soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or \n     torture against their enemies, including against other \n     children;\n       (4) many military commanders separate children from their \n     families in order to foster dependence on military units and \n     leaders, leaving children vulnerable to manipulation, deep \n     traumatization, and in need of psychological counseling and \n     rehabilitation;\n       (5) child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and \n     risk physical injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, \n     malnutrition, deformed backs and shoulders from carrying \n     overweight loads, and respiratory and skin infections;\n       (6) many young female soldiers face the additional \n     psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n     being enslaved for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n     forced to endure severe social stigma should they return \n     home;\n       (7) children in northern Uganda continue to be kidnapped by \n     the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which is supported and \n     funded by the Government of Sudan and which has committed and \n     continues to commit gross human rights violations in Uganda;\n       (8) children in Sri Lanka have been forcibly recruited by \n     the opposition Tamil Tigers movement and forced to kill or be \n     killed in the armed conflict in that country;\n       (9) an estimated 7,000 child soldiers have been involved in \n     the conflict in Sierra Leone, some as young as age 10, with \n     many being forced to commit extrajudicial executions, \n     torture, rape, and amputations for the rebel Revolutionary \n     United Front;\n       (10) on January 21, 2000, in Geneva, a United Nations \n     Working Group, including representatives from more than 80 \n     governments including the United States, reached consensus on \n     an optional protocol on the use of child soldiers;\n       (11) this optional protocol will raise the international \n     minimum age for conscription and direct participation in \n     armed conflict to age eighteen, prohibit the recruitment and \n     use in armed conflict of persons under the age of eighteen by \n     non-governmental armed forces, encourage governments to raise \n     the minimum legal age for voluntary recruits above the \n     current standard of 15 and, commits governments to support \n     the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers, and \n     when possible, to allocate resources to this purpose;\n       (12) on October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary General \n     Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United Nations \n     peacekeeping personnel that are made available by member \n     nations of the United Nations;\n       (13) United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace-\n     keeping, Bernard Miyet, announced in the Fourth Committee of \n     the General Assembly that contributing governments of member \n     nations were asked not to send civilian police and military \n     observers under the age of 25, and that troops in national \n     contingents should preferably be at least 21 years of age but \n     in no case should they be younger than 18 years of age;\n       (14) on August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning \n     the use of children in armed conflicts;\n       (15) in addressing the Security Council, the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary General for Children and \n     Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global \n     three-pronged approach to combat the use of children in armed \n     conflict, first to raise the age limit for recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict from the present age of 15 to \n     the age of 18, second, to increase international pressure on \n     armed groups which currently abuse children, and third to \n     address the political, social, and economic factors which \n     create an environment where children are induced by appeal of \n     ideology or by socio-economic collapse to become child \n     soldiers;\n       (16) the United States delegation to the United Nations \n     working group relating to child soldiers, which included \n     representatives from the Department of Defense, supported the \n     Geneva agreement on the optional protocol;\n       (17) on May 25, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly \n     unanimously adopted the optional protocol on the use of child \n     soldiers;\n       (18) the optional protocol was opened for signature on June \n     5, 2000; and\n       (17) President Clinton has publicly announced his support \n     of the optional protocol and a speedy process of review and \n     signature.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress joins the \n     international community in--\n       (A) condemning the use of children as soldiers by \n     governmental and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and\n       (B) welcoming the optional protocol as a critical first \n     step in ending the use of children as soldiers.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) It is essential that the President consult closely with \n     the Senate with the objective of building support for this \n     protocol, and the Senate move forward as expeditiously as \n     possible.\n       (B) the President and Congress should work together to \n     enact a law that establishes a fund for the rehabilitation \n     and reintegration into society of child soldiers; and\n        (C) the Departments of State and Defense should undertake \n     all possible efforts to persuade and encourage other \n     governments to ratify and endorse the new optional protocol \n     on the use of child soldiers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LOTT AMENDMENT

Res. 318\n\n       Whereas this is the 100th year of service to the people of \n     the United States by the United States Navy submarine force, \n     the ``Silent Service'';\n       Whereas this is the 200th year of service to the Nation of \n     the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard;\n       Whereas Portsmouth Naval Shipyard launched the first Navy \n     built submarine, the L-8, on April 23, 1917;\n       Whereas 52 years and 133 submarines later, on November 11, \n     1969, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard launched the last submarine \n     built by the Navy, the U.S.S. Sand Lance;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was launched at Portsmouth \n     Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960;\n       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 129 composed of 16 \n     officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;\n       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of the \n     naval submarine service, military and civilian, in the \n     protection of the Nation;\n       Whereas at approximately 7:45 a.m. on April 10, 1963, at a \n     location near 41.46 degrees North latitude and 65.03 degrees \n     West longitude, the U.S.S.

Thresher was declared lost with all \n     hands on April 10, 1963;\n       Whereas from the loss of that submarine, there arose the \n     SUBSAFE program which has kept America's submariners safe at \n     sea ever since as the strongest, safest submarine force in \n     history;\n       Whereas from the loss of the U.S.S.

Thresher characterizes the sacrifice of \n     all submariners, past and present, military and civilian, in \n     the service of this Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of the U.S.S. \n     Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on \n     April 10, 1963;\n       (2) expresses its deepest gratitude to all submariners on \n     ``eternal patrol'', forever bound together by their dedicated \n     and honorable service to the United States of America;\n       (3) recognizes with appreciation and respect the commitment \n     and sacrifices made by the Naval Submarine Service for the \n     past 100 years in providing for the common defense of the \n     United States; and\n       (4) offers its admiration and gratitude for the workers of \n     the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard whose 200 years of dedicated \n     service to the United States Navy has contributed directly to \n     the greatness and freedom of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       (B) improve the overall certification process by \n     incorporating process as well as outcome performance \n     measures, and developing equitable processes for appeals.\n       (b) Certification and Recertification of Organ Procurement \n     Organizations.--Section 371(b)(1) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 273(b)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) through (G) as \n     subparagraphs (E) through (H), respectively;\n       (2) by realigning the margin of subparagraph (F) (as so \n     redesignated) so as to align with subparagraph (E) (as so \n     redesignated);
