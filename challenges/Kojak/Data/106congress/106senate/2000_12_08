Mr. President, I have come to the floor because, as we \nare considering the final wrapup of the appropriations bills, I face \nthe problem of having to modify a provision that was in a bill as we \nwere ready to send it to the President before the election dealing with \nSteller sea lions.\n  It is sort of a long story, but let me start from the beginning.\n  In 1969, as a new Senator, I flew from Kodiak to the Pribilof Islands \nin a Navy plane. I observed hundreds--hundreds--of foreign fishing \nvessels--factory trawlers--between those two islands off our coast. \nThey were catching Alaska's seafood. As a matter of fact, they were \nbeyond the 3-mile limit. They were in international waters at that \ntime.\n  Subsequently, I asked the Coast Guard, and I think the Fish and \nWildlife Service then, to take some photographs of those vessels. We \nfound, after examining photographs, that on the top of the vessels, on \nthe decks, there were pens, literally, where they would toss a fur seal \nhere and a harbor seal there, and a baby sea lion there. And then there \nwas what we called a ``glory hole'' in the center, and they just shoved \nall of the fish into that hole. And it was ground up and sent back into \nthe world's economy as protein. None of it came ashore in the United \nStates or Alaska.\n  That appalled me. I came back and we worked with people in the House. \nWe devised a bill and introduced it to claim the 200 miles off our \nshore for the protection of the marine resources. That did not pass \nthat year.\n  The next year, I asked my good friend, Senator Warren Magnuson of \nWashington, and he introduced the bill as chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee. I was cosponsor. But we worked to get that bill passed.\n  By 1976, that bill was passed. We obtained control over the 200 miles \noff our shore. In that process we started the concept of Americanizing \nthe 200 mile zone so we could get better control over the vessels that \nharvested our fish.\n  The grand story of the whole continuum since 1976 is the pollock and \ncod of the North Pacific. Pollock and cod were at that time a fairly \ninsignificant fishery. They were taking probably 10-20 million pounds a \nyear--a little bit more--and would bring it ashore here into our \ncountry.\n  But the difficulty with pollock is, it must be fleshed and boned soon \nafter it is caught. It turns into a wonderful, white protein. The \nJapanese use it as surimi. We use pollock and cod as fillets and in \nfish sticks. If you go to Long John Silver's or McDonald's, any one of \nthose entities today to buy a fish sandwich, there is a 9 out of 10\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\nchance you are going to be eating Alaska pollock.\n  But here is the beauty of the control mechanism we set up over the \n200-mile limit. Pollock in the North Pacific is cannibalistic. I have \nsaid that on the floor before. As they mature, they get lazy, do not \nwant to forage for food, and they eat their young. We found that if you \nharvest the mature fish--take them to market--the biomass expands.\n  The biomass of Alaskan pollock is about five times the size it was \nwhen we created the 200-mile limit. It now sustains the most enormous \nfishery in the world. It is a vital necessity to the economy of the \nPacific Northwest and an absolute necessity to our State.\n  By virtue of an action taken just recently, the administration has \nnow denied access to Alaskan pollock and cod, to the extent that about \n1,000 boats will not fish in January who would otherwise go out and \nstart fishing.\n  The Department of Commerce released, last Friday, a biological \nopinion on the relationship between the Steller sea lion and the \nAlaskan groundfish fleet. This 588-page document contains a massive \nrewrite of the fishery management plan for the Bering Sea and the Gulf \nof Alaska groundfish fisheries.\n  Mind you, under the Magnuson Act--it is now called the Magnuson-\nStevens Act--but under that Act that commenced in 1976, the duty to \ncreate fishery management plans for the areas off our shore lies in the \nregional councils. Alaska is the only State that has its own council--\nbecause of the massive area of our State; more than half the coastline \nof the United States is in Alaska--we have a regional council.\n  As I mentioned, the duty to prepare fishery management plans under \nFederal law is in the regional councils. This is a magnificent \nexperiment in terms of government. The councils are created by \nappointments from the Secretary of Commerce from a list submitted by \nthe Governors of the coastal States. The Federal Government and the \nStates have each delegated some authority to those councils to manage \nfisheries in those areas.\n  But this document, filed last Friday, was prepared in secrecy. No one \nin my State knew what was in it.\n  It impacts areas inside Alaska state waters. It covers areas in the \njurisdiction of other departments. And it was not unveiled until the \nvery last minute. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries Service had an \nappointment to brief me on it on Thursday, and they asked to put it off \nuntil Friday. I changed that appointment for them. The reason was, they \nwanted to file it in court before they met with me. They had already \ndelivered the document to the Federal judge involved when we met \nFriday. They prepared this because a Federal judge in Washington had \nenjoined all fishing because they lacked sound science under their \nprior biological opinion, prepared under the Endangered Species Act.\n  I am trying to start a line of reasoning here so people understand \nwhat has happened. The way that that biological opinion under the \nEndangered Species Act has been handled is a direct assault on the 1976 \nMagnuson Act because it has taken over the jurisdiction of the regional \ncouncils to prepare these fishery management plans. In fact, the \nMagnuson Act contains an emergency clause. The Secretary of Commerce is \nenabled, under certain circumstances, to issue emergency orders that \nchange or even promulgate a management plan. But this management plan \nis promulgated in a biological opinion issued under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. There is no emergency clause in the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  What we did in 1976 was to provide the tools to each region to manage \nthe fisheries in their area. There has never been a more successful \neffort in terms of Federal-State cooperation, in my opinion. Now, \nbecause of a lawsuit filed by Greenpeace in a Federal court, the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service is trying to change the total \nmanagement of the North Pacific as far as the Steller sea lion and \nAlaska groundfish are concerned. This is the real emergency here for \nus, but it is something every coastal State should look at. Because by \nusing the authority of the Magnuson Act emergency clause and taking it \ninto a process under the Endangered Species Act and issuing a \nmanagement plan that is only outlined by the Magnuson Act, but by \nissuing it in a biological opinion, what they have done is they have \nseized from the States, they have seized from the regional councils any \nmanagement authority over the areas off our shores that the Magnuson \nAct covered.\n  I cannot stand by and see this happen. In the first place, as I said, \nthis is a terrible blow to the people of my State who work hard \nharvesting and processing this fish. The value of the lost harvest \nalone will be at least $191 million under the biological opinion. But \nif you look at that stream of economic activity it creates in the \nnational economy, there is over $1 billion a year that comes from \ngroundfish. It is turned into a marketable, salable product and \ndevelops these retail entities that are world renowned in terms of \nproviding quality fish and fish products for consumption by our \nconsumers.\n  The opinion that was filed is an interesting thing. The first five \ntimes the National Marine Fisheries Service explored the relationship \nbetween pollock and the decline of the Steller sea lion, the opinion \nsaid there was no relationship. Dissatisfied with that, the \nadministration dismissed from the area of research the people who had \nwritten those first opinions and turned to a new researcher who had \ndone some research off Atka Island, which is about 1,500 miles west of \nAnchorage, on the relationship of mackerel out there to the fishing \nefforts.\n  One man developed what is known as a localized depletion theory. He \nopined that the reason there was a decline around Atka Island was that \nfactory trawlers were coming and fishing. In the period after they were \nfishing, there was a localized depletion of the fishery resource. That \nis not a scientific conclusion. That is a theory. But they brought him \nin to write the biological opinion on Steller sea lions in relationship \nto pollock and cod, and he used his new concept of localized depletion. \nHe has now brought forward in this biological opinion, through the \nDepartment of Commerce--I wish I had the map to show the Senate--a \nprocess which denies access to the groundfish fleet to areas within a \n20-mile radius of most Steller sea lion rookeries. The concept of the \nconnection between those rookeries and the pollock is localized \ndepletion. It is not science. It is an assumption. And it has not been \naccepted by the scientific community.\n\n  Their own scientists admit they have no data to support this theory, \nand that is a direct violation of both the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the \nEndangered Species Act, which require a sound scientific basis. The \ndifficulty is that the biological opinion, if it becomes operative, \nwill limit the areas and limit the seasons in which fishermen can fish \nfor pollock and cod. That is a limitation that is only authorized under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act, and it cannot be promulgated except in \nresponse to a plan presented by the regional council.\n  Our regional council denounces this current biological opinion. Our \nState opposes it violently. As I said, no one knew anything that was in \nit. It was totally in camera. Nobody had access to it, unless it was \nthe plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Greenpeace. The Commerce Department \ndenied me access to it and demanded I wait 12 hours. And in that 12 \nhours, they filed it in opinion in court without giving us a chance to \nexamine it.\n  The Magnuson Act was designed to promote safety at sea. I don't know \nhow many people know about it, but the worst death ratio in any \nindustry in our country is in commercial fishing off our State. As the \nfather of a son who has been out there fishing for 10, 12, 15 years, I \ncan tell the Senate, there is no greater worry for a father than to \nhave a son on one of those boats because the death toll is horrendous. \nIt will be worse because of Government regulations that require \nclosures and require actions that aren't based on common sense. In this \nbiological opinion, they are now going to force our small boats to fish \nin the dangerous offshore areas in the winter storm season. They say: \nFish in the winter storm season. We passed the act so we could enact \nregulations so we could get out of the winter storm season. I can't \nunderstand why they would do that. It is a direct violation of Federal \nlaw to do that. They should have at least consulted the regional \ncouncil and allowed\n\n[[Page S11749]]\n\nthe regional council to have hearings. They have not done so.\n  Yesterday in Anchorage the advisory panel to the North Pacific \nFisheries Management Council voted unanimously to reject this \nbiological opinion. They want to restore the regulations that were in \neffect prior to its issuance until we can have public hearings and \npublic review and we get the National Academy of Sciences and other \nqualified scientists to review this theory that has been presented by \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service under the cloak of sound science.\n  I do have a provision I am going to offer to this bill again. It is a \nmodification of the amendment that is already there. It would allow the \nfishery to go forward under both the Endangered Species Act and the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act regulations that were in place before this opinion \nwas issued. People are saying we are emasculating the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Nothing is further from the truth. The Endangered Species \nAct was part of the plan that was followed and was in effect before \nthis new plan was filed in the lawsuit in Seattle. Earlier this year, \nthe Department of Commerce argued in court that these regulations were \nsufficient under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Again, I am here to ask the Senators from New England, from the \nAtlantic area, from the South Atlantic area, from the Gulf coast, from \nthe Pacific council area, to look at what has happened. This is a \nfederalization of fisheries off our shores under the guise of the \nEndangered Species Act based upon a theory that has not been tested \nanywhere.\n  In my opinion, the current act that is before us to close out the \nGovernment should not pass and will not have my signature on the final \nconference report unless something is in there that deals with this \nvery odd biological opinion and restores the capability of our people \nto continue to fish in a safe and sound way off our shores.\n  Mr. President, I was given a CD-ROM of this document, the biological \nopinion. I think it would be nice reading for some people over the \nweekend. I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary be printed \nin the Record following my remarks. The entire document is available on \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service website.\n  There being no ojbection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Executive Summary--November 30, 2000\n\n       In compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act \n     (ESA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has \n     completed this biological opinion consulting on the \n     authorization of groundfish fisheries in the Bering Sea and \n     Aleutian Islands region (BSAI) under the Fishery Management \n     Plan (FMP) for the BSAI Groundfish, and the authorization of \n     groundfish fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) under the \n     FMP for Groundfish of the GOA. This opinion is comprehensive \n     in scope and considers the fisheries and the overall \n     management framework established by the respective FMPs to \n     determine whether that framework contains necessary measures \n     to ensure the protection of listed species and critical \n     habitat. The opinion determines whether the BSAI or GOA \n     groundfish fisheries, as implemented under the respective \n     FMPs, jeopardize the continued existence of listed species in \n     the areas affected by the fisheries (i.e., the action areas) \n     or adversely modify critical habitat of such species.\n\n\n                              Action Area\n\n       The action area consists of ``all areas to be affected \n     directly or indirectly by the Federal action, and not merely \n     the immediate area involved in the action'' (50 CFR \n     402.02(d)). As such, the action area for the Federally \n     managed BSAI groundfish fisheries covers all of the Bering \n     Sea under U.S. jurisdiction, extending southward to include \n     the waters south of the Aleutian Islands west of 170 deg.W \n     longitude to the border of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. \n     The action area covered by the GOA FMP applies to the U.S. \n     Exclusive Economic Zone of the North Pacific Ocean, exclusive \n     of the Bering Sea, between the eastern Aleutian Islands at \n     170 deg.W longitude and Dixon Entrance. The area encompasses \n     sites that are directly affected by fishing, as well as sites \n     likely to be indirectly affected by the removal of fish at \n     nearby sites. The action area would also, necessarily, \n     include those state waters that are encompassed by critical \n     habitat for Steller sea lions.\n       The action area includes the Alaska range of both the \n     endangered western and threatened eastern populations of the \n     Steller sea lion. However, the effects of the Federal FMPs on \n     Steller sea lions generally occur within the range of the \n     western population. Therefore, this consultation focuses \n     primarily on areas west of 144 W longitude (the defined \n     boundary of the western population of Steller sea lions).\n       NMFS has determined that the action being considered in \n     this biological opinion may affect 22 species listed under \n     the ESA, including 7 species of endangered whales, the two \n     distinct populations of Steller sea lions, twelve \n     evolutionarily significant units (ESU) of Pacific salmonids \n     and one species of endangered sea turtle. The action area \n     also includes 4 species of endangered or threatened seabirds, \n     and 1 species of marine mammal, the northern sea otter, that \n     has been proposed as a candidate species under the ESA.\n\n\n                         Environmental Baseline\n\n       The environmental baseline for the biological opinion must \n     include the past and present impacts of all state, Federal or \n     private actions and other human activities in the action \n     area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal \n     projects in the action area that have already undergone \n     consultations, and the impact of contemporaneous State or \n     private actions (50 CFR Sec. 402.02). The environmental \n     baseline for this biological opinion includes the effects of \n     a wide variety of human activities and natural phenomena that \n     may affect the survival and recovery of threatened and \n     endangered species in the action area. The opinion recognizes \n     that such phenomena and activities have contributed to the \n     current status of populations of those listed species. While \n     some may have occurred in the past but no longer affect these \n     species, others may continue to affect populations of listed \n     species in the study area.\n       The environmental baseline for this action includes \n     fisheries and other FMP-associated activities that are \n     occurring, and that have occurred prior to January 2000. \n     Other human-related activities discussed that may affect, or \n     have affected, the baseline include the impacts of human \n     growth on the action area and the effects of commercial and \n     subsistence harvests of marine mammals. Alaska managed \n     commercial fisheries are also addressed. Those fisheries and \n     their effects on listed species are expected to continue in \n     the action area and into the future. Herring and salmon are \n     fisheries that are managed entirely by the State of Alaska, \n     or, in the case of pollock and Pacific cod, only a \n     percentage of the fishery is managed by State authority, \n     and are species found year-round in the diet of Steller \n     sea lions.\n       The environmental baseline also discusses the potential \n     effects of the environmental changes on the carrying capacity \n     of the action area over the past several decades, including \n     the relationship between the dietary needs of Steller sea \n     lions, the regime shift hypothesis, and massive population \n     declines in recent decades. The opinion concludes that it is \n     highly unlikely that natural environmental change has been \n     the sole underlying cause for the decline of Steller sea \n     lion.\n       The environmental baseline attempts to bring together all \n     of the estimated mortalities of Steller sea lions and a \n     synthesis of the significance of those takes. The best \n     available scientific information on the magnitude and likely \n     impacts of Orca predation on listed species in the action \n     area are analyzed. Other factors, such as disease, ecological \n     effects of commercial whaling through the 1970s, and \n     pollutants, while not entirely excluded as contributing \n     factors, have been considered, but are given lesser \n     importance in explaining the observed pattern of declines.\n\n\n                           Effects of Actions\n\n       The scope of the ``effects of actions'' analysis is \n     intended to be comprehensive. As such, the opinion is broad \n     and examines a range of activities conducted pursuant to the \n     FMPs including the manner in which the total allowable catch \n     levels are set, the process that leads to the setting of \n     these levels, the amount of prey biomass taken from sea lion \n     critical habitat. The effects of other activities that are \n     interrelated or interdependent are also analyzed. Indirect \n     effects are those that are caused later in time, but are \n     still reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are \n     those that are part of a larger action and depend upon the \n     larger action for their justification. Interdependent actions \n     are those that have no independent utility apart from the \n     action under consideration (50 CFR 402.02).\n       The first part of the effects analysis is a description of \n     fishery management as practiced under the FMPs, including an \n     explanation of how ecosystem issues are considered. \n     Particularly important sources of potential ecosystem effects \n     are highlighted in subsequent sections. The second part of \n     the effects analysis focuses on the current exploitation \n     strategy and its potential relevance, both past and present, \n     in shaping changes in the abundance and population structure \n     of groundfish stocks. The present fishery management regime's \n     maximum target fishing reference point of B40% is used as an \n     example to illustrate the potential direction and intensity \n     of direct effects.\n       The third part of the effects analysis reviews the annual \n     fishery cycle, from surveys through the establishment of \n     Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels. The effects are evaluated \n     specific to the major stages of the cycle and to explore \n     whether effects can be compounded through subsequent steps in \n     the cycle. Finally, in the fourth part of the effects \n     analysis, the FMPs and their management tools and policies \n     are examined as guiding documents for management of the \n     fisheries and protection of the associated ecosystems. This \n     part also addresses the fisheries as they are prosecuted \n     under the FMPs.\n\n\n                           Cumulative Effects\n\n       Cumulative effects include the effects of future State, \n     tribal, local, or private actions\n\n[[Page S11750]]\n\n     that are reasonably certain to occur in the action area. The \n     State groundfish fisheries are generally smaller than the \n     federal groundfish fisheries but are expected to have \n     marginally more impacts (because of location) on listed \n     species with respect to competition for prey and long term \n     ecosystem impacts. The crab fishery is one of the biggest \n     fisheries managed by the state. However, this fishery is not \n     likely to directly compete for prey with either Steller sea \n     lions or other listed species. Herring, salmon, Pacific cod, \n     pollock, squid, and octopus are items found year-round in the \n     diet of Steller sea lions. Species such as salmon and herring \n     occur much more frequently in the summer as determined by \n     analyses of Steller sea lion prey habits from 1990-1998.\n       Perhaps the most important interaction between state \n     fisheries and listed species may arise from the pattern of \n     localized removals of spawners. Although the patterns are \n     generally similar from one fishery to the next, the sheer \n     number of distinct fisheries makes it difficult to describe \n     them individually. Likewise, each fishery is distinctly \n     different in either the number of boats, gear used, time of \n     year, length of season, and fish species. Therefore, we \n     present the herring fishery as an example of this type \n     of interaction to demonstrate some of the competitive \n     interactions that may occur.\n       The impacts of some of the State fisheries on Steller sea \n     lions and, in some cases, humpback whales would be similar to \n     those of the Federal fisheries: cascade effects and \n     competition. Steller sea lions and some of the State \n     fisheries actively demand a common resource and the fisheries \n     reduce the availability of that common resource to Steller \n     sea lions while they satisfy their demand for fish. The State \n     groundfish fisheries may reduce the abundance or alter the \n     distribution of several prey species of listed species.\n       After reviewing the current status of each listed species \n     in the action area, the environmental baseline for the action \n     area, the effects of the FMPs for Alaska Groundfish in the \n     BSAI and GOA, and the cumulative effects of the federal \n     action, NMFS has determined that the FMPs are not likely to \n     jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species in \n     the action area except for the endangered western population \n     of Steller sea lions. In addition, after reviewing the \n     current status of critical habitat that has been designated \n     for Steller sea lions, the environmental baseline for the \n     action area, the FMPs for Alaska Groundfish in the BSAI and \n     GOA, and the cumulative effects, it is NMFS' biological \n     opinion that the FMPs are likely to adversely modify this \n     critical habitat designated for Steller sea lions.\n\n\n                   Reasonable and Prudent Alternative\n\n       Based on the effects discussion and NMFS determination that \n     fishing activity under the FMPs are likely to jeopardize the \n     continued existence of the western population of Steller sea \n     lions and are likely to adversely modify their designated \n     critical habitat, NMFS has developed a reasonable and prudent \n     alternative (RPA) with multiple components for the groundfish \n     fisheries in the BSAI and GOA. The fisheries effects that \n     give rise to these determinations include both large scale \n     removals of Steller sea lion forage over time, and the \n     potential for reduced availability of prey on the fishing \n     grounds at scales of importance to individual foraging \n     Steller sea lions.\n       The first RPA element addresses the harvest strategy for \n     fish removal at the global or FMP level. This RPA requires \n     the adoption of a new harvest control rule that would \n     decrease the likelihood that the fished biomass for pollock, \n     Pacific cod and Atka mackerel would drop below B40%. The \n     global control rule is a revised, more precautionary fishing \n     strategy (F40% adjustment procedure) for principal prey of \n     Steller sea lions taken by the groundfish fisheries in the \n     BSAI and GOA (pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel) than \n     that which currently exists under the FMP. The effect of \n     using the global control rule is increased likelihood that \n     the stock is maintained at or above the target stock size by \n     reducing the exploitation rate at low stock sizes.\n       Other RPA elements completely protect sea lions from \n     groundfish fisheries at global and regional scales, and in \n     both temporal and spatial dimensions. The other RPA elements \n     reflect a heirarchy of NMFS concerns about the effects of the \n     groundfish fisheries on Steller sea lions. Those concerns are \n     greatest with respect to critical habitat areas around \n     rookeries and major haulouts, and in special foraging areas \n     designated as critical habitat, and less for areas outside of \n     critical habitat where take levels are not considered to be \n     at a level that would jeopardize Steller sea lions. \n     Significant interactions between sea lions and the fisheries \n     for pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel have been \n     eliminated in critical habitat between November 1 and January \n     19, or 22% of the year. This level of partitioning is \n     necessary in this period because sea lions at this time are \n     considered extremely sensitive to prey availability. Because \n     fisheries are restricted to the remaining 78% of the year, \n     dispersive actions taken at finer temporal and spatial scales \n     are also necessary to avoid jeopardy and adverse \n     modification. The RPA extends 3 nautical mile (nm) protective \n     zones around rookeries to all haulouts. In the GOA, EBS and \n     AI, a total of 139 no-fishing zones (note: the rookeries are \n     already no-entry zones) are established that will partition \n     all pups and non-pups from disturbances associated with \n     vessel traffic and fishing in close proximity to important \n     terrestrial breeding and resting habitat. The RPA closes many \n     rookeries and haulouts out to 20 nm to directed fishing for \n     pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel. This second spatial \n     partitioning element excludes all fisheries for pollock, \n     Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel from approximately 63% of \n     critical habitat in the GOA, EBS, and Aleutian Islands. These \n     measures significantly increase the amount of critical \n     habitat protected from directed fishing for Steller sea lion \n     prey, greatly reduces the number of potential takes of \n     Steller sea lions through competition for a prey base inside \n     critical habitat, completely protects all pups and non-pups \n     on rookeries and haulouts out to 3 nm from the effects of \n     fishing activity, and greatly reduces the interactions \n     between fisheries and sea lions during winter months.\n       Fisheries occurring in the remaining 34% of critical \n     habitat and the areas outside critical habitat require \n     further dispersive actions to avoid jeopardy and adverse \n     modification. The temporal concentration of fisheries for \n     pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel may result in high \n     local harvest rates that may reduce the quality of habitat by \n     modifying prey availability. The RPA establishes the \n     following measures to disperse fishing effort at regional and \n     local scales and to reduce the effects of groundfish \n     fisheries on prey availability for sea lions to negligible or \n     background levels.\n       The RPA separates the fisheries into four seasonal limits \n     inside critical habitat, and two seasonal releases outside of \n     critical habitat, and disperses fishing effort throughout the \n     open portion of the year, January 20-October 31. Season start \n     dates are spaced evenly throughout this period and portions \n     of the TAC is allocated to each season. These actions reduce \n     the proportion of pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel \n     taken inside critical habitat inside the GOA to less than 20% \n     of the total catch. The measure also protects against \n     excessive harvest rates that may rapidly deplete \n     concentrations of prey inside critical habitat. NMFS has \n     concluded that a temporally dispersed fishery would not \n     significantly harm the foraging success of Steller sea lions \n     as the take would be reduced to a level that NMFS believes \n     would not compromise them.\n       The spatial concentration of current fishing effort for \n     pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel may result in high \n     local harvest rates that reduce the quality of habitat for \n     foraging Steller sea lions. Fishing inside critical habitat \n     may result in takes of Steller sea lions through adverse \n     modification of habitat (i.e, prey availability). Therefore, \n     this RPA reduces the percentage of pollock taken inside \n     critical habitat from 80 to 42% in the GOA, from 45 to 14% in \n     the EBS and from 74 to 2% in the AI compared to 1998. It also \n     reduces the percentage of Pacific cod caught in critical \n     habitat from 48 to 21% in the GOA, from 39 to 17% in the EBS \n     and from 79 to 17% in the AI as compared to 1998. The RPA \n     reduces the percentage of Atka mackerel caught inside \n     critical habitat in the AI from 66 to 8% as compared to 1998.\n       Finally, the RPA is designed to close adequate portions of \n     critical habitat to commercial fishing for the three primary \n     prey species of groundfish, while imposing restrictions on \n     fishing operations in areas open to fishing to avoid local \n     depletion of prey resources for Steller sea lions. This \n     approach of creating areas open and closed to fishing \n     operations provides contrast between complete closures and \n     restricting fishing areas within critical habitat and forms \n     the basis for monitoring the RPA. Over the past decade the \n     North Pacific Fisheries Management Council has noted the \n     importance of assessing the efficacy of conservation measures \n     intended to promote the recovery of the western population of \n     Steller sea lions. To this end, NMFS has incorporated into \n     its RPA a monitoring program that will allow for such an \n     evaluation.\n\n\n       Incidental Take Statement and Conservation Recommendations\n\n       An Incidental Take Statement (ITS) specifies the impact of \n     any incidental taking of endangered or threatened species. It \n     also provides reasonable and prudent measures that are \n     necessary to minimize impacts and sets forth terms and \n     conditions with which NMFS must comply in order to implement \n     the reasonable and prudent measures and to be exempt from the \n     prohibitions of section 9 of the ESA.\n       In addition to the RPA and ITS, conservation \n     recommendations have been provided within this biological \n     opinion. An example of one of the conservation \n     recommendations that NMFS believes should be implemented is a \n     more comprehensive stock assessment that would provide \n     detailed information on groundfish stocks on spatial and \n     temporal scales and to provide timely review of possible \n     fishery interactions with listed species (and in the future \n     on essential fish habitat). This would allow for better \n     analysis of the possible impacts of target fisheries on \n     listed species and the more proactive development of time/\n     space harvest recommendations at the individual stock \n     assessment level so that fishery interactions with listed \n     species and essential fish habitat can be minimized.\n       The cumulative effect of the RPA elements contained in this \n     biological opinion successfully removes jeopardy and avoid \n     adverse modification of designated critical habitat. However, \n     the State fisheries in Alaska, particularly those involving \n     salmon, herring, and Pacific cod are likely to result in take \n     of\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\n     Steller sea lions and may require modification. As a \n     conservation measure, NMFS also recommends that the State of \n     Alaska request NMFS to assist in the development of a Habitat \n     Conservation Plan (as authorized under section 10 of the \n     ESA). This plan should be designed to mitigate adverse \n     impacts on Steller sea lions and other listed species that \n     might accrue from State managed fisheries. This plan should \n     employ the same standards and principles as used in this \n     biological opinion to prevent completion and minimize take \n     between fisheries and listed species.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       After analyzing the cumulative, direct and indirect effects \n     of the Alaska groundfish fisheries on listed species, NMFS \n     concludes that the fisheries do not jeopardize any listed \n     species other than Steller sea lions. The biological opinion \n     concludes that the fisheries do jeopardize Steller sea lions \n     and adversely modify their critical habitat due to \n     competition for prey and modification of their prey field. \n     The three main species with which Steller sea lions compete \n     for prey are pollock, Pacific cod, and Atka mackerel. The \n     biological opinion provides a reasonable and prudent \n     alternative to modify the fisheries in a way that avoids \n     jeopardy and adverse modification.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, yesterday morning, without any notice to \nthis Senator, my distinguished colleague from Washington, Senator \nMurray, came to the floor to congratulate me in my career in the Senate \nin a most generous and gracious fashion and to yield time to other \nSenators for the same purpose.\n  Each of them, including the other Senator present, Mr. Burns, was \nmore than generous and profuse in their praise. The experience of \nlistening to it in my office bore some resemblance to attending one's \nown wake. But, nonetheless, the many fine things that were stated about \nmy career by Members on both sides of the aisle is deeply appreciated.\n  I reflected a little bit later on the fact that while our public \nimage--and, for that matter, our public duties--has to deal with \nprofound political and social questions of public policy, our personal \nrelationships among the 100 Members is something really quite \ndifferent. Each of us leaves the others with strong impressions. \nFriendships become both broad and deep during the course of a career \nhere in the Senate. When one comes to the end of such a career, it is \nthose personal relationships, in my view, that are the most deep and \nmost profound and that have the greatest effect on one as an \nindividual.\n  To listen to expressions from people who are not accustomed to \nspeaking emotionally or personally is an extremely moving experience. \nFor that reason, as close as each of those individuals was to me, I \ndon't want to mention them by name but simply express my thanks and my \nappreciation for all they said. Those friendships, of course, will \ncontinue in most cases through a lifetime.\n\n  Relationships of necessity are really quite different.\n  There is, however, one other set of relationships about which I \nshould like to speak very briefly, and that is the relationship between \na Member of this body and his or her staff, both present and past. I \nthink I can say unequivocally that quite profoundly I am and have been \na creature of my staff over the period of my entire 18 years in this \nbody.\n  My proudest achievement is that so many young people--almost all from \nmy own State--have worked for a great or shorter period of time on my \nstaff either here or in the State of Washington. The great majority of \nthem, of course, have already gone on to other careers--most of them in \nthe State, a return that I find particularly gratifying.\n  If I have a legacy--I think in many respects if any of us has a true \nlegacy over the years--the best of all the bills we have gotten passed \nand almost inevitably amended within a relatively short period of \ntime--that legacy is the young people to whom we have given a start \nhere in highly responsible positions, working on important matters of \npublic policy and dealing with dozens, hundreds, and even thousands of \nthe constituents whom we represent, growing in not only thoughtfulness \nbut responsibility during that period of time.\n  For me, the great legacy for generations to come will be the new, \nyoung, and maturing people who have worked for me during the course of \nthese 18 years. I have every hope that at some time in the not too \ndistant future at least one of them may appear in this body as a \nMember. And certainly I am of the belief that many of them will appear \nin my State and other States in positions of increasing responsibility \nin a lifetime that will have been marked by our association together.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank the staff here and of the Senate \nitself in this Chamber, but most particularly the hundreds of young \npeople who have worked for and with me during the course of the last 18 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/08/senate-section/article/S11751-3", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, while the Senator from Washington is \npresent. I wish to tell him on a very personal basis, how much I have \nappreciated his help. Slade Gorton has called the State of Washington \nhis home for the past 47 years, having moved to Seattle from Chicago in \n1953.\n\n  He served in the United States Army from 1946 to 1947. He was in the \nUnited States Air Force on active duty where he reached the rank of \ncolonel, from 1953 to 1956, and in the Air Force Reserves from 1956 to \n1981.\n  I have worked with Senator Gorton on the Appropriations Committee, \nparticularly on interior issues. Because of his knowledge and \nexperience on interior matters, working closely with him in his role as \nthe Interior Subcommittee chair, we passed the Lake Tahoe Restoration \nAct and other important environmental legislation for Nevada including \nrestoration of the Lahonton cutthroat trout and stopping the spread of \ninvasive species.\n  Those of us who have worked with Slade Gorton have long known his \ndedication to the ideals of this body and his championing of the State \nof Washington. I remember when the Senator took over the Interior \nSubcommittee on Appropriations; he did something unusual. The Senator \ncalled members to his office, all the members of the subcommittee, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to sit down and talk about what we thought \nshould be the direction of the subcommittee, which areas should be \nfunded, which areas should be cut back a little bit. I appreciated that \nvery much. It set a great tone for the subcommittee.\n\n  I was curious and looked around his office and saw many indications \nthat Senator Gorton had been to the U.S.\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\nSupreme Court presenting cases. I have been in courtrooms many times, \nat over 100 jury trials, argued before the ninth circuit of our State \nsupreme court, but never had the opportunity to argue a case before the \nU.S. Supreme Court, even though I am a member of that bar.\n  The number of times the Senator from Washington has appeared as an \nadvocate for the State of Washington and other parties in the U.S. \nSupreme Court is most impressive. It is a rare occasion that a person \ngets to argue once, but to argue as many cases before the Supreme Court \nas the Senator from Washington has is extremely impressive.\n  I also want to say that the people of Nevada have done well as a \nresult of the Senator being the chairman of that subcommittee. The \nState of Nevada is 87-percent owned by the Federal Government. As a \nresult we have many problems. The Senator from Washington was always \nvery understanding of the very special problems we had in the State of \nNevada.\n  The Senator had a great relationship with the ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, Senator Byrd, and to have Senator Byrd say publicly the \nthings he has on many occasions about his relationship with Senator \nGorton speaks volumes. Senator Byrd has been in the Senate 48 years and \nreally understands quality when he sees it.\n  I want the Senator from Washington to know how much I appreciate his \ngood work. I will always remember his friendship and look forward to \nour continued association.\n  I thank Slade Gorton, his wife Sally, and their three children and \nseven grandchildren for their years of sacrifice and dedication to our \nnation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his fine comments and \ncompliments. I may tell the Senator, that relationship is perhaps a \nresult of the marvelous biblical statement about casting your bread \nupon water and having it come back manyfold.\n  When I was first a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was in \nthe minority. The Senator from Nevada was the chairman of the modest \nsubcommittee on the legislative branch, and I was his ranking minority \nmember. The Senator from Nevada came to my office to consult with me in \na way he did not need to about those appropriations. I think it was I \nwho persuaded him to put more benches and trash receptacles on the \nCapitol grounds, which was denuded of them at the time, so I can \nbelieve I actually accomplished something in that modest position.\n  It was that lesson when we went into the majority that taught me that \non the Appropriations Committee and the Senate as a whole, it was best \nto work with everyone when it was at all possible to do so and that you \nwere far more likely to be successful not only for the people of your \nown State but the country, if you used the experience and the wisdom of \nall Members of your committees or of the Senate itself.\n  So I am particularly grateful for the comments of the Senator from \nNevada. But whatever courtesies he was rendered by this Senator he \nearned by having taught the same lesson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/08/senate-section/article/S11752-1", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PROJECT HOMESAFE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is a company in my home State of \nMichigan which is to be commended for its efforts to reduce gun \ninjuries and deaths. Last month, Meijer Stores paired up with a \ncoalition of law enforcement officials to implement a firearm buyback \nprogram in selected counties in Michigan.\n  The firearm buyback program, called ``Project Homesafe,'' allows gun \nowners to receive a $50 Meijer cash card in exchange for every \nfunctioning firearm. Meijer Stores donated $100,000 worth of these cash \ncards to promote the disposal of unwanted guns. Guns turned in under \nthis program are expected to be destroyed.\n  Mr. President, Project Homesafe is a constructive enterprise and the \nkind of public-private partnership needed to promote safety in Michigan \nhomes and communities. I applaud the initiative of Meijer Stores as \nwell as Attorney General Jennifer Granholm, the Michigan Sheriffs' \nAssociation, Ingham County Sheriff Gene Wriggelsworth, and Kent County \nSheriff James Dougan, all of whom were instrumental in implementing \nProject Homesafe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/12/08/senate-section/article/S11752-2", "month": "12", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    IN HONOR OF MARK LEWIS GILLMING\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

As a student, he excelled in both academics and athletics, \nbecoming an honors student and being involved in track and football. \nMark exhibited a great presence on the Hillcrest High football team, \nboth in action and in spirit.\n  Mark's life touched many lives, far beyond his school into his \ncommunity. He was well liked by his peers and had great influence on \nthose who knew him during his short life. His positive outlook enriched \nthose around him.\n  Mark was the son of Pastor and Mrs. Kenneth D. Gillming. He was a \nmember of Cherry Street Baptist Church where his father is a pastor. \nMark was a leader in their youth ministry. His Christian faith was a \ncentral part of his life. He loved his family, friends and most \nimportant of all, he loved Christ.
