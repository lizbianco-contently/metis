We hear Your word to us through Jeremiah, ``I have \nloved you with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness have \nI drawn you''.--Jeremiah 31:3.--We respond with the grateful words of \nthe psalmist: ``How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God''.--Psalm \n36:7. ``Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall \npraise You.''--Psalm 63:3.\n  As Your lovingkindness captures our thinking, we feel Your \nacceptance, forgiveness, and compassion. There is nothing we can do \nthat will make You stop loving us but there is something we can do to \nrealize Your love for us. We can love ourselves as loved and forgiven \nby You, and we can dedicate this day to communicating Your \nlovingkindness to the people around us. Remind us that practical, \npositive acts of lovingkindness heal the one who does them and those \nwho receive them. Alert us to people who need Your lovingkindness \nthrough us and make this a ``do it and say it'' kind of day. Through \nour Lord and Savior.

Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate evenly divided between the two leaders prior to the \ncloture vote on amendment No. 297 to the instructions to the motion to \nrecommit the bill S. 557.\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Abraham) amendment No. 254, to preserve and \n     protect the surpluses of the social security trust funds by \n     reaffirming the exclusion of receipts and disbursement from \n     the budget, by setting a limit on the debt held by the \n     public, and by amending the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     to provide a process to reduce the limit on the debt held by \n     the public.\n       Abraham amendment No. 255 (to amendment No. 254), in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Lott motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs, with instructions and report back \n     forthwith.\n       Lott amendment No. 296 (to the instructions of the Lott \n     motion to recommit), to provide for Social Security surplus \n     preservation and debt reduction.\n       Lott amendment No. 297 (to amendment No. 296), in the \n     nature of a substitute (Social Security Lockbox).\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need.\n  We find ourselves once again on the Senate floor. As I said to the \nSenator from New Jersey, some years back there was a movie called \n``Groundhog Day'' in which the main character in the movie kept waking \nup each day in the same exact setting in which he found himself the \nprevious day. Somehow that movie's theme seems to be playing itself out \nin this debate about the lockbox. We are once again to have a cloture \nvote to simply try to obtain the opportunity to have a vote on the \namendment which was offered by myself, along with Senator Domenici and \nSenator Ashcroft, to the underlying legislation.\n  We have previously tried to accomplish this without success. It is \nvery frustrating because if we obtain cloture today, we would get this \nvote, but this legislation would then be open to further amendment by \nany Senator who wished to change its composition.\n  So I start the debate by pointing out to all my colleagues that all \nwe are\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\nasking for is a chance to have a vote on one amendment.\n  Now, this past 4 days we have been debating the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I remember back a few weeks ago the entire Senate was virtually \nshut down so a group of Senators who wanted to have that issue \nconsidered could have the entire issue considered and a full range of \namendments brought up and voted on, and we did that. Here all we are \nasking for is a chance to have a vote on one amendment to a broader \nbill. I hope we will get the chance to do so.\n  The reason for that is very simple. Across my State, and I think \nacross this country, Americans continue to want to see their Social \nSecurity dollars protected. They want to make sure every single dollar \nthey send to Washington in their payroll taxes for Social Security is \npreserved and not spent on other programs or used for tax cuts or for \nany other purpose but for their Social Security protection. They want \nto make sure today's beneficiaries are protected. They want to make \nsure future beneficiaries are protected. So do the advocates of this \namendment. It is not just one side that advocates this, as far as I can \ntell, because just in the last few weeks we have heard from the White \nHouse that the President, too, shares our view that we ought to have a \nSocial Security lockbox.\n  It does not seem to me very clear why, as a result of that, we cannot \nhave a vote on this proposal. If others have additions or deletions or \ncounterproposals, they will have their chance because the underlying \nbill will still be subject to further amendment. But those of us who \nthink this is the right approach want to have a chance to have this \napproach ultimately debated and be voted on. We have been trying and \ntrying without success. I hope today we can continue down the path we \nstarted just a few days ago when we ultimately obtained cloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  As I open this debate, I implore Members on both sides of the aisle \nto give those of us who are advocating this amendment a chance to have \na vote on it. If you have your own ideas, bring those, too, and once we \nhave voted on this amendment, we will vote on yours. But let us at \nleast get the ball rolling. If everybody is as strongly for a lockbox \nas they profess, then let us have a chance to start the debate, and let \nus start with this amendment which was the first one offered.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  As stated by our colleague and friend from the State of Michigan, we \nare kind of looking at the same thing again. He likened it to \n``Groundhog Day.'' I would say it is ``deja vu all over again.'' That \nwas said by a great philosopher in New Jersey, Yogi Berra.\n  What are we talking about? What we are discussing is whether or not \nthe people on this side of the aisle and the people up there and the \npeople out there will have a right to have their views included in this \ndebate.\n  It is pretty simple. We are talking about a lockbox. A lockbox is a \nplace where you can preserve treasure, where you can preserve family \nrecords, jewelry, et cetera. But I never heard of a lockbox where they \nput in one article of value and leave out the rest.\n  What we are hearing is that we are going to protect Social Security's \nsurpluses, but we are not going to do anything, according to the \nmajority, to extend the solvency of Social Security. We are not going \nto do anything to include Medicare's solvency. People do not get into \nthese programs until they are 65 years old. At that time, do you want \nto have to worry about whether or not health insurance is going to be \navailable? Do you want to worry whether that retirement fund is going \nto be there for your children who are now hard at work trying to take \ncare of their needs while they also prepare for their retirement? The \nRepublicans are saying: Leave it to us; we will figure out a way to \ntake care of it some day off in Wonderland.\n  The fact of the matter is, yes, we want to engage in an honest debate \nabout this. It is not just let us have our vote. Let them have their \nvote means that under the proposal they have offered, this side gets no \nvotes and the people we represent across this country get no opinion \nexpressed. Look at the polls and see what they think about who is going \nto do the best job to protect Social Security and Medicare. They are \ngoing to say the Democrats are the people who worry most about it.\n  We are beginning to look at an examination of process, a process that \na lot of people do not understand, even some in this body, but \ncertainly across the country people do not understand it: Cloture \nmotions.\n  Amendments, allow us to discuss them. Pure and simple, that is the \nway the American people want us to talk to them. Will they allow us, \nthe Democrats, to register our view of how this Social Security so-\ncalled lockbox is going to look? Does it do the job the American people \nwant? Or are we using terminology that has a certain ring to it that \nhas no value?\n  That is the question. I say to my friend from Michigan, let us have \nsome amendments so that we do not have to, up or down, just take what \nthe Republicans have offered. Let us debate it. It is a big enough \nproposal, I think.\n  Yes, it has reared its ugly head several times. The fact of the \nmatter is, we have not yet gotten to see the whole body there. We do \nnot understand all the ramifications. At least the public does not \nunderstand them.\n  Give us a chance to have some amendments. They are saying: No, the \nfirst thing we are going to do is move on to the Abraham-Domenici-\nAshcroft proposal.\n  We do not want to do it that way. We are going to do our darndest to \nprotect the American people. We are going to insist we have a lockbox \nthat includes solvency for Medicare extended by 20 years, extend Social \nSecurity by 30 years or 40 years, and try during that period of time to \nwork it out so it is extended for 75 years.\n  That is what our mission ought to be--look ahead and not simply try \nto shut things down and offer as a juicy incentive a tax cut that is \nbest for the wealthiest in this country.\n  It is $1 trillion for the cost of the House Republican tax cut. Out \nof that, they take $55 billion away from Social Security to help it \nalong. They take $964 billion of the surplus to help that tax cut \nalong. The American people are more interested in putting food on the \ntable, providing for their education, and protecting their parents' \nhealth care in the future than they are about that kind of tax cut.\n  We want to give a tax cut, too. Everybody loves tax cuts. The \ndifference is, we love them for the majority of the people where it \ncounts. We love them because we want people to receive adequate child \ncare, and we want to know they can take care of the elderly when \nmedical services are necessary. It is not just tax cuts for tax cuts. \nNo, tax cuts for political purposes is what we are looking at--tax cuts \nfor the wealthy.\n  This economy is boiling. You cannot get help to do this. You cannot \nget help to do that. You want to buy a house. The housing market is \nexploding. If you want to go into fancy items such as boats and \nairplanes, you have to wait 3 years to get delivery on them. I do not \nfeel sorry for a guy who has to wait 3 years for a new airplane. The \nfact of the matter is, that is where that money will go with a tax cut, \nand not into the homes of people who worked all their lives to save a \nfew bucks and provide for their retirement, as well as for their \nmedical care needs.\n  That is what this debate is about, and I hope that our colleagues \nwill stick together on this side and insist that we have a chance to \noffer people's amendments. That is what we are discussing. We are not \ndiscussing anything else. There is no trickery. Let us express a view \nthat maybe, if people listen to it, they will consider it and, if not, \nthen we have the votes. They are the majority. They are going to get \ntheir way; we know that, but I do not think that is a good way to serve \nthe public.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Michigan, shall \nwe switch sides?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That will be fine, back and forth.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I, once again, \nfor all Senators, make the following point: We are not seeking cloture \non the underlying bill. It will still be subject to\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\namendments that I believe the Senator from New Jersey is referencing. I \ndo not know what those amendment are. They can be brought up if we \nobtain cloture. All we get is a chance to vote on our amendment. I \ncannot figure out why we are not being allowed a chance to vote on our \namendment. I will continue to make that point today.\n  I yield such time as he may need to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. The Senator from \nNew Jersey said, ``This side gets no votes.'' I wrote it down word for \nword. The Senator from New Jersey said, ``This side,'' meaning the \nDemocratic side, ``gets no votes.'' Does the Senator from New Jersey \nrealize that this is a cloture motion on the amendment? This is not a \ncloture motion on the bill. The cloture motion on the amendment simply \nsays that we get a vote on our amendment. After the amendment is \nadopted or rejected, the bill is still there, and it is open for \namendment. The amendment which we adopt, if we adopt it, will be open \nto amendment. The Senator can amend it. He can substitute it. He can \neliminate it. He can do whatever he wants. He will get all the votes he \nwants.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said, ``Let us have some amendments.'' \nHow many amendments does the Senator want? I will be happy to listen. \nHow many amendments would the Senator from New Jersey like?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I cannot speak for our leadership, but he has been \nwaiting for a response from the majority leader as to whether or not \namendments are going to be permitted. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nknows only too well that when we talk about this amendment, we are \ntalking about the bill; we are talking about the issue. We are not \ntalking about some abstract condition.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, the Senator knows, \nonce we put the amendment in the underlying bill, it is then open and \nsubject to amendment which the Senator can offer. In fact, he has an \nunlimited right in the Senate to offer amendments to the underlying \namendment. All we are doing is asking to put in this budget bill an \nunderlying amendment for the membership to then amend to its heart's \ncontent, vote as many times as the Senator from New Jersey wants to \nvote.\n  As we have seen in the last 4 days, we had multiple amendments. We \nhad, what? We had an underlying bill. We had an underlying bill that \nwas a Democratic bill and an underlying bill that was a Republican \nbill. All I am saying is let us put our underlying bill in place, and \nthen my colleagues can have all the fun they want in trying to craft \ndifferent amendments to that or substituting their own version of it.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said: All we want is an honest debate. We \nare trying to get an honest debate.\n  Let's put the measure in the underlying bill and have at it. Let's \nhave a full and open debate. Maybe we can get a unanimous consent \nagreement to be on this for a couple of days and allow amendments on \nboth sides. That is the way we do things in this body. All of us are \nwilling to do that. I am certainly willing to do that. I am certainly \nwilling to give the Democrats the opportunity to put forward their \nlockbox proposal and willing to put forward amendments to our lockbox \nproposal.\n  I welcome an open, honest, and fair debate, but we cannot get there, \nas the Senator from New Jersey knows, unless we have a bill with which \nto start. We cannot start amending nothing. We have to amend something. \nWhat we are trying to do is put something in place to start the ball \nrolling.\n  I understand the Senator would like to have a Democratic bill start \nthe process. I understand that. As he knows, we have to start \nsomewhere, and putting our bill up first, as the majority, is not an \nirrational thing to suggest as a starting point, as long as we give you \nthe right to amend, which we do.\n  This vote does not limit your rights at all. It limits no rights on \nyour side. You have all the full rights that a Senator has and that the \nminority has under the current set of rules. So this idea that this \nside has no votes or this side has no amendments is not factual. You \nhave unlimited amendments and unlimited rights to amend this proposal.\n  This proposal simply says: Every dollar coming into Social Security \nshould be used for Social Security. The Senator from New Jersey said: \nWell, the House tax cut uses Social Security money. If it does, guess \nwhat. We will have a vote right here on the Senate floor in which 60 \nSenators will have to say: We want to spend Social Security for that \ntax cut.\n  I do not think you will get 60 votes. I know you will not get 60 \nvotes. This Senator will not vote for it. I know a lot of Senators over \nhere who will not vote for using Social Security surplus funds for any \ntax relief.\n  I am perfectly willing--in fact, advocating--to use the onbudget \nsurplus to give relief to the taxpayers of America. In fact, giving \nthem that relief will help to buy the food and the medicines and other \nthings the Senator just talked about. It is important to do that. We do \nnot have to do everything for everybody. We can actually let people \nkeep their own money and do it themselves. I think people would have \nthe preference of doing it that way.\n  As to the idea that we have the power right now to stop raids on \nSocial Security, we do not. We do not. We saw that last October. What \nhappened last October was that the President got together with the \nleaders over there, and they raided the surplus, the Social Security \nsurplus. We did not have the courage or the opportunity with a vote to \nstop it.\n  If we pass this lockbox proposal, any Senator has the right to ask \nfor a vote, and 60 Senators would have to get up and say: I would \nrather spend that money on whatever program or spend that money, in a \nsense, on tax relief. And you need 60 votes. That is a real protection \nfor Social Security.\n  I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the Senate Democrats are \nnow the only group of people in Washington, DC--and I daresay the \ncountry--who are opposing this. You have the President of the United \nStates, a Democrat, who wants this. You have 99 percent of the \nDemocrats in the House of Representatives who voted for it. You have \nevery Republican who is supporting it.\n  The only group of people in the country, that I can see, who are \nagainst having Social Security money for just Social Security are 45 \nMembers on the other side of the aisle. I am not too sure they \nunderstand what the American public wants and what everybody else has \nfigured out is the right policy for America.\n  So I encourage the Senator--maybe his staff did not give him the \ncorrect information--to look at what this cloture motion does. It \nlimits no rights for the minorities--none. You have unlimited right of \namendment after this cloture motion is agreed to and we vote on this \namendment. Then we can have the full and fair debate.\n  I am sure our majority leader, who cares very deeply about this \nbill--Social Security is very important to him--would devote as much \ntime as necessary on the Senate floor to have that kind of debate, to \nget the kind of measure that can pass and be signed by the President, \nand we can begin the process of protecting Social Security.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Before recognizing the Senator from South Carolina, I \nwill tell you, the Senator from Pennsylvania has been here long enough \nthat he has knowledge of the process. I have been here longer. I, too, \nhave a knowledge of the process.\n  No matter what you say, if you are going to shut down the amendment \nprocess--which the majority has successfully done--you are not going to \nget amendments. You can say, we will take all the amendments.\n  I just heard the Senator from Pennsylvania make a commitment, I \nassume for the Republican majority, when he said: I have no objection \nto any amendments you want to offer.\n  Did I mischaracterize the Senator from Mr. Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would have no objection to any amendments you have \nwith respect to the Social Security lockbox, absolutely. Let's have a \ndebate on Social Security. Let's have a debate on the Social Security \nlockbox.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be \nvitiated, that the motion to recommit and the amendments be withdrawn, \nand that the bill be considered under the following time limitations:\n  That there be up to a dozen amendments for each leader, or his \ndesignee; that the amendments deal with the subject of lockbox \nprotections for Social Security and Medicare, budget reform, and the \navailability of prescription drugs for seniors; and that the amendments \nbe subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right the object. That unanimous-consent \nrequest does not focus on the Social Security lockbox; it focuses on \neverything in the world; thereby, I would have to object because it is \nnot about the Social Security lockbox. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With all respect, then with the subject of lockbox \nprotections for Social Security and Medicare reform--and we can leave \nit at that--that the amendments be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from New \nJersey knows Medicare is not funded out of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is exactly the problem.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So to expand the debate----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. That is exactly the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So I would have to object.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You heard it. Medicare is not included.\n  Finally, we have a frank admission on the floor of the Senate. \nMedicare is left out. So all of you who are like Senator Hollings and \nI, with blonde hair up top, may not be concerned at all about where we \ngo with our Medicare solvency--it may be too late for us--but there are \nother people in the line who may want to use it.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you heard the objection. We asked for 12 \namendments--just a dozen, not unlimited--and there was objection.\n  I have three amendments. One is a true lockbox. I made the motion \nback in 1990, as a member of the Budget Committee, for the lockbox. We \nreported it out 19 to 1. I then went on the other side of the aisle and \ngot the late Senator John Heinz from Pennsylvania, and he and I joined \ntogether, and by 98 votes--when the present distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania said everybody, that was everybody then; all except 2--98 \nSenators voted for the lockbox, passed it, it passed the House, and it \nwas signed on November 5, 1990, by President George Bush.\n  But they do not obey it; they do just as the Abraham amendment \npresently before the body. When you use that expression, ``paying down \nthe debt,'' what they do is take the Social Security money and use it \nfor any and every thing but Social Security. That is what is occurring.\n  We presently owe Social Security $857 billion. That is why I have \nthree amendments.\n  The true lockbox is to keep a reserve, as we require under the 1994 \nPension Reform Act for corporate America; I say we are going to do the \nsame thing for Government America.\n  I have a second amendment with respect to actually getting a return \nsince we are using Social Security money. We only get a 5-percent \nreturn on these special Treasury securities. Standard & Poor's shows \nfrom 1990 to 1998 the real return on private securities is 14 percent \nand the nominal return is 18 percent.\n  Since we passed this in 1926, over the 72-year period, including the \nDepression, we have a 10.9-percent return on average.\n  So I think if you are going to use our money, do not use it on the \ncheap, do not get a free ride. Pay in the 10.9 percent rather than the \n5.6 percent, and we begin to rejuvenate Social Security rather than \ndrain it. Otherwise, I want to cut out the monkeyshines of the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, calling over to the Congressional Budget \nOffice and saying: Give me $10 billion more. How does he do it? He uses \ndifferent economic assumptions.\n  Under the law, under section 301(g) of the Budget Act, they are \nrequired to use the same economic assumptions as contained in the \nbudget resolution. But rather than maintaining those particular \nassumptions, they just make new assumptions. We had nothing to do with \nit. I am on the Budget Committee. We were never called or notified or \nanything else of the kind. All of a sudden we find out there is $10 \nbillion left for defense. There is another $3 billion for \ntransportation, another $1 billion. Already we have busted the caps, \njust by a telephone call, $14 billion.\n\n  I have three amendments. I am ready to offer them, but they won't let \nus offer them. That is why I am not voting for cloture. Everybody ought \nto understand what is going on. They won't let it be treated as an \nunlimited measure, as we always have had discourse in the Senate in my \nalmost 33 years, until this kind of control. We had to fight to get up \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. We had to hold up all the appropriations \nbills. Now we can't even get an objective discussion of Social Security \nbecause they know how to gear it. They have it geared where they are \ngoing to pay down the debt, always talking lockbox, lockbox, lockbox.\n  They are in violation right now of the 13301 lockbox, and they will \ncontinue to do so. It is all politics, election 2000.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague. I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from \nMissouri, one of the sponsors of this legislation, I remind the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and the Senator from South Carolina, the President \nspoke in favor of the Social Security lockbox. He said he wanted a \nSocial Security lockbox, period. He didn't talk about Medicare.\n  Nobody is talking about Medicare. No one in this town has talked \nabout commingling two separate trust funds. I don't know what kind of \ngreat admission the Senator from Pennsylvania supposedly made. It is \nsomething that is obvious to every taxpayer. There are two separate \ntrust funds, one for Medicare and one for Social Security.\n  To suggest that we should commingle those funds is a very dangerous \nsuggestion. I think that is what the Senator from New Jersey is \nintimating. That is not what the President wants. That is not what the \nHouse wants, Democrats and Republicans. It is certainly not what we \nwant.\n  If the Senator from New Jersey is suggesting that, I think he is \nalone on a very dangerous suggestion and one that is not healthy for \neither fund. That is certainly something we will not allow to have \nhappen in the Senate.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his insightful comments. There are two distinct funds. To commingle \nthose funds would be irresponsible--not only irresponsible, but it \nwould go against the intentions of the American people in developing \nthose two separate funds for separate purposes. I believe we should \nproceed to do what we responsibly should do with the money we have \ntaken from the American people for Social Security, and that is to make \nsure that we spend the money for Social Security, for which we taxed \nthe American people saying we would use it for Social Security.\n  We have spent a little time this morning in the Senate jargon of \nexchanges on procedure. It is enough to make the head of a Philadelphia \nlawyer swim, with all deference to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The \nAmerican people are not interested in convoluted explanations of Senate \nprocedure. They want to know why is it that this body alone stands \nbetween them and the integrity of protecting Social Security resources \nfor the exclusive use of Social Security.\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\n  They have heard the President of the United States come forward--\nbelatedly come forward, but he has come forward--and say: I want a \nlockbox for Social Security. Those are his words. Not a lockbox for \nSocial Security that starts doing other things for other trust \naccounts, a lockbox for Social Security.\n  They have watched as the House of Representatives voted 416 to 12. \nTalk about bipartisan support; talk about a near unanimous vote. You \nhave it in the House of Representatives. They see on the Republican \nside of the Senate a very strong desire, reflected now in our sixth \neffort to get the Democrats to break the filibuster against reserving \nSocial Security taxes for the use of Social Security. We are determined \nto keep voting to break this logjam. The American people have seen that \neveryone wants this: The President, the overwhelming majority of House \nDemocrats, and Republicans, all but 12 of a 435-Member body want a \nlockbox, and we need it in the Senate.\n\n  President Clinton's budget this year, prior to his endorsement of the \nlockbox, would have spent $158 billion out of the Social Security trust \nfund over the next 5 years. That is the kind of thing we need to guard \nagainst. The President has now said we need to guard against that.\n  In March, Senator Domenici and I introduced S. 502, the Protect \nSocial Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a point of \norder preventing Congress from spending any Social Security dollars for \nnon-Social Security purposes. In April, the Senate budget resolution \nincluded language endorsing the idea of locking away the Social \nSecurity surplus. The language in the Budget Act passed unanimously. \nThose on the other side of the aisle have passed this language already, \nincluding the point of order process. Also in April, Senators Abraham, \nDomenici, and I introduced the Social Security lockbox amendment, about \nwhich we have been talking today.\n  In May, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed \nCongressman Herger's measure to protect the Social Security surplus, \nand the vote there was 416 to 12. That is an amazing vote for the House \nof Representatives.\n  In late June, after Senate Democrats had blocked four efforts to \nproceed to the lockbox, after Senate Democrats had said, we won't let \nyou move to this, President Clinton announced that he had changed his \nposition and that he finally supported a lockbox that would protect 100 \npercent of the Social Security surplus. His quote is this: ``Social \nSecurity taxes should be saved for Social Security, period.'' Not \nSocial Security taxes should be saved for Social Security and tax cuts, \nno, and Medicare, no, and anything else; it is Social Security, period. \nThat happens to be what Senator Abraham, along with Senator Domenici \nand I, has brought to the floor as an amendment. That happens to be \nwhat we are asking Senate Democrats to allow us to move forward on.\n  A few days after the President's announcement, we obtained a motion \nto proceed on the lockbox. But now we are faced, again, with the \nprospect of Senate Democrats blocking a forward motion on this lockbox \nconcept. The House has voted for it. The President has come out in \nfavor of it. Senate Republicans support it. The American people are \ndemanding it. Senate Democrats still stand in the way.\n  Over the next 5 years, Social Security taxes will bring in an \nestimated $776 billion in surpluses--not just in revenue, $776 billion \nin surpluses. The lockbox would protect every dollar of those current \nSocial Security surpluses for future obligations to America's retirees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Would the Senator from Missouri like additional time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senator from Missouri is yielded whatever time he \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have five times previously been \ndenied this, in spite of the House vote, in spite of the President's \nendorsement, in spite of the overwhelming support of the American \npeople. I ask Members of this body to vote to give us the opportunity \nto make the progress necessary to protect 100 percent of the Social \nSecurity surpluses so they can be used to strengthen, and provide \nintegrity to, the Social Security system.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for this opportunity to speak, and \nI thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, under a quorum call, how is the time \ncharged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be charged to the side that requests \nthe quorum call.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I gather the Senator from New Jersey does \nnot choose to yield time at this point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Then I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I won't even take 5 minutes. I want to \nshare some of the frustration I have about where we are, trying to move \nforward with what I think is one of the most important issues before us \nand, of course, that is Social Security. Everybody is talking about it, \nof course, and they say, oh, yes, we want to do something. When the \ntime comes, how many times have we been frustrated in trying to get to \nwhat is essentially the first step to do something about Social \nSecurity? That, of course, is to have a lockbox, take the money coming \nin for Social Security and put it there so that we can do something \nwith Social Security.\n  So this is clearly the first step that we have to take. I think this \nis the fifth time we have been trying to move forward with this. Each \ntime all the people on the other side of the aisle say they are for \nSocial Security, and the President says he is for Social Security, but \nthey never want to do anything. I guess maybe this is part of the \nfrustration that has been building up over the last month or so, and \nthis week there has been frustration.\n  I think it is time to invoke cloture and move forward on the lockbox \nissue to make sure the American people who are paying into Social \nSecurity, particularly young people who are starting to work and \nputting their money aside, will have some hope that there will be \nbenefits for them. And we do that only by moving forward with our \nlockbox. I suggest that we do that. I thank the Senator for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Who yields time? If no \none yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time remains on \neach side. We want to reserve some time for the Senator from New Mexico \nto close on our side, and I wanted to know how much that would be \nbecause we do want to make a closing argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 10 minutes remaining, and the \nDemocrats have almost 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nRepublicans have 10 minutes and the minority has 16 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 9 minutes 30 seconds; the \nminority has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to use 3\\1/2\\ minutes, if I might.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition. The \nAmerican people, by overwhelming odds, would like us to take every \nsingle penny of the Social Security that belongs to the Social Security \ntrust fund and lock it up so it can't be spent. The issue is not only a \nRepublican issue; the President of the United States has said we should \nlock it up. He didn't say lock up something for Medicare; he said lock \nup the trust funds for Social Security, period.\n  Senator Daschle, leader of the minority, said very recently that \nthere ought to be some common ground. We ought to lock up the Social \nSecurity trust fund. What are we doing on the floor? We have six times \ntried to get an amendment up--not a bill, not a final action but an \namendment, after which you can have amendments to your heart's desire.\n  We can't get the other side to agree that we will do that. We will \nhave limited debate on that amendment, after which they can have all \nthe debate and all the amendments they wish. It is only the amendment \nthat we would like to get voted on. Why? Because it is time that, \nrather than talking about making sure we don't spend under the pressure \nof emergencies and all kinds of other things, we don't spend the Social \nSecurity trust fund money.\n  Now, the President of the United States came our way already. He said \nlock up 100 percent. At one time in his budget, he said lock up 62 \npercent. He came with us and said lock up every single penny.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get a vote on \ndoing that, after which time, if the Democrats see fit, they can muddy \nthe water and bring up amendments on other issues, and if we had time \ntoday, we could debate the foolhardy issue that even Democrats think \nmakes no sense--that we should take the surplus that belongs to the \npeople of the United States and put it into the Medicare trust fund \nwith IOUs to be paid for by increased taxes on our children later on. \nWe can debate that if you would like. But that is not the issue.\n  The issue is Social Security money, the senior citizens' pension \nmoney. Time is wasting. The pressures to use it are growing. The \nopportunities to come to the floor and say let's spend it, with the \npassage of each day, are getting closer and closer. Somebody will say \nwe need this for something. Who knows what. It could be agricultural \npolicy for America or any kind of thing you can dream up.\n  I say to my friends on the other side, let's get on with it and let's \nclose the debate on the amendment. Then we can open the debate after \nthat vote occurs on anything you wish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from New \nMexico on what he has said. Social Security money is for Social \nSecurity. It should not be used for anything else. Now is the time to \nnail this thing down so no question will arise in the future. There are \ndemands now for everything, but this is a particular trust fund. It \nbelongs to the Social Security fund, and we should keep it there and \nnot let it get away. I again commend the able Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are debating a proposition that I \nthink probably lends some confusion to the recognition of what it is we \nare attempting to do. One can call it a lockbox, a safe deposit box; \ncall it what you will. I say we want a lockbox, too, but we want a \nlockbox that is without holes, without rust, without a broken lock on \nit. We want a lockbox that is secure, that holds our valuables, and \nthat no one can get their hands on, and that is the Social Security \nlockbox that cannot be used.\n  Our friends over there say they want to keep it from being a pot for \npeople to reach into when they want to spend money. The fact of the \nmatter is that they create a condition as a result of the structure of \ntheir bill, their proposal, that says that if the economy turns sour, \nin fact, perhaps this country could be put into default, unless Social \nSecurity is used, because of overarching criteria, then that is what is \ngoing to happen. Social Security will be that safe deposit box that is \nnow open for other purposes in Government.\n  I hear the plea for letting the debate get started. But we have been \nwaiting to hear from the majority leader--our leader and the majority \nleader; that is where these discussions take place--that he has a \ncommitment that we can offer amendments.\n  We have a commitment from the Senator from Pennsylvania. He said he \nhad no objection to our having amendments. But we haven't heard that \nfrom the top.\n  That is what we are asking for; that is what I tried to do with a \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  I said: OK. Let's talk about a dozen amendments that our two leaders \ncan agree upon. Let's talk about that. Let's put that aside, and then \nwe can end the debate. But they do not want to do that.\n  The majority has the upper hand. That is life in the Senate. They are \nnot going to let us get our amendments up because--even though they \nsay, yes, you will have all the amendments you want--the fact is there \nis a system here. Everybody in this Chamber knows there is a system. It \nis called the amendment tree. Once you fill it up with first-degree \namendments followed by second-degree amendments, the majority leader \nalways has the privilege of initial recognition, and you shut down the \namendment possibilities.\n  Let's stop fooling each other. Let's stop trying to fool the people \nout there in the countryside. Do they want Medicare included as a \nsecurity measure, as a safe deposit measure, as a lockbox measure? Ask \nthem. Let's have a vote on that. Let's have it straight up or down. Do \nyou want Medicare?\n  I heard a statement made today that, no, the Republicans don't want \nMedicare included. Let the public hear that. Let the public hear that \nthe one measure for protecting health may not be of concern to them. It \nis fine with me. I just want to make sure the record is clear that \npeople understand what we are saying.\n  Look at this. The Republican House committee proposes a tax cut of \n$1.19 trillion. In order to accomplish that, they are going to have to \ntake $55 billion from the Social Security surplus and $964 billion from \nthe onbudget surplus.\n  We are using arcane language to try to pull the wool over the \npeople's eyes.\n  Say it straight. They on that side of the line don't want Medicare \nincluded. We want Medicare included on this side of the line. We want \nto lock up Social Security, and we all agree a lockbox is a desirable \nthing, a place where those funds are going to be protected. We are \nsaying you can't touch the Social Security surplus.\n  Remember this: In 10 years, forecasts being as they are, we expect to \nhave almost a $1 trillion surplus in non-Social Security funds. That is \npretty astounding. Imagine, we could be out of public debt in 2015, \nbarely 15 years from now--not only the public debt but anything. It \nwould be an unheard of condition in terms of a major government around \nthe world. The fact of the matter is it would be certainly a benchmark \nthat people never thought would arrive.\n  We are trying to do it. We are saying we support a modest tax cut for \nthose who really need it--a targeted tax cut for child care, savings \naccounts, and health care for the elderly. But friends over here want \nto use it to spread the tax cut around for all of the benefit. It would \ngo largely to the wealthiest in the country.\n  I once again ask if we can get an agreement. It can be done away from \nthe microphones or it can be done in front of the microphones. Give us \nthe assurance that we can have amendments and not be barred by second-\ndegree amendments and not barred by other parliamentary procedures. We \nwould be happy to consider a different position, but we are not going \nto do it knowing full well that once we step over the line we are in a \ntrap that is going to silence our voices in terms of any modifications. \nWe are talking about just the motion to proceed. Just let us get \nstarted.\n  The fact of the matter is this amendment would be a substitute for an \nunderlying bill. It would be the bill itself. We have to be on guard \nfor the public\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\ninterest. That is where we are going to stand.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture until we understand \nfully what this debate is about for the benefit of the public.\n  It has been suggested that we are filibustering it. We just had a \nmajor bill go through this Chamber yesterday, and we were allowed a \nlimited number of amendments. In 3 days, we had 11 amendments that were \nconsidered. That was it. That was the most we could negotiate, instead \nof as it used to be with an open process. If it took a long time, it \ntook a long time.\n  I remember working through the night until 6 in the morning. We don't \ndo that anymore. We shut down nice and early so we are not too tired at \nthe end of the day.\n  But I say the time is the property of the public. They let us use it. \nWe ought to use it fully instead of shutting down the debate and \nshutting down the opportunity for the American people to understand \nwhat is really taking place.\n  It is tough. It is tough because the route that is being used is kind \nof inside-the-beltway stuff.\n  How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes on his side, and the \nmajority side has 6 minutes as well.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the unanimous consent that we are \noperating under had a call for a vote at 10:30. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey said we should have \nMedicare included in this lockbox proposal. The President of the United \nStates said: I can't believe the Republicans don't want to include it. \nHe just finds that incredulous.\n  The Senator should talk to his own President. His own President \ndoesn't want Medicare included in this lockbox proposal. The President \nhas been clear.\n  Social Security money should be used for Social Security, and once \nyou say it can be used for Medicare, it can be used for Medicare, it \ncan be used for education, or for whatever.\n  I can tell you that Social Security recipients want Social Security \nto be used for Social Security. They do not want to expand the program \nto include other things. In fact, one of the biggest complaints I hear \nfrom seniors is that if you would quit taking money out of Social \nSecurity for every program that comes down the line, Social Security \nwould be OK.\n  I think if we took a poll it would be overwhelming not to include any \nprogram--any program--other than Social Security in Social Security.\n  I also find it incredulous that he said there is a hole in the Social \nSecurity lockbox.\n  We wrote a provision in this bill; if we were in a recession, because \nwe hold the debt limit, there could be a default on the credit of the \nUnited States. Is the Senator suggesting we should allow the United \nStates to default? Isn't that what the provision says? I ask the \nSenator from New Mexico if he can explain that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. The Secretary of the Treasury made some \nobjections to the original bill because it was too rigidly drawn in \ncase of emergencies. We took care of that.\n  We also took care of the problem we had with reference to the end of \nthe year and the way the surpluses come and go because of the way you \ncollect taxes in large quantities in other parts of the year a little \nbit.\n  We fix that, too.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So the Senator from New Jersey, when he objected to our \n``hold'' on the lockbox, his objection is counter to what the \nadministration demanded of us to fix in our lockbox?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't know why it is not clear, but \nwe have said and we mean that Social Security funds, surpluses, are \nsacrosanct. They are untouchable.\n  The Medicare solvency we want to create comes out of the non-Social \nSecurity budget surplus. We have talked about this 60 times. Apparently \nthe message has not gotten through. We want to do it. We want to deal \nwith it.\n  By the admission of some on that side, Medicare isn't part of the \nthinking in this. If it is not part of the thinking now, I wonder when \nit will be.\n  There is also an opportunity, if I may suggest with a degree of \ntemerity, that Social Security funds can be used in the name of Social \nSecurity reform. That is kind of a catch-all. It says if we can't get \nit one way, we will get it another way. We face the specter of a huge \ntax cut that is being proposed. It is not much different here from on \nthe House side. We are talking about something close to $800 billion.\n  We understand each other very clearly. The question is, Does the \npublic understand why we are? We want to save Social Security, and we \nwant to save Medicare. We want to increase the solvency of Medicare, \nand we are committed to a reform of both programs. During that period, \nit is said by the President that we will extend the life of both of \nthese programs even longer than the 50-some years for Social Security \nand the 20 years for Medicare.\n  That is where we are, my friends.\n  If we are ready to conclude the debate, I am prepared to yield back \nour time--if we are prepared.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We are not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time does the majority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 3 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico such time as he \nconsumes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to clarify this from the \nstandpoint of what a Democrat on the other side who is well versed in \nthis had to say about this issue. On March 22, 1999, Senator Breaux, on \na CBS newscast, avoided criticism of Clinton. Senator Breaux said: Some \npeople want an issue of Medicare rather than solving the problem. They \ntalk about wedge issues.\n  Senator Breaux added that one of the problems is that some people \nwant an issue out of Medicare rather than solving the problem. They \ntalk about wedge issues.\n  Are you going to have a tax cut or are you going to save Medicare?\n  That is old politics, he said. I think the American people are tired \nof it. They want us to solve the problem, not give them political \nslogans.\n  Now, to stand on the floor of the Senate and even imply that the \nproposed tax cuts in the budget resolution of $782 billion over a \ndecade would in any way infringe upon the Social Security trust funds \nis to confuse the public of America, and it is exactly what the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana is saying--sloganizing, making an \nissue by slogans.\n  Secondly, if there is any implication that there are not sufficient \nreserves in our budget to take care of Medicare, that is an absolute \nerror and an untruth. There are huge amounts of money left over after \nthe tax cut. In fact, it approaches $450 billion that is not allocated \nto anything during the next decade other than what we choose to use it \nfor in the Congress.\n  I remind everyone, the President said we can fix Medicare with how \nmuch? Forty-eight billion dollars will give us prescription drugs, he \nsaid. We had $90 billion left over in our budget resolution that was \nunspent, and now, with the new estimates, there is more money there. We \ncan fix Medicare, put this money in a lockbox, have the tax cut, do \nthat by the end of this year, and fix things for American seniors on \nboth fronts: Lock up the money that is theirs and fix Medicare.\n  To talk about this trust fund as if it has something to do with \nfixing Medicare is an absolutely erroneous stating of the situation in \nthe Senate and in the fiscal policy of America.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will wrap up by using leader time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Then I can use the rest of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the overwhelming recommendation by the \nHouse Republicans says use Social Security funds if necessary.\n  But there is an issue beyond that. It is quite apparent, if you use \n$792 billion for tax cuts, it reduces the possibility\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nthat you can pay down the debt. That is where we would like to go. We \nwant to get rid of this constant threat of higher interest rates. We \nwant to be able to be free to take care of the needs we have to operate \nour society, our country.\n  There is no confusion about where we are. We want to protect Social \nSecurity. We want to protect Medicare out of non-Social Security \nsurpluses. That is where we are. One ought not confuse it with \ndiscussions about other things: A, Do you want to protect Medicare? B, \nHow? That is the question. That is what we would like to have answered.\n  I hope my colleagues will stick together and say we want to have an \nopen debate, we want to continue to discuss the issues, and not to be \nshut down on this pretense that this cloture vote will take care of the \nproblems.\n  The majority leader is on the floor. We all have great respect for \nhim. We would love to be able to be assured of amendments. I know our \nleader has been interested in a discussion of that and is awaiting the \nmajority leader's response. If we knew that, perhaps we could be \nreacting differently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need for \nleader time. I know Members expect to vote at 10:30. I will try to be \nbrief.\n  I am compelled to make a couple of points. First of all, our \nRepublican budget plan reduced the national debt by $1.9 trillion. That \nis the most significant and the only real contribution of reducing the \ndebt in our lifetime. The point I want to make is, the American people \noverwhelmingly support the idea of the Social Security lockbox.\n  After resistance, the President even adopted that exact word, that he \nsupported a Social Security lockbox. I don't know what the numbers are \nbut in the high seventies, 80 percent of the American people think this \nis something we should do: Take all of the Social Security taxes, the \nFICA tax, and set them aside for what they were intended--Social \nSecurity, and only Social Security, a lockbox.\n  OK, so we advocated that--Senators Domenici, Abraham, Santorum, and \nothers. And finally the President apparently checked the polls and \nsaid: Oh, yeah, me, too; I want a lockbox.\n  Then the House voted for a lockbox--not as tight as this one, not as \ngood as this one--with a vote of 415-12. Even the Democrats in the \nHouse of Representatives voted overwhelmingly without a lot of \nshenanigans, playing around, distractions, and a dozen amendments. They \nvoted for the lockbox. Apparently they got serious.\n  Now, here comes the point: We go down in our bipartisan meeting to \nthe White House on Monday to meet with the President. I am hopeful. I \nam optimistic. In fact, I come out and say: Yes, maybe we can have a \nlockbox; work together on Medicare reform; we can get some tax relief.\n  Let me tell Members what happened. We go in there. The first subject \nI brought up was the Social Security lockbox. The President said: We \nneed to do that. I'm with you. We can do that.\n  Senator Daschle said: Yeah, we ought to do that.\n  What happened?\n  I go out and say: We are going to get this done.\n  The President hasn't lifted a pinkie since--nothing. All he has done \nis run around and whine and threaten that he is going to veto a \nlegitimate Patients' Bill of Rights bill, the health care needs of the \npeople of this country. That is all he has done all week--maybe a \nfundraiser or two, but he has done nothing to help us get a Social \nSecurity lockbox.\n  So I invite, in fact I challenge, the President: Talk to the \nDemocrats in the Senate, Mr. President. They are the only obstacle to \nsetting aside Social Security in a lockbox for Social Security.\n  That is what I have to deal with all the time. I get a lot of soft \nsoap: Oh, yes, we will work together; we will get it done. And then \nnothing. If the President wants a Social Security lockbox, make one \ncall, Mr. President, one call. Call Senator Daschle and say: Get it \ndone. And we will get it done next Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We yield back our time.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). All time is yielded back. Under \nthe previous order, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion to \ninvoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     amendment No. 297 to Calendar No. 89, S. 557, a bill to \n     provide guidance for the designation of emergencies as a part \n     of the budget process:\n         Trent Lott, Pete Domenici, Rod Grams, Michael Crapo, Bill \n           Frist, Michael Enzi, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Judd \n           Gregg, Strom Thurmond, Chuck Hagel, Thad Cochran, Rick \n           Santorum, Paul Coverdell, James Inhofe, Bob Smith, \n           Wayne Allard.\n\n\n                            Call Of The Roll\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. There is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am surprised by this objection by our \nDemocratic colleagues. This issue concerns two very important matters: \none, the intelligence authorization for the year, and also the very \nimportant Department of Energy reforms as a result of the Chinese \nespionage that has occurred during the last several years within the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Needless to say, this issue needs to be debated in the Senate. I am \ntruly sorry our Democratic colleagues do not want to debate it at this \ntime.\n  I have urged the President, the National Security Adviser, Sandy \nBerger, and the Secretary of Energy to engage this issue. The headline \nshould read: Senate resolves how in the future the Department of Energy \nwill handle these matters to stop the leaks of very important nuclear \nweapons information from our labs.\n  That should be the headline, that we are working together to resolve \nthis problem, instead of the situation where the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Energy is still trying to have a diffused system of \nreporting. There should be only one person who is reported to on the \nmatters of national security at our nuclear labs, and that is the \nSecretary of Energy, and it should go straight to him and from him to \nthe President of the United States. Surely we can work this out.\n  Having said that, I now move to proceed to H.R.----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, there are ongoing \ndiscussions. There was a hearing today in the Senate on this very \nissue. There are meetings that are going to take place today on that \nissue. I have spoken to the Secretary of Energy as recently as last \nevening.\n  We are really trying to work something out. I think parties on both \nsides are trying to work something out. I think it would be to \neveryone's best interest that when we do bring this up, there is some \ndegree of certainty that it will be resolved.\n  We also understand, without any question, the importance of the \nintelligence authorization bill. Senator Kerrey, the ranking member of \nthis committee, has expressed, on numerous occasions, how important it \nis we move this legislation. So I say to the leader and Members of this \nbody, we are doing our utmost to resolve this issue as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I address the Senate regarding Executive \nCalendar No. 135, the nomination by the President of the United States \nof Richard Holbrooke of New York to be the Representative of the United \nStates of America to the sessions of the General Assembly. That was \npresented to the Senate by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Mr. Helms, on June 30, 1999. Following the \nfavorable reporting by the Committee. It is now pending.\n  I have been in this magnificent body, privileged by the State of \nVirginia, for 21 years. I fully recognize the rights of Senators to \nplace holds on nominations. I respect that right. I respect them for \nthe reasons they have done it. I have done it myself, although \nsparingly. But in my judgment, the urgency for the Senate to address \nthis nomination is increasing daily. I urge the Senate to proceed to an \nup-or-down vote because the United States of America, in my judgment, \nis increasingly in need of having a very powerful voice at the U.N.\n  Ambassador Holbrooke, in my judgment, is eminently qualified. He is \nwell experienced with the complex issues in the Balkans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks there be \nprinted an article in today's Washington Post.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. It covers the following:\n\n       Five weeks after the end of bitter ethnic war and the \n     arrival of NATO troops in Kosovo, growing confusion among \n     Western officials, local politicians and Kosovo's population \n     about who controls the province is hampering efforts to begin \n     rebuilding its tattered economy and political structure and \n     social services.\n\n  The essence of this article captures a concern of this Senator, that \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces, be they wearing the uniform of \nthe United States or the uniform of our other NATO allies, all under \nthe command of an American officer, General Clark, are at increasing \npersonal risk because the United Nations is not able, perhaps for valid \nreasons, perhaps for invalid reasons, to take up their allocation of \nresponsibilities and relieve the burdens from the troops so they can \nrestrict their responsibilities to professional military duties.\n  I believe we should proceed with this nomination, have a vote up or \ndown. Hopefully, this nomination will be approved by the Senate, and we \ncan have a strong voice to enter into this very serious situation in \nKosovo. We have invested billions of dollars. We have put at risk tens \nof thousands of lives, the men and women of the Armed Forces of this \ncountry and other countries, to reach the conclusion we now have of \nrelative stability, in clear contrast to the cruel ethnic cleansing \ninflicted upon the people of Kosovo.\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\n  I think the time has come. I ask those who have reasons to be further \nconsidering this nomination--I am actively working to resolve those \nproblems--to weigh the risk to the men and women of the armed forces of \nall nations involved in Kosovo.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 16, 1999]\n\n                   Kosovo's New Adversary: Confusion\n\n                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       Pristina, Yugoslavia, July 15--Five weeks after the end of \n     a bitter ethnic war and the arrival of NATO troops in Kosovo, \n     growing confusion among Western officials, local politicians \n     and Kosovo's population about who controls the province is \n     hampering efforts to begin rebuilding its tattered economy, \n     political structures and social services.\n       The Western allies are preparing an ambitious multibillion-\n     dollar program to repair war damage and bring stability to \n     Kosovo and the surrounding region for the first time in at \n     least a decade. But the effort has already become bogged down \n     by major disagreements among the rival claimants to power in \n     the Serbian province.\n       In the resulting power vacuum, Kosovo's myriad problems are \n     multiplying. Thousands of vacant buildings, homes and \n     businesses are being taken over by squatters, some of whom \n     are investing in new, unlicensed enterprises whose legal \n     basis is unresolved. No one is sure who owns public \n     enterprises or who is to benefit from their revenues now that \n     most Serbian officials have left and hundreds of thousands of \n     ethnic Albanian refugees have returned.\n       With municipal offices otherwise unoccupied, former members \n     of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army are taking up positions \n     as local administrators even though they lack any legal \n     authority. Even so, the former rebels are making decisions \n     and issuing edicts whose long-term viability is open to \n     question.\n       In the meantime, fire departments have no trucks, hospitals \n     have no ambulances or equipment, gas stations have no fuel. \n     Electricity and water supplies function only intermittently, \n     and telephone service is available only in parts of Pristina, \n     the Kosovo capital, and a few other towns. Without a trained \n     police force, ``the level of lawlessness is stable on the \n     high side,'' one senior Western official said.\n       But no one knows who to complain to--or where.\n       According to NATO, the United Nations--officially in charge \n     of reestablishing a civilian government--is the top \n     authority. But almost no one here seems to heed, or even \n     recognize, the U.N. presence. Many civilians still regard \n     NATO and its 32,400 troops as the ultimate arbiter on civil \n     matters. Other residents say unelected ethnic Albanian \n     representatives, led by KLA members, are in charge.\n       Moreover, the KLA and the United Nations have begun to \n     joust over matters both large and small. In one such \n     encounter, Jay Carter, the senior U.N. official in charge of \n     civilian government here, told a senior KLA official that all \n     state-owned property in Kosovo is now under U.N. control. But \n     Visar Reka, the KLA official, said he responded that ``You're \n     not the owner, you're just the manager; Albanians are the \n     owners.''\n       Reka and others who work in the offices of KLA political \n     leader Hashim Thaqi, who has been named prime minister of a \n     provisional government, say they have the authority to run \n     the province until elections next spring. But U.N. officials \n     refuse to recognize this claim. ``To me, [Thaqi] represents \n     the KLA, not the government; we are clear on this,'' said \n     Brazilian diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello, the interim U.N. \n     administrator in Kosovo.\n       Even so, the United Nations itself is unsure how far its \n     legal mandate extends and recently asked its lawyers to \n     review what authority its officials are entitled to assert. \n     In particular, the lawyers are looking at whether revenues \n     from state-owned enterprises, such as electric and water \n     utilities, must be placed in escrow until Kosovo's legal \n     status is resolved or can be spent without input from \n     authorities in Belgrade, the capital of both Yugoslavia and \n     its dominant republic, Serbia. Kosovo's final legal status--\n     whether it will remain part of Serbia, for example--is likely \n     to take years to resolve.\n       For now, no one knows for sure what Yugoslavia--and its \n     Serbian leadership--owns or is entitled to control in Kosovo. \n     ``Ownership is one of the toughest problems we face,'' said \n     de Mello, who is being replaced this week by Bernard Kouchner \n     of France. ``If it is state-owned, it is the U.N.'s, at least \n     during the interim administration. If it's private, we are in \n     serious trouble.''\n       Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority is reasserting itself in \n     the wake of the withdrawal of Serb-led forces and the flight \n     of tens of thousands of Serbs from the province. More than \n     660,000--or roughly 85 percent--of the ethnic Albanians who \n     fled or were expelled from the province have now returned, \n     each expecting to have considerably more say in Kosovo's \n     governance.\n       Meanwhile, the government in Belgrade has complained \n     repeatedly that provisions in the June 12 cease-fire accord \n     offering Serbia at least a token role in policing borders and \n     monuments in Kosovo have not been respected. It has also \n     denounced talk of creating an independent currency for the \n     province and has claimed rights to revenues from state-owned \n     mines and power plants.\n       Much of the confusion stems from the uncertain status of \n     the agreement signed by ethnic Albanian leaders and Western \n     officials in France last March, which set out in dozens of \n     pages what the new government here would look like. But \n     Serbian officials never accepted the document, and nothing \n     was written to replace it when the cease-fire accord was \n     signed. Since then, the United Nations, NATO and local \n     leaders have had to renegotiate which of its provisions will \n     be followed.\n       KLA officials, for example, complain that the United \n     Nations got off on the wrong foot by demanding that jobs at \n     city halls, utilities and state-owned media be apportioned \n     equally among Serbs and ethnic Albanians. The intent was to \n     demonstrate even-handedness and to help persuade Kosovo Serbs \n     to stay here. But the plan angered ethnic Albanians, who \n     expected that jobs would be divided according to their \n     proportion of the overall population--now hovering at 95 \n     percent.\n       ``It means a new slavery,'' said Ram Buje, a KLA political \n     official now employed in Thaqui's office, of the proposed 50-\n     50 split. When asked about the split last Friday, de Mello \n     indicated he was unaware of it and called inappropriate. By \n     Sunday, U.N. officials agreed that 330 ethnic Albanians will \n     eventually work alongside just 60 Serbs at the city hall in \n     Pristina, a likely model for other towns. But the city hall \n     was closed Tuesday after the most prominent Serb there was \n     badly beaten by an ethnic Albanian mob, which claimed he had \n     committed atrocities during the war.\n       The ethnic Albanian leadership has not been the only source \n     of friction for the U.N. mission. A U.N.-appointed \n     consultative council was to have been established Tuesday, \n     which would have the power to confirm the selection of mayors \n     for each of Kosovo's 29 municipalities. It was supposed to \n     have two representatives from longstanding ethnic Albanian \n     political parties, one from the KLA, two independent ethnic \n     Albanians, two Serbs, a Turk and a Muslim. The Belgrade \n     government's local representative was not invited, de Mello \n     said, ``because the others won't come if he is there.''\n       But some KLA officials last week created a new party that \n     will not be represented, and the two Serbs picked by de \n     Mello--Serbian Orthodox Church Bishop Artemije Radosavljevic \n     and Serbian Resistance Movement leader Momcilo Trajkovic--\n     announced last weekend they would boycott the commission on \n     grounds that Serbs and Serbian interest are not being \n     adequately protected. As a result the council has yet to get \n     off the ground.\n       De Mello acknowledged that it remains to be seen how the \n     council will be replicated ``at the district or . . . \n     municipal level, where democratic institutions will truly be \n     tested.'' Buje, the Thaqi aide, has in the meantime stepped \n     into the vacuum by appointing mayors for 25 municipalities--\n     all but the four in which Serbs compose a majority of the \n     local population.\n       ``We are the people who know all the business,'' Buje said, \n     but the government ``is a mosaic. We know this is an \n     international protectorate, but it's all mixed.''\n\n\n                         Who's Running Kosovo?\n\n       The U.N.? Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. administrator in \n     Kosovo, faces a situation in which disputes over control have \n     bogged down reconstruction efforts.\n       NATO? Many in Kosovo still regard NATO, commanded by Gen. \n     Wesley K. Clark, as the ultimate arbiter on civic matters, \n     but NATO says it's the United Nations.\n       The KLA? Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaqi says \n     the rebels have authority over Kosovo for now, but the United \n     Nations refuses to recognize this claim.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I echo what my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said.\n  It is not wise policy nor responsible governance for the greatest \npower on earth to hold captive one of the most important and \nresponsible positions in this government, a position that has an effect \nand consequence to all of our allies as well as our adversaries. It is \na constitutional mandate for this body to act with responsibility, \naside from dispatch, and to move on this. I personally think holds are \nirresponsible. I understand the tradition of this body. I am new to \nthis body, but I would go so far as to say, if you wish to hold \nsomeone, have the courage to take a stand on the floor of the Senate. \nCome before the American public and say why that hold is to be put on \nand why it is so important to hold captive such a critical position for \nthis country, for our allies, for the representation of American values \nand standards across the world.\n  To put in jeopardy our men and women in uniform who defend this \nNation, as the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nhas so directly stated, is irresponsible. I support strongly what the \nsenior Senator from Virginia is saying. This body\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nshould have the courage to bring this nomination up and vote straight \nup or down. Let every Member be recorded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the remarks so \nforcefully made by our beloved chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, \nthe Senator from Virginia, and the Senator from Nebraska, as regards \nthe nomination before us on the calendar for the position of permanent \nrepresentative to the United Nations.\n  I would like to make the point--and I have served in that role--that \nthis is a Cabinet position. It has been from the time of President \nEisenhower when Henry Cabot Lodge was in the Cabinet. It is one of the \noldest traditions of this body that a President is entitled to and must \nhave his own counselors. Be they right-minded or wrong-minded, they are \nthe President's judgment and they are his responsibility.\n  This office is a Cabinet office of the highest importance, as the \nSenator from Virginia has said, in mediating urgent international \nissues. But there is an awesome principle. Once, almost a half century \nago, the Senate did reject a Cabinet nomination of President \nEisenhower. It was not a proud moment for the Senate. We have not done \nit since, for the good reason that we ought not to do it ever.\n  I plead with the Senate to respect this prerogative of the other \nbranch. I hope I will not seem mischievous if I repeat the remarks of \nmy friend from Nebraska who said the day may come when there is a \nPresident of the other party. And indeed that could come very shortly. \nI do not predict it, but that is the way we work here. That President \nwould want to choose his Cabinet members and would be entitled to do \nso, for all the errors they may make or not. That is the constitutional \nform of government in which we live. Let us, sir, support that regime \nof two centuries, unparalleled in the history of democratic government, \nbased upon this principle of the separation of powers and the \nPresident's right to choose.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee had a briefing on the Balkan \nTask Force from the Department of Defense. I put the question to the \nuniformed officers: Is there a correlation between the absence of \nstrong leadership in the U.N. and risk to our troops? Their response \nwas a definitive yes.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8709-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8709-S8714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I recognize the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia. I thank the Senator from New York for his allowing me to \naccommodate a previously developed schedule. When I had asked for time \nduring this special order, I had anticipated being able to begin at \nabout 11, so I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n  This morning the Senate voted on a Social Security lockbox to protect \nevery dollar of Social Security, protect the surplus and the integrity \nof Social Security. We were not able to do that. We had a majority of \nthe Senate vote in favor of it, but there is still the filibuster on \nthe part of others who are unwilling to guarantee a vote on this issue.\n  The supporters of the lockbox believe the money Americans pay for \nSocial Security ought to go for Social Security, period. That happens \nto be the language of the President of the United States who has \nendorsed that position. But Social Security taxes are only one of the \nmany taxes, as we all know, that are placed upon the American people. \nToo many taxes, forms of taxation, proliferate in this place. These \ntaxes place an enormous $1.8 trillion burden on the American people \nannually. That is 1.8 trillion, trillion being a thousand billions and \na billion being a thousand millions. It is more money than one can \nvirtually imagine.\n  These taxes also bring in more money than the Government needs. It is \namazing. What we have is a Government which is charging more in taxes \nthan it needs in order to provide services. I find it interesting that \nover the next 10 years there will be a trillion dollars more than are \nneeded to provide the services we now provide.\n  Normally, if you go into a store and you give them $20 and you are \nbuying something worth $8, they give you change. When you pay in excess \nof what you need to buy the product you are getting, they give you \nchange. I think the U.S. Government ought to do that. We ought to say: \nThere is a surplus coming in. The people have paid more than is needed \nfor these services. We ought to give the money back.\n  If a store owner came to me and said: You have bought two bottles of \nmilk and you get some change from your $10 bill, but instead of the \nchange, I want to give you six more bottles of milk, I would say: Wait \na second.\n  I think the American people want some change. They want change in the \nway Government is consuming their resources. I believe it is time for \nus to begin to address the idea that we have tax relief for the \nAmerican people.\n  Never before in history have we paid as high a tax as we pay today--\nState, local, Federal taxes--and a lot of the State taxes are really \ndisguised Federal taxes. I say that because the Federal Government \nforces the State governments to do things. Then the State government \nhas to charge the people for that. The truth of the matter is, it is a \nmandate from the Federal Government. It is an expense occasioned by the \ndemand of the Federal Government through the system. And when you put \nall of our taxes together, they are higher than any time in the history \nof the country--higher than in wartime, the First World War, Second \nWorld War, Korean war, Vietnamese war, Gulf war; you name it, we are \nhigher than ever before. Now, it seems to me we ought to be asking \nourselves with whom we are at war. I had one taxpayer say to me: I \nthink you are at war with the American people, because we are taxing \nthem the way we are.\n\n  I think the American people deserve a break. The Republicans in \nCongress agree with that. We believe we should return the tax \noverpayment. Senator Roth has offered an $800 billion tax cut over the \nnext 10 years. This tax cut is deserved; it has been earned. The \nAmerican people are the ones who are responsible. This Congress didn't \ncreate the surplus. The American people earned the surplus. It is just \nas if you hand $20 to the grocer and you are entitled to change; it is \nmoney you earned.\n  It is the same with the American people who are overpaying for \nGovernment services now, creating a surplus. It is money they earned. \nThey earned it, and we should return it. So we should change the slogan \nof Washington from, ``You send it, we spend it,'' to, ``You earned it, \nwe returned it.''\n  I think one of the things we ought to do as we begin to provide \nrelief to the American people is to scrub out of our system those \nthings that are discriminatory and those things that are harmful, \npernicious punishments in the Tax Code, especially punishments for \nthings that are very important to our culture. One of those things is \nmarriage.\n  I don't believe there is an institution in this country more \nimportant to the future of America than marriage. We want people to be \nmarried. We want the durable, lasting commitments of families to \nundergird this culture with the kind of principles and responsibilities \nand values that will keep us from having really serious social \nproblems. I believe we will minimize the difficulties and trauma we \nhave in this culture if we have strong marriages, things we need to \nminimize such as the tragedies we experience.\n  What we find out when we look at our Tax Code is, for the last \nseveral years Americans have been paying a tremendous penalty in taxes \nmerely because they are married; $29 billion is paid by people as a \npenalty to the Tax Code simply because they are married, and 21 million \ncouples pay that penalty. It is an average of $1,400 per couple, per \nyear. That is over $100 a month. Think of the food, the shoes, the \nschoolbooks, the entertainment that could pay for. That is at least a \nvery nice vacation for that family. Think of the relief to families if \nwe simply say, we are not going to punish you for being married.\n  It is time for us in Congress to say that among those items of tax \nrelief,\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nwe sure ought to be doing something about the marriage penalty. This \nCRS study projected that over the next 10 years the average household \nwill be paying $5,000 extra in taxes than it needs to pay. We ought to \naddress that.\n  I think the Roth plan will return that hard-earned money to those who \nearned it, the American people. I urge the American people to call the \nCongress and urge us to give them the change they deserve, give them \ntheir money back. They earned it, and we should return it. It is time \nfor us to get together with Senator Roth and support an idea that he \nhas, and get our ideas in that measure, of refunding the $800 billion \nin tax overpayments that the American people are scheduled to make \nin just a very few years.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield now to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell of Georgia for \nasking for a special order this morning to talk about taxes, where we \nare with taxes in our country, and where the Senate Finance Committee \nand the House Ways and Means Committee are at this moment as we begin, \nwithin a few weeks, a very important national debate on reducing the \noverall tax burden for the American people.\n  For a few moments this morning, let me talk about that tax burden and \ntry to put it in context with other times in our history when the \nAmerican people cried out for tax relief and the Congress heard them \nand the Congress respectfully responded.\n  Today's total tax burden is the highest since World War II, according \nto the Office of Management and Budget. I know when I came here in the \n1980s, the World War II tax level was always used as the index. It was \nless than we had to pay during the wartime tax of World War II. At that \ntime, that was the highest ever registered in our Nation. But now we \nhave broken that mark. I will repeat that. The OMB now says that the \npeacetime tax burden of the average American taxpayer is higher than it \nhas been at any time since World War II.\n  Tax receipts as a percentage of the gross domestic product amounted \nto 20.5 percent last year, will grow to 20.6 percent this year, and \nwill reach 20.7 percent next year.\n  Recently a new administration estimate predicted the largest budget \nsurplus in the history of our country, with the highest taxes ever, and \nthe highest budget surplus ever.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed this optimistic \nforecast.\n  According to the President's estimates, last year's was the largest \nsurplus in history. It will be larger this year, and will extend for \nthe next 15 years.\n  That is a lot of optimism. But even conservative economists suggest \nthat the budget surplus, as we now know it, is going to extend well \ninto the future.\n  Over the next 10 years, a non-Social Security surplus will be at \napproximately $1.1 trillion. Over the next 15 years, the non-Social \nSecurity surplus could get as high as $2.9 trillion. Once again, these \nare reasonably conservative estimates on reasonably conservative growth \nin the Federal budget. Growing surpluses, but still no net tax cut? \nThat is what our President is saying. Look at all of this money we are \ngoing to have to spend beyond what would be considered a reasonable \nlevel of spending at the Federal level. President Clinton won't \nrecognize the income taxpayers' burdens, despite a $2.9 trillion \noverpayment over the next 15 years.\n  I am not going to talk about surpluses anymore. I am going to talk \nabout overpayment. The American taxpayer is overpaying what they should \nhave to pay for the Government they are getting at this moment. Yet \nfrom the White House there is not one word about reasonable and \nresponsible tax relief for the American taxpayer. That is why our \nSenate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee are \nfashioning tax reductions at this moment.\n  The income taxpayers' burden is the heaviest in history, in terms of \na total tax burden. The personal income tax burden stands at 9.9 \npercent of the gross domestic product, and, that is not just the \nhighest since World War II, but the highest ever. It is higher than the \n7.9 level when the President took office. It is higher than the 7.8 \nlevel of the gross domestic product when John Kennedy, a new President, \ncame into office, and said: Let's stimulate the economy by producing a \nmajor tax cut. Of course, we remember the history of that. It was not \nunlike the model that Ronald Reagan brought to office and convinced the \nCongress to produce a tax cut to stimulate the economy.\n  Our President thinks this economy is so good that you don't need to \ndo that. That is not the issue. Our economy is strong, and we want to \nkeep it strong, growing, and providing jobs. The way you do that is to \ninsure that you don't drain the American public of their ability to \nspend for their families, and to save and invest in the growth of that \nfuture economy.\n  The tax burden we have today is higher than the 9 percent level Jimmy \nCarter left office with, which produced the tax cuts, or at least the \nstimulus for the tax cuts, that Ronald Reagan brought to this Congress \nin the early 1980s.\n  It is the highest level since World War II, and that was 1946 when it \nwas 7.2 percent, and we were taxing at a high level to finance a war \neffort, the most major war effort ever conducted in the history of this \ncountry.\n  According to Clinton's own budget office, his 9.9 percent level is \nthe highest recorded level of personal income tax receipts ever reached \nin the history of this country. Clinton is the undisputed champion of \npersonal income tax burden.\n  You are the undisputed champion of that personal income tax burden \nand not one word from you, Mr. President, on a right and responsible \nlevel of tax reduction on the highest burden ever in the history of our \ncountry.\n  Under President Clinton, personal income tax receipts have grown at \nan average annual rate of 9.7 percent. That is 75 percent faster than \nthe economy's average annual growth rate of 5.3 percent. That is faster \nthan the wages' and salaries' average annual growth rate of 5.6 \npercent. In other words, Mr. President, your tax rate increase is \noutstripping all levels of growth in this country--both personal and \npublic. That is faster than personal income's average annual growth \nrate of 5.2 percent. That is faster than payroll taxes' annual growth \nrate of 5.6 percent. That is 4\\1/2\\ times faster than the 2 percent \naverage annual growth rate of gross private savings of this country.\n\n  Highest surpluses in high history; highest non-Social Security \nsurplus in history; highest non-payroll tax surplus in history; highest \npersonal income tax receipt burden in history.\n  What should we do? Cut personal income taxes, is what we ought to be \ndoing. Yet, Mr. President, not a word from you.\n  What about the marriage penalty that the Senator from Missouri was \ntalking about a few moments ago? What about death tax relief? Every \ntime I walk off from a plane in my home State of Idaho, I hear from the \nsmall businessperson, or a farmer, or a rancher, who are at a time in \ntheir lives when they want to transfer the ownership of their life's \nwork to their son, or to their daughter, and can't because the Federal \nGovernment steps in and destroys the American dream by saying: Give me \nat least 50 percent of the value of the life's work, and then I will \nlet you pass the rest of it on to your family; and, in doing that, the \nson, or the daughter, or the son-in-law or the daughter-in-law spends \nthe rest of their life trying to pay once again for that business, for \nthat farm, for that ranch, and, in the end, they have to sell it just \nto pay the tax.\n  Mr. President, please. What about the American dream? Join with us in \neliminating the death tax.\n  The fact that we have a $2.9 trillion surplus totally apart from \nSocial Security means we can still protect Social Security and buy down \nthe public debt. In addition to these things, we could cut income taxes \nand return income tax surpluses to the overburdened taxpayer.\n  Everyone can see this connection. It is not a difficult thing to \nunderstand the highest income tax burden and the highest surplus in our \ncountry's history. When I say it is easy to see, that is everyone \nexcept President Clinton. Right on this Hill, his defenders won't even \ntalk about a tax reduction.\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\n  Clinton wants to raise taxes. Understand me. Here is the President, \nafter all of the statistics and facts I have just given you, who brings \nthe budget to the Hill this year, and in it are tax increases. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, President Clinton's \nbudget raises $96 billion in new taxes over the next decade. I mean, \nMr. President, where in the heck are you coming from? With surpluses \nunlike we have ever had before, certainly in this Senator's history, \nand you want to raise taxes? That is roughly a 10-percent surplus \nsurcharge over the next 10 years on the American taxpayer.\n  In case you haven't forgotten, let me give you a little of the \nClinton tax history. It is important the Senate understand this is a \nPresident who campaigned in 1992 on the promise to cut taxes. Then, in \n1993, once elected, he raised taxes by $240 billion. After that, in \n1995, President Clinton confessed--I was not in the room at that time, \nbut here is the quote: ``People in this room are still mad at me at \nthat budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.''\n  His own quote: ``Well, it might surprise you to know I think I raised \nthem too much.''\n  That is the inconsistency of this President on this issue, and now \nwith 2 years of a budget surplus under our belt, and with $2.9 trillion \nover the next 15 years in non-Social Security budget surpluses, Mr. \nPresident, join us in reducing the overall tax burden on the American \npeople, and work with us to give a strong, responsible tax reduction to \nthe taxpayers and to the economy of this country.\n  Bill Clinton breaks promises to cut taxes and makes promises to raise \nthem.\n  No wonder Bill Clinton is the undisputed champion of personal income \ntaxes.\n  Bill Clinton may have a choice--whether to keep his word or not, \nwhether to raise taxes when there is a surplus or whether to veto a tax \ncut when there is a surplus.\n  For this Congress there should be no choice.\n  This Congress should cut taxes on the overtaxed American people.\n  We should do it if we had to cut spending to do it--as we have \nbefore.\n  We do not even have to cut spending to cut taxes when there is \ntrillions more than is necessary to run an already bloated government.\n  When not one cent of this surplus comes from Social Security.\n  We have nothing short of a moral imperative to return the money to \nthe taxpayers who sent it.\n  While it may be Clinton-able, it is unconscionable to do otherwise.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Idaho for \nhis very illuminating remarks.\n  I now yield to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I congratulate the Senator from Georgia for putting \ntogether this special order on taxes. If we don't talk about it, if we \ndon't act on it, as sure as day follows night, Washington will spend \nthis surplus unless we do something. It is a very important issue, and \nI appreciate the opportunity to join in.\n  A few minutes ago the Senate cast another important vote in an \nattempt to lock away every penny of the Social Security surplus for \nAmericans' retirement security. If enacted, this lockbox legislation \nwould effectively end the practice of allowing the Government to spend \nSocial Security money on other Washington ``wish list'' programs.\n  I take this opportunity also to commend Leader Lott, Chairman \nDomenici, and Senators Abraham and Ashcroft for their leadership on \nthis very important issue. I believe stopping the Government from \nraiding the Social Security trust fund is an essential first step to \nensure Social Security will be there for current beneficiaries, the \nbaby boomers, as well as their children and grandchildren. I am pleased \nthis remains our No. 1 priority.\n  We will protect Social Security, preserve Medicare, and dramatically \nreduce the national debt, while providing major tax relief. Republicans \nare pleased that President Clinton agrees that shoring up Social \nSecurity and Medicare should be our Nation's top priority. But the \ndifference is that President Clinton talks about it and Republicans are \nready to act on it.\n  A good example is the President's commitment to work out a Social \nSecurity lockbox compromise when talking with the leadership this past \nMonday. Yet here we are again, another cloture vote, and no agreement. \nWhere is the action to back up that type of commitment?\n  The Republicans are determined to achieve these goals. We have locked \nin every penny of the estimated $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus \nover the next 10 years--not for Government programs, not for tax \nrelief, but exclusively to protect all Americans' retirement.\n  We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be \nthere for seniors. Prescription drug coverage for the needy will be \npart of our commitment to seniors, to protect their Medicare benefits. \nHad the White House and the Democrats cooperated, we could have fixed \nMedicare by now.\n  We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically \nreduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by \n2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 \nbillion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire \ndebt held by the public by 2012.\n  We have not ignored spending needs to focus on tax cuts as has been \ncharged. We not only have funded all the functions of the government, \nbut also significantly increased funding for our budget priorities, \nsuch as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture, and others.\n  Meanwhile, Republicans are committed to providing nearly $800 billion \nof the projected non-Social Security surplus--the tax overpayments of \nworking Americans--for tax relief.\n  This is the largest tax relief since President Reagan and it does not \ncome at the expense of seniors, farmers, women, children, or any other \ndeserving group.\n  However, despite our healthy economy expanding our on-budget surplus, \nwhich, again, is not the Social Security surplus, President Clinton \nstill denies meaningful tax relief for working Americans. He and his \naides accuse our tax relief plan of being ``dangerous'' and ``risky,'' \nsquandering your money by giving it back to you, worried that you won't \nspend it right. The administration believes you are smart enough to \nearn your money but you are not smart enough to know how to spend it--\nWashington is.\n  He believes public opinion polls show less interest in tax relief. No \nwonder! How many people do you know like paying taxes and actually \nexpect a refund? Most people have given up any thought of tax relief--\nbut they still constantly remind me how important it is when I travel \naround Minnesota.\n  To tell the public they don't deserve tax relief is just plain wrong. \nThe Bureau of Census just released a report last week that finds 49 \nmillion hard-working Americans--nearly one person in every five--lived \nin a household that had trouble paying for their basic needs.\n  They are going further into debt each month trying to make ends meet. \nCredit cards are charged to the limit. They need tax relief.\n  What's even more shocking, Mr. President, is that not all of these 49 \nmillion are underprivileged people, over 8 million Americans are from \nmiddle-class families, families that earn more than $45,000 a year.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, a significant number, 8.1 million, to \nbe exact, of middle-class and well-off families today have difficulties \nmaking their ends meet. They even have trouble paying rent, medical \nbills or other basic daily needs. A family night at the movies, a \ndinner out, braces, piano lessons are often out of reach to average \nincome families.\n  Mr. President, this is not my data, nor is it data from think tanks. \nThis is the data produced by the government of the United States.\n  Some experts attribute this financial hardship to lack of savings, \nwhich is true, but there is much more.\n  Our personal savings rate has dropped from 9.4 percent in 1981 to \nonly six-tenths of a percent last year. This year the government \nreported that the rate actually dipped below zero for the first time \nsince the Great Depression.\n  In fact, in the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, our \nsavings rate has dropped as low as it is today\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nonly twice before. The personal savings rate has remained low for more \nthan a decade, and net personal savings other than pensions have \nvirtually disappeared over the past ten years.\n  But why? My answer is that government tax bites have been getting \nbigger and more cruel. Americans have been struggling to pay basic \nbills. After paying Uncle Sam and paying for basic family needs, there \nis nothing left for working Americans to save, or for money even to \nprovide for the basics.\n  Americans should be able to save for their future, but they also \nshould be able to pay for what most of us here take for granted--the \nfamily's night out, the lessons, camps, etc.,--the things that improve \nour quality of life. Tax relief can improve the quality of life of \nmiddle-class American families.\n  Mr. President, I remind you the total tax burden on working Americans \nis at an all-time high. The government's own data shows that the \naverage household pays $9,445 in federal income taxes alone--twice what \nit paid in 1985.\n  Federal taxes take a huge bite out of Americans' hard-earned paycheck \nand consumes about 21 percent of the national income, the highest \nproportion since World War II. And it's still growing. Total taxes from \nall levels of government--federal, state, and local taxes--stand at a \nrecord 32 percent of national income.\n  Mr. President, according to the Census report, the income of the \naverage American family has grown only 6.3 percent in constant dollars \nbetween 1969 to 1996. However, federal tax revenue increased nearly 800 \npercent during the same period of time.\n  Studies show that if government spending in this country had remained \nat the 1960 level, the average income of an American family of four, \neven accounting for inflation, would be $23,000 higher today than it \nis. That could certainly improve the quality of life for those \nfamilies.\n  The tax burden has become even more excessive since 1993. Over the \ncourse of President Clinton's administration, Washington's income has \ngrown faster than our economy and twice as fast as the income of \nworking Americans. In fact, federal taxes have grown by over 54 \npercent. That's nearly $4,000 a year more per person.\n  Because of the unfair tax system, millions of middle-income Americans \nwho have worked hard to get ahead have been pushed from the 15-percent \nbracket into the 28-percent bracket. Hundreds of thousands of others \nhave been pushed from the 28-percent bracket into the 31- and 36-\npercent brackets. No one can escape this growing tax burden, not even \nlow-income and minimum wage workers.\n  Since payroll taxes are levied against everyone, as low-income and \nminimum wage workers work harder and earn more, their payroll taxes \nalso increase, taking a huge bite out of their hard-earned dollars that \nare most needed to keep families above the poverty line. As a result, \nAmericans today are working harder and longer but taking less home. A \nlarger share of the earned income of working Americans is siphoned off \nto Washington, and isn't available to spend on family--not Washington--\npriorities. No wonder working Americans have trouble making their ends \nmeet. No wonder they cannot save for emergencies. No wonder they work \ntwo or three jobs but still cannot get ahead.\n  President Clinton himself at one time admitted that Americans were \ntaxed too much. But he still refuses to return the tax overpayments \nback to them because he does not think working Americans will spend it \nright. Instead, President Clinton has decided he will spend much of the \nsurplus for his own government programs.\n  President Clinton and some of our Democratic colleagues insist we \nshould have Social Security and Medicare first before we have tax cuts. \nIn my view, this is nothing but an effort to deny working Americans tax \nrelief.\n  Republicans have saved Social Security and have tried to create \ninterest in Medicare reform. Tax relief only detracts from the need to \nspending more to bring home the bacon for many of our colleagues on the \nother side. Even after we've set aside and protected $2 trillion for \nSocial Security and Medicare, he and my Democratic colleagues in the \nSenate still insist the tax relief is unachievable.\n  Over the next 10 years, the federal government will collect over \n$22.7 trillion in taxes. Excluding the Social Security tax surplus, the \ngovernment will take $17 trillion from Americans' paychecks while it \nneeds only $16 trillion to operate the government. In other words, the \naverage U.S. household will pay approximately $5,307 more than the \ngovernment needs over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  One question we should ask ourselves before we decide how to spend \nany non-Social Security surplus is where the budget surplus comes from. \nDo we have a budget surplus because the government is spending less or \nbecause it is taking more of our money? The CBO has showed us precisely \nwhere we will get our revenues in the next ten years. The data \nindicates that the greatest share of the projected budget surplus comes \ndirectly from income tax increases, primarily from the capital gains \nrealizations and increase of effective income tax rates.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, as I have argued repeatedly our revenue \nwindfall did not just fall from the sky, nor has it come from any belt \ntightening in Washington. It comes directly from American taxpayers.\n  Again, my point is, Mr. President, that this non-Social Security \nsurplus is nothing but tax over-payments. It is the American taxpayers' \nmoney and it should be returned.\n  Like the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, my biggest \nfear is that if we don't give the non-Social Security surplus back to \nthe taxpayers, Washington will soon spend it all. Such spending will \nonly expand the government, making it even more expensive to support in \nthe future, creating an even higher tax burden than working Americans \nbear today and a higher federal debt. That's why Chairman Greenspan \nsays ``If we have to get rid of the surpluses--I would far prefer \nreducing taxes than [increasing] spending, and, indeed, I don't think \nit's a close call.''\n  Major tax relief as we have proposed will help all Americans keep a \nlittle more of their own money. It will give middle class families \nrelief from the tax squeeze. It will help farmers and small business \nowners pass their hard-earned legacies onto their children. It will \nhelp to reduce self-employed medical costs, and correct the injustice \nof the marriage penalty tax. It will encourage working Americans to \nsave and invest more. It will reward people who work hard to get ahead. \nIt will benefit all Americans and ensure our economy continues to grow. \nBut more importantly, it will give working Americans more freedom to \ncontrol their own fate and decide what's best for themselves and their \nfamilies. This is exactly what President Clinton and our Democratic \ncolleagues fear will happen. They simply cannot let go of their \nmisconceived belief that higher taxes and more government spending are \nthe best answers to America's challenges. That's the fundamental \ndifference between the two parties. That is what this debate on tax \nrelief is all about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I \nappreciate his accommodating the somewhat tight schedule. The remarks \nhe made are very pertinent to what we are going to be hearing a lot \nabout over the next 3 weeks.\n  I now turn to the distinguished Senator from Colorado for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell, for leading the discussion this morning on the need to have \ntax cuts for all Americans. I agree with my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Ashcroft, and his call to action. He said: Americans have \nearned it; Uncle Sam ought to return it.\n  I agree with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, who pointed out \nthat right now Americans are facing the highest tax burden since World \nWar II. I also would like to associate myself with the comments of my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, who says we can save Social \nSecurity, we can pay down the public debt, and we can still provide tax \ncuts for Americans. My colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, will \nprobably talk about the need of cutting taxes for the benefit of \nAmerican families.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  These are all very good points on why we should cut taxes. In talking \nwith my constituents in town meetings across Colorado, one thing I hear \nin every meeting is that Congress should cut taxes. The legislature in \nthe State of Colorado, and the Republican Governor in the State of \nColorado, have heard the same message. This year there were some major \ntax cut provisions for the people of Colorado. The Governor of \nColorado, Governor Owens, has pointed out that he plans on making \nanother major tax cut for the people of Colorado next year. They \nrecognize that government is receiving a windfall with our good \neconomy, and we ought to cut taxes to give people the power to \ndetermine how they want to spend that money.\n  The government in Colorado or the Government in Washington should not \nbe spending those dollars. The power really does belong with the \npeople, not with the government in Colorado or, particularly, with the \nGovernment in Washington, DC.\n  People of all ages, professions, and positions in life believe they \nsend too much of their paycheck to Washington. I happen to agree with \nthat. Taxes are currently at a record high level. According to the Tax \nFoundation, Tax Freedom Day, the day in the year to which the typical \nAmerican family must work to pay their combined Federal, State, and \nlocal taxes, was May 11 this year. This is the latest day ever, but it \nis hardly surprising in light of the fact that the combined effective \ntax rate is also the highest ever. When you add in the cost of \nGovernment regulations, Americans did not finish paying for the cost of \nGovernment until June 22nd. I believe Congress should downsize \nGovernment and return power to the States, localities, and individuals.\n  Part of the effort to downsize Government must also include a tax \ncut. I believe Americans should be able to keep more of their own \nmoney. American workers already pay 38 percent of their income in \ntaxes, which is more than they spend on food, clothing, and housing \ncombined. For the average family, this translates to a large percentage \nof their paycheck going straight to Uncle Sam.\n  A tax cut means they could keep more of their money to use for their \npriorities, not Washington's priorities. Some families may choose to \nuse that money for a downpayment on a house, others, for education, and \nother families will now have the money to work fewer hours and spend \nmore time together. The important point is, they know their own family \nneeds and we, in Washington, do not.\n  I realize some question the wisdom of tax cuts. We always hear from \nthose, sometimes I think louder than we do from others, except when it \ncomes to election time, and then their voice is heard. They believe the \nbudget cannot be balanced or Social Security cannot be saved if they \nreturn taxpayer money. However, according to a recent Congressional \nResearch Service study, there will be an additional $800 billion on \nbudget surplus over the next 10 years, even after assuring that all our \nobligations to Social Security and Medicare have been met.\n  The study also found the average household will pay $5,000 more in \ntaxes than the Government needs to operate over the next 10 years. This \nmoney belongs to the American people. We must refund the excess in the \nform of tax cuts and not spend it. At the very least, we should reduce \nthe excessive recent growth of the Federal tax burden.\n  During the Clinton administration, Federal tax receipts have \nincreased by over 54 percent. Tax revenues have grown twice as fast as \nour economy and twice as fast as economic growth for working Americans. \nClinton tax hikes have left each American $4,000 per year poorer, yet \nthe President is not done. His budget for Fiscal Year 2000 proposes $96 \nbillion in new taxes. Congress should reject new taxes and new spending \nin favor of meaningful tax relief.\n  In conclusion, I point out that it is time we return Government money \nto its rightful owner, and that is the American people.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for allowing me to join with him and \nmy other colleagues in the Senate to deliver this very important \nmessage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I know our time has been scheduled to \nconclude at noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Do I have 14 minutes remaining? Thank you.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank all of these speakers. In \ntheir own way, each pointed out the effect of a circumstance in which \nworking American families are paying the highest taxes they have ever \npaid. These numbers begin to back into each other, but if you get down \nto the bottom line, what we are talking about is that American workers \ntoday are keeping just over half their paycheck--about 52 cents. If \nthey kept two-thirds of their paycheck, which I think everybody in the \ncountry would agree at a minimum would be appropriate, they would have \nabout $7,000 a year in their checking accounts.\n  We have just spent a fierce week of debate arguing about how people \ndeal with prescription drugs and the Patients' Bill of Rights and the \nneeds of American families. The problem is, we have taken so much out \nof those folks' checking accounts they do have to start looking to some \nother place to take care of these problems. Obviously, if every working \nfamily had $7,000 more in their checking accounts, the problem of a \n$2,000 drug bill or an additional educational requirement could be \nfacilitated.\n  We have created, by these enormous tax levels, massive pressure on \nAmerican working families. I will give you two immediate manifestations \nof what this does, and there are many.\n  One of them is that American families this year, for the first time, \nhave a negative savings rate.\n  In other words, they are in the red in terms of the amount of money \nthey are saving each year. The reason is, if somebody--the Government--\ngoes into their checking account and takes over half what they make, \nthere is not enough left to save. In fact, there is not enough \ndisposable income left to do what that family is supposed to do. \nEducation, housing, transportation, and health needs are all impaired \nbecause we have taken those resources and moved them away.\n  There are people in this city who believe they can make better \ndecisions about where that money ought to go. If you are interested in \ntax relief, economic relief, leaving those funds in those families' \nchecking accounts, you are a person who believes they make a better \ndecision about what they need, they make a more efficient decision, \nthey make a more intelligent decision about what the requirements are \nin that family than some bureaucrat buried in the basement of one of \nthese buildings in Washington, DC.\n  They know whether they have a special education problem. They know \nwhether they can afford and need more health insurance or not. They \nknow whether or not they have a housing requirement or transportation \nrequirement.\n  There is absolutely no way this city, despite all the intellect, can \nfigure out what are the specific needs of an individual family. The \nbest thing we can do for middle America, the best policy we can enact, \nis to get more resources into their checking accounts. They worked for \nit; they earned it.\n  If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he would faint that we had come \nto the point where nearly half the resources of working families are \nsent off to the Government. If he woke up, he would be furious that \nthis condition had ever been imposed. So American families are not \nsaving.\n\n  Also, we have the highest bankruptcy rates in contemporary history. \nWhy is that? Once again, it is a reaction to all the pressures we put \non working families across the country. We are taking too much of their \npaychecks and moving those resources away from them to Washington for \nothers to decide what to do with it, leaving those families without the \nresources necessary to do what they have always done for America.\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude. I know there are several other \nSenators who have remarks to make on other subjects.\n  In my judgment, there is no single policy more deserving of our \nattention than that of focusing on how to lower the highest tax levels \nin American history, how to return resources to the\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nchecking accounts of our average American families so they are \nempowered to do the things they need to do to make America great.\n  There are three pillars of American freedom. One is economic \nopportunity, the second is safety of persons and property, and the \nthird is an educated mind. We have ratcheted down economic opportunity \nto a point where it is changing the behavior and the way Americans \nfunction and act. It is robbing them of the dreams and the visions that \nhave been such a special part of America.\n  This is the time, the perfect time, for us to be conscious of this, \nto leave those resources in those checking accounts and empower those \nfamilies to build not only their family, their community, but their \nNation, the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, I did not hear everything \nthe Senator from Georgia said. As I understand it, he was talking about \nincome tax cuts; is that correct?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8714-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8714-S8734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BIPARTISAN SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia does not have to \nstay for this, but I agree with the fundamental principle the Senator \nfrom Georgia laid out. I may come at it slightly differently.\n  There have been a lot of arguments about income tax cuts and why they \nare needed. I call to my colleagues' attention, one of the biggest \nreasons is the total amount of taxes we are currently taking from the \nAmerican people which totals 20.7 percent of U.S. income. That is the \nhighest it has been since 1945, and it continues to go up.\n  I believe we need to measure and look at that very carefully as we \ndecide how much in taxes we are going to take from the American people. \nI put myself on the side of I believe at least the fundamental \nprinciple about which the Senator from Georgia talked. There are many \nways to cut taxes, and I want to talk about one way to do so this \nafternoon.\n  I rise today to talk about the introduction of a bipartisan bill \ncalled the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of 1999. It is the \nonly bipartisan, bicameral--it has been introduced in the House as \nwell--Social Security reform bill, and it is the only bill that can \nclaim to cut taxes, cut programmatic costs, leave current retirees' \nbenefits untouched, and it substantially increases the benefit checks \nof women and low- and moderate-income workers. This reform plan is a \nreform plan for all generations.\n  First, in our bill, current seniors--those who are eligible either \nfor the old age, survivor, or disability benefits who have not had time \nto financially prepare for benefit changes--will not face any benefit \ncuts.\n  Second, current workers--the baby boomers and the generation Xers--\nwill participate in a modernized and strengthened Social Security \nprogram. Our proposal gives all current and future workers a 2-\npercentage point payroll tax cut which they can invest in individual \ninvestment accounts. That is a $928 billion tax cut over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Indeed, as I will illustrate with my presentation, what Congress \nshould consider, when we consider the payroll tax, is do we want to \ntake that payroll tax and pay off the national debt.\n  I favor a substantial debt reduction. Under our proposal, instead of \ngoing all for debt reduction, that $928 billion will be accumulated as \nan asset in 137 million working American households. That will add to \nthe net worth of American working families. It is, in my view, a \npreferable way of dealing with the payroll taxes. It gives the baby \nboomers and generation Xers who have time to plan under our proposal \nnot only a payroll tax cut, but it gives them an opportunity to invest \nin their future. At retirement, these workers will receive the \ntraditional monthly benefit check. We preserve not only the old age \nbenefit, but we preserve intact the survivor and disability benefit. \nThis traditional defined benefit will be supplemented by the retirement \nwealth they have accumulated in their individual savings accounts.\n  Third, future workers--that is, those who are born after 1995--will \nnot only get to participate in individual savings accounts, but they \nwill get to start saving for their retirement at birth through our \nbill's KidSave account program.\n  Through KidSave accounts, all children will be given a stake in the \nAmerican economy and a chance to build substantial retirement wealth at \nthe same time. Each child born in the United States will receive $3,500 \nto invest in their retirement. When a child takes his or her first job, \nhe or she will be able to contribute 2 percentage points of their \npayroll tax to the KidSave account.\n  Not only is this a plan for all generations--it is a plan for all \nincome levels. Our plan has something for every wage earner. It will \nresult in substantially higher benefit checks for low- and moderate-\nincome workers. It will result in substantially lower taxes for high-\nincome workers, and it has a combination of higher benefits and lower \ntaxes for middle-income workers.\n  I have brought with me some examples of how real Nebraskans would be \naffected by our legislation. These charts compare Social Security \nbenefit checks under current law with Social Security benefit checks \nunder the Senate bipartisan Social Security reform plan.\n  The first example is a friend of mine by the name of Verner Magnuson, \na retired farmer from Oakland, NE. This chart says, 75-plus. I do not \nthink Verner would object to me telling you he was born in 1915. So \nVerner obviously is an individual who says: Well, what do I benefit \nfrom additional savings? He is exactly right. He does not have time to \nsave and benefit from the buildup in cash that can occur by taking \nadvantage of compounding interest rates.\n  So under current law, Verner receives a benefit check of \napproximately $1,500 per month. Under our bill, his check will be \nexactly the same, $1,500--and it will continue to grow with inflation \nfrom year to year. We make no adjustment in Verner's CPI nor in \nanybody's CPI over the age of 62.\n  The second example shows an Omaha resident and the divisional social \nservices director for the Salvation Army, Linda Burkle. Linda, who has \na relatively high income--although she may object to that description--\ndemonstrates how higher income individuals will experience somewhat \nlower monthly benefits under our Social Security plan--at least during \nthe transition period. These temporary benefit reductions for high-\nincome people will only occur until the new Social Security program--\nthat is to say, with individual accounts--is fully phased in. At that \npoint high-income people will not experience reductions in overall \nbenefits. These are temporary benefit reductions for higher income \npeople, and they will only occur until a new program with individual \naccounts is fully phased in.\n  You can see from this chart that a baby boomer with a low or moderate \nincome will still have a higher income benefit in our plan than under \ncurrent law. A moderate-income worker, for example, will receive a \nmonthly benefit check of $673 under current law. Since Linda will \nbecome eligible to retire for old-age benefits in 2020, her benefit \ncheck will not reflect the large benefit cuts that are expected to \noccur in 2034 under current law.\n  I will not spend a great deal of time on this point, but one thing we \nall need to understand is if we do not change the law, people who are \nunder the age of 45, under current law, according to the trustees of \nthe Social Security Administration, will experience a 25- to 33-percent \ncut in benefits. Ask them. If any citizen doubts that, call the Social \nSecurity Administration. If you are under the age of 45, call them \nup and ask them: What will my benefits be unless Congress changes the \nlaw? And they will tell you that your benefits are going to be cut 25 \nto 33 percent.\n\n  I have listened to my colleagues from time to time who say: Gosh, it \nis not going to run out of money until 2034,\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nand that is a long time away. Why do anything now? Why should we act \nnow, especially when the choices are hard and people are apt to get \nupset with you?\n  The answer is, in 1983, when Congress fixed Social Security as it was \nabout ready to not be able to pay benefits, it made a radical departure \nfrom the previous plan. In 1983, what Congress said is that we are not \ngoing to only fund current beneficiaries; we are going to fund all \nbeneficiaries.\n  That is what the 75-year mark does. It is not just 75 years; we are \ntrying to write the law so that whatever your age, whether you are born \nthis year or you are 16 years old or you are 76 years old, that we can \nkeep the promise we have on the table.\n  We cannot keep the promise we have on the table to the people under \nthe age of 45. It is not just a small haircut they are going to take; \nit is a big haircut they are going to take. Or there is going to have \nto be a comparable--actually, a larger tax increase on their children \nand grandchildren. That is the current law--a big benefit cut for \npeople under the age of 45.\n  You can see from this chart that a baby boomer with a low- or \nmoderate-income will have a higher benefit under our plan than under \ncurrent law. A moderate-income worker will receive a monthly benefit \ncheck of $673 under current law. Under our plan, a low-income worker \nwill receive a benefit of $813. That is a very important point.\n  We believe that the current Social Security Program is not very \ngenerous to low- and moderate-income workers. We add what is called \nunder law an additional benefit point. So for that lower wage \nindividual, in my view, not only are there many of them today, but \nthere are apt to be many of them in the future, who are both an \nimportant force for economic reasons as well as for moral reasons. We \nhave to make sure that that defined benefit program is sufficient so \nthey can live with some dignity in their retirement years.\n  This plan not only provides them a higher benefit check, it also \nprovides them the thing that I think produces real financial \nindependence, and that is ownership of some financial assets.\n  My third example shows how Kelly Walters, a 20-something generation \nXer from Columbus, NE, will fare under our Social Security reform bill. \nGeneration X is the first generation that will experience very \nsignificant benefit increases from our Social Security reform plan. If \nKelly earns the average wage over her lifetime, she can expect to get a \nbenefit check, under current law--assuming no tax increases--of $884 \nper month. Under our reform plan, she can expect to get a Social \nSecurity benefit check worth $1,329 per month. That is a 50-percent \nincrease in benefits over current law. If she turns out to be a low-\nincome worker throughout her lifetime, Kelly can expect to get a $536 \nmonthly check under current law but a $1,115 benefit under our new \nplan. That is more than double the benefit under current law.\n  One of the very difficult things we are experiencing, as the occupant \nof the Chair knows--he was on the Ways and Means Committee in the \nHouse, and I look forward to the day when he is on the Finance \nCommittee as well--but as the occupant of the Chair understands, what \nwe have is a situation where people are living longer. Generation Xers \nare probably going to be looking forward to living to the age of 85 or \n90. So it is very important that that defined benefit program be solid \nfor them. It is also very important that they have the financial assets \nand wealth that allows them to sustain themselves through to the course \nof their old-age years.\n\n  My fourth and final example shows how the next generation of children \nwill fare under our Social Security reform plan.\n  Erin Kuehl, who is only 2 years old today, will benefit not only from \nthe 2-percent account but also from the KidSave account I described \nearlier. Under the current Social Security system, Erin can expect to \nhave a Social Security benefit worth $1,037 if she earns the average \npay. Under our plan, she will receive a monthly benefit worth $2,693. \nIf she becomes a low-income worker, Erin will receive a benefit worth \n$629 under the current system and $1,631 under the new system--again, \nmore than one and a half times her current expected benefit.\n  Many people get confused about this because they will look at the \nexisting benefit plan and they will say: Well, that is not true. Under \nwhat shows up on her benefits, Erin is going to get a much larger \ncheck. But that assumes that Congress is going to raise taxes. The \nPresident said he is against raising payroll taxes. That presumes that \nCongress somehow is going to come up with some additional money. If \nanybody wants to do that, let them come down and argue for that. Let \nthem come down and make a presentation or a proposal to raise taxes \neven more on people who get paid by the hour than we have under current \nlaw.\n  The message with our proposal is very clear: Our bill provides better \nbenefits for low- and moderate-income workers. And although some high-\nincome individuals will temporarily experience slightly lower benefits \nduring the transition from the old system to the new system, all \nworkers in America will eventually experience higher benefits and lower \ntaxes than current law provides. In Nebraska alone, there are over \n283,000 Social Security beneficiaries: 182,000 have an old-age benefit; \n35,000 are taking the survivor or widower benefit; and the balance are \nin the disability program. The average monthly check under the old-age \nbenefit is $753 for retired workers. For the widower, it is $740.\n\n  Not only is $753 not a livable monthly benefit, that is an average. \nThat means many are getting substantially lower than that. Even in \nNebraska, that is not adequate, unless it is supplemented by additional \nwealth and income from pensions and personal savings. This is an even \nlower amount and not likely to provide that individual with what they \nare going to need, especially with longer lifespans projected out into \nthe future.\n  Our bill will ensure workers have larger benefits. Our bill also \nensures they have wealth with which to supplement their retirement \nincome.\n  There are tradeoffs in our bill. Although our reforms will ensure \nlower taxes and higher benefits from future workers, our bill does call \nfor programmatic changes which will lower the guaranteed defined \nbenefit check for some middle and upper workers in the future.\n  I don't want to sugarcoat this. Unless you are for a tax increase, if \nyou want to walk out on the floor and say, let's raise taxes, you also \nfavor at some point lowering benefit checks. If you don't like the idea \nthat we are making some adjustments out in the future in benefit \nchecks--and again, for emphasis, if you are watching this and you are \nover the age of 62, please don't call my office and say I am cutting \nyour benefits. I am not. This proposal does not cut benefits for people \nover the age of 62. It makes adjustments out in the future. Again, if \nyou don't like those adjustments, come down to the floor and say you \nwant to raise taxes because that is the only option to making these \nkinds of adjustments.\n  Our bill includes a provision which instructs the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics to study overestimates in the CPI and correct them \naccordingly. When the recommendation was made well over a year ago now, \nit was a commission that studied this. They came back and said that the \nCPI was overstated 1.1 and we ought to make an adjustment, and nothing \nhappened. I guarantee you, if they had come back and said that it is \nunderstated 1.1, there would have been 535 votes for it. It would have \nbeen unanimous in the House and Senate. But because it is overstated, \nwe recognize that the adjustment is going to mean somebody is going to \nhave to give up something. We make that adjustment for beneficiaries \nout into the future.\n  We think this will result in a downward adjustment in the CPI and \nCOLAs of .5 percent. It brings the CPI much more closely in line with \nwhat real cost-of-living increases are. It doesn't reduce the cost-of-\nliving increase. It brings us a much more accurate cost of living. In \naddition, the CPI adjustments will affect income tax revenues. I do not \nargue that it will not. But our bill allows the Social Security \nAdministration to recapture these initial income tax revenues for the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  Another benefit change in our bill is the indexation of benefits to \nlife expectancy. Earlier I introduced a bill with Senator Moynihan that \nwould\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nhave moved the eligibility age. It set off a howl, a protest, and \nconcern. I listened to those concerns. By the way, in 1997, we had 1.3 \nmillion old-age beneficiaries who became eligible for Social Security's \nold-age benefit. Of those 1.3 million, 1.1 million took the early \nbenefits at 62. So when news commentators try to figure out what this \ndoes, they typically say: Kerrey is proposing to move the retirement \nage. Not true. We are talking about eligibility age, when you are \neligible for the benefit. By the way, this bill would also eliminate \nthe earnings test that is still present. That earnings test is gone. So \nwhenever you are eligible, if you want to continue working, that is \nfine under our proposal.\n\n  But this change to index benefits to life expectancy is a response to \npeople saying: Don't move the eligibility age. We keep the eligibility \nage exactly as it is under current law. We do accelerate the move from \n65 to 67.\n  Once the retirement age increases to 67, as under current law, our \nbill will provide for benefits that track the life expectancy of your \nbirth cohort. I think we made that adjustment so we do not accelerate \nit until 67, or do we? We do? I was right the first time.\n  Our bill will provide for benefits, as I said, that track the life \nexpectancy of your birth cohort. The longer your birth cohort lives, \nthe more years over which your benefits must be spread. This may mean \nthat retirees far in the future may experience a lower defined benefit \nunder our program, but again, it does not affect the value of their \nindividual account.\n  We have several other benefit changes in our bill, but those are the \ntwo big ones. I disclose them up front.\n  There is a price. Again, I say, for the third time, for those who \nobject to it, what is your alternative? What else do you want to do? I \ngraduated from the University of Nebraska in 1965 with a B.S. in \npharmacy. It is a land grant college. I am not a Rhodes scholar. I \ndidn't go to Yale University. I don't have a Ph.D. behind my name.\n  This is not difficult to figure out. The difficulty is looking at the \n10 or 12 options and saying: Oh, my gosh, I don't want to pick any of \nthose because somebody is going to get mad at me. Somebody will object \nto it. Somebody will criticize it.\n  Criticize the changes if you want, and there will be many who do, but \nif you are an elected official, if you are an elected representative, I \nhope people outside, after they have leveled their criticism will say: \nWhat is your solution? Or are you suggesting that people under the age \nof 45 should just be basically out of luck because we don't expect to \nhave to worry about them in our political lifetimes or perhaps even in \nour physical lifetimes.\n  Ultimately, the public must decide whether it is willing to risk some \nbenefit adjustments and some benefit uncertainty for the long-term \ngains that come with a Social Security program that includes individual \naccounts. Furthermore, the public must weigh the costs and benefit \nadjustments against the cost of doing nothing. As I said, the cost of \ndoing nothing, if you favor doing nothing, if you favor delay, what \nthat means is you favor, unless you have an alternative, you favor a 25 \nto 33 percent cut in benefits for people under the age of 45 because \nthat is what current law provides.\n  This is a reform proposal that Republicans and Democrats are \nsupporting and should be supporting. If Congress wants to get serious \nabout Social Security reform, this is the bill to mark up. If Members \nwant to stop talking about saving Social Security--we just had a \ncloture vote on the lockbox proposal. Democrats have a lockbox \nproposal. Everybody wants to save Social Security. If you want to save \nSocial Security, this is the bill to rally behind. If the President, \nwho cannot run for reelection, wants to save Social Security, this is \nthe bill for him to embrace as well. If the public wants the \npoliticians to enact Social Security reform legislation that shares \ncosts across generations, protects benefits and lowers tax burdens, \nthis is the bill to write their Congressman about.\n\n  You may detect frustration in my voice. I have been frustrated in \nrecent weeks by our difficulty to come to a resolution of this problem. \nWe do talk a great deal about it. I understand the difficulty. I do not \nunderestimate the political difficulties of solving this problem. The \ndifficulty, in my judgment, is not picking the solution. This is not \nlike Medicare. This is not like youth violence. There are lots of \nthings out there that are extremely complicated, that are very \ndifficult to figure out. This one is not difficult to figure out. You \njust, in the end, must select which proposals, which solutions you \nwant.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the office that dictates what we do \nfar too often around here, and the Office of Management and Budget, the \nexecutive office, recently released their midsession review that \nprojected surpluses of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, 65 percent \nof which comes from excess FICA taxes.\n  What I find to be odd in our current debate is that from 1983 to \n1999, after we raised taxes on working people in 1983 to prefund all \nAmericans who were going to be eligible in the future, we raised taxes \nthen. Every single year what Treasury does is, any excess tax, it \ncredits the Social Security Administration with a treasury bond, an \nasset that has real value. This year at the start of the year, that is \nabout $860 billion that the Social Security Administration owns for \nfuture beneficiaries. It will be over $1 trillion at the end of this \nyear because there will be $130 billion of revenue taxes, taxation of \nbenefits and the interest off these bonds that flow into the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The Social Security trust fund will own over $1 \ntrillion of the bonds. It will build up to $4.5 trillion in the year \n2014. From 1983 to 1999, what we did was, we ended up, after the trust \nfund owns bonds, Treasury ends up with cash. It ends up with cash. And \nit has been using that cash for all sorts of things. It has to buy \nsomething.\n  So basically what this excess did was made the deficit look smaller. \nSo from 1983 to 1999, people who got paid by the hour--and 80 percent \nof Americans have higher FICA taxes than they have in income taxes--\npeople who get paid by the hour shouldered a disproportionate share of \ndeficit reduction.\n  Now, in 1999, that the deficit is gone and we are at a surplus, what \nthe lockbox says is that people who get paid by the hour are going to \nshoulder all of the debt reduction. Every single penny of debt \nreduction under the President's proposal, the Democratic proposal, and \nthe Republican proposal is paid for with payroll taxes, FICA taxes. So \nwhat we say with our proposal is not only do we want to give a tax cut \nto people who get paid by the hour--almost $1 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod--but what it effectively does is say that rather than paying \ndown the national debt all of us owe, we will increase the net worth of \nAmericans by transferring that to the asset side of their balance \nstatement. That is basically what it does. At the end of the 10-year \nperiod, 137 million working families will have at least $1 trillion of \nnew assets. That assumes no interest, no accumulation on that \nownership.\n  Furthermore, each day we let go by means this problem gets harder to \nsolve. This body rarely takes the opportunity to solve future crises. I \nunderstand that. I have been in the situation many times before. I urge \nand beg my colleagues to let the issue of Social Security reform be the \nexception to the rule. This bipartisan, bicameral bill represents a \nreal effort to work in a truly bipartisan fashion, not just to save \nSocial Security, but to modernize it, strengthen it, and improve it.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to cosponsor this bill and join with us in \nurging the chairman of the Finance Committee, the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee, and the President to take up and endorse a Social \nSecurity reform bill this year.\n  In addition, I announce that I intend, when we mark up a tax bill in \nthe Finance Committee, to offer this piece of legislation as a way to \ncut substantially more taxes than anybody is currently proposing.\n  I thank my colleagues who are on this bill, including Senator Gregg \nand Senator Breaux who are both on the floor today. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of it. I praise them for their leadership. They have been \nfearless and future-looking. When we talk about our kids and grandkids, \nsometimes we don't often back those words with actions. I praise them \nfor being willing to back, in a very courageous way, their words with \naction.\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Concord Coalition, June 9, 1999]\n\n Concord Coalition Commends Bipartisan Social Security Plans That Make \n                  Tough Choices and Offer Real Reform\n\n       Washington.--With the U.S. House Committee on Ways and \n     Means holding hearings today and tomorrow on plans to reform \n     Social Security, The Concord Coalition commends the Members \n     of Congress who had the courage to submit bipartisan Social \n     Security proposals that are both fiscally responsible and \n     generationally sound. Concord singled out for praise the \n     sponsors of the Kolbe-Stenholm bill (21st Century Retirement \n     Security Act, H.R. 1793) and the Gregg-Breaux plan (the \n     Senate Bipartisan Social Security Agreement).\n       Concord Coalition Co-Chairs and former U.S. Senators Warren \n     Rudman (R-NH) and San Nunn (D-GA) draw three conclusions in \n     letters addressed to Congressmen Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) and Charlie \n     Stenholm (D-TX), and Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), John Breaux \n     (D-LA), Bob Kerrey (D-NE) and Charles Grassley (R-IA). \n     ``First, changing demographics make the current pay-as-you-go \n     benefit structure unsustainable.

Reform must reduce Social \n     Security's long-term burden by reducing its long-term costs. \n     And it must make the remaining burden more bearable by \n     increasing national savings, and hence the size of tomorrow's \n     economic pie. Doing so requires the hard choices of fiscal \n     discipline. In short, there are no magic bullets. . . . \n     Third, the time for action is now. The longer reform is \n     delayed, the worse the problem will become and the more \n     draconian the solutions will be.\n       ``The Concord Coalition commends your efforts because your \n     plan recognizes each of these conclusions. We are \n     particularly pleased that you have resisted the temptation to \n     rely on speculative gains such as projected budget surpluses \n     and higher market returns to close Social Security's fiscal \n     gap. Either strategy is fraught with peril,'' Rudman and Nunn \n     warn.\n       ``The Concord Coalition supports the approach taken by \n     Kolbe-Stenholm and by Gregg-Breaux because both plans are \n     powerful antidotes to the free lunch disease that is gripping \n     the Social Security debate. Compared with the other proposals \n     being considered, these plans come closest to meeting the \n     Concord Coalition's criteria. They reduce future benefits on \n     a progressive basis, modestly raise the eligibility age, \n     provide a more accurate Consumer Price Index, create \n     individually owned retirement accounts without relying on \n     projected budget surpluses, and they have bipartisan \n     support,'' said Concord Coalition Policy Director Robert \n     Bixby.\n       ``The Concord Coalition also commends Chairman Archer and \n     all of the witnesses at this week's hearings for putting \n     forth the specifics of their Social Security reform plans. \n     The safest place is always on the sidelines. However, if the \n     end result of the Social Security debate is to avoid all the \n     hard choices, we might as well launch a new government \n     program to find the fountain of youth because otherwise we \n     will never be able to meet all of our future benefit \n     obligations,'' Bixby said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Concord Coalition,\n\n                                      Washington DC, June 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     Hon. Robert Kerrey,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Gregg, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Grassley: \n     The Concord Coalition heartily commends you and the other co-\n     sponsors of the Bipartisan Social Security Agreement. \n     Together, you have demonstrated political courage by making \n     the kind of hard choices that must be made to preserve Social \n     Security in a fiscally responsible and generationally fair \n     manner.\n       For the past two years the Concord Coalition has devoted \n     much of its time and resources to promoting bipartisan \n     dialogue on the key long-term challenges facing Social \n     Security, and evaluating potential solutions.\n       Three conclusions stand out:\n       First, changing demographics make the current pay-as-you-go \n     benefit structure unsustainable. Absent change, the system \n     will either burden future workers with steep tax hikes, or \n     betray future retirees with deep benefit cuts. Take the year \n     2033 as an example. While the Social Security trust fund will \n     still be officially solvent in that year, the program is \n     projected to be running a cash deficit of some $280 billion \n     in today's dollars--an amount roughly equal to this year's \n     entire budget for national defense. Closing the gap that year \n     would require a Social Security payroll tax hike of 40% or a \n     nearly 30% cut in benefits.\n       Second, there are only two roads to genuine reform, and a \n     workable plan must pursue both. Reform must reduce Social \n     Security's long-term burden by reducing its long-term costs. \n     And it must make the remaining burden more bearable by \n     increasing national savings, and hence the size of tomorrow's \n     economic pie. Doing so requires the hard choices of fiscal \n     discipline. In short, there are no magic bullets.\n       Third, the time for action is now. The longer reform is \n     delayed, the worse the problem will become and the more \n     draconian the solutions will be. Moreover, delay risks losing \n     a valuable opportunity to act while the economy remains \n     strong, the huge baby boom generation is still in its peak \n     earning years, and the Social Security trust fund is running \n     an ample cash surplus.\n       The Concord Coalition commends your efforts because the \n     Bipartisan Agreement recognizes each of these conclusions. We \n     are particularly pleased that you have resisted the \n     temptation to rely on speculative gains such as projected \n     budget surpluses and higher returns to close Social \n     Security's fiscal gap. Either strategy is fraught with peril.\n       Projected budget surpluses may never come to pass. And even \n     if they do, there are many other competing claims on this \n     hoped for windfall. Market gains can certainly help workers \n     earn a higher return on their payroll contributions. But it \n     would be irresponsible to ignore structural reforms in favor \n     of simply ``playing the spread'' between the expected returns \n     on stocks and bonds.\n       Another advantage of your plan is that it does not rely on \n     double counting assets by crediting funds both to the Social \n     Security trust fund and to some other purpose such as debt \n     reduction or individual accounts. Money cannot be spent \n     twice. Plans that purport to do so are ducking the real \n     question of how future benefits will actually be paid.\n       As the President's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n     has observed about the trust funds:\n       . . . [T]hey are claims on the Treasury that, when \n     redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, \n     borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other \n     expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, \n     therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the \n     Government's ability to pay benefits.\n       Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States \n     Government, Fiscal Year 2000 p. 337.\n       Given the difficult choices ahead, it is all too easy for \n     elected officials to lament the problems while remaining \n     silent on the solutions. Clearly, the authors of the \n     Bipartisan Social Security Agreement have answered this \n     challenge.\n       The Concord Coalition is currently developing its own \n     Social Security reform proposals. While in the end Concord \n     may not endorse every element of your plan, we recognize that \n     there is no such thing as a ``perfect'' plan. Trade-offs will \n     always need to be made. But we fully support the bipartisan, \n     fiscally responsible, generationally fair path you have \n     chosen. As the process of Social Security reform moves \n     forward we hope that an increasing number of your colleagues \n     will do what you have done--make the hard choices.\n       The Concord Coalition stands ready to assist in any way \n     that we can.\n       Sincerely,\n     Warren Rudman,\n       Co-Chairman.\n     Sam Nunn,\n       Co-Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                        National Association of Manufacturers,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: American workers and future retirees \n     would have much to gain under your bipartisan Social Security \n     modernization plan that would allow workers the opportunity \n     to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in \n     personal retirement accounts. Not only does the plan help \n     workers accumulate adequate resources for retirement, but it \n     also restores the 75-year solvency of the Social Security \n     Trust Fund. Individuals would own the accounts and could pass \n     the money on to their heirs.\n       Thank you for your outstanding leadership as an original \n     cosponsor of this plan; it would achieve real Social Security \n     reform without a tax increase, accounting gimmicks or \n     dependence on budget surpluses. This reform plan will help \n     prepare for the retirement of the baby boom generation when \n     the Trust Fund begins paying out more than it received in \n     payroll taxes by 2014. At the same time, the plan would \n     maintain a safety net for all workers, while establishing a \n     guaranteed minimum benefit for low-income workers not \n     available under current law.\n       The NAM and its 14,000 member companies appreciate your \n     leadership of the 1997-98 bipartisan National Commission on \n     Retirement Policy, on S. 2313 and your work this year to \n     broaden cosponsors for the 1999 plan. Thank you for your \n     commitment to reform and we look forward to working with you \n     toward passage of Social Security legislation that assures \n     retirement security for all workers and promises a viable \n     economy for America's future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sharon F.

Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: On behalf of the thirty organizations \n     that comprise the\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\n     AWRS, I would like to extend congratulations on the \n     introduction of your Bipartisan Social Security Reform bill. \n     While acknowledging the financial shortfall ahead, you and \n     the other co-sponsors have succeeded in developing a plan \n     that saves Social Security and is fair for American workers, \n     employers, and retirees alike.\n       The members of AWRS are committed to the responsible reform \n     of Social Security--not just accounting gimmicks. We are \n     pleased to see that your bill meets all of the principles for \n     reform set forth by the AWRS, including the creation of \n     Personal Retirement Accounts from a portion of the FICA taxes \n     with no FICA tax increases, no government ownership of \n     private enterprise, and a strong safety net for all retirees \n     while preserving the benefits of existing retirees. In fact, \n     your bill is more progressive than the existing system and \n     will result in more of our elderly being lifted out of \n     poverty. As the debate moves forward, we will have \n     suggestions for modest changes or elaborations, but we \n     support your bill as an excellent staring point for reform.\n       We are especially pleased that your legislation \n     restructures the existing system and reduces the huge \n     unfunded liabilities ahead of us. Workers and employers \n     already pay an astounding 12.4% of earnings to fund Social \n     Security. They cannot be asked to also carry the burden of a \n     projected $20 trillion shortfall over the next 75 years! The \n     weight of this burden would certainly have a very negative \n     impact on wage growth, workers' ability to save, and the \n     overall economy.\n       Instead, you have wisely chosen to follow the course \n     already charted by countries all over the world that have \n     faced similar demographic problems in their public pension \n     systems. More than fifteen countries--who were also facing \n     huge future funding shortfalls--have voted to restructure \n     their pay-as-you-go system to allow workers to invest their \n     payroll taxes in the growing economic market. And, no country \n     has chosen  to simply raise taxes, create a new entitlement \n     system, or hide the problem behind accounting gimmicks.\n       Along with your other co-sponsors, we commend for your \n     courage and your ability to find responsible answers to \n     difficult entitlements' problems. We will urge your \n     colleagues in the Senate to get involved with you and work in \n     a bi-partisan manner to achieve reform now. There is no \n     better time--and the children, the workers, and the elderly \n     in our country deserve nothing less.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leanne J. Abdnor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                            the Self-Employed,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: On behalf of the more than 330,000 \n     members of the National Association for the Self-Employed, as \n     well as millions of other independent entrepreneurs in \n     America, we commend you for introducing the Senate Bipartisan \n     Social Security Plan.\n       The bill that you and six of your Senate colleagues are \n     introducing meets the criteria that the NASE has long sought \n     for Social Security reform:\n       It does not increase payroll taxes or add to the current \n     Social Security tax inequities of the self-employed.\n       It avoids changing retirement benefits for current and near \n     retirees.\n       It actually increases the defined benefit safety net for \n     future retirees.\n       It reduces the huge unfunded liability of the Social \n     Security system, and\n       It permits a portion of Social Security taxes to be \n     allocated to personal retirement accounts that workers \n     themselves would own and control.\n       In addition to these noteworthy achievements, your bill \n     would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years, \n     according to the Social Security Administration's own \n     actuaries. And it would do so without raising the retirement \n     age, creating an entirely new entitlement system, or relying \n     on government IOU's to prop up the Social Security Trust \n     Fund.\n       This is genuine and thorough reform. It would put the \n     nation's moral obligation to its retirees on the soundest \n     financial footing that it's had in at least a generation.\n       We hope your bill will lead the way in the forthcoming \n     effort to reform Social Security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bernie L.

Charles Grassley,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Gregg, Breaux, Kerrey and Grassley: Economic \n     Security 2000 applauds the introduction of your \n     comprehensive, fiscally responsible Bipartisan Social \n     Security Agreement. This plan saves Social Security for 75 \n     years and beyond, without placing future tax burdens on \n     younger generations. More importantly, it addresses the \n     broader issue of retirement security by creating Personal \n     Retirement Accounts, which open up meaningful savings and \n     ownership to all Americans.\n       We commend the Bipartisan Social Security Agreement for \n     strengthening the safety net guarantees that have been the \n     bedrock of Social Security. In maintaining the progressive \n     structure of the guaranteed Social Security benefit, the plan \n     increases the defined benefit for lower-income workers whom \n     otherwise have little or no opportunity for saving.\n       The Bipartisan Agreement provides a real opportunity for \n     working Americans to build a nest egg for themselves and \n     their children. Fifty-three percent of Americans earn less \n     than $18,000. Yet, the $18,000 workers pays over $2,200 in \n     payroll taxes each year. By allowing a portion of the current \n     FICA tax to be diverted into an individually owned and \n     controlled savings account, every American is given the \n     opportunity to accumulate meaningful savings and real \n     retirement security. Moreover, these accounts mirror the \n     progressive nature of Social Security through government \n     savings matches for lower-wage workers.\n       As a grassroots organization, we have a unique \n     understanding of the American public's desire for a Social \n     Security solution that provides real ownership and control \n     over their retirement assets. You have demonstrated great \n     leadership and courage by making the tough decisions \n     necessary to preserve Social Security for today's seniors as \n     well as future generations. We thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Sam Beard,\n     Founder/President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Women Business Owners,\n\n                                Silver Springs, MD, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     Hon. Bob Kerrey,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Gregg, Breaux, Kerrey, and Grassley: The \n     National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) \n     commends you for the introduction of the Senate Bi-Partisan \n     Social Security Reform Bill. NAWBO's membership represents \n     9.1 million women business owners who employ 27.5 million \n     workers, and we believe this legislation would be good for \n     all those whom we represent.\n       NAWBO has extensively reviewed the Social Security reform \n     measures being discussed in Congress, and developed a set of \n     principles which include giving all workers the opportunity \n     to use a portion of their FICA taxes to create Personal \n     Retirement Accounts. No one knows better the importance of \n     personal ownership and control than the millions of women who \n     own businesses. We strongly support extending this principle \n     of ownership and control to all workers through the creation \n     of thes PRAs. Likewise, we believe the Social Security \n     Administration must continue to provide a strong safety net-\n     guaranteed minimum benefit-for all retirees. We must lift \n     even more of our elderly, most of whom are women, out of \n     poverty.\n       Your legislation achieves these goals and more. It reduces \n     the unfunded liability of the Social Security System \n     (currently set by SSA at $20 trillion over the next 75 \n     years), saves Social Security and puts it on a permanently \n     sustainable path. Your bill is strongly bi-partisan, which is \n     required for any reform measure to pass Congress. In other \n     words, it is fair to all constituencies, not just a segment \n     of the population.\n       NAWBO is a member of the Alliance for Worker Retirement \n     Security. We will continue to work with AWRS and you to \n     secure our future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Terry Neese,\n\n                                       Past President, Corporate &\n     Public Policy Advisor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Business Roundtable,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: I would like to congratulate you on \n     your efforts to move forward this critical debate on the \n     future of Social Security. The ``Senate Bi-Partisan Social \n     Security Bill'' is largely consistent with the principles The \n     Business Roundtable developed to guide its members as we \n     participate in this important debate.\n       Based on the information we have reviewed, there are \n     several positive elements of your plan that deserve special \n     recognition. The plan is more progressive than the current \n     system in that low-wage workers will receive a higher defined \n     benefit than is promised from the current Social Security \n     system. It insures that general revenues would be used \n     responsibly to save Social Security, not create a new \n     entitlement system. You have also stepped up to the plate and \n     addressed the hard choices we all know must be faced. The \n     bill would reduce the unfunded liability of the Social \n     Security System, currently set by the Social Security \n     Administration at $20 trillion, over the next 75 years. In \n     addition, all workers under age 62 would receive Personal \n     Retirement Accounts that they own, control, and can pass on \n     to their heirs.\n       Of course, there are issues we would like to explore in \n     more depth as this and other proposals are debated. For \n     example, we have concerns about how individual accounts are \n     invested, and would like to learn more about your proposal to \n     model the accounts on the federal Thrift Savings Plan. We \n     would encourage as many investment options as possible to \n     allow individuals to diversify their accounts and prevent \n     undue market concentration. It also is inclear how corporate \n     governance concerns, such as the voting of\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\n     proxies, would be handled. Finally, we would like to explore \n     the interaction between individuals accounts and employer-\n     sponsored retirement plans. The ability of individuals to \n     make additional voluntary contributions to their accounts \n     under your plan may inadvertently have a negative impact on \n     private plans. Again, this is an issue we would like to \n     discuss with you as your proposal is fleshed out.\n       These issues are not meant to overshadow the critical \n     contribution you have made to advance this debate. Most \n     importantly, the proposal enjoys bipartisan support. The only \n     way we will, or should, adopt comprehensive Social Security \n     reform is if we all work together as a nation to develop a \n     plan that keeps its promises to current retirees and those \n     near retirement while meeting the needs of future \n     generations.\n       The Business Roundtable looks forward to working with you, \n     and with every other member of Congress as well as the \n     Clinton Administration, to promote responsible reform of our \n     Social Security system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 M. Anthony Burns,\n         Chairman & CEO, Ryder System, Inc., Chairman, Health and \n           Retirement Task Force, The Business Roundtable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Council for Government Reform,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, July 8, 1999.\n     Senator Judd Gregg,\n     Senator John Breaux,\n     Senator Bob Kerrey,\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Gregg, Breaux, Kerrey, and Grassley: On \n     behalf of the Council for Government Reform's 350,000 \n     supporters, let me congratulate you on your hard work and \n     diligence in preparing the Senate Bipartisan Social Security \n     bill. You are very courageous to offer a detailed plan that \n     actually addresses some of the long-term structural and \n     demographic problems that unquestionably confront our current \n     pay-as-you-go system. The Council for Government Reform \n     strongly agrees with many of the principles put forth in your \n     legislation.\n       The introduction of your legislation indicates that \n     prospects for true Social Security reform are not dead in the \n     106th Congress. Rather, you offer the hope that some short-\n     sighted, new entitlement system that would even further \n     saddle our most recently born children, as well as future \n     generations, with high taxes will not be adopted.\n       Although this is not the first major proposal in the 106th \n     Congress, the Senate Bipartisan Social Security bill actually \n     addresses some of the underlying programs in the Social \n     Security system. It avoids the pitfalls of adding-on \n     additional taxes, creating new entitlement programs, or \n     sabotaging personal retirement accounts. This legislation \n     will spark the Social Security reform debate towards a \n     dynamic, solvent, and efficient Social Security system for \n     the 21st century.\n       The keys to bipartisan legislative potential are individual \n     ownership of retirement accounts, guaranteed minimum \n     benefits, and a reliance on a ``carve-out,'' rather than an \n     ``add-on.'' The carve-out vs. add-on distinction is crucial \n     because add-ons carry with them implicit tax increases while \n     carve-outs allow for better investment of funds already taxed \n     away from American workers.\n       The Council for Government Reform is very pleased that the \n     Senate Bipartisan Social Security bill would eliminate the \n     earning test. This is important to CGR's supporters \n     nationwide, many of whom want to continue to earn income \n     without suffering a loss in their Social Security benefits.\n       Equally important, this is a bipartisan bill which \n     indicates its appeal can cross party lines and gain \n     widespread support on Capital Hill. Given the poisonous \n     political environment and the election coming up, only \n     bipartisan bills stand a chance of going anywhere. The only \n     question is whether common sense, political courage, and the \n     public interest can prevail in bringing this debate to the \n     forefront.\n       Gentleman, on behalf of the Council, I sincerely thank you \n     for your efforts and stand ready to assist you in creating a \n     retirement income security system that protects current \n     retirees while saving our children and grandchildren from \n     bankruptcy.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Charles G. Hardin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             United Seniors Association, Inc.,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, July 15, 1999.\n     Hon. John Breaux,\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Hon Bob Kerrey,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Breaux, Gregg, Grassley, and Kerrey: United \n     Seniors Association (USA) greatly appreciates your efforts to \n     save Social Security. The legislation you are introducing is \n     timely and a significant step toward improving the program.\n       With Social Security in serious financial trouble, you \n     recognize that the status quo is unacceptable. No later than \n     2014--just 15 years away--the program will begin to pay out \n     more than it collects in payroll tax revenue. That is when \n     Social Security's financial crisis really begins.\n       According to the 1999 Trustees Report, to keep Social \n     Security solvent for the next 75 years will require raising \n     the payroll tax to over 18% (a 50% increase), reducing \n     benefits by at least one-third, or some combination of the \n     two.\n       USA has long advocated that the current pay-as-you-go \n     system must be redesigned to maintain solvency and to assure \n     higher benefits for future retirees. The creation of Personal \n     Retirement Accounts (PRAs), owned and controlled by workers, \n     will help achieve these goals. While we favor allowing \n     workers to privately invest at least 5 percentage points of \n     their payroll taxes, your legislation is an excellent start.\n       There are many other attractive features of the legislation \n     that will draw widespread support. These include: protecting \n     current beneficiaries to whom promises have been made; \n     rewarding work by eliminating the earnings test; and \n     encouraging workers to increase savings.\n       On behalf of USA's 685,000 members, thank you for your \n     concern about the retirement security of all Americans. We \n     look forward to working with you to pass this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Dorcas R. Hardy,\n\n                            Former Commissioner of Social Security\n     and Policy Advisor to USA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The 60 Plus Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: The 60 Plus Association strongly \n     endorses your proposal to safeguard Social Security. \n     Especially significant, we believe, is that your proposal is \n     bipartisan co-sponsored by your colleagues Senators Bob \n     Kerrey, John Breaux and Charles Robb. Clearly, any reform \n     must be palatable to both parties. Your measure reduces the \n     unfunded liability of the Social Security system (currently \n     set by the Social Security system) and saves Social Security \n     for 75 years and even longer.\n       Significantly, all workers under the age of 62 would \n     receive Personal Retirement Accounts that they own, control, \n     and, most importantly, can pass on to their heirs.\n       60 Plus believes it is more progressive than the current \n     system in that low-wage workers will receive a higher defined \n     benefit than is promised from Social Security.\n       Your proposal doesn't raise the age at which you can get \n     benefits although it accelerates the current law increase to \n     67. Also, it does not rely on IOUs in the Social Security \n     Trust Fund. We hope that Congress will act on it soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James L. Martin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I truly \nbelieve is Congress's ``last, best hope'' to place Social Security on a \ncourse of long-term health in this session of Congress. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to look carefully at this bipartisan, bicameral, fiscally \nresponsible plan, and to give their support to this, our best chance to \nmeet our important responsibility to take action so as to enable Social \nSecurity to continue to meet its historic mission of providing senior \ncitizens with insurance against poverty in old age.\n  The proposal that I will discuss was negotiated over several months \nbetween a bipartisan group of committed reformers in the Senate. It \nalready has more cosponsors than any other competing proposal. Those \ncosponsors include myself, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator John Breaux, \nSenator Chuck Grassley, Senator Fred Thompson, Senator Chuck Robb, and \nSenator Craig Thomas.\n  What I want to do in my remarks is to describe what our proposal \nwould achieve, and then to provide some details as to how it achieves \nthese goals. It would: s\n  Make Social Security solvent. Not simply for 75 years, but \nperpetually, as far as SSA can estimate. Our proposal would leave the \nsystem on a permanently sustainable path.\n  Increase Social Security benefits beyond what the current system can \nfund. I will follow up with some details as to why and how.\n  It would drastically reduce taxes below current-law levels. Again, I \nwill provide details as to why and how it does this.\n  It will make the system far less costly than current law, and also \nless costly than competing reform proposals.\n  It will not touch the benefits of current retirees.\n  It will strengthen the ``safety net'' against poverty and provide \nadditional protections for the disabled, for widows, and for other \nvulnerable sectors of the population.\n  It will vastly reduce the federal government's unfunded liabilities.\n  It would use the best ideas provided by reformers across the \npolitical spectrum, and thus offers a practical opportunity for a \nlarger bipartisan agreement.\n  It will provide for fairer treatment across generations, across \ndemographic\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\ngroups. It would improve the work incentives of the current system.\n  I would like now to explain how our proposal achieves all of these \nobjectives:\n  Our system would make the system solvent for as far as the Social \nSecurity Actuaries are able to estimate.\n  How does it do this? Above all else, it accomplishes this through \nadvance funding.\n  As the members of this Committee know, our population is aging \nrapidly. Currently we have a little more than 3 workers paying into the \nsystem for every 1 retiree taking out of it. Within a generation, that \nratio will be down to 2:1.\n  As a consequence, if we did nothing, future generations would be \nassessed skyrocketing tax rates in order to meet benefit promises. The \nprojected cost (tax) rate of the Social Security system, according to \nthe Actuaries, will be almost 18% by 2030.\n  The Trust Fund is not currently scheduled to become insolvent until \n2034, but as most acknowledge, the existence of the Trust Fund has \nnothing to do with the government's ability to pay benefits. President \nClinton's submitted budget for this year made the point as well as I \npossibly could:\n\n       These balances are available to finance future benefit \n     payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a \n     bookkeeping sense . . . They do not consist of real economic \n     assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. \n     Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, \n     will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \n     public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The \n     existence of large Trust Fund balances, therefore, does not, \n     by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay \n     benefits.\n\n  In other words, we have a problem that arises in 2014, not in 2034, \nand it quickly becomes an enormous one unless we find a way to put \naside savings today. This does not mean simply adding a series of \ncredits to the Social Security Trust Fund, which would have no positive \nimpact, as the quote from the President's budget clearly shows.\n  What we have to do is begin to advance fund the current system, and \nthat means taking some of that surplus Social Security money today out \nof the federal coffers and into a place where it can be saved, \ninvested--owned by individual beneficiaries. That money would belong to \nthem immediately, even though they could not withdraw it before \nretirement. But it would be a real asset in their name.\n  By doing this, we can reduce the amount of the benefit that needs to \nbe funded in the future by raising taxes on future generations. This is \nthe critical objective, but it allows for flippant political attacks. \nIf you give someone a part of their benefit today, in their personal \naccount, and less of it later on, some will say that it is a ``cut'' in \nbenefits. It is no such thing. Only in Washington can giving people \nownership rights and real funding for a portion of their benefits, and \nincreasing their total real value, be construed as a cut. Accepting \nsuch terminology can only lead to one conclusion--that we can't advance \nfund, because we simply have to be sure that every penny of future \nbenefits comes from taxing future workers. So we need to get out of \nthat rhetorical trap.\n  Our proposal has been certified by the actuaries as attaining \nactuarial solvency, and in fact it goes so far as to slightly \novershoot. We are ``overbalanced'' in the years after 2050, and have \nsome room to modify the proposal in some respects and yet still stay in \nbalance.\n  I would note the consensus that has developed for some form of \nadvance funding. This was one of the few recommendations that united an \notherwise divided Social Security Advisory Council in 1996. The major \ndisagreements today among policymakers consist only in the area of who \nshould control and direct the investment opportunities created within \nSocial Security. I believe strongly, and I believe a Congressional \nmajority agrees, that this investment should be directed by individual \nbeneficiaries, not by the federal government or any other public board.\n  We have worked with the Social Security actuaries and the \nCongressional Research Service to estimate the levels of benefits \nprovided under our plan.\n  There are certain bottom-line points that should be recognized about \nour plan. Among them:\n  (1) Low-wage earners in every birth cohort measured would experience \nhigher benefits under our plan than current law can sustain, even \nwithout including the proceeds from personal accounts.\n  (2) Average earners in every birth cohort measured would experience \nhigher benefits under our plan than current law can sustain, even if \ntheir personal accounts only grew at the projected bond rate of 3.0%.\n  (3) Maximum earners in some birth cohorts would need either to \nachieve the historical rate of return on stocks, or to put in \nadditional voluntary contributions, in order to exceed benefit levels \nof current law. However, the tax savings to high-income earners, which \nI will outline in the next section, will be so great that on balance \nthey would also benefit appreciably from our reform plan.\n  Under current law, a low-wage individual retiring in the year 2040 at \nthe age of 65 would be promised a monthly benefit of $752. However, due \nto the pending insolvency of the system, only $536 of that can be \nfunded. We cannot know in advance how future generations would \ndistribute the program changes between benefit cuts and tax increases. \nBut we do know that our plan, thanks to advance funding, would offer a \nhigher benefit to that individual, from a fully solvent system that \nwould eliminate the need for those choices.\n  I will provide tables that are based on the research of the \nCongressional Research Service that make clear all of the above points. \nThe CRS makes projections that assume that under current law, benefits \nwould be paid in full until 2034, and then suddenly cut by more than \n25% when the system becomes insolvent. CRS can make no other \npresumption in the absence of advance knowledge of how Congress would \ndistribute the pain of benefit reductions among birth cohorts. In order \nto translate the CRS figures into a more plausible outcome, we added a \ncolumn showing the effects that would come from the benefit reductions \nunder current law being shared equally by all birth cohorts.\n\n    BENEFIT TABLE NO. 1.--THE BIPARTISAN PLAN'S BENEFITS WOULD BE HIGHER FOR LOW-INCOME WORKERS EVEN WITHOUT\n                                           COUNTING PERSONAL ACCOUNTS\n        [(Assumes Steady Low-Wage Worker) (Monthly Benefit, 1999 Dollars) (Assumes Retirement at Age 65)]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                          Bipartisan\n                                                                          plan (bond  Bipartisan    Bipartisan\n     Yr. and current law (benefit cuts begin in 2034)        Current law    rate no    plan (w/o    plan (w/1%\n                                                            sustainable*     vol.       account      voluntary\n                                                                           contrib.)   benefits)  contributions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000    626...............................................          517          615         606           627\n2005    624...............................................          515          620         601           645\n2010    652...............................................          539          698         667           738\n2015    673...............................................          556          733         687           790\n2020    660...............................................          545          754         691           832\n2030    690...............................................          570          776         694           877\n2035    512...............................................          595          798         693           926\n2040    536...............................................          621          821         689           981\n2050    582...............................................          678          869         710          1051\n2060    611...............................................          739          920         749         1107\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* The Congressional Research Service, in the left-hand column, assumes that all of the burden of benefit changes\n  under current law will commence in 2034.

In order to produce a more realistic prediction of how the changes\n  required under current law would be spread, the ``current law sustainable'' column assumes that they have been\n  spread equally among birth cohorts throughout the valuation period.\n\n  The alternative course is that current benefit promises would be met \nin full by raising taxes, both under current law and under proposals to \nsimply transfer credits to the Social Security Trust Fund. I have also \nprovided a table that shows the size of these tax costs, and will \ncomment further upon them in the next portion of my statement.\n  I would like to point out that these figures apply to individuals \nretiring at\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\nthe age of 65. Thus, even with the increased actuarial adjustment for \nearly retirement under our plan, and even though our plan would \naccelerate the pace at which the normal retirement age would reach its \ncurrent-law target of 67, benefits under our proposal for individuals \nretiring at 65 would still be higher.\n  Our tables also show that the progressive match program for low-\nincome individuals will also add enormously to the projected benefits \nthat they will receive.\n  If there is a single most obvious and important benefit of enacting \nthis reform, it is in the tax reductions that will result from it.\n  I am not referring to the most immediate tax reduction, the payroll \ntax cut that will be given to individuals in the form of a refund into \na personal account.\n  The greatest reduction in taxes would come in the years from 2015 on \nbeyond. At that time, under current law--and under many reform plans--\nenormous outlays from general revenues would be needed to redeem the \nSocial Security Trust Fund, or to fund personal accounts. The net cost \nof the system would begin to climb. The federal government would have \nto collect almost 18% of national taxable payroll in the year 2030, \nmore than 5 points of that coming from general revenues.\n  The hidden cost of the current Social Security system is not the \npayroll tax increases that everyone knows would be required after 2034, \nbut the general tax increases that few will admit would be required \nstarting in 2014.\n  With my statement, I include a table showing the effective tax rate \ncosts of current law as well as the various actuarially sound reform \nproposals that have been placed before the Congress. These figures come \ndirectly from the Social Security actuaries. They include the sum of \nthe costs of paying OASDI benefits, plus any mandatory contributions to \npersonal accounts. (Under our proposal, additional voluntary \ncontributions would also be permitted. But any federal ``matches'' of \nvoluntary contributions from general revenues would be contingent upon \nnew savings being generated.)\n  Let me return to our individual who is working in the year 2025 under \ncurrent law. In that year, a tax increase equal to 3.61% of payroll \nwould effectively need to be assessed through general revenues in order \nto pay promised benefits. As a low-income individual, his share of that \nburden would be less than if it were assessed through the payroll tax, \nbut it would still be real. Under current law, his income tax burden \ncomes to about $241 annually.\n\n                          COMPARISON OF COST RATES OF CURRENT LAW AND ALTERNATIVE PLANS\n    [(As a percentage of taxable payroll) (Annual cost includes OASDI outlays plus contributions to personal\n                                      accounts.)

Unlike the other personal account proposals, the\n  accounts in Moynihan/Kerrey plan are voluntary. The figure without\n  parentheses assumes no contributions to, and thus no income from,\n  personal accounts. The figure inside parentheses assumes universal\n  participation in 2% personal accounts, for comparison with other\n  personal account plans.)\n*--Like the Nadler plan, the Moynihan/Kerrey plan would increase the\n  share of national income subject to Social Security taxation, but to a\n  lesser degree. Thus, tax rates will appear lower than would an\n  equivalent amount of tax revenue collected under the Archer/Shaw,\n  Gramm, or Kolbe/Stenholm plans. The correction factor required to\n  translate one cost rate into another would be between 1.03-1.06 for\n  the Nadler proposal, 1.01-1.02 for the Senate bipartisan proposal, and\n  1.01-1.04 for the Moynihan/Kerrey proposal.\n\n  Under our proposal, that tax burden would drop by roughly 37%, from \n$241 to $153.\n  Middle and high-income workers would not experience benefit increases \nas generous as those provided to low-income individuals under our plan. \nBut we have determined that by the year 2034, an average wage earner \nwould save the equivalent of $650 a year (1999 dollars) in income \ntaxes, and a maximum-wage earner, $2,350 a year. I want to stress that \nthese savings are net of any effects of re-indexing CPI upon the income \ntax rates. These are net tax reductions, even including our CPI \nreforms.\n  I would also stress that 2025 is not a particularly favorable example \nto select. Our relative tax savings get much larger after that point, \ngrowing steadily henceforth.\n  A look at our chart showing total costs reveals how quickly our \nproposal, as well as the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal, begins to reduce tax \nburdens.\n  A plan as comprehensive as ours can be picked apart by critics, \nprovision by provision. It is easy to criticize a plan's parts in \nisolation from the whole, and to say that one of them is \ndisadvantageous, heedless of the other benefits and gains provided. One \nreason for the specific choices that we made is revealed in this \nimportant table. The result of not making them is simply that, by the \nyear 2030, the effective tax rate of the system will surpass 17%, an \nunfortunate legacy to leave to posterity.\n  How would current retirees be affected by our proposal?\n  Only in one way. Their benefits would come from a solvent system, and \ntherefore, political pressure to cut their benefits will be reduced. \nOur proposal would not affect their benefits in any way. Even the \nrequired methodological corrections to the Consumer Price Index would \nnot affect the benefits of current retirees.\n  Under current law, there is no way of knowing what future generations \nwill do when the tax levels required to support this system begin to \nrise in the year 2014. We do not know whether future generations will \nbe able to afford to increase the tax costs of the system to 18% of the \nnational tax base by the year 2030, or whether other pressing national \nneeds, such as a recession or an international conflict will make this \nuntenable. Current law may therefore contain the seeds of political \npressure to cut benefits. Moreover, as general revenues required to \nsustain the system grow to the levels of hundreds of billions each \nyear, there is the risk that upper-income individuals will correctly \ndiagnose that the system has become an irretrievably bad deal for them, \nand that they will walk away from this important program.\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n  By eliminating the factors that might lead to pressure to cut \nbenefits, our proposal would keep the benefits of seniors far more \nsecure.\n  Poverty would be reduced under our proposal, even if the personal \naccounts do not grow at an aggressive rate. The reason for this is that \nour proposal would increase the progressivity of the basic defined, \nguaranteed Social Security benefit. It would also gradually phase in \nincreased benefits for widows.\n  Moreover, our plan would protect the disabled. They would be \nunaffected by the changes made to build new saving into the system. \nTheir benefits would not be impacted by the benefit offsets \nproportional to personal account contributions. If an individual \nbecomes disabled prior to retirement age, they would receive their \ncurrent-law benefit.\n  It is important to recognize that we do not face a choice between \nmaintaining Social Security as a ``social insurance'' system and as an \n``earned benefit.'' It has always served both functions, and it must \ncontinue to do so in order to sustain political support. The system \nmust retain some features of being an ``earned benefit'' so as not be \nreduced to a welfare program only. This is why proposals to simply bail \nout the system through general revenue transfusions alone--to turn it \ninto, effectively, another welfare program in which contributions and \nbenefits are not related--are misguided and undermine the system's \nethic.\n  Again, I would repeat that our proposal contains important benefits \nfor all individuals. Guaranteed benefits on the low-income end would be \nincreased. High income earners would be spared the large current-law \ntax increases that would otherwise be necessary. If we act responsibly \nand soon, we can accomplish a reform that serves the interests of all \nAmericans.\n  By putting aside some funding today, and reducing the proportion of \nbenefits that are financed solely by taxing future workers, our \nproposal would vastly reduce the system's unfunded liabilities.\n  Consider such a year as 2034. Under current law, the government would \nhave a liability from general revenues to the Trust Fund equal to an \napproximately 5 point payroll tax increase. By advance funding \nbenefits, our plan would reduce the cost of OASDI outlays in that year \nfrom more than 18% to less than 14%. The pressure on general revenue \noutlays would be reduced by more than half.\n  The Social Security system would be left on a sustainable course. The \nshare of benefits each year that are unfunded liabilities would begin \nto go down partway through the retirement of the baby boom generation. \nBy the end of the valuation period, the actuaries tell us, the system \nwould have a rising amount of assets in the Trust Fund.\n  Mr. President, I would stress to you that our plan is not the work of \nany one single legislator. It is the product of painstaking \nnegotiations conducted over several months. The seven names that you \nsee on the proposal are not the only ones who contributed to it. We \ntook the best ideas that we could find from serious reform plans \npresented across the political spectrum. Each of us had to make \nconcessions that we did not like. But we did this in the interest of \nreaching a bipartisan accord.\n  We believe that our plan is indicative of the product that would \nresult from a larger bipartisan negotiation in the Congress. \nAccordingly, we believe that it provides the best available vehicle for \nnegotiations with the President if he chooses to become substantively \ninvolved. It was our hope to put forth a proposal on a bipartisan \nbasis, so that the President would not have to choose between \nnegotiating with a ``Republican plan'' or a ``Democratic plan.'' \nStalemate will not save our Social Security system.\n  The changes effected in our bipartisan bill do not, all of them, \nrelate solely to fixing system solvency.\n  One area of reforms includes improved work incentives. Our proposal \nwould eliminate the earnings limit for retirees. It would also correct \nthe actuarial adjustments for early and late retirement so that \nbeneficiaries who continue to work would receive back in benefits the \nvalue of the extra payroll taxes they contributed. The proposal would \nalso change the AIME formula so that the number of earnings years in \nthe numerator would no longer be tied to the number of years in the \ndenominator. In other words, every year of earnings, no matter how \nsmall, would have the effect of increasing overall benefits (Under \ncurrent law, only the earnings in the top earnings years are counted \ntowards benefits, and the more earnings years that are counted, the \nlower are is the resulting benefit formula.)\n  We also included several provisions designed to address the needs of \nspecific sectors of the population who are threatened under current \nlaw. For example, we gradually would increase the benefits provided to \nwidows, so that they would ultimately be at least 75% of the combined \nvalue of the benefits that husband and wife would have been entitled to \non their own.\n  We also recognized the poor treatment of two-earner couples relative \nto one-earner couples under the current system. Our proposal includes \nfive ``dropout years'' in the benefit formula pertaining to two earner \ncouples, in recognition of the time that a spouse may have had to take \nout of the work force.\n  Unveiling a proposal as comprehensive as ours invariably creates \nmisunderstanding as to the effect of its various provisions.\n  First, let me address the impact of our reforms on the Consumer Price \nIndex. Most economists agree that further reforms are necessary to \ncorrect measures of the Consumer Price Index, and our proposal would \ninstruct BLS to make them. Correcting the CPI would have an effect on \ngovernment outlays as well as revenues. This is not a ``benefit cut'' \nor a ``tax increase,'' it is a correction. We would take what was \nincorrectly computed before and compute it correctly from now on. No \none whose income stays steady in real terms would see a tax increase. \nNo one's benefits would grow more slowly than the best available \nmeasure of inflation.\n  However, we wanted to be doubly certain that any effects of the CPI \nchange upon federal revenues not become a license for the government to \nspend these revenues on new ventures. Accordingly, we included a ``CPI \nrecapture'' provision to ensure that any revenues generated by this \nreform be returned to taxpayers as Social Security benefits, rather \nthan being used to finance new government spending. This is the reason \nfor the ``CPI recapture'' provision in the legislation.\n  Our proposal would not increase taxes in any form. The sum total of \nthe effects of all provisions in the legislation that might increase \nrevenues are greatly exceeded by the effects of the legislation that \nwould cut tax levels. The chart showing total cost rates makes this \nclear.\n  Our provision to re-index the wage cap is an important compromise \nbetween competing concerns. Fiscal conservatives are opposed to \narbitrarily raising the cap on taxable wages. The case made from the \nleft is that, left unchanged, the proportion of national wages subject \nto Social Security taxation would actually drop.\n  Our proposal found a neat bipartisan compromise between these \ncompeting concerns. It would maintain the current level of benefit \ntaxation of 86% of total national wages. This would only have an effect \non total revenues if the current-law formulation would have actually \ncaused a decrease in tax levels. If total wages outside the wage cap \ngrow in proportion to national wages currently subject to taxation, \nthere would be no substantive effect. This proposal basically asks \ncompeting concerns in this debate to ``put their money where their \nmouth is.'' If the concern is that we would otherwise have an indexing \nproblem, this proposal would resolve it. If the concern is that we \nshould not increase the proportion of total wages subject to taxation, \nthis proposal meets that, too. I would further add that the figure we \nchoose--86%--is the current-law level. Some proposals would raise this \nto 90%, citing the fact that at one point in history it did rise to \n90%. The historical average has actually been closer to 84%, and we did \nnot find the case for raising it to 90% to be persuasive. Keeping it at \nits current level of 86% is a reasonable bipartisan resolution of this \nissue.\n  In conclusion, this proposal represents our best hope to achieve \nmeaningful and responsible bipartisan reform of Social Security in this \nCongress. It does not represent a partisan\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\n``statement.'' It has not been drawn up in the spirit of ideological \n``purity.'' Rather, it combines the best ideas of the most committed \nreformers in the Senate. I am grateful to the other negotiators who \nworked so hard to put together this package, and I thank them--Senator \nBob Kerrey, Senator John Breaux, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Fred \nThompson, Senator Chuck Robb, and Senator Craig Thomas--for their \ntireless efforts to get this job done.\n  It is not the plan that I would have drawn up by myself. It is not \nthe plan that Senator Kerrey would have drawn up by himself. Each of us \nhad to give up something in the interest of crafting a proposal that \ntruly represented a bipartisan compromise. Without such compromise, we \nwill never be able to take action to safeguard benefits for our senior \ncitizens.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join our bipartisan team and cosponsor \nthis critically important legislation to reduce the unfunded \nliabilities of our Social Security system and to put critical funding \nand investment behind the benefits that it promises. I thank my \ncolleagues and I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with the Senators \nfrom Nebraska and Louisiana and, recently the Senator from Iowa, in \ndeveloping this bipartisan plan. The Senator from Nebraska and the \nSenator from Louisiana have truly done an extraordinary job of bringing \nto the attention\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nof the American public the essential needs to address soon, quickly, \nand substantively the issue of Social Security reform.\n  I had the pleasure of serving 15 months as cochair, along with the \nSenator from Louisiana, of a commission of folks put together--a large \ncross-section of people--who are truly expert in the area of Social \nSecurity. As a result of that commission, we produced a bill that was \nan excellent piece of legislation. We were joined, in a bipartisan way, \nby Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm, Members of the House, on that bill.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has been on his own bill, along with the \nSenator from New York. They have developed another bill here. Months \nago, we decided to get together and see if we could develop an even \nbigger coalition of membership around one concept of how to reform the \nSocial Security system. That is what we accomplished. It has been \naccomplished because of the strong and vibrant leadership of those two \nSenators who are on the floor today, Senators Breaux and Kerrey, and \nalso Senator Grassley, who is not here but may be coming in on a number \nof other issues that are involved in the Social Security reform matter. \nHis leadership has been excellent.\n  So, first of all, we do have a bipartisan bill. It has been pointed \nout by the Senator from Nebraska that this bill goes across the aisle, \nacross ideology, and it is a substantive bill. It is a proposal that \nhas been scored by the Social Security actuaries as creating solvency \nin the Social Security system for the next 100 years, at a minimum. It \ngoes to infinity, but I like to say the next century because it is a \nmore definable event. That is very important. It is a bipartisan \neffort, which shows it can be done. Second, it works, as scored by the \nSocial Security actuaries.\n  Why is it important? You don't have to look very far to see why. I \nnotice we have many Senate pages with us. These folks are juniors in \nhigh school who come here to work. They are either rising juniors, or \nhave completed their junior year in most instances. They come here to \nwork and see Congress in action. When they get finished with their \nschooling, most of them will go to college. When they get out of \ncollege, they are going to go to work. They are going to find that \nprobably the biggest amount that comes out of their paychecks is the \nFICA tax, a big chunk that comes out of paychecks. They are going to \npay that for all their working lives. What are they going to get back \nunder the present system? These wonderful young people are probably \nhoping I won't speak too long so they can get off for the weekend. But \nwhat are they going to get out of this? Actually, they are going to get \nvery little out of it. They will pay out a tremendous amount of taxes \nduring their working lives and they will virtually get nothing back for \nit.\n  In fact, a person coming into the workforce in their early twenties \ntoday--the rate of return on what they pay into Social Security taxes \nover their working lives, or how much they get back for the amount of \ntaxes they pay, is essentially a wash. They are not going to get any \nmore back than they pay in. That is not much of a return for all the \ntaxes they will pay over all those years. If you happen to be an \nAfrican American, you actually will get less back, as a group of \nindividuals, than you will end up paying.\n  So the system is broken. Why? It is broken because we have this huge \nbubble in our society, this huge population bubble called the postwar \nbaby boom generation, of which Bill Clinton is a member, I am a member, \nthe Senator in the Chair is a member, and the Senator from Louisiana is \na member. This postwar baby boom generation is the largest demographic \ngroup in the history of our country. When Social Security was \noriginally designed, and for all the years it has worked so well, it \nhas always been conceived as a pyramid. It was essentially perceived \nthat there would be many more people paying into the system than would \nbe taking out. So you would have many people earning in order to \nsupport the people getting the benefit--a pyramid.\n\n  In fact, as late as 1950, there were about 15 people paying into the \nsystem for every 1 person taking out. By the late part of this \ncentury--right about now, in fact--we are down to about 3\\1/2\\ people \npaying in for every 1 person taking out. When the baby boomers retire, \nbeginning in the year 2008, it starts to accelerate and it becomes an \nacute situation by 2014, where 2 people will be paying into the system \nfor every 1 taking out.\n  In that sort of a structure, you can see we simply can't support the \nbenefits. Instead of having a pyramid, we basically have some sort of \nrectangle. The older generation that will be retired--myself included--\nwill be demanding too much in the way of benefits for the younger \ngeneration to support. As a result, we end up bankrupting the system. \nTo express it in another way, even though there is a lot of debt in the \ntrust fund, even though the Social Security trust fund, as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska pointed out, has literally billions of dollars of IOUs in \nit, they are simply that; they are paper IOUs.\n  What drives the Social Security problem is the fact that when the \nbaby boom generation retires, there is a benefit that is guaranteed, a \ndefined benefit. As a retiree, under Social Security, when we hit 2010, \nor whenever I take retirement, I am guaranteed a benefit, a fixed sum \nof money that I will get under our system of Social Security, a defined \nbenefit.\n  Is there something there to pay that benefit? No, nothing. There are \nnotes held by the Social Security trust, but those notes are not assets \nin the sense that there is something to back them up that is a physical \nasset. What backs it up is the taxing of power of the United States. \nThe only way you can pay that defined benefit is to raise taxes on the \nearners of America to pay the benefits of the retired in America.\n  Because this generation is so huge and the defined benefit becomes so \nhuge, we will have a massive tax increase on the earners of America, \nstarting about the year 2014, and it accelerates radically to the point \nwhere we are literally talking, under the President's proposal on \nSocial Security, about $1 trillion annually in new taxes, simply to \nsupport those people who are retired by the year 2035--I think it might \nbe a little later. The fact is, it is a huge tax increase. Where do the \ntaxes come from? The earnings of American people. They will come from \nthe general fund, and they will end up essentially bankrupting this \ncountry.\n  Something needs to be done. Why have we put this plan forward? You \nsay: It won't happen until the year 2014; that is a long way away; I \ndon't have to worry about that.\n  We have to worry today because we can't answer this type of problem \nwhen it happens. We have to anticipate; we have to work to try to \ncorrect the problem before we hit the problem. Unfortunately, we are \nnot doing much to get ready for this problem.\n  To address this, we have put forward this bill. What is the basic \ntheme of this bill? The basic theme of this bill is that the way to \naddress the problem of the Social Security liability in the outyears is \nto begin to save in the early years, say to the American worker today: \nStart saving for retirement and have some ownership in that savings. \nToday you think you are saving for retirement under Social Security \nbecause you are paying the Social Security taxes, but that doesn't mean \nanything. The Social Security taxes are being spent by the Federal \nGovernment. There is no asset we are building up which the retiree will \nown.\n  We say under our bill to the wage earner, people earning money in the \nmarketplace--whether the job is a restaurant, a computer store, or \nwhether they are working for the Government--we are going to let you \nstart to save some of the assets you are paying in taxes today for your \nSocial Security. We will allow you to start saving and owning those \nassets. We will take 2 percent of your present payroll tax and put it \nin a savings account which you control--you, the wage earner control, \nwhich you own. You own that account. You make the decision in a broad \nterm as to how that is invested.\n\n  We do put limitations on the investment structure so you can't take \nhigh-risk investments or speculate. We take an asset, for all Americans \npaying Social Security tax, which they will physically have and own \nthroughout their earning life, which will grow as they put more into it \nand which, when they retire, will be available to support\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\ntheir retirement and to support the costs of the Social Security \nsystem.\n  This concept, which is called personal savings accounts, is at the \ncore of what we are proposing as a solution to the problem. These \npersonal savings accounts don't solve the problem completely. I wish we \ncould do it completely with these accounts, but we can't.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska so eloquently and effectively pointed \nout--I won't retread that water--the fact is, you have to make \ndecisions on the benefit side or you have to make decisions on the tax \nincrease side. That is the only way you can get long-term solvency, \nunless you have the capacity to refund liability dramatically at a \nlevel you can't do because of the cost of supporting the present \nbeneficiaries under the system.\n  There are three ways to solve the Social Security outyear problem: \nYou can raise taxes, cut benefits, or ``prefund'' the liability. What \nwe do is combine two of those. We prefund the liability and adjust the \nbenefit structure. We adjust it in a constructive and effective way, as \npointed out by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The fundamental philosophical change in our bill is giving people \nownership over part of their Social Security taxes. We say to folks: \nYou can invest that, you can save it, and when you retire, it will be \nyours. In fact, it will be yours before you retire.\n  Under the present law, you pay all these Social Security taxes, and \nif you are unlucky enough to get hit by a train when you are 59 years \nold, you get nothing, absolutely nothing, from all the taxes you have \npaid in. What an unfair system that is.\n  We say to people: You are going to have that asset; it will be yours. \nIf you are, unfortunately, hit by a train when you are 59, your family \nwill own that asset. Whoever you want to pass it on to will own that--\nyour wife, your children, cousins, nephews. We give people the \nopportunity to participate in that extraordinary thing called American \ncapitalism, the marketplace where people can create wealth.\n  Is there a risk? Very little. The way we structured this, we tracked \nwhat Federal employees have been doing for years in the Federal Thrift \nSavings Plan. Any Federal employee can participate in it and have an \noption of placing some of their pension plan into the marketplace by \nchoosing four different funds in which to invest. Those funds are \nmanaged by trustees under the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. One is very \nconservative, one is a moderate investment, and one is a more \naggressive investment.\n  We will use the same type of structure. It will be the Social \nSecurity trustees investing these funds. Wage earners will have the \nright to choose whether they want to aggressively invest, moderately \ninvest, or very conservatively invest. It is your choice. In any event, \nthe rate of return on those assets is going to be dramatically better \nthan the rate of return on the amount of taxes presently paid in the \nSocial Security system. The average rate of return on taxes paid into \nSocial Security is 2.7 percent. As I mentioned, for an earner in their \ntwenties it is essentially zero, and for certain groups it is negative. \nUnder our bill, the lowest rate of return possible is the rate of \nreturn of Treasury bills, which is about 3 percent. One could get \nsignificantly better than that, obviously. The average rate of return \nof the equities market over any 20-year period, including the \nDepression period, has been about 5\\1/2\\ percent. So presume 5\\1/2\\ \npercent is a number by which one reasonably assumes their assets will \nincrease.\n  That is the essence of what we are doing. We are setting up a plan \nwhich, first, is bipartisan; second, it creates solvency in the trust \nfund for 100 years, the next century; third, it gives people ownership \nover parts of the assets which they are now paying in taxes over which \nthey have absolutely no ownership.\n  A couple of other points should be made. We do not impact anybody \npresently in the Social Security system or about to come in the Social \nSecurity system. We say to those folks: The system is in place; you are \ncomfortable with it; that is your system; we are not going to touch you \nin any way.\n  When the scare letters come out from the various groups which use \nSocial Security as a way to try to raise money so people can drive \naround the city in their limousines and go to fancy restaurants, when \nthe scare letters come out in envelopes looking like Social Security \nchecks, and the letters say they will devastate your Social Security \nbenefits, and they are directed at people already on Social Security, \nunfortunately, we don't have the wherewithal to send a counter letter. \nBut if people have time to listen, they will know that is not case. We \ndon't impact anyone presently on the Social Security system.\n  Our bill, more than any other that is presently pending on Social \nSecurity reform, is progressive. In other words, people at the lower \nincome levels get a much better benefit under the proposal we put \nforward than people at the higher levels, and they get a better benefit \nthan they would get in the present Social Security system or under any \nother Social Security proposal out there today, whether they have been \nscored as solvent or not. It is a progressive system.\n  In fact, a low-income person not only gets to save 2 percent, they \ncan save about 3\\1/2\\ percent in the personal savings account because \nwe set up a system for the next dollar after the 2 percent. They get a \n$100 match by the Federal Government. It works out so you basically can \nalmost save 3.5 percent if you are in a low-income bracket, and that is \na big increase in your net worth over 40 years, a huge increase in your \nnet worth over 40 years, which is the average earning experience in \nAmerica today.\n\n  In addition, our plan most importantly treats generations fairly. We \nare headed into a period, when our generation retires, the baby boom \ngeneration retires, when we are simply going to be unfair to younger \ngenerations. What we are going to do to them under the present Social \nSecurity system is absolutely wrong. We are going to tax this younger \ngeneration into a much lower level quality of life in order to support \nour retirement. Is that right? Of course, it is not right, but that is \nexactly what is going to happen if we do not address the Social \nSecurity problem and address it soon so we can start to build the \nassets necessary to prefund the liabilities, as I mentioned earlier.\n  Our bill addresses that issue. Our bill tries to right that shift of \nfairness between our generation and the younger generation, and it does \nit very effectively, and it is an important effort.\n  Importantly, our bill creates an atmosphere where people will have \nconfidence in the Social Security system. There are a lot of people who \nsay: I am not going to get anything when I retire. I am just going to \npay a lot of taxes. I am not going to get anything.\n  And they are right if they happen to be a certain ethnic group or \ncertain age level. Our bill will restore the confidence in the Social \nSecurity system, and that is absolutely critical.\n  In addition, we understand women have especially been \ndisproportionately impacted by the present system. They are not treated \nas fairly as they should be. There are two reasons: No. 1, because many \nwomen weren't in the workforce, and No. 2, because they live longer. \nOur bill makes some very significant efforts in order to address the \nspecial needs of women, especially widows, in the Social Security \nbenefits area. These were put together by the Senator from Iowa, to a \nlarge extent.\n  They are positive efforts to give women the opportunity to get the \nbenefit structure that is fair to them and also encourage women to \nraise children at home. It could be a man, of course, but in most cases \nit would be a woman who wants to leave her job and raise her child for \nup to 5 years. She will be able to do that without being penalized by \nthe Social Security system for having taken those 5 years out of the \nworkforce and then coming back into the workforce. It is a very \nimportant step towards fairness towards women and especially women who \ndecide to raise children.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana wants to speak on this. He has \ncertainly been a core player, a key player on this issue, as well as so \nmany others. But on Medicare specifically, let me say this. We, as \npolicy people, have an absolute obligation to pursue and accomplish \nSocial Security reform in this Congress. There is no way we can justify \npassing up this opportunity. We have a President who does not have to\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nrun for reelection, so he is under no political pressure to make a \npolitical decision. He has the flexibility and freedom to make the \ndecisions that should be made in order to resolve this type of problem.\n  We know if we do not act, we will begin to run out of time quickly. \nWe know if we cannot set up these personal accounts to start creating \nassets and letting those assets grow through compounded interest--which \nEinstein said was the greatest force known to mankind--we know if we do \nnot get those assets started and get those accounts begun, we are going \nto end up running out of time, and we will not be able to solve the \nproblem effectively. So we know we have to act. It is similar to that \nold oil filter ad, ``You can pay me now or pay me later.'' We know we \nhave to act now, so we should be taking action.\n  We know it can be done because this bill proves it. It can be done in \na bipartisan way and it can be done in a way that can be scored and \napproved by the Social Security trustees as working, so there is no \nargument about doing it and being able to do it. All we need now is the \npolitical will to do it, and that is going to take Presidential \nleadership.\n  Although the President has spoken on this issue a number of times, he \nhas not given us the type of leadership we need to accomplish the goal. \nBut if he wants to step forward, this is a great opportunity to do it. \nThis bill gives him the vehicle to do it. I certainly hope he will take \nadvantage of that chance.\n  In any event, I thank my fellow Senators who have worked so hard on \nthis. I believe we have laid out a method that can control and move \nthis forward in a positive way. I hope we can move from only the \nacademic discussion of a bill to the passage of a law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for purposes of a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent immediately after completion of \nthe time controlled by the Senator from Louisiana, that I be given 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me first congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his remarks and his major \ncontribution in this effort to bring to the floor of the Senate a \nproposal on reforming Social Security that, first of all, is real; it \nis serious, it is bipartisan. A lot of the credit goes to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for his diligent work in this area.\n  Previous to the work of the Senator from New Hampshire, we had the \nwords of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who also joins with all of us \nas lead sponsors on this Social Security reform legislation. Senator \nKerrey has been involved in this issue of entitlement reform for a long \ntime. He chaired the Entitlement Reform Commission and his work in the \nSocial Security area has truly been outstanding.\n  It is interesting that what is happening today on the floor is this \nis the first time, certainly in my memory and probably in a long time, \nwe have actually had a bipartisan proposal on reforming Social Security \nintroduced in the Senate. Not only is it unique that it is the first \ntime in this body, it is also even more surprising that this proposal, \nin addition to being bipartisan, is also bicameral. By that, of course, \nI mean the same proposal has also been introduced on the other side of \nthe Capitol, over in the House, by our colleagues over there, also in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  This is truly historic in the sense that Members of both parties and \nboth Houses can join together in addressing an issue as important, yet \nat the same time as politically divisive, as Social Security has been. \nYet we have been able to do that and have been joined by a number of \nour colleagues, particularly on the Senate Finance Committee. We have \ncome together to make a recommendation on Social Security which I think \nis one that bears favorable consideration of our colleagues.\n  We just had a very strenuous and sometimes somewhat heated debate on \nthe question of the Social Security lockbox, which we just voted on. We \nwill have future debate on that. I think it is very important for all \nAmericans to know that while we debated on this concept of a lockbox, \nit does not do a single thing to restore the Social Security program. \nIt does not change the program in any way. It does not make any \nstructural changes to Social Security. It does not increase any \nAmerican's retirement options. It does not give them any additional \nchoices about how they want to plan for their retirement future. It \ndoes not increase widows' benefits. It does not address the problems \nthe Senator just spoke of regarding the female population in the \ncountry and the special concerns they have. It does not allow low- and \nmiddle-income workers to access any Government contributions to help \nthem in their retirement planning and to build up a larger nest egg. \nThe lockbox does not do anything regarding the current unfunded \nliabilities in the Social Security program. It certainly doesn't \nrestore the confidence in the Social Security system.\n  We have heard the statements that more young people believe in flying \nsaucers than believe Social Security is going to be there for them. So \nwhile we had a great, interesting debate on this lockbox concept, it is \nvery important to know it does not do a single thing to take care of \nthe problems that are facing this country in regard to the Social \nSecurity system. But this bill does. This bill has been scored by the \npeople who have to do this for us professionally as restoring solvency \nto the Social Security program to the year 2075, and that is a fact. \nThere is no debate about that. How we do it, I think, is the substance \nof our bill. I think it is very positive.\n  Let me point out, why do we have a problem in Social Security? We \nhave been rocking along since 1935 in a pretty fortunate situation. \nMost people got their Social Security benefits, everything they \ncontributed, back very quickly.\n  If someone retired in 1980, for instance, they got back everything \nthey put into the Social Security system in a little over 2 years. They \ngot back everything they put into the program. Retirees in 1980, at the \nage of 65, took 2.8 years to recover everything they put into the \nprogram. That is a heck of a deal for anyone. I know my father has said \nmany times: I will never get back what I put into Social Security. He \ngot it back in about 2.8 years. It was a very good deal for most \nAmericans, and that is changing.\n  The question is, Why? Very simple: People live a lot longer and there \nare a lot more of them. Life expectancy--thank goodness and thank \nmedical science and thank God--has dramatically increased over the \nyears so people live a lot longer than they used to.\n  The second point is there are a lot more people. There are 77 million \npeople in the so-called baby boom generation, those Americans born \nbetween 1946 and 1964. We have about 40 million people on Social \nSecurity today. We are getting ready to add 77 million more people into \nthis program. It does not take rocket science to figure out why we are \nhaving problems.\n  We have a lot more people who are living a lot longer and earning \nretirement benefits through Social Security. We have fewer and fewer \npeople left who are working to pay for those benefits. When Social \nSecurity was passed under Franklin Roosevelt, there were about 16 \npeople working for every 1 person who was retiring. Because people live \na lot longer now and there are a lot more of them, it is now down to \nabout 3 people working for every 1 person who is earning retirement \nbenefits and getting retirement benefits. We cannot continue on this \ntrend. The so-called lockbox does not do a single thing to help reform \nthe program or allow it to generate more funds to make sure the program \nis going to be there for the 77 million baby boomers.\n  For those who are on Social Security retirement now, the good news \nfor them is it is there; they do not have to worry about it. We have \nnever missed a payment. They will be guaranteed their payments.\n  Unless we do something, we are in danger of letting the program go \nbroke. We have presented to the Senate today, and it had been presented \nto the other\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\nbody earlier, our recommendation in the form of a specific bill that \nhas been scored by the people who do this work as restoring the \nsolvency to this program to the year 2075.\n  How do we do it? It is not that complicated. One of the things we \nhave done is to say that every American who pays Social Security will \nbe required to divert 2-percentage points of their payroll tax--which \nis 12.4 percent payroll tax of which they pay 6.2 percent--to an \nindividual retirement account, which is strongly supported by most \nAmericans.\n  Almost two-thirds of Americans in the polls I have seen have said yes \nto the question: Would you like to be able to save a portion of your \npayroll tax in an individual retirement account that you would be able \nto control? There is strong support for that. I do not think they want \nto privatize the whole program, but they would like to have some of the \nmoney to invest for themselves, as we do as Federal employees.\n  I do not know if a lot of Americans realize it, those who are not \nFederal employees, but I can do that as a Member of the Senate. We \nestablish our own Federal employees Thrift Savings Plan, and we can put \nup to 10 percent in that savings plan. We can earn interest on the \nmarket, and we get a lot better return than we get as a Government with \nSocial Security funds. The Federal Government invests the Social \nSecurity surplus in Government bonds. It has been earning about 3 \npercent. That is not a good return in today's market. We need to allow \nindividuals to do a better job with their own tax dollars.\n\n  Our plan creates a savings plan for people on Social Security where \nthey can put 2 percent of their payroll tax into an individual \nretirement account which they will own, and when they pass away, it can \nbe inherited. It will be theirs and they can invest it and hopefully \nget 10 percent or 15 percent or more return on their money, and they \nwill be able to get the advantage of that higher investment when they \nretire and add it to the rest of their Social Security program.\n  It will put more money into the program. It will strengthen the \nprogram. It will allow people to become more involved in their own \nretirement. A lot of young people do not think it is going to be there. \nThey think the Government does not do it very well.\n  This changes all of that and, I think, in a very important way. \nIndividuals will own those proceeds, and I believe that is extremely \nimportant.\n  That is one of the features of our program I wanted to highlight.\n  In addition, we also say you can do more than that. People in lower- \nand middle-income brackets will be able to put an additional amount of \nmoney for an additional $1 over this 2 percent that they would put into \ntheir account. The Federal Government would match it with $100.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The Government will match it with $100. They can make additional \nvoluntary contributions, up to 1 percent of the total wage base of \n$72,600, which means they will be able to get a maximum contribution of \nabout $626 from the Federal Government.\n  This is a good plan. It is a solid plan. It restores Social Security \nviability to the year 2075, and it is something of which we need to \ntake advantage and do it in this Congress. We cannot continue to wait.\n  The big problem is this has always been a political football. This \neffort, this bill, is bipartisan and it is bicameral. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at the substance of our legislation. I think they, \ntoo, will find, when they review it carefully, that this is the right \napproach, it makes sense, it is balanced and one that can be considered \nfavorably by this Congress this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the \nfloor today to introduce the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of \n1999. As one who has been involved in various reform efforts over the \npast three Congresses, I can honestly say that the legislation we are \nintroducing today is, in my view, the best product we have submitted to \ndate.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the dedication of the \nmembers who are here on the floor today. They have all demonstrated a \ntireless commitment to get this body to take seriously solving the \ntough issue of financing this program through the Baby Boom generation \nand beyond. This is not an easy task. Under current law, the program \nfaces a shortfall that would require either an 18 percent payroll tax \nrate or a 30 percent cut in benefits. Either option would be \ndevastating to the future workers financing the program or the future \nSocial Security beneficiary.\n  This group has united around a common purpose. Instead of trying to \ndress up so-called lock-boxes as Social Security reform, and instead of \nundertaking massive Federal borrowing to finance individual accounts on \ntop of the current system, and instead of committing future taxpayers \nto fix the problem, we have actually sought to solve the long-term \nfinancing dilemma in this important program. And I'm proud to say that \nwe have done this without adopting any payroll tax increase.\n  By allowing all workers to take 2 percentage points of their payroll \ntax into individual retirement savings accounts that workers own, we \nensure that not only is today's Social Security surplus being set aside \nfor today's workers who will become tomorrow's retirees, but we also \nadvance fund some of our future liabilities. In addition, we also use \nsome of the surplus to boost contributions for lower income workers, \nensuring that these individuals have a comparable opportunity to build \nwealth in their personal savings accounts. The accumulation in these \naccounts will supplement future Social Security benefits under the \ntraditional program.\n  While we make some revisions to future benefits to bring down the \nfinancing cost of the program, we do so in a way that doesn't affect \nanyone currently over the age of 62, that increases the traditional \nSocial Security benefit for low income earners, that protects women who \nhave taken time out to raise children, and that increases the benefit \nfor widows and widowers.\n  Mr. President, this is a credible plan that solves the financing \nchallenge presented by Social Security in a truly progressive manner. I \nhope other colleagues who are serious about tackling the issue will not \nonly take a close look at this proposal, but will also help us make \nreal reform a top priority.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin introducing a bipartisan bill to protect, preserve and improve the \nSocial Security system for the challenges of the 21st Century.\n  We all know that Social Security faces massive demographic changes. \nFor example, our population is aging rapidly. As a result, the ratio \nbetween the number of workers paying taxes into the system as compared \nto the number of retirees taking funds out of the system is falling \nswiftly. Soon, we will have fewer than two workers for each retiree. \nOther demographic trends are that Americans are living longer and \nretiring earlier.\n  The combined effect of these changes is that future generations will \nface tremendous tax burdens or massive benefit cuts in order to \npreserve Social Security. The longer Congress waits before reforming \nthe law, the more painful and difficult these changes will be.\n  That's why I am pleased this bipartisan group has come together with \ncredible reform legislation that will preserve Social Security in \nperpetuity. It achieves this important goal in large part through \nadvance funding of the program. The bill allows workers to divert a \nportion of their existing Social Security taxes into a personal \nretirement account that they would own. This feature would enable all \nAmericans to accumulate a cash nest egg for their retirement and would \nimprove the rate of return on their Social Security taxes.\n  Currently, Congress is considering legislation to create a \n``Lockbox'' that would reserve Social Security surplus revenues for \nSocial Security alone, not other government spending as is currently \nthe case. I support this legislation and believe it is an important \nfirst step toward saving Social Security. But to me, the true \n``Lockbox'' is private retirement accounts. These accounts ensure that \nindividual Americans, not the Federal Government, are in charge of \ntheir retirement nest egg. If the worker dies before retirement,\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nthe accounts could be left to his or her heirs. In addition, these \nprivate accounts ensure that the Federal Government can't come back at \na later time and reduce benefits. Another key feature of these accounts \nis that low income workers, most for the first time, will have an \nopportunity to own assets and create wealth.\n  Another way the bill makes Social Security more progressive is by \nincreasing the guaranteed benefits for those with low incomes. Other \nimportant provisions in the legislation will improve the Social \nSecurity benefits of widows, repeal the earnings test, and correct \nperverse work incentives inherent in the current system.\n  Finally, our proposal doesn't affect current retirees. They would \ncontinue under the current system. But by reducing the tremendous \nunfunded liability the system faces and restoring solvency to Social \nSecurity, current retirees are protected from the potential tax \nincreases and benefit cuts that would be necessary to preserve the \nsystem. Seniors' benefits are far more secure under this plan than they \nare under current law.\n  Again, I am pleased to join Senators Gregg, Kerrey, Breaux, Grassley, \nThompson and Robb in introducing this important legislation. And I \nencourage the rest of our colleagues to examine this bill carefully \nbecause I think it has the elements necessary to achieve a bipartisan \nagreement to save Social Security. The sooner we act, the better. Time \nis not on our side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of 1999.\n  We have crafted a responsible plan to save Social Security for \ngenerations to come. By making incremental, steady changes to the \nSocial Security system, we will be able to ensure the long-term \nsolvency of the program without taking Draconian measures.\n  Not only have we designed a responsible plan, but a bipartisan plan \nas well. No change to the Social Security system can be made without \nsupport from both sides of the aisle. Our bill represents a true \nbipartisan effort to save Social Security. The Bipartisan Social \nSecurity Reform Act is co-sponsored by four Republicans and three \nDemocrats. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm. This bipartisan, \nbicameral support is an excellent foundation on which to build, \nensuring that the basis of the American retirement system remains \nfinancially sound for future generations.\n  The bipartisan plan would maintain a basic floor of protection \nthrough a traditional Social Security benefit, but two percentage \npoints of the 12.4 percent payroll tax would be redirected to \nindividual accounts. Individuals could invest their personal accounts \nin any combination of the funds offered through the Social Security \nsystem. An individual who invested his or her personal account in a \nbond fund would receive a guaranteed interest rate. However, \nindividuals who wish to pursue a higher rate of return through \ninvestment in a fund including equities could do so.\n  Our proposal would eliminate the need for future payroll tax \nincreases by advance funding a portion of future benefits through \npersonal accounts. With individual accounts, we provide Americans with \nthe tools necessary to build financial independence in retirement--\nespecially to those who previously had limited opportunities to create \nwealth. Under our plan, they will be able to save for retirement and \nbenefit from economic growth.\n  In putting together this legislation, this group has been conscious \nof how changes to Social Security would affect different populations. \nOne group that I have been particularly concerned about is women. Let \nme explain how our bill addresses women's needs:\n  Women are more likely to move in and out of the workforce to care for \nchildren or elderly parents. They should not be punished for the time \nthat they dedicate to dependents. Our proposal provides five ``drop-\nout'' years to the spouse with lower earnings in every two-earner \ncouple.\n  Women, on average, earn less than men. The Bipartisan Social Security \nReform Act would ensure that workers with wages below the national \naverage would receive an additional $100 contribution annually to their \npersonal accounts when they make a contribution of at least $1. Any \nsubsequent contributions would receive a dollar-for-dollar match so \nthat all workers would be guaranteed a minimum contribution of one \npercent of the taxable wage base. For this year, that contribution \nwould be $726. Furthermore, all wage-earners would be permitted to save \nup to an additional $2,000 annually through voluntary contributions to \npersonal accounts.\n  In addition, our proposal creates an additional bend point to the \nbenefit formula to boost the replacement rate for low-income workers, \nmany of whom are women.\n  Women live longer than men. At age 65, men are expected to live 15 \nmore years, whereas women are expected to live almost 20 more. Our \nproposal addresses that reality by allowing money accumulated in \nindividual accounts to be passed on to surviving spouses and children. \nFurthermore, our proposal would increase the widow's benefit to 75 \npercent of the combined benefits that a husband and wife would be \nentitled to based on their own earnings.\n  Congressional Republicans and Democrats and the administration all \nhave established saving Social Security as a top priority. Now we must \nmove ahead with the process and provide leadership. Each year that we \nwait to enact legislation to save Social Security, the changes must be \nmore pronounced to make up for the lost time. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is under a previous \norder to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is there any order subsequent to \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to voice my strong \nobjection to hidden provisions which were inserted in the so-called \nlast amendment during the consideration of the HMO Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Last night, at approximately 8 o'clock, an amendment was offered \nwhich had over 250 pages. It had been represented throughout the debate \nthat this amendment would be of a corrective, technical nature. There \nwere several statements made on the floor that alterations, which had \nbeen agreed to verbally, would be incorporated in that final amendment. \nWhat we find is that quite a different thing has occurred.\n  First, I have found that several of the areas in which I had clear \nrepresentations that refinements would be made were not made. In the \narea, for instance, of the emergency room, one of the key issues we \nspent considerable time debating had to do with poststabilization \ncoverage. It was my understanding we had arrived at an agreement as to \nhow to correct the language which all parties had appeared to agree \nwould be an undue restriction on the rights of patients to receive \nproper care in an emergency room. I am sad to have to report that those \nchanges were not incorporated in the final version of the legislation.\n  I am even more offended by the fact that while the changes we thought \nwould be there were, at least in this instance, not obtained, but more \nso there were extraneous issues inserted, issues that had never been \nconsidered on the floor, never considered by a committee, never debated \nand unknown until they were unearthed, in the case of the issue I was \nto raise on page 252 and 253 of the so-called manager's amendment.\n  What is the provision I am so concerned about? It is section 901, \n``Medicare Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project.'' If you want to \nget the full flavor of this, let me just quote:\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Senate finds that implementing \n     competitive pricing in the medicare program . . . of the \n     Social Security Act is an important goal.\n\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\n\n  I could not agree more with that statement. So that would cause your \nheart to beat, your level of anticipation to be excited as you want to \ngo on to what is the next paragraph that will implement that goal.\n  What is the next paragraph? It says: Notwithstanding what has been \nsaid above, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may not \nimplement the Medicare demonstration project on competitive bidding; \nand, furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services may not implement any other competitive \npricing project before January 1, 2001.\n  An absolute outrage.\n  Let me give you a little history of this.\n  When the Medicare program began to move beyond fee for service and to \naccept modern ways of health care, it did so in a rather cumbersome \nway. It said that we will reimburse a health maintenance organization \non a formula; and the formula is 95 percent of the fee for service \npayments to Medicare beneficiaries within that community.\n  That may have some superficial rationale, but let me tell you what \nreally happens.\n  First, if you happen to be in a community that has, for instance, a \nlarge teaching hospital or other complex medical center that serves a \nlarger region, you are going to have high fee-for-service payments \nbecause of the nature of the health care that is delivered in that \ncommunity. I would imagine that Rochester, MN, is a community that has \nrelatively high fee for service because it has that great Mayo Clinic. \nI can tell you that Miami, FL, has high fee-for-service charges because \nit has a number of tertiary care hospitals. So because of that \naberration that has nothing to do with what an HMO should be \nreimbursed, HMOs in those communities get 95 percent of fee for \nservice.\n  There were some modifications made of that in the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act, but the basic principle of a formula-based reimbursement \nwhich relates back to fee for service is still largely in place.\n  There is a second sequence of that in that we have very erratic fee \nlevels for HMOs. The community that is immediately adjacent to the high \nfee-for-service community can have very low fee-for-service medicine \ndelivered there, and therefore the HMOs get a much lower fee.\n  In my State, the differential from the highest to the lowest \ncommunity is probably on the order of at least 100 percent from the \nhighest to the lowest community that has an HMO program.\n  What is the consequence of that? The consequence of that is reported \nin today's Washington Post on page A-2. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthat article printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It states: ``HMOs Will Drop 327,000 Medicare \nBeneficiaries Next Year.''\n  We have just spent 4 days of debate on trying to avoid having people \ndropped from their HMOs, and we now have an announcement that just in \nthe Medicare program alone--the Medicare program has 39 million \nparticipants, and approximately 4 million of those are in HMOs--out of \nthat relatively small number of HMO beneficiaries, 327,000 are being \ndropped.\n  What does it say? It says that of those who are being dropped, 79,000 \nwill be unable to enroll in another HMO because there are no other HMOs \nin their area.\n  When the industry was asked, why is this happening, their answer was: \nThe managed care industry says HMOs are pulling out of Medicare because \nthe Government isn't paying them enough.\n  You would think the industry would therefore want to have an \nalternative system that would provide adequate reimbursement, but not \nexcessive reimbursement, and that the place to achieve that is the \nmarketplace.\n  We heard a lot of talk this week about how we ought to have deference \nto the marketplace. I think what the HMOs want is to have free \nenterprise when it relates to service to the patients, and they want to \nhave socialism when it relates to how much revenue they get paid.\n  So in 1997, in the face of all of these factors, the Congress, by a \nvery strong vote--I think it was 76 votes in the Senate--passed the \nBalanced Budget Act which contained a provision that would actually \nstart HMOs toward a competitive bidding process--the same process, \nincidentally, used by many other large HMO users, State and local \ngovernments, and in the private sector.\n  It was started very modestly, with a demonstration plan so that we \ncould learn about what was involved in competitive bidding for HMOs. I, \nfrankly, thought that was excessive caution, that we could have taken \nadvantage of the experience that was already available by many other \nlarge users, but the thought was, let's go slow, let's do a \ndemonstration project.\n  So since 1997, HCFA, the Federal agency with responsibility for \nmanaging Medicare, has been organizing this demonstration project. They \nselected Kansas City and Phoenix as the two sites for the demonstration \nproject. They are about to start, and all of a sudden, on the 252nd \npage of what is supposed to be a corrective manager's amendment, we not \nonly bar the demonstration projects that are about to commence but bar \nany other demonstration projects that may be suggested. Yet we started \nwith a finding that we support competitive bidding.\n  Boy, I tell you, if this is the way they support the principle, you \ndo not want them to be your parents and say they are going to give you \ngood care.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a short question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to inquire. I was unaware that that provision was \nin the package that was presented. Was the Senator from Florida aware, \ndid he know of anyone else who was aware of that except perhaps the \nfolks who wrote it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We have not found anybody who was aware of it except some \ndiligent soul who actually got to page 252 of the bill sometime late \nlast night or this morning and discovered this. I might say, it is very \ndifficult to even get copies of this amendment.\n  We have known for several years that the HMO industry did not want \ncompetitive bidding. They like the socialized formula system that \nexists today. They are attempting in any way they can, including this \nstealth attack late last night on page 252, to kill competitive \nbidding.\n  Unfortunately, just as with the issue of the HMO bill we have been \ndebating, on the issue of patients versus the bottom line of the HMOs, \nthe HMOs won in the Patients' Bill of Rights, and they have won again \nby killing competitive bidding. I say they have won. I think it is a \nPyrrhic victory.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota might recall an event that, as \nYogi Berra said, it is deja vu all over again. I think it was just \nabout 3 years ago, in a similar stealth maneuver, that we discovered \nthere was embedded in a large bill a provision that would have given \nthe tobacco industry a $50 billion tax break. Once that issue surfaced, \nit could not stand the light of day. It slowly withered, died, and has \nnot been resurrected.\n\n  I suggest the light of day will be shed on what the HMO industry has \ndone by inserting this amendment on page 252 of a technical amendment, \nthe fact they are using this as a means of avoiding the rigors of the \nmarketplace, they are using this to avoid a rationalization of the \ncompensation that HMOs receive from their patients so that we don't \ncontinue this pattern of 32,700 people being dropped. I can tell my \ncolleagues, most of these people are people who come from rural areas. \nThey come from small towns where they don't have high fee-for-service \nmedicine. The HMOs want to skim off those areas that have high fee-for-\nservice, where they can get a formula that results in a very rushed \nreimbursement level. They don't want to provide services, and they \ndon't even want to have a competitive bidding process that can arrive \nat what the marketplace says they should be paying for those HMO\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nbeneficiaries in smaller communities of America.\n  What we are seeing, again, is the bottom line winning out over the \nrights, the interests, and the health of patients. We are watching as \nMedicare patients are dumped on the street. Is that the HMO industry's \nidea of reform? It is my idea of a travesty, and it is one that we need \nto bring to the attention of America. And we, as the Senate, need to \nexpunge this dark page, page 252, and its companion, page 253, from our \nrecords. I hope we will, at the first opportunity, do so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 16, 1999]\n\n        HMOs Will Drop 327,000 Medicare Beneficiaries Next Year\n\n                        (By David S. Hilzenrath)\n\n       About 327,000 of the 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries \n     nationwide who belong to HMOs will be abandoned by their \n     health plans next year, the government said yesterday.\n       Of those, 79,000 will be unable to enroll in another health \n     maintenance organization as 41 health plans withdraw from the \n     federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled \n     and another 58 stop serving Medicare beneficiaries in \n     particular areas, according to the agency that runs Medicare.\n       Medicare beneficiaries who lose their HMO coverage have two \n     or three alternatives: They can choose another HMO, if one is \n     available; they can revert to standard fee-for-service \n     Medicare coverage; and they can buy ``Medigap'' policies to \n     supplement the standard benefits.\n       But there is no guarantee that they can find a Medigap \n     policy with prescription drug coverage, which is one of the \n     main reasons some Medicare beneficiaries choose HMOs.\n       In Maryland and Virginia, 33,000 beneficiaries--26.9 \n     percent of those with HMO coveage--will lose their current \n     coverage, and 27,000 will be unable to replace it with \n     another HMO.\n       An HMO industry group recently predicted that more than \n     250,000 beneficiaries would be affected by the changes, but \n     the Department of Health and Human Services released the \n     final tally based on notices HMOs were required to submit by \n     July 1.\n       This year, a larger number of beneficiaries--407,000--were \n     abandoned by their HMOs, but a smaller number--51,000--were \n     left without an HMO option.\n       The managed-care industry says HMOs are pulling out of \n     Medicare because the government isn't paying them enough, but \n     the government says the HMOs' actions reflect broader \n     industry trends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8736-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MANAGED HEALTH CARE REFORM--HMO LIABILITY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, over the past few days, my Democratic \ncolleagues and I presented a number of arguments which clearly laid out \nthe need for managed health care reform.\n  The ability to hold insurance companies accountable for their \ndecisions is a critical element in ensuring the overall quality of \npatient protections.\n  While we will continue to present our case in a variety of ways, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to relate a story that was shared \nwith me just a few weeks ago about a young girl from Albuquerque, New \nMexico.\n  Anna, 6 years old at the time, was a very active and energetic young \ngirl and excited about entering first grade that year. One evening, \nAnna went with her parents and her brothers and sisters to a softball \ngame. She and other children went off to play in an area near the \nsoftball field. Suddenly, some of the children came running towards the \nadults, screaming for help. Anna had caught her foot in a gate. Her \nfoot was bleeding profusely and she was in agonizing pain. She was \nimmediately rushed to the local emergency room.\n  After Anna was examined by her doctor and after a conversation with \nher family's HMO, it was determined that Anna would not be admitted to \nthe hospital that night.\n  Anna's family reluctantly took her home that night where she was in \npain throughout the evening. Her family was forced to watch their \nsmall, frail daughter lay in bed in agony.\n  The next morning, her mother was worried because Anna's foot was \npurple, swollen, and cold. Anna was in tremendous pain and had a fever. \nHer parents did not hesitate any longer and Anna was rushed back to the \nemergency room.\n  This time she was admitted immediately and treated on an emergency \nbasis, but it was too late and her family's worst fears were realized. \nAnna had a raging infection that had already destroyed half of her foot \nwhich had to be amputated.\n  Anna had two surgeries and spent 6 weeks in the hospital. She will \nlive with this deformity forever.\n  Unbelievably, her family's HMO has delayed paying for the 6 weeks she \nwas in the hospital to have her foot amputated and grated at a cost of \n$23,000.00.\n  Anna's family paid for the protection of health insurance. What they \nreceived in return was a possible delay of critical medical service \nwhich has left Anna disfigured and has ruined her family's credit.\n  To the amazement of anyone who hears this story, under current law, \nAnna's HMO will not be held accountable for their decisions.\n\n  Under the Democratic plan, Anna and her family would have legal \nrecourse like any other American has in this country when they are \nwronged by a business.\n  The Democratic plan simply states that if a patient is injured or \nkilled as a result of an insurance company's decision, the insurance \ncompany can be held liable under state law.\n  Let me be clear. This will not open the flood gates to more \nlitigation and raise the cost of health insurance.\n  It doe not override states' rights. It simply says that whatever \nrights a given state chooses to grant shall not be blocked by federal \nlegislation.\n  Without adoption of the Democratic plan, stories like Anna's will \ncontinue to be told. I understand Anna is quite a young girl and she \nwill go on. But she and her family will struggle with this nightmare.\n  The Democratic plan is not about lawyers--it is about people like \nAnna and protecting their rights.\n  Anna, her family and millions like them in this country are waiting \nfor us to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8736-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8736-S8737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE ILLEGAL PURCHASE OF FIREARMS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we've all heard the saying, ``if at first \nyou don't succeed, try, try, again.'' It's a lesson we've been taught \nsince childhood. It's a lesson used to teach children to be persistent \nand work hard if they want to achieve their goals. It is also a lesson \nthat applies to the purchase of firearms, and it is one that Benjamin \nSmith knew all too well.\n  Over the Fourth of July weekend, the majority of Americans were \ncelebrating the birth of our nation. But the long holiday weekend \nproduced yet another tragedy, made possible by the free flow of deadly \nfirearms. A single man, Benjamin Smith, with a hatred for life, \nallegedly used a .22 caliber handgun and a .380 caliber semi-automatic \nhandgun to murder two people and wound nine before ending his own life.\n  The alleged gunman had a history of violence, a protection order \nfiled against him, and belonged to an organization that espouses hatred \ntoward minorities, yet, he was still able to purchase deadly firearms, \nall because he was persistent. Approximately one week before his \nkilling spree, he had applied to purchase firearms from a licensed \nfirearms dealer in Illinois. He obtained an owner identification card, \nfilled out an application, and expected to retrieve his weapons shortly \nthereafter. A few days later, however, he returned to buy the weapons \nand was rejected by the licensed dealer after failing to pass the \nIllinois state background check. Unfortunately, Benjamin Smith knew his \nlesson, ``if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.''\n  Benjamin Smith knew of other means to obtain firearms. He knew that \nalthough he was not permitted to purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, \nhe would have few problems buying a gun on the street, from an \nunlicensed dealer. He knew that federal law requires that background \nchecks be conducted by licensed dealers, but he also knew of a large \nsecondary market in the United States that permits the free flow of \nweapons in to the hands of those who can not pass background checks. \nAnd, because he knew how easy it is to obtain a gun in the United \nStates, Benjamin Smith was able to try, again, to purchase firearms for \nhis killing spree.\n  Smith's second attempt to purchase guns was successful and as a \nresult, this dangerous young man was equipped with the two handguns \nbelieved to be used in the several Independence Day shootings. Because \nof this secondary market that allows easy accessibility of firearms, \nthe nation is\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nagain mourning the loss of innocent lives lost to gunfire. And although \nthe American public expresses continual outrage that federal firearms \nlaws are not strong enough to prevent persons like Benjamin Smith from \npurchasing guns, Congress has not yet responded. We need to try, try \nagain to pass meaningful legislation that will put an end to this \nsenseless slaughter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8737-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \n``Veterans' Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act.''\n  By establishing the National Veterans Business Development \nCorporation, this bill will provide significant assistance to \nentrepreneurial veterans. Additionally, this legislation works to aid \nveterans through networking, supervision, microloans and loans, \ndisaster assistance, and data collection programs. This bill provides \nassistance to many veterans who have the skills, talent and motivation \nto successfully own and operate small businesses but may not have the \nright connections or the ability to hire consultants. This bill is a \nmeans by which the federal government can help veterans help \nthemselves.\n  Veterans have fought and sacrificed to protect the United States and \nthe freedoms Americans cherish. Veterans' programs such as this provide \nus, in a small way, the capability to repay those veterans for their \nextraordinary contributions to our nation. These veterans have already \ngiven so much to our country and many of them want to contribute even \nmore by starting small businesses. I believe we owe it to them to do \neverything we can to help them in these endeavors.\n  Accordingly, I am proud to join The American Legion, the Disabled \nVeterans Association, the Reserve Officers Association, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and the many other military and veteran service \norganizations in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8737-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ADOPTION AWARENESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the Adoption \nAwareness Act of 1999. The objective of this legislation is to provide \nproactive support for adoption as an option for women with unplanned \npregnancies, and for couples who are unable to conceive a child due to \nproblems with infertility. The bill would require certain federally-\nfunded health centers to provide adoption counseling by trained \nadoption counselors.\n  The Adoption Awareness Act makes grants available to national \nadoption organizations to provide staff training in adoption counseling \nto eligible health centers. These health centers include Title X funded \nclinics, community health centers, migrant health centers, centers for \nthe homeless, school-based clinics, and crisis pregnancy centers. The \nobjective is to ensure that woman and their families are provided \nprofessional, compassionate, and understanding counseling about \nadoption.\n  This legislation also provides that faith-based charities may receive \ngrants to provide adoption counseling training services on the same \nbasis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the \nreligious character of such institutions and without diminishing the \nreligious freedom of those receiving services.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes the appropriation of $7,000,000 \nfor fiscal year 2000 for purposes of providing adoption counseling \ntraining.\n  There are no unwanted babies in this country. Across America there \nare countless couples who cannot conceive a baby, and struggle, often \nhopelessly, to adopt a child. All the while, tragically, 1.5 million \nchildren are aborted every year. There are parents who desperately want \nthe opportunity to provide these children with a loving home, and the \ngift of life itself.\n  The purpose of this legislation is not to incite a debate about \nabortion. The purpose of this legislation is to stress the value, \nindeed the sanctity of life, and the importance of adoption as an \nalternative to abortion. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure \nthat a woman struggling with the tragic choice of abortion is provided \nprofessional and compassionate counseling on adoption. A mother \ndeserves to know that there are millions of couples out there who are \nwilling, indeed desperate, to provide her child with a loving home. A \nmother deserves to know that ending her child's life is not the only \nchoice she has.\n  I speak from personal experience. I am an adoptive father. I am a \nstaunch supporter of the choice of adoption. Every mother pondering the \nagony which is abortion deserves the hope this legislation offers. \nEvery unborn child deserves the opportunity for life that this \nlegislation offers.\n  I believe in the sanctity of human life. I have always fought for the \nrights of the unborn child, and the preservation of the intrinsic value \nof all human life. At approximately 1.5 million abortions every year, \nthat is some 35 million children killed since the Roe v. Wade decision. \nMr. President, regardless of your beliefs, pro-abortion, or pro-life, \nthat is a staggering and tragic statistic. This legislation offers a \nchance at reducing that number. It is not the answer, but it does \nprovide hope to couples struggling desperately to adopt children. As \nimportant, it provides hope to that mother or couple who is standing on \nthe tragic precipice of abortion, ensuring that they know there is \nanother choice.\n  Every child embodies the hope for our future. It is our children, in \ntheir purity and their innocence, that hope is born again in an \nincreasingly cynical world. Abortion is the great tragedy of our time. \nAmerica is not a country of kings. America is not defined by any single \ngeographic characteristic, by any single race or creed. America is an \nidea, a collection of high ideals, eloquently articulated, inscribed in \nour Constitution, and embodied on our institutions.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in pondering the profound wisdom and our founding \nfathers, wrote of them: ``This was their majestic interpretation of the \neconomy of the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble \nunderstanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures . . . In \ntheir enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the divine image and \nlikeness was sent into the world to be trodden on . . . They grasped \nnot only the whole race of man then living, but they reached forward \nand seized upon the farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide \ntheir children, and their children, and the countless myriads who would \ninhabit the Earth in other ages.''\n  Mr. President, confronting the tragic figures on abortion I have \npreviously cited, I cannot help but question whether we can continue on \nthis course and maintain hope that the intrinsic value of every human \nlife, that principle out of which all the rights of man flow, can \nsurvive. The Adoption Awareness Act represents one step in the effort \ntoward restoring the sanctity of life as the foundation of our system \nof human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8737-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8737-S8738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today is an anniversary that almost no one \nwill\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nrecognize. It was 54 years ago today that the first nuclear explosion \noccurred at the Trinity Test Site in New Mexico. Mr. President, 54 \nyears ago today we saw the first nuclear explosion on the face of the \nEarth. At that time, of course, we developed nuclear weapons because we \nwere locked in a life and death struggle with the Axis powers. We \ndeveloped nuclear weapons to end the most destructive war the world had \never seen, the Second World War. We then got involved in a cold war \nwith the Soviets and we saw the buildup of thousands and thousands of \ntactical and strategic nuclear weapons, warheads, and delivery \nvehicles.\n  I want to tell you what President Dwight D. Eisenhower said towards \nthe end of his term about the spread of nuclear weapons. He said not \nachieving a test ban--that is, a ban on the testing of nuclear \nweapons--``would have to be classified as the greatest disappointment \nof any administration of any decade of any time and of any party.'' \nThat belief, expressed by President Eisenhower, was echoed by President \nJohn F. Kennedy, who stated that a comprehensive nuclear test ban would \n``increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war.'' He \nsaid, ``Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our \nsteady pursuit.''\n  That was the late 1950s and the early 1960s. We still do not have a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in force, but we are close. \nAlmost 3 years ago, this country, the United States, along with over \n100 nations, signed a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The \nPresident sent that treaty to the Senate 662 days ago. What has \nhappened? What has been done with that treaty? Nothing. Not a hearing. \nNot a minute, not an hour, not a day of hearings, not one hearing on \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  The only way another country in this world who wants to develop \nnuclear weapons can have some guarantee that they have nuclear weapons \nthat work is if they can test them. That is true of China; it is true \nof any other country. A test ban treaty in which this country provides \nleadership, signs and ratifies it, is a significant step towards \nremoving the dangers of the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the \nworld. We ought to do this. We ought to be able to do it soon.\n  I used a chart on the floor of the Senate recently in which I showed \nthe number of days it took to ratify treaties. No treaty that I am \naware of languished here for over 600 days except this treaty.\n  We have a responsibility to lead in this country with respect to this \ntreaty, and we are not leading. This treaty is before the Senate. The \ncommittee has a responsibility to hold a hearing and give the Senate \nthe opportunity to debate the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nThere is precious little discussion about it. No one seems to know it \nis here. It has been here almost 2 years.\n  Next week, several of my colleagues and I are going to hold a press \nconference to announce the results of a recent bipartisan poll that \nwill demonstrate, once again, overwhelming support for this treaty. \nThis chart shows the support all across this country from last year's \npoll. Overwhelmingly, the American people support a Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  It has been negotiated, it has been signed, but it has not been \nratified. Why? Because it was sent to the Senate over 600 days ago and \nthere has been no debate about it, no discussion of it to speak of, and \nthere has not been 1 minute of hearings held on this treaty. This \nSenate ought to have the opportunity to debate and to vote on the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I reach back to President Eisenhower to make the case only because I \nwant to demonstrate how long the desire for a Comprehensive Nuclear \nTest Ban Treaty has been around--decade after decade.\n  Most recently, when India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons, \nvirtually under each other's chins--and these are countries that do not \nlike each other much--it should have sent a signal to all of us that we \nneed to be concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. How do \nwe manifest concern? By expressing leadership. How do we express \nleadership? By bringing a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that \nhas been negotiated and signed before this body for ratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8738-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TOP AMERICAN HOSPITALS IN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I have been very encouraged in recent days \nby the peace offensive initiated by the new government of Ehud Barak in \nIsrael. The people of Israel long for peace. The new Prime Minister, in \nhis first few days in office, has been energetically trying to lay the \ngroundwork for a secure, lasting peace in the Middle East. I applaud \nhis efforts and trust that Prime Minister Barak's actions will be fully \ndiscussed and carried forward in his upcoming talks in Washington \nduring the next week.\n  While I applaud these steps toward peace, I also believe it is \nimperative that, at the same time, Israel remain militarily strong. The \nonly way a durable peace will be successfully negotiated and maintained \nin this dangerous but vital region of the world is if Israel deals from \na strong hand. Even if Israel is successful in reaching an \naccommodation with its closest neighbors, it will continue to face very \nserious strategic threats from Iran, Iraq, and Libya for the \nforeseeable future.\n  To counter these terrorist states which possess weapons of mass \ndestruction and lie within easy striking distance of Israel's homeland, \nit is critical that Israel have an effective strategic strike \ncapability that will provide effective deterrence. To do this and to \nmove simultaneously forward in implementing the Wye River Agreement and \npursuing peace initiatives with its neighbors, Israel will need more \nmilitary assistance funding for aircraft purchases from the United \nStates.\n  In this regard, I recently came across a thoughtful Lexington \nInstitute Issue Brief, authored by well-known defense strategist Loren \nThompson, ``Bolstering Israel's Strategic Air Power Serves America's \nInterests.'' In this essay, Dr. Thompson argues that helping Israel to \nincrease it military strength at this time not only will help Israel \nand further Middle East peace but also help protect America's interests \nin the region, especially since the\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nUS may have less access to bases in the region and more threats to \nAmerican security interests in the future.\n  Dr. Thompson states, among other things, that:\n\n       It (Israel) needs enough money to buy and equip 15 more F-\n     15's for a total force of 40. . . . Making such a purchase \n     would nearly double the Israeli Air Force's capacity for \n     long-range strikes. . . . The US economic and political \n     interest in the Middle East-Persian Gulf region will continue \n     to grow in the years ahead (and) Israel is the only stable, \n     reliable US ally willing to take the necessary risks. \n     Congress and the Clinton Administration need to equip it \n     (Israel) so that it is ready when the time comes.\n\n  Mr. President, to share Dr. Thompson's thoughts with my colleagues, I \nask unanimous consent that this essay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Bolstering Israel's Strategic Air Power Serves America's Interests\n\n                     (By Loren B. Thompson, Ph.D.)\n\n       Israel's government is currently considering a major \n     purchase of military aircraft from the United States. The \n     pending sale has attracted media attention in the U.S. \n     because it pits two highly-regarded tactical aircraft--the \n     Boeing F-15 and Lockheed Martin F-16--against each other in a \n     competition that may be the last opportunity to keep the F-15 \n     in production.\n       The F-15 is more capable than the F-16 in some roles, but \n     it is also more expensive. That is one reason why the F-16 \n     has won most of the recent international arms-sale \n     competitions in which both aircraft were offered. With global \n     tensions greatly reduced from the Cold War period, many \n     nations would prefer the operational flexibility of acquiring \n     a larger number of planes for the same price.\n       Israel will probably be no exception. It is a foregone \n     conclusion that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) will select one \n     of the two planes because the U.S. government subsidizes \n     Israeli arms purchases and the F-15 and F-16 are the only \n     U.S. aircraft being offered in the current competition. But \n     the IAF has over a hundred aging F-4 fighters and A-4 attack \n     planes reaching the end of their useful life, and the multi \n     role F-16 is a much more affordable replacement than the F-\n     15, both in terms of up-front acquisition costs and later \n     support costs. So the F-15 is likely to lose the competition.\n\n\n                         The Strategic Context\n\n       The U.S. government should not try to dictate to Israel how \n     it organizes or equips its military. On the other hand, \n     Washington should be sensitive to the fact that Israel is one \n     of America's few democratic allies in the Middle East, and \n     its armed forces in the future may be called on to serve as \n     substitutes for U.S. military power. This has happened in the \n     past, most notably when the IAF destroyed Iraq's Osirak \n     reactor in 1981--a facility the Iraqis planned to use for \n     making weapons-grade nuclear material.\n       The Osirak mission was carried out by Israeli F-16 strike \n     aircraft escorted by F-15 fighters. Its success was good news \n     for every nation in the region, although few Arab states \n     could publicly say so. Saddam Hussein's subsequent behavior \n     demonstrated it was also good news for America, which avoided \n     having to deal with a nuclear-capable dictatorship in a \n     volatile, strategically-important region.\n       But things have changed in the Middle East since 1981. A \n     number of countries other than Iraq--some of them more \n     distant from Israel--have begun acquiring access to weapons \n     of mass destruction. Iran is developing nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons, along with the ballistic missiles to \n     deliver such weapons over long distances (it tested the new \n     Shahab medium-range ballistic missile in July 1998). Libya \n     has made similar efforts. And Sudan has become a center of \n     global terrorism, one suspected of sponsoring the manufacture \n     of chem-bio weapons.\n       These trends, which are likely to grow worse, already pose \n     a serious threat to both Israeli and Western interests in the \n     region. But whereas policymakers in Washington have the \n     luxury of seeing such developments in tactical terms, for \n     Israel they are strategic: the very survival of the Jewish \n     state is at stake. And although it is now fashionable to \n     think of America as the world's policeman, it is clear that \n     Israel will often have more incentive and latitude than the \n     U.S. to respond expeditiously to such threats in the future.\n\n\n                       israel's strategic dilemma\n\n       Which is why the pending arms sale has a special \n     significance: if the government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak \n     decides its top air-power priority is to refresh its force \n     structure with the improved version of the F-16 (the F-16I), \n     Washington shouldn't dispute that decision. But the issue of \n     Israel's strategic strike capability against emerging threats \n     in distant states like Iran should not be neglected.One of \n     the ways in which the F-15I is superior to the F-16I is in \n     its ability to carry bigger bomb loads to greater distances. \n     It would be easier to sustain a long-range bombing campaign \n     against strategic targets near the Iranian capital of Teheran \n     using F-15I's than F-16I's for the simple reason that the F-\n     15I's have about a third more range.\n       A single F-16I has a maximum weapons carriage of four \n     2,000-pound bombs, which it can carry to a maximum unrefueled \n     combat radius of over 700 nautical miles. An F-15I can carry \n     the same bombload to a radius of about 1,100 nautical miles, \n     or it can carry up to seven 2,000-pound bombs of lesser \n     range. The performance of the F-15 results from the fact that \n     each of its twin engines generate as much thrust (29,000 \n     ponds) as the single engine on an F-16. Unfortunately the \n     twin engines are also the biggest reason why each F-15I would \n     cost the IAF about 30% more, not counting later support \n     costs. In air warfare, the tradeoff between price and \n     performance often is inescapable.\n       Fortunately for Israel, long-range strategic strike is a \n     specialized mission that does not require a large number of \n     aircraft, and the IAF already has 25 F-15Is suitable for the \n     mission that it bought in 1995. Furthermore, it's not as \n     though the F-16s can't hit remote targets: it was the strike \n     aircraft against the Osirak reactor. But for truly distant \n     targets, the F-16 imposes performance penalties. Conformal \n     fuel tanks might have to be added at the expense of bombload, \n     or aerial refueling might be necessary in hostile airspace. \n     For these very distant targets, the F-15I is the safer \n     choice.\n       The problem is that Israel doesn't have enough F-15I's \n     today to prosecute a sustained bombing campaign over great \n     distances, and within current budget constraints it can't \n     afford to buy more--unless it decides to buy fewer F-16s, \n     which would be a bad idea given the age of existing IAF \n     assets and the myriad other missions the F-16Is are needed to \n     cover.\n\n\n                            the bottom line\n\n       The bottom line is that Israel needs more military \n     assistance funding for aircraft purchases from the United \n     States. Specifically, it needs enough money to buy and equip \n     15 more F-15Is for a total force of 40, without cutting its \n     planned purchase of F-16s. Some F-15I proponents have called \n     for a ``second squadron'' of F-15Is, but the U.S. should not \n     be in the business of dictating the organization of the \n     Israeli Air Force. What it should be doing is helping Israel \n     meet the full range of its legitimate military needs.\n       Fifteen more F-15s for Israel is not enough to keep the F-\n     15 line open for an extended period of time, but that's \n     precisely the point: this may be the last chance for Israel \n     to acquire an adequate strategic strike capability before the \n     F-15 line closes. Making such a purchase would nearly double \n     the IAF's capacity for long-range strikes while permitting \n     more efficient use of the support infrastructure bought to \n     support the 25 F-15Is already in the force. It would also \n     free up F-16s for other missions, thus enhancing utilization \n     of the entire tactical-aircraft inventory.\n       But the case for funding a viable IAF strategic force \n     transcends Israeli military needs. The U.S. economic and \n     political interest in the Middle East-Persian Gulf region \n     will continue to grow in the years ahead as America becomes \n     more dependent on foreign oil. Unfortunately, its access to \n     bases and freedom to act militarily in the region will \n     probably diminish, forcing it in some cases to rely on allies \n     to achieve military goals. Israel is the only stable, \n     reliable U.S. ally willing to take the necessary risks. \n     Congress and the Clinton Administration need to equip it so \n     that it is ready when the time comes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8739-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives was received announcing \nthat the Speaker signed the following enrolled bill on July 1, 1999:\n\n       H.R. 775.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Folic Acid \nPromotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1999. I would also like \nto thank my colleagues Senator Bond and Senator Kohl for cosponsoring \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, each year over 8,000 infants die from birth defects. \nThe loss of these children, who could have grown up to be community \nleaders, teachers, doctors, or lawyers, weighs heavily upon our \nsociety. In addition, each year over 2,500 babies born live with \nserious birth defects of the brain and spine, called neural tube \ndefects, and over 50 percent of these cases are preventable. In 1991, \nresearch proved that if pregnant women take as little as 400 micrograms \nof B vitamin folic acid each day, 50 to 70 percent of all cases of \nthese serious birth defects of the brain and spine, such as spina \nbifida, would be prevented. Unfortunately, this information is not \nwidely known by the public. According to a Gallup Poll conducted for \nthe March of Dimes, only 32 percent of women of childbearing age \nreported taking a multivitamin with folic acid on a daily basis.\n  We must broaden public awareness about the prevention of these \ncrippling defects. For this reason, I have introduced the Folic Acid \nPromotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1999. This legislation \nauthorizes $20 million for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in \npartnership with state and local public and private entities, to launch \nan education and public awareness campaign, conduct research to \nidentify effective strategies for increasing folic acid consumption by \nwomen of reproducing age, and evaluate the effectiveness of these \nstrategies.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is an effort to link great advances \nin research with everyday life. This life-saving information about the \nconsumption of folic acid, which will prolong the health and well-being \nof women and infants, needs to be broadcast to families and individuals \nacross the country. It is my firm belief that this legislation will be \nthe vehicle to help bring this important message into every home in \nAmerica.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the March of Dimes for their \ninvolvement in this issue. Their work will be critical in getting this \nlegislation passed and in helping spread the message of the benefits of \nfolic acid.

Mr. President, I will take a little time to speak about \nthe surplus that we have over and above Social Security, which we call \nthe non-Social Security surplus. That is the amount by which the \ntaxpayers of this country have paid more into the U.S. Treasury than we \nneed to run Government.\n  I choose now to speak to a proposal that I made with the introduction \nof a tax bill yesterday. I introduced it and had it printed and \nreported to the appropriate committee because I thought that even \nthough I am not on the Finance Committee, that some of my ideas and \nthoughts might be relevant. I wanted the Senate to have the benefit of \nwhat I thought should be a good way to fix the Tax Code while we are \nreducing taxes.\n  Let me address this matter in a text that I have prepared and worked \nvery hard on, including the bill that was introduced. I thank my staff \nfor the diligent work and the Joint Committee on Taxation for their \nwillingness to help us with evaluations of how much these various \nproposals will cost.\n  T.S. Eliot wrote, ``April is the Cruelest Month.'' Millions of \nAmericans agree, especially around April 15. The Congress is going to \npass a tax bill to make April a little kinder. I say it is time to \nshare the surplus. Since without tax relief it takes the average worker \nuntil May 11 to earn enough money to pay his or her taxes, our tax bill \nalso lets people start working for their families' benefit earlier in \nthe year.\n  American families are currently saddled with an unprecedented tax \nburden. Total Federal tax collections are at a post-World War II high \nof 20.7 percent of the gross domestic product. Individual income tax \ncollections alone are 10 percent of the gross domestic product and are \nprojected to stay there. We have never experienced a government based \non that level of income taxation, speaking of the income tax component \nof our total American government tax table.\n\n  The 1990s are truly a decade when government taxed the total \npopulation of America at a very excessive rate. The President will have \na choice to spend on government programs or resist the urge to splurge \nand instead return the overpayment to its rightful owners in the form \nof a tax cut or tax relief. It is estimated the average American \nhousehold will pay nearly $7,000 more in taxes than the government \nneeds to operate the non-Social Security portion of the government over \nthe next decade. The tax-writing committees of Congress are working \nright now to fashion a 10-year tax cut, phasing it in, that will total \naround $778 billion over the next 10 years. In the Senate it seems that \nthey are working on that exact number because that is what the budget \nresolution we adopted said they should do. The House seems to be moving \nin a direction of a little larger tax cut over the decade, but we are \ntalking now about $770 billion to $800 billion plus.\n  The ideas that are encapsulated in the bill I introduced take into \naccount that the economy is booming. Personal income tax, as measured \nagainst adjusted gross income, is up 8.25 percent\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nfrom 1997 over 1996. That is a current year IRS statistic. That is, \npersonal income, as measured as adjusted gross income, is up 8.25 \npercent. Income tax revenues are up 10.2 percent. This is good news and \nbad news, and these statistics encapsulate both.\n  The good news is our salaries, capital gains, and interest income are \ngrowing. The bad news is that bracket creep is pushing more and more \nAmericans into higher tax brackets, even though we do not have as many \nbrackets as we had years ago when bracket creep was a major American \nproblem because of high inflation.\n  It is still pushing them into higher brackets, and at the same time, \nthe code is working to make more and more American taxpayers pay what \nis commonly called now AMT taxes; that is, alternative minimum taxes, \nwhich really were never intended to cover the vast number of Americans \nthat are currently being pushed into the alternative minimum tax \nportions of our code because they are being pushed into higher \nbrackets.\n  I share with the Senate the key components of the bill I introduced, \nand I want to recognize that this bill builds upon legislation \nintroduced by Senators Coverdell, Torricelli, and Mack.\n  The philosophy behind the various provisions is something important, \nas I view it. I have been a long-time advocate of fundamental tax \nreform. I believe it would be better for our economy and simpler and \nfairer if we could shift our tax base from income that is earned and \ninstead tax income that is consumed. There are very few who disagree \nthat that would be a very good approach to a philosophy of taxation in \nour country. I have often said our current code is hostile to savings \nand investing and that we, as a Nation, pay the price in the form of \nlower economic growth.\n  The philosophical underpinnings of this package corrects some \ndeficiencies. Let me go through it.\n  First section. Broad-based tax relief for all taxpaying families. \nPurpose: To cut taxes for 120 million American taxpayers by lowering \nand widening the 15-percent Federal income tax bracket.\n  Second, marriage penalty mitigation and burden reduction. The purpose \nis to return 7 million taxpaying families to the 15-percent bracket and \nto cut taxes for another 35 million taxpaying families who will benefit \nfrom a tax cut of up to $1,300 per family. It eliminates or mitigates \nthe marriage penalty for many middle-class taxpaying families. That \nhappens by merely adjusting the brackets downward and upward in the 15-\npercent area. I repeat, you do not change the marriage penalty for \nmiddle-class taxpaying families, but by making the 15-percent bracket \nbroader, adding $10,000 to the adjusted gross income people can earn \nand still be in that bracket, and lowering the bottom bracket 1.5 \npercent, much of the marriage penalty is mitigated for people in those \nbrackets.\n  Third, dividend and interest tax relief. Adjusting the tax base to \nrecognize that dividends and interest should not be taxed. Now, \nobviously, there is not room in a tax package to totally eliminate \ndividends and interest. But the purpose of our bill is to provide an \nincremental step toward taxing income that is consumed rather than \nincome that is earned and saved. It simplifies the code by eliminating \n67 million hours of spent time in tax preparation. It eliminates \nFederal income taxes on savings for more than 30 million Americans in \nthe middle-class families and reduces Federal income taxes on savings \nfor an additional 37 million Americans. It essentially allows about a \n$10,000 nest egg to grow, tax free, and will let Americans enjoy the \nmiracle of compound interest.\n  Specifically, it excludes the first $500 in interest and dividend \ntaxation. That permits you to grow this nest egg and not have to pay \ntaxes on the interest and dividends for the first $500 in that kind of \nincome. It sounds small, but it affects a huge number of Americans and \nstarts us in the direction of saying we ought to save, and we ought to \nstart taxing not earned income, but consumed income.\n  The next provision is a capital gains cut by recognizing that \ninvestment and investing should be encouraged, not penalized. A Tax \nCode for the new century should exclude modest capital gains from \ntaxation. The purpose of the provision is to provide an incremental \nstep toward shifting our Internal Revenue Code away from taxing savings \nand investment. A savings-friendly Tax Code would lower the cost of \ncapital so that prosperity, better paying jobs, and innovation can \ncontinue in the United States.\n  The bill would eliminate capital gains for 10 million American \nfamilies, 75 percent of whose income is $75,000 or less. This provision \nis also a 70 million man-hour timesaver. I can think of many activities \nto spend 70 million hours on rather than filling out tax forms. The \nspecific of this provision is that it exempts the first $5,000 in long-\nterm capital gains from taxation. It eliminates it totally from \ntaxation.\n  Another important section deals with retirement savings incentives. \nThe purpose of this is to say that the savings rate for all Americans \nwill increase by reforming the system to favorably treat income that is \ninvested for retirement. It provides targeted incentives to middle-\nclass families to increase their retirement savings in a traditional \nIRA by $1,000 per working member of the family per year. Specifically, \nit raises the contribution limit for traditional deductible IRAs from \n$2,000 to $3,000 and indexes the limit for inflation, when we can fit \nthat into the dollars in the code.\n\n  The bill includes a death tax phaseout. It recognizes that death \nshould not be a taxable event in the 21st century. We do not have \nsufficient resources to do away with it in toto. Some will be proposing \nit. I think they will find that it is rather expensive, even with $782 \nbillion to spend. So the purpose of ours is to begin phasing it out. \nSpecifically, it reduces tax from the top rate of 55 percent to 40 \npercent.\n  Then we have innovation and competitiveness. We all know those are \ncharacteristics that, at this point in our economic history, are \nrampant in our American economy. Innovation and competitiveness are the \nthings that turned the American economy around and made Japan ask: What \nis America doing right? It made France and Germany ask: What are they \ndoing right? Fifteen years ago, everybody was asking the reverse. Some \nwere wondering if we should do things like they did things. I am \ngrateful we did not, for most of the difference was planning by \nGovernment. They continued to do it and we came out of it with \ninnovation and competitiveness.\n  Now we ought to make sure we do what we can with this available \nsurplus to make the research and investment credit turn out to be a \npermanent part of the Tax Code. This change recognizes that the single \nbiggest factor in creating better jobs through productivity growth is \ninnovation. Productivity growth is derived from research and \ndevelopment conducted in the private sector. Between 60 to 80 percent \nof the productivity growth since the Great Depression can be traced to \ninnovation.\n  Specifics of the proposal. The provisions here are the same as those \ncontained in Senate bill 951, which I introduced. It makes this tax \ncredit permanent, but also expands it to cover businesses that were not \nheretofore covered, including many small businesses that are filled \nwith innovation but can't avail themselves of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  Last, but not least, the bill includes a section on energy \nindependence. All I will say is that America is, once again, looking at \nitself in the world and finding that we grow more and more dependent on \noil from abroad. In fact, it has gotten so high that there is no \nquestion that America is now dependent for its very survival upon \nimporting oil from foreign countries. We have probably reached the \npoint where we cannot avoid that. We will always be dependent. But the \nquestion is, Should we let an American oil and gas industry--\nprincipally made up of independent producers and risk takers--wither \nand die on the vine? Or should we change the Tax Code so more capital \nwill be made available by the way we change the Tax Code for that kind \nof industry, the oil patch of America, for those who supply the \nservices, take the risks, and those who pump the oil and gas.\n  We have made some changes and many Senators are interested in some of \nthese issues, such as oil and gas capitalization, through changing the \nTax Code. I won't read them one by one. To be specific, with reference \nto my own\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nState, this overall proposal cuts taxes for 574,000 New Mexican \nfamilies who have to file an income tax return.\n  First, the bill cuts taxes by 10 percent by lowering the 15-percent \nbracket to 13.5 with a 5-year phase-in. This lowers taxes for families \nwith adjusted gross incomes up to $44,000 for joint filers and $28,000 \nfor single filers. The tax change puts 424,000 New Mexicans who weren't \nup to that amount in a new lower bracket and cuts their taxes by 10 \npercent. This bill also raises the threshold on the 15-percent \nbracket--something that was included in the proposals made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia and Senator Torricelli from New \nJersey. It raises that threshold by $10,000 so that middle-income \nAmericans can earn up to $55,000 in a joint return and only pay 15 \npercent, instead of being dumped into the higher bracket once they are \nat $44,000. This is going to cut taxes for families with adjusted gross \nincomes between $44,000 and $55,000. You know the rest.\n\n  According to our own revenue and taxation department in my home \nState, approximately 151,000 New Mexicans would be returned to the 15 \npercent tax bracket from which they have been pushed out; 83,000 of the \nfamilies would see their taxes cut by $1,300 a year. Because of the \nprogressive rate change structure, New Mexicans in the 28, 31, 36 and \n39.9 brackets would all see their taxes cut by a similar amount because \nof the marginal rate concept in our law.\n  This bill excludes $500 in interest and dividends from taxation. The \nexclusion essentially makes a $10,000 nest egg tax free; 504,000 New \nMexicans will be helped by it and file more simple tax returns. The \nbill exempts $5,000 in capital gains from taxation, amounting to a $1.4 \nmillion tax cut for 118,000 New Mexicans.\n  I close with a quote from Milton Friedman.\n  Milton Friedman said, and I agree:\n\n       The estate tax sends a bad message to savers, to wit: that \n     it is O.K. to spend your money on wine, women and song, but \n     don't try to save it for your kids. The moral absurdity of \n     the tax is surpassed only by its economic irrationality.\n\n  The death tax is also one of the most unpopular taxes. While most \nAmericans will never pay it, 70 percent believe it is one of the most \nunfair taxes. Its damage to the economy is worse than its unpopular \nreputation. The Tax Foundation found that today's estate tax rates \n(ranging from 18 to 55 percent) have the same disincentive effect on \nentrepreneurs as doubling the current income tax rates and NFIB called \nit the ``greatest burden on our nation's most successful small \nbusinesses.''\n  The would make R credit permanent and phase-in some modifications \nduring last five years. This is essentially the text of a bill I \nintroduced earlier this year.\n  The bill increases expensing to $250,000. This will simplify record \nkeeping for 2.5 million small businesses and save them a whopping \n107,000,000 hours in tax preparation.\n  It also phases out the AMT for both indivduals and corporations.\n  The tax plan also recognizes that there are certain areas of the \ncountry--oil patch in particular that are being devastated. At the same \ntime, the oil and gas industry pays some of the highest taxes in the \ncountry. For this reason the bill also includes oil and gas tax relief.\n  While the Joint Committee on Taxation has not completed its revenue \nestimate, it is my intention that these tax provisions can be \naccommodated within the Budget Resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one only needs to open a newspaper or turn \non a television set to a news program in this country, the United \nStates, to understand we are experiencing a wonderful economy, a \nwonderful turn of events. This has lasted a long while. Most people are \nworking. Inflation is down. Budget deficits have evaporated. The \ncountry is growing. The economy is doing better, and there is a lot of \ngood news.\n  In addition to the general economic news, the stock market is in a \nkind of go-go mood reaching record highs. These breathtaking heights in \nthe stock market are coupled with stories about young people involved \nin the Internet who are making millions before they are old enough to \nshave. That is wonderful.\n  There are a lot of people doing well in this country because of the \neconomy. But there are some who are left behind and left out. We ought \nto pay attention to some of these storm clouds. I am speaking \nespecially about family farmers. They are this country's economic all \nstars and have been for some long while. They are suffering silently, \nbut they are suffering in a very significant way today. This Congress \nhas a responsibility to do something about it.\n  Let me read a letter that I received from a farmer in North Dakota a \nday or two ago. He says:\n\n       As a family farmer and rancher, it doesn't seem to me there \n     are many people who care much about us anymore. It sometimes \n     brings tears to my eyes that maybe in a year or two I won't \n     be around in farming anymore. This won't be easy to explain \n     to my three daughters. I wanted to bring them up in a rural \n     setting. If it happens I can't farm, I hope they read in the \n     history books some day that it wasn't because their dad was a \n     dumb man. It was caused by policy and giant concentrations of \n     companies who want world dominance.\n\n  This farmer, who worries about losing his farm and worries about how \nhe will explain that to his three daughters, worries about not being \nable to raise his daughters on the family farm. He says it is not his \nfault. And it isn't.\n  I want to describe what this man is going through.\n  Another farmer wrote to me and said:\n\n       I'm sitting at the kitchen table at 3:30 in the morning. It \n     is spooky quiet out here these days, neighbors going broke, \n     moving away, family farmers can't make it. My family is \n     asleep and I don't know how long I will be able to hang on to \n     this family farm.\n\n  Let me describe what these farmers face. While the stock market \nreaches record highs, here is what happens to the price of wheat. Those \nfamily farmers see their income declining in a very significant way. No \none else is experiencing declining income. CEO salaries aren't going \ndown; they are going up, up, up--way up. The stock market is going up \nto record highs. Yet if you are raising wheat and you are a family \nfarmer, you have seen your income collapse.\n  What if you are raising corn? Exactly the same thing. Your income is \ncollapsing.\n  What if you are raising soybeans on the family farm? The same thing. \nThe income is collapsing.\n  What share are you getting as a family farmer of the retail food \ndollar? Collapsing.\n  In the spring, you borrow some money, you buy some seeds, you fix up \nthe tractor, plant the seeds, and hope they grow. You worry about \ninsects; you worry about crop disease; you worry it will hail; you \nworry that it won't rain enough, or maybe too much; and then at the end \nyou may get a crop. If you get a crop, you worry when you will get it \noff the ground. After you have combined it and harvested the crop, you \nput it on the truck and drive to the elevator, only to be told the \ngrain trade says that the crop produced has no value. We are going to \npay you $1.50 or $2 a bushel less than it cost to produce.\n\n  You sit in the truck as a family farmer, knowing you took all of \nthese risks, that your family is depending on you, and that the world \nis hungry. You hear the stories. You hear that in the Sudan a million \npeople face the abyss of starvation and old women climb trees to forage \nfor leaves because they have nothing to eat.\n  The grain trade says the food we produce has no value. Farmers \nscratch their heads and say: I guess it is because the public policies \nin this country say that family farmers don't count. Family farmers \ndon't matter.\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\n  That is what angers family farmers the most. They produce something \nof enormous importance to the entire world and are told it has no \nvalue. They are told that the farm bill is fundamentally bankrupt. The \nFreedom to Farm Act passed by this Congress several years ago is \ntotally bankrupt. It ought to be repealed immediately.\n  Trade agreements, negotiated by trade negotiators who have done a \nterrible job and were totally incompetent, sold our farmers down the \nriver.\n  So family farmers have a right to ask the question: Why can't we \nexpect from this Congress, this Administration, and this country, a \ndecent opportunity to make a living, a decent price for the food we \nproduce, and a decent deal from trade agreements that are negotiated \nwith other countries? Why can't we expect this country to stand up for \nfamily farmers?\n  A group from some farm States met this morning. We talked about how \nwe will mobilize efforts to try to begin to provide two things. One, we \nneed some emergency help--an emergency disaster relief bill to offset \nthe income collapse which family farmers are facing. Second, we need a \nchange in the farm program. We decided to seek a meeting next week with \nPresident Clinton at the White House. We will try to make sure this \nAdministration proposes a robust disaster program and joins in \nproposing to change the underlying farm program to provide decent \nincome support for family farmers when prices collapse.\n  Next week we will try to do that, meet with the President, and \ndevelop an emergency bill to provide disaster relief. Senator Harkin \nand I proposed such a bill in the appropriations subcommittee. Senator \nConrad has proposed a number of ideas on how to provide disaster \nrelief. I expect we will have to propose disaster relief somewhere in \nthe $10-billion-plus range.\n  This Congress has a responsibility to respond to this issue and to do \nit soon.\n  Second, to change the farm bill so family farmers have a safety net. \nOthers in this country have a safety net. But somehow the suggestion \nwas made that we can just pull the safety net out from under family \nfarmers and that would be fine. Nobody will care. Families care. \nFarmers care. I do not want anybody standing up in this Chamber saying \nthey are profamily and then turn a blind eye to the needs of family \nfarmers. That is what has been happening.\n  If there were fires or floods or tornadoes that hit our part of the \ncountry and devastated all the buildings, the economy and the \ninfrastructure, we would have folks rushing out there with help. We \nwould have FEMA all set up in big buildings and tents, getting people \nin to give help. Everybody would be helping. In fact, you wouldn't even \nneed a tornado. If some hogs got sick with a mysterious disease, we \nwould have the entire Department of Agriculture trying to find out what \nwas wrong with the hogs. Only farmers can see their incomes collapse.\n  In our State, the incomes collapsed 98 percent in 1 year. Ask \nyourself, could your family stand a 98 percent loss in income? Could \nany Members of the Senate stand a 98 percent loss in their paycheck? \nCan wage earners stand a 98 percent loss in their wage? I don't think \nso. That is what happened to farmers in my State.\n  The question is, who is going to respond, when are they going to \nrespond, and when is this country going to care whether we have family \nfarmers left in our future? The answer for me is soon. The answer for \nme is now. Next week, we must expect to make progress with the \nPresident; yes, with the majority party and the minority party working \ntogether to try to provide disaster relief, No. 1, and a long-term \nsafety net, No. 2.\n  I want to tell you about a fellow named Tom Ross who did something \nthat I thought was unique in Minot, ND. Tom Ross is a newscaster with \nKMOT television. He got 48 acres just north and east of Minot, ND. He \ngot some partners, and he planted 48 acres of durum wheat. His partners \nwere experts in this area, seed companies, chemical companies, the \nResearch Extension Service and so on. In 1997, they determined exactly \nwhat it cost, exactly what they planted, and exactly what they \nharvested, and what the outcome was. They did this on television to try \nto demonstrate the plight that family farmers were facing. Let me \ndemonstrate what it was.\n  In 1997, they planted 48 acres, and they lost $50 an acre. This is \nwith all the experts weighing in with Mr. Ross, the newsman, saying \nhere is how we do it. They did it, and they lost $50 an acre. Next \nyear, they planted the same 48 acres and they lost $1,930 an acre. So \nin 2 years they have lost almost $2,000 an acre on 48 acres of land. If \nyou farm 1,000 acres, which is about an average size farm, slightly \nsmaller than an average size farm in the farm belt, you would have lost \n$50,000 just in that first year.\n  This year, Mr. Ross planted 48 acres of roundup ready canola. Last \nweek, I stood out in that field just northeast of Minot, ND. We will \nsee what happens this year. Given the price, given the circumstances, \nthey expect they will lose some money this year.\n  The point is that on 48 acres with controlled circumstances and all \nof the experts to help, you have massive losses of income over three \nyears. This is multiplied by every family farmer across the farm belt. \nWhy? Because prices have collapsed, and family farmers have no safety \nnet, at least not a safety net that is available to help them survive.\n  This is a unique experiment, and it shows in the clearest way \npossible that this is not about whether family farmers are good \nfarmers. They are the economic All-Stars in our country. The project \nthat KMOT did in Minot, ND, demonstrates that when prices collapse, \nfamily farmers do not have a chance to make a decent living and someone \nhas a responsibility to help. That someone is this Congress, this \nSenate, this President. And the time is now; not later--now. If we want \nto save family farmers for this country's future, we must take action \nnow.\n  On Monday, I am going to talk about a paper that was just released by \nthe Economic Policy Institute written by Robb Scott, ``The Failure of \nAgriculture Deregulation,'' describing the failure of Freedom to Farm, \nthe failure of our trade policies, and the selling down the river of \nfamily farm interests in this country by people who should have known \nbetter. I will describe that in more detail on Monday.\n  We do not have time to waste. We do not have time to wait. We must \nact and do so with great effect to try to help family farmers. The \nfellow who says I may not be able to farm anymore, at least is farming \nnow. A whole lot of folks sold out long ago, and more are selling out \nevery month and every week.\n  A woman called me recently and said her 17-year-old son would not \ncome down to the auction sale when they were forced to sell. She says \nit is not because he is a bad kid. This young boy stayed up in his \nbedroom because he was brokenhearted. He wanted to farm that land so \nbad and take it over from his dad at some point. He knew when the \nauction sale was held that it was over for him. His dreams were gone. \nShe said he was so brokenhearted he simply could not come down and \nparticipate in the auction sale of the family farm.\n  That is happening all across the northern plains, all cross the farm \nbelt. At the same time, the stock market shows record highs, and we \nhear about this robust economy. The economic all-Stars in this country, \nwho produce so much of what the world needs, are being told what they \nproduce has no value and their existence does not matter. Shame on this \ncountry if it does not stand up now and decide that family farmers have \nvalue. What they produce has enormous value, and family farmers are \nimportant for this country's future.\n  I am betting the energy exists with this President and this Congress \nto finally turn the corner and say we need to make a change. We need \ntrade agreements that stand up for the interests of farmers. We need a \nsafety net that says when farmers' incomes drop 98 percent, we stand to \nhelp because we care about you and your future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, yesterday, the House of Representatives \nwith very little discussion and debate voted themselves a $4,600 pay \nincrease. The Senate passed a similar measure earlier this month. Fair \nis fair. If Members of Congress deserve a raise, then surely the hard-\nworking, lowest paid workers across this country deserve an increase in \nthe minimum wage as well. Shame on this Congress when we vote ourselves \na $4,600 pay increase, yet do nothing for the lowest paid workers in \nAmerica.\n  I intend to do all I can to see that Congress acts to raise the \nminimum wage as soon as possible. When President Clinton signs the law \nto raise the pay for the 535 Members of Congress, he should also have \non his desk the bill to raise the pay for the 11 million Americans who \nwork for the minimum wage.\n  The case for an increase in the minimum wage is overwhelming. Since \n1991, congressional pay has increased $39,400. In the same amount of \ntime, a minimum wage worker has seen a pay increase of only $1,870.\n  Legislation to raise the minimum wage--the Fair Minimum Wage Act--has \nbeen installed for many months by this Republican Congress. Our \nproposal will raise the federal minimum wage from its present level of \n$5.15 an hour to $5.65 on September 1, 1999 and to $6.15 an hour on \nSeptember 1, 2000.\n  Speaker Hastert said last March, ``I feel Members of Congress come \nhere, they do their work. I know there are Members that have three or \nfour kids in college at a time. I'm not crying crocodile tears, but \nthey need to be able to have a life and provide for their family.''\n  I say minimum wage workers have a life, too. They need to provide for \ntheir families, too. They need to put their children through college, \ntoo.\n  Under our proposal, a minimum wage worker would earn an additional \n$2,000 a year. That amount will pay for 7 months of groceries to feed \nthe average family. It will pay to house an average family for 5 \nmonths. It will pay for 10 months of utilities. It will cover a year \nand a half of tuition and fees at a 2-year college. It will provide \ngreater opportunities for all those struggling at the minimum wage to \nobtain the skills they need for better jobs and better careers and \nbetter support for their families.\n  We know that under current law, minimum wage earners can barely make \nends meet. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712 \nalmost $3,200 below the poverty line for a family of three. A full \nday's work should mean a fair day's pay. But for millions of Americans \nwho earn the minimum wage, the pay is unfair.\n  Opponents complain that increasing the minimum wage hurts small \nbusiness and causes job losses. But these claims have been proven \nwrong. In fact, since the most recent increases in the federal minimum \nwage--a 50-cent increase in October 1996 and a 40-cent increase in \nSeptember 1997--employment has risen in virtually all sectors of the \neconomy. Over 8 million new jobs have been added to the workforce, \nincluding 1.1 million retail jobs, 350,000 restaurant jobs, and more \nthan 4 million jobs in the service industry. The increases boosted the \nearnings of 9.9 million low-wage workers directly, and millions more \nindirectly, but far from enough.\n  As Business Week has stated:\n\n       [H]igher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. \n     Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, minimum \n     wages raise income, not unemployment. . . . A higher minimum \n     wage can be an engine for upward mobility. When employees \n     become more valuable, employers tend to boost training and \n     install equipment to make them more productive. Higher wages \n     at the bottom often lead to better education for both workers \n     and their children.\n\n  Even Business Week agrees, ``It is time to set aside old assumptions \nabout the minimum wage.''\n  The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the \nlowest unemployment rate in almost three decades. Under the leadership \nof President Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable \nperiod of growth and prosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are \nflourishing--generating an unprecedented expansion, with impressive \nefficiencies and significant job creation. The stock market has soared. \nInflation is low, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low.\n  But despite this unprecedented economic growth, too many workers are \nnot reaping the benefits of this prosperity. To have the purchasing \npower it had in 1968, the minimum wage should be at least $7.49 an hour \ntoday, not $5.15. This unconscionable gap shows how far we have fallen \nshort over the past 30 years in granting low-income workers their fair \nshare of the country's extraordinary prosperity.\n  Since 1968, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by \nover 150 percent--while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has \ngone down by 30 percent. Shame on Congress for allowing that decline.\n  As the economy reaches new heights, so do CEO salaries, often \nreaching tens of millions of dollars a year. At that rate, it takes a \nCEO barely 2 hours to earn what a minimum wage worker earns in an \nentire year. The rise in income inequality between the country's top \nearners and those at the bottom makes our Nation weaker, not stronger.\n  In a strong economy, we can clearly afford to give low income workers \na rise. Our national wage total is over $4.2 trillion. That is what \nAmerican employers are paying in wages today. The increase of one \ndollar that we proposed would raise the national wage total by only \none-fifth of 1 percent.\n  That is a drop in the bucket in the overall American economy, but a \nsignificant benefit for low-income workers.\n  According to the Department of Labor, 59 percent of minimum wage \nearners are women. Nearly three-fourths are adults. Forty percent are \nthe sole breadwinners in their families. Almost half work full time. \nThey are teachers' aides and child care providers, home health care \nassistants and clothing store workers. They care for the elderly in \nnursing homes. They stock the food shelves at the corner store. They \nclean office buildings in thousands of communities across the country.\n  The minimum wage is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is \na civil rights issue. It is a labor issue. It is a family issue. Above \nall, it is a fairness issue and a dignity issue. It is time to raise \nthe federal minimum wage again. No one who works for a living should \nhave to live in poverty.\n  This chart over here indicates clearly what has happened to the \nunemployment rate with previous increases in the minimum wage. For \nyears, we have often heard that an increase in the minimum wage would \nsee an increase in unemployment. In 1996, we had an increase in the \nminimum wage to $4.75 an hour, and we have seen the gradual decline in \nunemployment. Then we raised it to $5.15 an hour in September 1997, and \nwe continue to see the decline in unemployment.\n  This chart over here indicates how long an average CEO has to work in \norder to make what a minimum-wage worker earns over the year. By 10:06 \na.m. on the first working day--say, for January 1st--the average CEO \nhas made what will take a minimum-wage worker to earn by 5 p.m. on \nDecember 31. In just over 2 hours, the average CEO has made what a \nminimum-wage worker will make by the end of the year.\n  Finally, this chart over here shows what the poverty line is for a \nfamily of three. The lower line here shows what the annual minimum-wage \nearnings are. What we see in 1999 is the continuing decline in the \nvalue of the minimum wage as minimum wage earners fall further below \nthe poverty level.\n  It is time those men and women who work hard--play by the rules, work \n52 weeks of the year, 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day--are not going to \nhave to live in poverty. We are going to insist this issue be before \nthe Senate in these next very few days or weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8772-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8772-S8773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nby the failure of the parties to move forward with the peace process in \nNorthern Ireland. The Good Friday Peace Agreement was endorsed by the \noverwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland, and it offers \nthe only\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\nrealistic hope for lasting peace for the two communities. We cannot let \nit fail.\n  It is hard to understand why this moment was not seized. The Good \nFriday Peace Agreement is the only way forward--the only way to bring \nthe two communities closer together to build a better future for the \npeople of Northern Ireland.\n  Decommissioning was not a precondition for the formation of the \nExecutive, but it should take place along with other provisions of the \nagreement. The Way Forward proposal outlined a clear timetable for \naddressing the issue. It required clear progress on decommissioning in \nthe coming weeks. General De Chastelain would review progress on \ndecommissioning in September, in December, and again in May 2000. He \nwould need to say publicly that everyone is cooperating. Without \nsignificant progress, the Executive would be disbanded.\n  It is tragic that the opportunity to form the Executive was missed.\n  The Agreement is the mandate of the people, and must be implemented. \nIt offers the Unionists their key demands--their constitutional \nposition, the principle of consent, an end to violence.\n  I would hope that once out of the marching season and after a period \nof reflection and the review by the governments and parties of the \nworking of the agreement--not a review of the agreement itself--that \nwiser counsels will prevail in September.\n  I share the frustration expressed by President Clinton that a \nbreakthrough of this potential is being stalled by a dispute on \nsequencing, which should weigh very little compared to the historic \nagreement on areas of substance reached in the negotiations.\n  I applaud the determination of the two Prime Ministers and President \nClinton to persist in their efforts, with the support of Senator \nMitchell, to overcome this last hurdle.\n  Despite this latest impasse, all who care about peace must redouble \ntheir efforts to find a solution. We must focus our energy on \nincreasing the political dialogue and securing full implementation of \nthe agreement.\n  A way must be found to build trust between the two communities of \nNorthern Ireland. It is clearly the will of the people of Northern \nIreland.\n  The Governments of Ireland and Great Britain and the United States \nmust continue to work together to revitalize the peace process. We \ncannot let it fail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/16/senate-section/article/S8773-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 19, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
