Mr. President, during World War II, countless \nindividuals distinguished themselves while serving this fine Nation. \nHowever, few displayed the valor, leadership, and selflessness as our \ncolleague Daniel K. Inouye and it is with much admiration\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nthat I congratulate him on what this afternoon will be a deserving \nreceipt of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the \nhighest medal awarded by the United States and is reserved for those \nwho have gone above and beyond the call of duty, at the risk of their \nown life, to perform a deed of personal bravery or self-sacrifice.\n  We have recently reached a point in U.S. history which has left only \na handful of Americans who can personally recount the events that took \nplace during World War II and even fewer who fought in this effort to \nfree Europe from the plague of Nazis. Though history books attempt to \ngive younger generations insight into the valiant deeds and the \ncountless deaths which occurred during the Second World War, no words \ncan convey the emotional tragedies and triumphs felt by the men and \nwomen who participated in this campaign.\n  At the age of seventeen, Dan Inouye embarked on a life of public \nservice. Using his knowledge of first aid, he volunteered to treat the \nearliest casualties of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This marked the \nbeginning of Dan's exemplary service to his country. After turning \neighteen, he enlisted in the United States Army's 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team.\n  On the fateful day of April 21, 1945, outside a small town in Italy, \nLieutenant Inouye made a decision which would change the course of his \nlife. As he led his platoon of the 2nd Battalion up a ridge, they were \nconfronted with heavy machine-gun fire, striking Lieutenant Inouye in \nthe abdomen and barely missing his spine. Rather than risk the life of \none of his men, the injured young officer went up against \ninsurmountable odds, and crawled alone farther up the hill into the \nnest of machine guns. He struggled to stand up, pulled the pin from his \ngrenade, and destroyed the closest group of machine guns. He continued \nup the hill, bleeding from his wounds, and struck the second enemy \nposition.\n  Upon reaching the third machine-gun position, Lieutenant Inouye \nattempted to throw a grenade, only to have his right elbow shattered by \nan enemy rifle grenade. However, this did not stop the determined \nlieutenant. Using his good left hand to throw the final grenade, he \ndestroyed the enemy's position. He continued to fight until he was \nstruck by a bullet in the leg, and though in excruciating pain, refused \nto be evacuated until his men were deployed in defensive positions. He \neventually spent 20 months in hospitals after having his right arm \namputated, and returned home a Captain with a Distinguished Service \nCross, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with cluster along with multiple other \nmedals and citations.\n  In my long life, I have met few men who have displayed the \nextraordinary courage, disregard for self, and devotion to their \ncountry as Senator Dan Inouye. And though Dan gave above and beyond \nduring his participation in World War II, he continued to serve this \nfine Nation through public service upon his return to the States. His \ncommitment and concern for the welfare of others is reflected in his \nservice in the U.S. Senate, and I feel honored and privileged to have \nthe opportunity to serve with such a remarkable individual.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I personally appreciate the Senator from \nSouth Carolina recognizing Senator Inouye. I have not served in \nCongress nearly as long, of course, as the Senator from South Carolina, \nbut during my term in Congress, which is now 18 years, there is no one \nthat I have more admiration for than Senator Inouye. He has been like a \nfather to me in the Senate. He has been an adviser and a confidant. He \nis someone for whom I have the deepest respect.\n  I have followed, as have others, his war record. And that is what it \nis; he is certainly a warrior. The outline that was given by the \nSenator from South Carolina of Senator Inouye's extraordinary deeds is \ndramatic, but it did not cover everything that Senator Inouye did on \nthat day of valor.\n  I think it is wonderful that finally Senator Inouye is going to be \nrecognized, as he should be, with the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Senator Inouye has many stories to tell. I hope someday they are \ntold. During the time he spent in the hospital with Senator Dole, their \nfriendship developed. That is one of the friendships that has served \nthe American people well.\n  Even though Senator Inouye lost a limb, he does remarkable things. He \nplays the piano. One of our colleagues has a broken arm, Senator \nHollings. With his wit and with a lot of humility, Senator Inouye asked \nSenator Hollings who had tied his tie that morning. Senator Hollings \nsaid he had had help doing that. Senator Inouye ties his tie himself \nwith one arm.\n  Senator Inouye is someone who has not only been valiant on the \nbattlefield in Italy but he has also been valiant on the battlefield in \nthe Congress of the United States, having served in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and having served in the Senate.\n  I had the good fortune to come to the Senate and be placed on the \nAppropriations Committee, and I was able to watch this master \nlegislator in action. He is someone who doesn't talk a lot, even though \nhe is an extremely fine speaker. But he is a good legislator; he gets \nthings done. I have watched him maneuver bills through the legislative \nprocess as no one else can.\n  Mr. President, I am so grateful that he is being recognized today. \nThere will be a ceremony at the White House where he will be given this \nlong overdue award. Having this award is only part of what this man \ndeserves. I want to spread across this Record how much I and everyone \nin the Senate--Democrat and Republican--respect and admire this great \nlegislator and this great soul.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader for his remarks. I wanted to come to the floor to \nassociate myself with his eloquence and his heartfelt expression \nregarding this important moment in the life of one of the most \nrespected and revered U.S. Senators today.\n  At long last, our country will recognize the valor, the courage, and \nthe extraordinary commitment that one man made to his country now over \n50 years ago.\n  I know I speak for all of our colleagues--frankly, all of the \ncountry--in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to him, our admiration \nfor him, and the extraordinary pride we have in the knowledge that we \nserved with him.\n  Senator Dan Inouye is not only an extraordinary Senator and great \nAmerican in this day of the dearth of the hero; we find the true hero \nin Dan Inouye. There ought to be more role models in our country today. \nBut if one looks to the Dan Inouyes, you don't need many more.\n  I have admired him for the kind of person he is, for the kind of \nmodel that he has been, and for the extraordinarily unique and very \nremarkable way in which he represents his State and all of the people \nhe serves so well in the Senate.\n  The people of Hawaii can be very proud of their delegation. They can \nbe very proud of their senior Senator, and on this day in particular \nthey can be very proud of this country in recognizing the remarkable \nachievement for which this unique leader has now been recognized.\n  So we congratulate Senator Inouye. We congratulate him not only on \nbeing awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, but we congratulate him \nfor his lifetime of service to his country--not only in the military \nbut here in the Senate as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am delighted to speak on behalf of \nSenator Daniel K. Inouye, a man who has distinguished himself in the \nHouse and now in the Senate for more than 40 years. He is also a man \nfor whom I have tremendous respect and regard as a truly national \nleader on a wide range of issues. Later today at a White House \nceremony, Daniel Inouye will be awarded the Congressional Medal of \nHonor by the President.\n  This memorable occasion is one that has been much anticipated and \nlong\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\noverdue. I have had the honor and opportunity to serve with Senator \nInouye in Congress over the past 14 years, and we have worked side by \nside on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs over the past 8 years. \nOn many occasions, I have witnessed his courage and leadership in \nstanding up for serious issues and problems that have affected all \nAmericans including our collective national defense.\n  These qualities and traits can be witnessed throughout Senator \nInouye's life, career, and his service in the United States Army during \nWorld War II. I would like to recount for those unfamiliar with the \nexperience of Dan Inouye and the ``Go for Broke'' regiment a brief \nhistory of the heroics and commitment to his men and the United States \nduring his service in the 2nd Battalion, 442nd ``Go for Broke'' \nRegimental Combat Team in the War.\n  In April of 1945, Army 1st Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye, was leading a \nplatoon of the 2nd Battalion, when it came under fire from a bunker \nmanned by Italian Fascists fighting for their Axis partners the Nazis. \nThere was no cover on the hill, so Inouye crawled up alone to scout. As \nhe was taking out a hand grenade to destroy the first position, he was \nhit in the abdomen by a bullet which came out his back, barely missing \nhis spine. Although wounded, Inouye was still able to pull the pin out \nof the grenade and run to within five yards of the nearest of the three \nmachine guns, and throw the grenade inside the position. He continued \nto lead the platoon and advance alone against a machine gun nest which \nhad his men pinned down. He tossed two hand grenades with devastating \neffect before his right arm was shattered by a German rifle grenade at \nclose range. With his left hand, he tossed his last grenade and \nattacked the Italian Fascists with a submachine gun. Then he was hit in \nhis right leg and fell down the hill. Inouye refused to be evacuated \nuntil his men were deployed in defensive positions.\n  First Lieutenant Inouye spent 20 months in Army hospitals after \nlosing his right arm. He returned to Hawaii as a Captain with a \nDistinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star, Purple Heart with cluster, \nand 12 other medals and citations.\n  After graduating with a law degree from George Washington University, \nhe entered politics, and after Hawaii became a state Dan Inouye won \nelection to the United States House of Representatives as the state's \nfirst Congressman. He was reelected to a full term in 1960 and won \nelection to the United States Senate in 1962. Mr. President, I cannot \nfully express to you or others the deep respect I have for this man, to \nthe leadership he has provided to this country and the sacrifices he \nhas made during these accomplishments. Senator Inouye continues to \ninspire admiration and respect among all who serve with him--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike. Dan Inouye is a leader and hero to \nAmericans across the country and a man that I am proud to consider my \ncolleague as well as my friend.\n  I am pleased that the President has chosen to recognize his service \nand bestow upon such a deserving man as Dan Inouye the Medal of Honor. \nIt is my hope that young people around our country will look to Dan \nInouye and his many traits and accomplishments--Army officer, \nCongressman, Senator--and realize as he does that first and foremost, \nhe is an American. In this regard I would like to quote Major General \nJacob Devers, Chief of the Army Field Offices, ``These men . . . more \nthan earned the right to be called just Americans, not Japanese \nAmericans. Their Americanism may be described only by degree, and that \nthe highest.''\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear \ncolleague, Senator Daniel Inouye. Today, Senator Inouye receives the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for his heroic service to our nation. This \nhonor is richly deserved--and long overdue.\n  Senator Inouye's life is one of service and patriotism. He began his \nservice when he was just seventeen, leaving his home in Honolulu to aid \nwounded civilians on the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As \na Japanese American, he faced bigotry, resentment, and outright \npersecution. Even while facing this discrimination, he withdrew from \nhis medical studies at the University of Hawaii and enlisted in the \nArmy as soon as Japanese Americans were permitted to serve.\n  Stationed in Italy with the war's end nearing, 2nd lieutenant Inouye \nled his men into his final battle. Though he was shot and his platoon \nwas pinned by gunfire, he continued on alone. Bravely he tossed two \nhand grenades before his right arm was shattered by a German rifle \ngrenade. He threw a final grenade with his left arm before another shot \nin the leg forced him to retreat. It is for this tremendous act of \ncourage that Senator Inouye receives this long overdue honor.\n  Senator Inouye is being honored for his courage in battle. We also \nknow that Senator Inouye's service to our country extends far beyond \nhis bravery in war. When Senator Inouye was elected to the United \nStates House of Representatives in 1959, he was the first American of \nJapanese ancestry to serve in the House. Since 1962, Senator Inouye has \nserved with great distinction in the Senate.\n  Every day, we witness first-hand Senator Inouye's commitment to the \npeople of Hawaii and the people of the United States. He is a leader on \nnational security and international human rights. As a senior member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, he works tirelessly to ensure that we \nmeet the day to day needs of our constituents--and the long term needs \nof our nation. Since my earliest days on the Appropriations Committee, \nI've learned from Senator Inouye--particularly in the area of defense \npolicy.\n  Even in a war filled with heroes, Senator Inouye's heroism was \nextraordinary. It is with deep respect and affection that I offer my \nmost sincere congratulations to Senator Inouye for being awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5481-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5481-S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SECTION 527 ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last week the Senate voted to tighten \nregulations on 527 organizations--organizations created to influence \npolitical campaigns in the United States; that section of the Tax Code \nallows them to operate without disclosure of their contributors or \nwithout limitations on their expenditures, and, indeed, on a tax-\ndeductible basis.\n  The vote last week was genuinely historic in the Senate. It was the \nfirst time since 1993 that a campaign finance reform measure passed the \nSenate.\n  I congratulate Senator Lieberman on his leadership in bringing the \nSenate to this important moment of judgment.\n  These ``527 organizations,'' as they have come to be known, are the \nlatest threat to the integrity of our Nation's electoral process, with \nunlimited funds unaccountable from unknown sources.\n  If this legislation does not become law, they threaten to change the \nentire electoral process of the country. Every reform instituted not \nonly since Watergate but, indeed, in this century could be undone.\n  There is no assurance that even those limited protections--from the \nprogressive movement in the times of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow \nWilson that barred unlimited and undisclosed corporate contributions--\nand reforms could remain in place if these 527 organizations are \nallowed to operate and, indeed, to proliferate.\n  The Senate's vote last week sent a very strong message that for \nwhatever we are unable to do on campaign finance reform we can at least \nagree that complete and full disclosure is required and that we will \nnot allow the Tax Code to be misused for the raising of unknown \npolitical funds.\n\n  It is, however, important that the public not accept this limited \nachievement as the sum total of all the Congress can do on campaign \nfinance reform. It is only a beginning. Indeed, it is a modest \nbeginning.\n  It is also true that our efforts on soft money in McCain-Feingold \nhave been frustrated. For a variety of reasons, it is now very clear \nMcCain-Feingold and limitations on soft money contributions are not \ngoing to be enacted in this Congress. Some of the barriers are \npolitical. Some are legislative. Indeed, as my friend, Mitch McConnell, \nhas pointed out, some are very real and constitutional. There are real \nproblems to enacting a complete soft money ban. Federal courts have \nspoken on the subject. There are many who believe their\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nindividuals rights might be limited. That debate will continue for \nyears on the merits.\n  Now the Congress is left with a partial achievement on 527 \norganizations, a frustration on soft money prohibitions. The question \nis whether anything else can be done. Indeed, a great deal more could \nbe done that is both easier to achieve and in some respects more \nimportant.\n  There is primarily a single reason that campaign fundraising is \nrising exponentially in the Nation. It is very simple. Campaign \nexpenditures are rising exponentially in the Nation. It is becoming \nmore and more expensive to communicate with the American people through \nmore and more news outlets. It is the heart of the problem.\n  A recent study has indicated that records are being broken across the \nNation in the cost of political advertising. The study, led by the \nAlliance for Better Campaigns, cited the Senate primary in my own State \nof New Jersey as evidence of how broken the campaign finance system has \nnow become and that the same broadcasters in the news media who are \nleading national efforts for campaign finance reform are a central part \nof the problem.\n  Television stations in New York and Philadelphia during the recent \nNew Jersey Democratic primary took in a record $21 million in \nadvertising. The chart shows the stations in New York and Philadelphia, \nthe four rated stations, the amount of time they actually devoted to \nhard news. We have these stations in New York and Philadelphia bringing \nin $21 million in revenue from political advertising. Yet in actual \nnews coverage of the campaigns per evening--two stations in \nPhiladelphia--one is giving 19 seconds of coverage per evening; \nanother, 1 second; in New York, the two top stations, WNBC and WCBS, 23 \nseconds and 10 seconds, respectively.\n  Advertising rates soar. News coverage collapses. Candidates are left \nwith no choice. There being no other means to communicate with people \nwho live in our States, they must buy more advertising time at ever-\nhigher and higher rates. Indeed, in the final 2 weeks of the New Jersey \nprimary, voters in Philadelphia and New York markets were 10 times more \nlikely while watching a news program to see a campaign advertisement \nthan a news story--10 times more likely to see an advertisement than a \nlegitimate news story on an issue in the campaign.\n  That, my colleagues, is the heart of the problem. However, it is not \nonly a senatorial problem or not only a problem in my own region of the \ncountry. During the month before the March 7, Super Tuesday primary, \nthe national networks aired a nightly average of only 36 seconds \ndiscussing an issue of importance to the national voters. The situation \nthat Democrats and Republicans face in the New Jersey primary is \nidentical to what Al Gore and George W. Bush face in the national \nelections--no news coverage, rising rates, higher expenditures. It is, \nof course, part and parcel of this problem that is driven by the \nindividual rates for specific advertising time.\n\n  An example of this would be, in New York City, a 30-second \nadvertisement can now cost as much as $50,000. In Chicago, the same \nadvertisement could cost $20,000. Television stations in the Nation's \ntop 75 media markets took in a record of $114 million in the first 4 \nmonths of this year in political advertising.\n  There is no other nation in the world where the public airwaves are \nlicensed to a private corporation which will then set commercial rates \nas the cost of discussing public policy issues with the Nation's \nvoters. This wouldn't happen in Britain, Canada, Italy or France. These \nairwaves belong to the American people. The issues, be they Democrat, \nRepublican, or Independent, be they from some other group or political \nparty, are issues of importance to the American people. Yet the \nbroadcasting networks are using them as a revenue source while they \nincredibly claim to be campaigning for campaign finance reform.\n  There is no mistaking that the power to change the campaign finance \nsystem belongs in the Congress. We could lead to a solution. For a \nvariety of political reasons, legislative reasons, and constitutional \nreasons, that is not going to happen. The question now is whether the \ntelevision networks will spend the remainder of this electoral season \ncomplaining about this political problem of reaching a solution or be \npart of the answer. I believe they should lead by example.\n  Only a year ago, Mr. Kennard, the Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, raised the prospect of, by regulation, \nlowering the cost of television advertising. Rather than $50,000 in New \nYork or $20,000 in Chicago, the FCC could mandate, if the networks are \nunwilling to do it voluntarily, a lower cost. Since television accounts \nfor 80 or 90 percent of the cost of the Senate or Presidential \ncampaign, lowering the cost of that advertising would dramatically \nremove pressure on fundraising. The problem could begin to solve \nitself. The FCC chose not to do so under pressure from Members of \nCongress.\n  The question remains, Why do the networks not do so themselves? I \nunderstand the networks looking to the Congress for an answer. They \nshould. They are entitled to look to us, and they are entitled to \nexpect an answer. But I also look back to them. Rather than 20 seconds \na night for candidates to discuss the future of our Nation, rather than \nusing the national airwaves to discuss every latest crime trend or \nweather pattern or cultural abnormality, the national airwaves could be \nused to actually discuss the Nation's future--not 10 seconds a night or \n20 seconds a night but 10 minutes a night or 15 minutes a night so \ncandidates believe there is an alternative to communicating with the \nAmerican people other than buying the public airwaves to do so.\n  Second, the networks, most obviously, could enhance this national \ndebate and reduce the cost of this fundraising, remove the pressure on \nfundraising by dramatically reducing these costs. Political advertising \nis now the third largest source of revenue for the television networks. \nWe have become an industry supporting the networks themselves, only \nbehind retail sellers of merchandise in the Nation, spending hundreds \nof millions of dollars in this Presidential and congressional campaign. \nA reduction of those rates to allow challengers to compete with \nincumbents and lesser-financed candidates to compete with \nmultimillionaires would enhance the American political system and start \nsetting an example of how the Nation can begin to change the dominance \nof money in the American political system.\n  I hope at some point the networks, as good corporate citizens and as \nAmericans, no less as people who claim to be for campaign finance \nreform, would hear this message and join this movement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SUPPORT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR SERBIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and an \n     indicted war criminal, visited Moscow from May 7 through May \n     12, 2000, as a guest of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation, attended the inauguration of President Vladimir \n     Putin, and held talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor \n     Sergeyev and Army Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin;\n       (2) General Ojdanic was military Chief of Staff of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war and has \n     been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against humanity and \n     violations of the laws and customs of war for alleged \n     atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo;\n       (3) international warrants have been issued by the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for \n     General Ojdanic's arrest and extradition to the Hague;\n       (4) the Government of the Russian Federation, a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council which \n     established the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia, has an obligation to arrest General \n     Ojdanic and extradite him to the Hague;\n       (5) on May 16, 2000, Russian Minister of Economics Andrei \n     Shapovalyants announced that his government has provided the \n     Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic $102,000,000 of a \n     $150,000,000 loan it had reactivated and will sell the \n     Government of Serbia $32,000,000 of oil despite the fact that \n     the international community has imposed economic sanctions \n     against the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     and the Government of Serbia;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation is providing \n     the Milosevic regime such assistance while it is seeking debt \n     relief from the international community and loans from the \n     International Monetary Fund, and while it is receiving corn \n     and grain as food aid from the United States;\n       (7) the hospitality provided to General Ojdanic \n     demonstrates that the Government of the Russian Federation \n     rejects the indictments brought by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia against him and other \n     officials, including Slobodan Milosevic, for alleged \n     atrocities committed during the Kosovo war; and\n       (8) the relationship between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Governments of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia and Serbia only encourages the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic to foment instability in the Balkans and thereby \n     jeopardizes the safety and security of American military and \n     civilian personnel and raises questions about Russia's \n     commitment to its responsibilities as a member of the North \n     American Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping mission in \n     Kosovo.\n       (b) Actions.--\n       (1) Fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing all \n     loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government \n     of the Russian Federation or entities acting on its behalf \n     has provided since June 1999, and intends to provide to the \n     Government of Serbia or the Government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or any entities under the control of \n     the Governments of Serbia or the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (2) If that report determines that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation or other entities acting on its behalf has \n     provided or intends to provide the governments of Serbia or \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any entity under their \n     control any loans or economic assistance and oil sales, then \n     the following shall apply:\n       (A) The Secretary of State shall reduce assistance \n     obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in \n     value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales \n     the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and \n     intends to provide to the Governments of Serbia and the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors of the international \n     financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any \n     extension by those institutions of any financial assistance \n     (including any technical assistance or grant) of any kind to \n     the Government of the Russian Federation except for loans and \n     assistance that serve basic human needs.\n       (ii) In this subparagraph, the term ``international \n     financial institution'' includes the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral \n     Investment Guaranty Agency, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n       (C) The United States shall suspend existing programs to \n     the Russia Federation provided by the Export-Import Bank and \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and any \n     consideration of any new loans, guarantees, and other forms \n     of assistance by the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation to Russia.\n       (D) The President of the United States should instruct his \n     representatives to negotiations on Russia's international \n     debt to oppose further forgiveness, restructuring, and \n     rescheduling of that debt, including that being considered \n     under the ``Comprehensive'' Paris Club negotiations.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the hopes that it \nwill bring about needed realism in our Government's relationship with \nRussia. President Clinton continues to promote the myth that the \nRussian Government has been ``a supportive and reliable partner in the \neffort to bring peace and stability to the Balkans.''\n  That myth was shattered again last month by the Kremlin's brazen \ndisplay of the enormous political, military, and economic support \nRussia continues to provide the Milosevic regime. Surely no Senator has \nforgotten the visit to Moscow last month by General Ojdanic, \nMilosevic's Minister of Defense, who just happens to be a war criminal \nindicted by the International Criminal Tribunal of the former \nYugoslavia. Instead of arresting and sending this man to The Hague, the \nKremlin provided not only meetings with the Russian Minister of Defense \nbut a privileged seat at the Putin inauguration and a week of fine food \nand camaraderie.\n  Shortly after Milosevic's Minister of Defense visited Russia, Russian \nofficials announced that it is sending to the Milosevic regime $102 \nmillion of a $150 million loan. All of this flies in the face of the \neffort of the international community to isolate and undermine the \nMilosevic regime.\n  I confess that I find incredible the audacity of Russian President \nPutin. Here he is, providing the Milosevic regime with more than $150 \nmillion in economic support while seeking debt relief from the \ninternational community and loans from the International Monetary Fund. \nHe is doing this while his country seeks and receives food aid from the \nUnited States and while he is asking the United States to reschedule \nand forgive Russian debt owed to the United States.\n  The Kremlin should not be encouraged to assume that Western, and \nparticularly the United States, economic assistance and aid are an \nentitlement. It is, however, sadly evident that Putin has concluded \nthat he can conduct Russian foreign policy with impunity and still \ncount on the West's economic largesse. The fact is, the hospitality and \nsupport provided to Serbian war criminals occurred just one month prior \nto President Clinton's visit to Moscow, emphasizing how little respect \nPutin has for the policies of the U.S. Government.\n  What concerns me most about the relationship of the Kremlin and the \nMilosevic regime is the threat it poses to America's men and women in \nuniform serving in the Balkans, along with those of our allies. The \npolitical, military, and economic support the Kremlin provides \nMilosevic directly jeopardizes the safety and security of both American \nand allied forces deployed in the Balkans. While we are trying to force \nthe Milosevic regime to step down and turn power over to Serbia's \ndemocratic opposition, Russia is signaling Milosevic that he can \nsurvive and even outlast the alliance and that Russia will help him, \nMilosevic, prevail.\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\n  There is no reason the American taxpayer should provide Russia loan \nforgiveness and economic assistance when the Kremlin continues to \nsupport a regime in Serbia whose forces directly threaten U.S. troops \nwho are trying to bring peace to the Balkans.\n  My amendment, which I have just offered, simply underscores that the \nU.S. assistance is not an entitlement benefiting the Kremlin. The \namendment proposes that the United States withhold assistance to Russia \nby an amount equal to the amount which Russia provides Serbia. The \namendment also will preclude any debt forgiveness or rescheduling of \nOPIC and Eximbank programs along with U.S. support for loans from \ninternational financial institutions to Russia. This assistance \ncertainly is not warranted unless and until the Kremlin demonstrates \nthat it has at long last cut its ties to the Milosevic regime.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3499 Through 3513, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3499 through 3513), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3507\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past two years, the \nSubcommittee has held hearings which have focused on corruption, fraud \nand financial management problems at the international financial \ninstitutions. The interest was stimulated in part by flagrant abuses \nwhich compromised the World Bank's program in Indonesia. The Bank's \nCountry Director ignored internal reports detailing program kickbacks, \nskimming and fraud because he was unwilling to upset the Suharto family \nand their cronies whom he believed were responsible for Indonesia's \neconomic boom. A change of government and country directors presented \nan opportunity to set a new course for management and lending policies.\n  Because of these problems, I asked GAO to conduct a review of the \nBank's management with an emphasis on anti-corruption policies and \nprograms in several of the largest borrowing countries, including \nIndonesia, Russia, and Brazil. While the Bank limited GAO's access to \ndocuments, and set up a special committee to supervise their work, they \nstill did an excellent job.\n  In brief, the GAO concluded the Bank has launched an ambitious effort \nto identify problems, but significant challenges lie ahead. We are a \nlong way from real solutions.\n  Let me tick off some of the conclusions which concerned me the most--\n  First, although the World Bank has established an Investigations Unit \nwhich answers to a new Fraud and Oversight Committee, many local \nproblems in borrowing countries never reach the investigators. In one \ncountry where the Bank itself identified corruption as a serious \nproblem, 30 allegations of abuse reported to their local officials had \nnot been referred on to the Investigations Unit or Committee.\n  Second, both the Investigations Unit and the Committee answer to one \nof the Bank's Managing Directors. GAO concluded that the independence \nof investigations could be compromised by the fact that a Managing \nDirector controls the unit's budgets and makes final decisions on \nwhether an investigation is pursued, including those that may involve \nemployees who answer to the Director.\n  Third, new initiatives introduced in 1998 to improve financial and \nprocurement procedures only apply to 14% of the Banks 1,500 projects. \nIn recent audits, 17 of 25 borrowers showed a lack of understanding or \nnoncompliance with procurement rules. GAO's review of 12 randomly \nselected projects identified 5 projects where the borrowing countries \nimplementing agencies had little or no experience managing projects.\n  Fourth, when making project recommendations for Board approval, the \nstaff's risk analysis fails to adequately address corruption or undue \npolitical influence as key factors. Eight of Twelve projects reviewed \ndid not identify corruption or political manipulation as a critical \nrisk even though other Bank reports indicated both were serious issues \nin the countries included in the project sampling.\n  Finally, GAO determined that solving problems is made more difficult \nbecause audits are often late and of poor quality, and the Bank does \nnot evaluate the quality of audits.\n  To remedy these problems, GAO recommends the Bank integrate the \ninvestigative function and establish its organizational independence, \ninclude more complete corruption data in risk assessments and country \nstrategies, develop a system for allocating anti-corruption assistance, \nimprove borrowing countries' capabilities to monitor, implement and \nsupervise fraud free projects, and improve auditing and project \nsupervision.\n  These problems are not unique to the World Bank. We have all read the \nstories about the IMF being caught by surprise in both Russia and \nUkraine regarding manipulation of loans and loan data. I am sure there \nare similar problems in the regional institutions as well.\n  To accelerate a solution to these pressing issues, Senator Leahy and \nI felt it was prudent for the Secretary of the Treasury to encourage \nthese institutions to implement GAO's recommendations. The amendment \nbefore the Senate requires the Secretary to withhold 10% of our \ncontribution to each institution until audits are in place, independent \ninvestigation units are established, and the problem of corruption is \nbeing addressed in risk assessments. We also expect the institutions to \nstrengthen local government capacity so that lending and projects are \nbetter supervised to prevent corruption.\n  This amendment addresses one of the most fundamental issues which has \ncompromised support for the multilateral banks. Bringing more \ntransparency to lending and improving procurement and management \nprocedures will help restore confidence and support to the banks.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3511\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I support the Baucus-Roberts amendment to engage china \non the important issue of rapid industrialization and the environment. \nThe amendment would permit appropriated funds for the US-Asia \nEnvironmental Partnership (USAEP)--an initiative of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID)--to be used for environmental \nprojects in the People's Republic of China (PRC). In other words, the \nU.S. government would finally be able to, for example, help U.S. \nbusinesses connect with provincial and municipal governments in China \nto initiate badly needed environmental engineering projects. This work \nis necessary to attempt to prevent a possible long-term environmental \ncatastrophe resulting from intense industrialization and development in \nthe PRC and Asia in general.\n  Why should one care whether Chinese or Asian people breath clean air \nor\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\ndrink clean water? Besides the obvious humanitarian concern, a ruined \nenvironment throughout Asia will--at some point--affect us here in the \nUnited States and our interests. This is common sense.\n  The Baucus-Roberts amendment also sends a strong pro-engagement \nmessage to the PRC since the U.S. excluded de jure or de facto the PRC \nfrom U.S. foreign aid programs with passage and signing of the FY 90-FY \n91 State Department Authorization, specifically section 902 of H.R. \n3792.\n  Our government purports to be concerned about global environmental \nissues, Mr. President, about avoiding contamination of the world's \nwater, air, and soil. Yet, we prohibit ourselves from consulting and \ncooperating on a government to government basis with the one nation \nwith the greatest potential to impact the world's environment over the \nnext 50 to 100 years. That makes no sense.\n  What is the United States-Asian Environmental Partnership? It is a \npublic-private initiative implemented by the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID). Its aim is to encourage \nenvironmentally sustainable development in Asia as that region \nindustrializes at a phenomenal rate. By ``environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment,'' we mean industrial and urban development that does not \nirreparably damage the air, water, and soil necessary for life. It's \nreally that simple. US-AEP currently works with governments and \nindustries in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, \nPhilippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. In \ncreating US-AEP, the U.S. government recognized the long-term \nenvironmental hazards of Asia's rapid industrialization and the need \nfor the U.S. government to engage on the issue.\n  The program provides grants to U.S. companies for the purpose of \nfacilitating the transfer of environmentally sound and energy-efficient \ntechnologies to the Asia/Pacific region. Again, the objective is to \naddress the pollution and health challenges of rapid industrialization \nwhile stimulating demand for U.S. technologies. In cooperation with the \nU.S. Department of Commerce, US-AEP has placed Environmental Technology \nRepresentatives in 11 Asian countries to identify trade opportunities \nfor U.S. companies and coordinate meetings between potential Asian and \nU.S. business partners.\n  Mr. President, on the basic issue of the global environmental impact \nof Asian industrialization, specifically Chinese modernization, the \nSenate has the responsibility to authorize at least some cooperation \nbetween Beijing and Washington. I ask for my colleagues support for \nthis common sense amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3512\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the United \nStates to provide non military education and anti corruption assistance \nto countries, and their governments, that are not on the terrorism \nlist, and that are denied U.S. assistance or are under U.S. sanctions. \nLet me just reiterate that this amendment is not applicable to \ncountries on the terrorism list or which are major producers or \ntraffickers in illegal drugs.\n  This provision is specifically intended to enable the U.S. Government \nto conduct a broad range of rule of law programs, as well as other \nprograms (e.g. setting up elementary schools, high school exchanges, \nhealth education, economic reform measures; tax reform, tariff \nregulation, developing rational and transparent budgeting procedures, \nprivatization, or drafting a commercial code, etc.), so long as there \nis some component of the program that includes educating or providing \ninformation to persons.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been working for a long time to \ntry to find ways to help the most vulnerable populations around the \nworld. Allowing the United States to continue to provide assistance in \neducation and anti corruption training is something which ultimately is \nin our own interests.\n  In many parts of the world, we are up against elements like the \nWahhabis, the Saudis, the Iranians and the likes of Bin Laden and \nothers, who are pouring money into the poorest regions of the world to \nset up schools which are dedicated to teaching children anti-Western \nattitudes, as well as how to carry weapons.\n  In many countries, because of the dire poverty, such schools are the \nonly game in town. And the single common element which allows these \nschools to flourish is poverty and ignorance. There is no other option \nfor many people. The poverty and the lack of education leads to \nradicalism, and violence, often directed first against women, and a \nhost of problems which every one on this floor can list.\n  The growth of this radicalism comes back and haunts us and affect \nAmerican lives and American security. The popularity of Bin Laden for \nexample, and the anti-Western fervor which is rampant in the Middle \nEast and South Asia can too often lead to terrorism and attempts to \ndestabilize developing countries that are trying to remain secular and \npro-west. Ultimately, this is a threat to U.S. security.\n  This lack of education also leads to tragic global phenomena like the \ntrafficking in women and children: Education would substantially \nincrease awareness regarding the insidious practice of international \nsex slavery. This involves forcing women and children into prostitution \nagainst their will, who are held in slavery-like conditions, having \nbeen transported into a strange country.\n  There is a general sentiment in the Congress these days that \nsanctions have gone too far, that they don't work and that we should \nremove all of them. I do not share this view, I believe sanctions have \na role to play and are appropriate in certain situations. But denying \nourselves the opportunity to provide education in a variety of fields \nin certain parts of the world is counterproductive. We are only hurting \nourselves.\n  Instead of being able to implement education programs which would \nhelp bring a secular alternative to the lack of education, or the types \nof schools I mentioned earlier, we find our hands are tied when \nassistance is denied to a country or when general sanctions are imposed \non a country--including sanctions on countries that for one reason or \nanother default on their loans. Yes, we should be able to take \npolitical action against countries that are doing bad things; but we \nshould not be put in a situation where programs in education or in anti \ncorruption training is involved. We shouldn't be mandating sanctions in \nan area, like education, which are of long term assistance to the \nUnited States.\n  We sit and complain about such things as corruption or lack of \nenvironmental awareness, or lack of democracy, or child labor, or \ntrafficking in women and children. Education could help make a dent in \nsuch things, from helping to set up elementary schools, having \nexchanges at higher school levels, to such things as providing \ninformation to people in such areas as economic reform, equitable \ndistribution of wealth, growing their economies, implementation of tax \nreform and tariff regulation, development of rational and transparent \nbudgeting procedures, development of rule of law and democratic \ninstitutions, and privatizing or drafting a commercial code.\n  And yet we occasionally find ourselves in the position of having to \ndeny assistance in the very area which would help fix these problems.\n  That is why I am introducing this amendment today. Denying U.S. \nassistance to a country is a right we should preserve, but we shouldn't \nbe cutting our ability to influence countries at such a basic level as \neducation and we certainly should do what we can to combat anti-\ncorruption.\n  The most effective way to overcome the anti democratic threats and \nthe lure of terrorism is to go to the root of the problem and to \nencourage the development of civil society.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized to offer an amendment relative to Colombia.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I got a last-minute call from the \nBudget Committee, and we may have to work this amendment out. I will \nwait about 5 minutes before I offer the amendment. I am waiting for \nsome last-minute wording.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the situation \nnow? Is there an amendment pending? Are we open for general debate on \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina sent up an \namendment by unanimous consent, and the regular order is to recognize \nthe Senator from Minnesota to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to use leader time at this \npoint to speak with regard to the Wellstone amendment, which I \nunderstand he will be offering momentarily.\n  I rise to speak against the Wellstone amendment that I understand \nwill be offered. What this amendment would do would be to knock out the \nfunds that are included in the foreign operations appropriations bill \nfor Colombian aid. Is that correct about the intent of the amendment by \nthe Senator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, no, it is not. This amendment leaves \nseveral hundred million dollars out of the $900 million that would go \nto the southern Colombia military campaign. I will talk about the \nmilitary and the right-wing violence groups and go through State \nDepartment reports and human rights reports about this. But in no way, \nshape, or form does this amendment say that.\n  Mr. LOTT. You would move a significant portion of the funds in excess \nof $900 million into another category to be used for exactly what? Will \nthe Senator describe that to me?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to. We are working on this final wording \nbecause we are trying to figure whether to do this out of emergency \ndesignation or whether we can do this in a different way.\n  What this amendment says is that we absolutely are committed to \ninstitutional building in Colombia; we are committed to helping out in \nevery way, shape, or form, including interdiction and police action.\n  There are very serious concerns that have been raised by a whole \nrange of religious groups. I have a list of hundreds of nongovernment \norganizations in Colombia, but a particular portion, $225 million, \nwould go to this one military campaign in southern Colombia. This money \ninstead would say--and this follows up on what General McCaffrey and \nothers have said, which is that we also need to deal not just with \ninterdiction but also the demand side in this country.\n  I say to the majority leader, I am going to be presenting compelling \nevidence about the huge gap in the number of people who are not getting \nany treatment. We have to figure out a way to cut down on the demand \nside in our country so we will provide money for prevention and \ntreatment programs in this country.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his explanation.\n  At this time, rather than just speaking against his amendment, I will \nspeak for what is in the foreign operations appropriations bill for the \nColombia aid package. As a matter of fact, the Senate version has over \n$900 million in this area. The House bill actually included around $1.7 \nbillion because the House included not only funds for the drug war in \nColombia--I believe they also provided more than what had been asked \nfor by the administration--they also provided some aid for other \ncountries in the area that are also having some difficulty in fighting \nthe drug situation in that part of the world.\n  Let me emphasize that we have been very much involved, obviously, in \nbeing supportive of bringing about a peaceful solution in Kosovo. It \nhas been, of course, debated what should be done there, if we should do \nwhat we have done there, and how much should be spent there. The \nadministration has pursued the policy there and the Congress has gone \nalong with it, for better or for worse, at a cost of billions of \ndollars.\n  I point out on this map the area we are talking about. Kosovo is in \nthis area of the world. It is very important to Europe and to our \nallies in Europe. I have suggested to our allies--NATO, Germany, \nBritain and other countries--they should assume more of the \nresponsibility there, not less. I have been very concerned they have \nnot met their responsibilities. Until just very recently, they seemed \nto be doing a better job of providing the money and the people they \ncommitted.\n  My point is while this is important, it is not nearly as close and as \ndirectly involved in the U.S. national security as the situation in \nColombia. This map depicts Colombia. This whole region is experiencing \nsome transition now. Since we have turned over the Panama Canal and \nclosed our bases there, we see evidence that already there has been an \nincrease of drug trafficking through Panama. We are concerned about the \nnarcotraffickers in Colombia; we are concerned about what is happening \nin Venezuela, and this whole region of the world. It is in our \nneighborhood.\n  For years, to our own detriment, in my opinion, we have not been as \ninvolved with Central America and South America as we should have been. \nNow we see democracy and economic opportunity beginning to make \nprogress in Central America, in the Caribbean, and democracy at least \nblossoming in parts of South America, but we see a threat, and it is \nbeing driven by drugs.\n  In addition to being in our hemisphere and in close proximity, we are \ntalking about activities by people who are undermining the Colombian \nGovernment, who are killing people, and who are killing our children. \nThe drugs that come out of Colombia are coming right into the United \nStates--cocaine and heroin. They are poisoning our children.\n  I take this not very well. I am very concerned about it. I think we \nignore it to our own peril. Should we do more in our country to deal \nwith the demand problem, education, and treatment? Sure. We ought to \nfind ways to do that. But we shouldn't do it by taking away from the \nefforts that are underway in Colombia.\n  That is why I call this a close national security interest for our \nown country. There are those who are worried if we do this, we are \nslipping toward being involved. Where better to be involved than to try \nto take action and provide support for people who are trying to move \ntoward greater democracy and greater economic development and to \ncontrol and stop the drug trafficking and the drug pushers in that part \nof the world? I think we should do this. I think we should have been \ndoing more a year ago or 2 years ago. I worked in the Senate with \nSenators Coverdell, DeWine, and others in communication with our own \ndrug czar in America that we were not doing enough in Colombia.\n\n  Finally, the administration has said, well, we need to do something \nmore; we need to be involved. I commend them for that. We need to get \nit done. That is why we pulled this foreign operations appropriations \nbill up as early as possible. We think we should get this foreign \noperations bill done and we should get the Colombian aid package \nincluded. This is very important for us.\n  President Pastrana of Colombia has asked for our help--not to solve \nthe problem for him. We are not advocating U.S. troops go in or that we \nhave direct involvement in their efforts there but to help him without \nAmerican troops. Give them the aid they need; give them the equipment \nthey need to fight these massive narcotic drug cartels in Colombia and \nthat part of the world.\n  President Clinton's plan is multifaceted: Economic, political, \nsocial, and military means to gain the upper hand in dealing with the \nnarcoterrorists who control vast amounts of Colombian territory. That \nis an area where I have some concern. I think too much territory has \nbeen conceded to these narcoterrorists.\n  Make no mistake, the FARC and the ELN guerrillas are ruthless. They \ndon't know anything or care anything about human rights. They only want \npower to turn Colombia into the first nation controlled by \nnarcoterrorists. Think about that. That is a real possibility unless we \nact to get assistance there as soon as possible.\n  Will this aid package alone solve the problem overnight? No. I \nemphasize again we should have been doing more last year and the year \nbefore and over a period of years. But it will make a significant \ncontribution by giving to\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nthe Colombian Government the wherewithal to challenge these \nnarcoterrorists.\n  We know one thing for certain: Without this package, these \nnarcoterrorists will be emboldened and they will have no incentive to \ncome to the peace table. The freely elected pro U.S. government of \nPresident Pastrana will be dealt a very serious blow. We cannot leave \nthem unassisted when they have asked for our help.\n  This is a question of standing up for our children, of standing up \nand fighting these narcoterrorists in our part of the world, in our \nneighborhood, in our region. Colombia has a chance. They are tired of \nthe bloodshed. They are tired of kidnappings. They are tired of human \nrights abuses on all sides. I don't for a minute mean to push aside the \ncomplaints about some of the human rights violations on the other side, \nbut that shouldn't be a reason not to act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, support the foreign \noperations bill as it is, with the Colombian aid. As a matter of fact, \nI think it is possible the aid may actually be increased somewhat in \nconference. We should not let this be pecked apart. We should step up \nto our responsibility and fulfill our commitment to Colombia, to \nPresident Pastrana for his efforts, but particularly for the children \nof our country.\n  Do not support amendments that will take away funds in this package \nand move them over into other areas. It is the minimum that we should \ndo.\n  I thank Senator Wellstone for allowing me to go forward at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I \nappreciate his comments and I did not want to interrupt him while he \nwas speaking.\n  I will, in as thoughtful a way as possible, respond to some of his \ncomments. I don't think there is any question that we need to deal with \nnarcoterrorists. I don't really believe that is the issue. I will take \ntime to develop this.\n  My colleague from New York wanted to speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow \nthe Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, more than 80 percent of the cocaine, and most of the \nheroin flooding America's streets comes from Colombia. That is just one \nof many reasons why helping honest Colombians is an urgent and absolute \nnecessity.\n  Today, Colombia's democratically elected government is besieged by \nblood-thirsty communist guerrillas who have gone into business with \nnarcotraffickers, and, Mr. President, without U.S. help, Colombia may \nvery well lose its fight with these narcoterrorists--and that is why \nthe United States must move swiftly to help President Andres Pastrana \nsave the second oldest democracy in the Americas.\n  I support doing whatever it takes to save Colombia--not only because \nof the enormous cost of drugs to our country but because the United \nStates of America should stand with a decent, democratic government in \nour own hemisphere that is threatened by Marxist terrorist groups.\n  I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, \nand the able Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, for including in the \nforeign operations bill the emergency anti-drug assistance for Colombia \nand surrounding countries.\n  This bill deserves our support even though I expect that the House-\nSenate conference will choose to make some adjustments.\n  For example, we must resist unrealistic conditions that will block \nthe delivery of badly needed support. Also, I am persuaded that we must \nsupply the Colombian Army with Blackhawk helicopters so they have the \nmobility to respond to the hit-and-run tactics of the guerrillas who \nare part of the drug trade.\n  The stakes are enormously high. Colombia is one of the most important \nU.S. trading partners in the Americas, with $4.5 billion in direct U.S. \ninvestment in sectors--not counting the key petroleum sector. Also, the \nguerrillas have expressly targeted American businesses and citizens in \nColombia for bombings, kidnapings, and murders.\n  Further, the threat to regional stability is acute: Venezuela, Peru, \nand Ecuador all have massed troops on their borders with Colombia. \nPanama, which has no army, is helpless to secure its frontier from \nsmugglers of drugs and weapons.\n  President Pastrana doesn't ask us to do his fighting for him. In \nfact, no man alive has taken more risks for peace. If anything, he \nmight be criticized for making too many concessions to bring the \nguerrillas to the peace table.\n  The guerrillas have responded by launching murderous attacks on \ncivilian targets. While President Pastrana is going the extra mile for \npeace, the guerrillas have launched a recruitment drive--bent on \ntearing Colombia apart.\n  These guerrillas are criminals and terrorists who thrive on drug \ntrafficking, kidnaping, and extortion. They are playing an ever-\nincreasing role in the drug trade, which earns them a blank check from \nthe narcotraffickers who realize that chaos is good for their dirty \nenterprise.\n  These 20,000 guerrillas move about the country virtually unchallenged \nwhile most of Colombia's army is pinned down protecting bridges, oil \npipelines, and power stations from terrorist attacks. That leaves only \n40,000 soldiers, with a mere 30 helicopters, to take on the guerrillas \nin a rugged, mountainous country almost twice the size of Texas.\n  What can the United States do to help?\n  We can approve emergency anti-drug aid to Colombia and to her \nneighbors, thereby giving them a fighting chance to stem the tide of \nlawlessness and cocaine that threatens the entire Andean region.\n  U.S. support will bolster the Colombian army's counter-drug \nbattalions, providing continued U.S. military training, better \nintelligence and communications, and increased mobility in he form of \ntransport helicopters. We will also provide support to eradicate \nillegal crops and create alternative employment for displaced farmers.\n  Current U.S. law requires that any military units receiving U.S. aid \nmust be ``scrubbed'' for human rights violations. That is as it should \nbe. But we should not hold U.S. support hostage to unrealistic \npreconditions.\n  If America fails to act, Colombia will continue to hurdle toward \nchaos. If the war drags on--or if desperate Colombians lose their \nstruggle or are forced to appease the narco-guerrillas--the United \nStates and the rest of the hemisphere will pay a very dear price.\n  The longer we delay, the higher that price will be.\n  I urge Senators to support emergency anti-drug support for Colombia--\nand to do so without delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Without objection, \nthe Senator's time will be charged under the previous order against his \ntime on the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are working on the final version of \nthe amendment, but I will outline for colleagues what this amendment is \nabout. I will send the amendment to the desk in a short while.\n  This amendment would essentially transfer $225 million--as I said to \nthe majority leader, this is by no means an amendment that says we \ndon't supply assistance to Colombia--from the Colombian military for \npurposes of the push into southern Colombia to the domestic drug \ntreatment programs.\n  Specifically, this amendment would transfer funds to the substance \nabuse prevention and treatment block grant program to provide--I will \nmarshal evidence to colleagues--desperately needed funds for State and \nlocal community-based programs and for drug treatment programs within a \nvariety of different facilities, such as correctional facilities and \nother facilities in the country.\n  By the way, part of the argument that I present today is that we deal \nwith this drug problem for sure, but there is a considerable amount of \nevidence that we don't want to all of a sudden militarize this whole \npackage, especially with the record of the military in Colombia.\n  Moreover, we want to deal with the demand side in our country. By the \nway, I am sure the vast majority of people in the United States of \nAmerica agree.\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\n  This amendment leaves substantial assistance for the Colombian \nGovernment and civil society, including all sorts of alternative \ndevelopment programs such as judicial reform and human rights programs.\n  I want to make this clear, given some of the comments of the majority \nleader. It also leaves extensive funding for interdiction, \ninvestigating, and prosecuting drug trafficking and money laundering, \nand for the counternarcotics effort of the Colombian national police, \nas well as for other counternarcotics programs in other Latin American \ncountries. It doesn't cut 1 cent from any of that.\n  I want colleagues to know what they are voting on. It simply removes \nand transfers to more effective domestic use the resources in this \nparticular bill destined for the Colombian Army's push into southern \nColombia.\n  Since 1989, virtually all U.S. assistance to Colombia has officially \nbeen intended to fight illicit drug production and trafficking. The \nmajority leader comes to the floor and speaks as if we have not been \nmaking this effort. But what is sold as a war on drugs to the Congress \nand the American public is far more complex. This is where I dissent \nfrom the majority leader. This is much more complex than just a war \ndealing with drug production and trafficking.\n  Colombia today is embroiled in the hemisphere's largest and longest \ncivil war with the military increasingly linked to paramilitary death \nsquads.\n  The majority leader says this is just a matter of whether or not we \nare serious about the war on drugs. That is not what this amendment \ndeals with. I am serious about the war on drugs. I am serious about \ninterdiction. I am serious about getting the assistance to Colombia for \nthat. But when the majority leader says: I am concerned about human \nrights, he then quickly brushes this aside.\n  We need to understand that there is a civil war in Colombia. There is \na military link to paramilitary death squads with massive corruption \nand widespread human rights atrocities. The rebel insurgency has also \nexpanded throughout large sections of the country, and innocent \ncivilians have been killed by these rebels as well. Colombia now has \nthe third largest internally displaced population in the world.\n  Before I go any further, since we are now by a 7-to-1 ratio going to \nchange our assistance from police to military--that is what worries me \nwith American advisers--let me talk about the military.\n  Let me, first of all, quote from the 1999 country reports on human \nrights practices released by the U.S. Department of State, February 25, \n2000.\n\n       Paramilitary groups and guerrillas attack at increasing \n     levels unarmed civilians expected of loyalty to an opposing \n     party in the country.\n       Government forces continue to commit numerous serious \n     abuses, including extrajudicial killings, at a level that was \n     roughly similar to that of 1998. Despite some prosecutions \n     and convictions, the authorities rarely brought officers of \n     the security forces and the police charged with human rights \n     offenses to justice, and impunity remains a problem. At \n     times, the security forces collaborated with paramilitary \n     groups that committed abuses.\n       Paramilitary groups and guerrillas were responsible for the \n     vast majority of political and extrajudicial killings during \n     the year. Throughout the country, paramilitary groups killed, \n     tortured, and threatened civilians suspected of sympathizing \n     with guerrillas with an orchestrated campaign of terrorizing \n     them into fleeing their homes thereby depriving guerrillas of \n     civilian support.\n\n  This report goes on. It basically says you have the military directly \nlinked to these paramilitary groups which have committed widespread \nabuses of human rights and which have murdered innocent civilians.\n  I am all for interdiction. But I have to raise some questions about \nwhat we are doing all of a sudden in this package by dramatically \nchanging the ratio of our support and giving much more to the military \nlinked to these death squads. I don't think that is what our country is \nabout.\n  Moreover, I don't believe the militarization of this package will \nwork. I will get to that in a moment.\n  The majority leader says he is concerned about human rights. He said \nit in a word or two. But I would like to spend a little bit more time \non this.\n  ``Human Rights Watch World Report 2000,'' in Colombia,\n\n       Paramilitary groups working in some areas with the \n     tolerance and open support of the armed forces continue to \n     massacre civilians, commit selected killings and special \n     terror.\n\n  Democratic Senators and Republican Senators, now we are going to give \nthis military, given this record, a massive infusion of money for a \ncampaign in southern Colombia with American advisers with them.\n  Let me quote again from the ``Human Rights Watch World Report 2000.'' \nThat is this year.\n\n       Paramilitary groups working in some areas with the \n     tolerance and open support of the armed forces continue to \n     massacre civilians, commit selected killings and special \n     terror.\n\n  I argue that we should take this seriously.\n  Amnesty International, May 3, 2000:\n\n       Jesus Ramiro Zapata, human rights defender, was abducted \n     and killed in Segovia, department of Antioquia. Several days \n     earlier he reported that members of paramilitary groups had \n     inquired into his whereabouts eight times in the latter part \n     of April. On the 3rd of April, 500 paramilitaries reportedly \n     entered the municipalities of Segovia and Remedios, setting \n     up camp in Otu. The large number of Colombian National Army \n     4th Brigade troops stationed in the area did nothing to \n     confront the illegal paramilitary group.\n\n  That is a report from Amnesty International.\n  I could go on.\n  The armed forces, the military that we are now going to provide money \nto with American advisers watching and standing by idly as paramilitary \ngroups violate human rights, abduct innocent people and murder them, \nand we are going to be providing all of this support for this military?\n  Colleagues, if there had been some evidence over the last couple of \nyears that there has been a change, that would be a different story.\n  This is a letter from a number of different religious organizations \nin the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of these documents be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Legal Action Center, National Association of Alcoholism \n           and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC), National Council on \n           Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD), Partnership for \n           Recovery, State Associations of Addiction Services \n           (SAAS),\n                                                     May 18, 2000.\n\n       Support the Wellstone Amendment to the Foreign Operations \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n       Dear Senators: We are writing in support of Senator \n     Wellstone's Amendment to the Foreign Operations \n     appropriations bill to transfer $225 million from the section \n     of the bill funding military operations in Southern Colombia \n     to drug and alcohol treatment and prevention programs funded \n     by the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block \n     grant. We feel this amendment leaves intact critical \n     assistance for democracy stabilization and drug interdiction \n     efforts in Colombia, while also supporting the vastly \n     underfunded drug and alcohol treatment and prevention \n     programs here in the United States.\n       Public funding for treatment primarily serves low income \n     and indigent people who are seeking treatment in order to \n     reclaim their lives. When looking at drug and alcohol \n     addiction, we find that in addition to being a disease \n     itself, it is a critical risk factor for health problems such \n     as the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases as well as \n     social problems such as crime and domestic violence.\n       Additionally, treatment and prevention systems have faced \n     increased pressure from entitlement reforms, specifically \n     welfare and SSI program reforms that decrease system capacity \n     while increasing the need for public treatment and prevention \n     services. Successful criminal justice programs involving (and \n     often mandating) treatment, including drug courts, have \n     proliferated and are steadily increasing the demand for \n     treatment.\n       We feel that a balanced approach to the drug control effort \n     is necessary, yet prevention and treatment programs have not \n     received adequate funding to keep up with demand. The \n     Wellstone amendment adds necessary prevention and treatment \n     funds to domestic programs that will save lives and taxpayer \n     dollars.\n       On behalf of the 18 million Americans who chronically use \n     drugs or alcohol and the 8.3 million children whose parent(s) \n     abuse drugs or alcohol, we ask that you support drug and \n     alcohol prevention and treatment programs by supporting the \n     Wellstone amendment.\n       We thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom McDaniels,\n       Director of National Policy, Legal Action Center.\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\n     William D.

Citizens elected President Andres \n     Pastrana of the Conservative Party and a bicameral \n     legislature controlled by the Liberal Party in generally \n     free, fair, and transparent elections in 1998, despite \n     attempts at intimidation and fraud by paramilitary groups, \n     guerrillas, and narcotics traffickers. The civilian judiciary \n     is largely independent of government influence, although the \n     suborning or intimidation of judges, witnesses, and \n     prosecutors by those indicated is common.\n       The Government continued to face a serious challenge to its \n     control over the national territory, as longstanding and \n     widespread internal armed conflict and rampant violence--both \n     political and criminal--persisted. The principal participants \n     were government security forces, paramilitary groups, \n     guerrillas, and narcotics traffickers. In some areas \n     government forces were engaged in combat with guerrillas or \n     narcotics traffickers, while in others paramilitary groups \n     fought guerrillas, and in still others guerrillas attacked \n     demobilized members of rival guerrilla factions. Paramilitary \n     groups and guerrillas attacked at increasing levels unarmed \n     civilians suspected of loyalty to an opposing party in the \n     conflict. The two major guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary \n     Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation \n     Army (ELN), consist of an estimated 11,000 to 17,000 full-\n     time combatants organized into more than 100 semiautonomous \n     groups. The FARC and the ELN, along with other smaller \n     groups, exercised a significant degree of influence and \n     initiated armed action in nearly 1,000 of the country's 1,085 \n     municipalities during the year, compared with 700 \n     municipalities in 1998. The major guerrilla organizations \n     received a significant part of their revenues (in the \n     hundreds of millions of dollars) from fees levied on \n     narcotics production and trafficking. Guerrillas and \n     paramilitary groups supplanted absent state institutions in \n     many sparsely populated areas of the national territory. In \n     July 1998, then-President-elect Pastrana met with the FARC's \n     leader, ``Manuel Marulanda Velez,'' and agreed to a \n     demilitarized zone (``despeje'') in which the two sides could \n     pursue direct peace talks. In November 1998, the despeje was \n     initiated in 5 southern municipalities, with a total \n     population of approximately 100,000 persons. Security forces \n     completed their withdrawal from the area the following month. \n     In January Marulanda failed to appear for the scheduled \n     formal inauguration of peace talks in the despeje. President \n     Pastrana and Marulanda met again in May and agreed on an \n     agenda for formal negotiations and on procedures for the \n     creation of an international verification commission to \n     monitor both sides' compliance with the terms of the despeje. \n     However, the FARC refused to proceed with the establishment \n     of the commission. Formal Government-FARC peace negotiations \n     began in earnest in October and were underway at year's end, \n     following the Government's concession to the FARC that, at \n     least initially, there be no international verification \n     commission. The Government also held a series of informal \n     discussions with the ELN during the year, but insisted on the \n     ELN's release of the victims of specific mass kidnapings as a \n     condition for undertaking formal negotiations and for \n     demilitarizing a zone in which the ELN could hold its \n     national convention. At year's end, the ELN had not complied \n     with the Government's request and still held captive several \n     dozen of the specified kidnap victims.\n       The civilian-led Ministry of Defense is responsible for \n     internal security and oversees both the armed forces and the \n     National Police, although civilian management of the armed \n     forces is limited. The security forces include armed state \n     law enforcement, investigative, and military authorities, \n     including the National Police, army, air force, navy, \n     marines, coast guard, the Administrative Department of \n     Security (DAS), and the Prosecutor General's Technical \n     Corps of Investigators (CTI). The army, air force, navy, \n     marines, coast guard, and National Police fall under the \n     direction of the Minister of Defense. The DAS, which has \n     broad intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and \n     investigative authority, reports directly to the \n     President, but is directed by a law enforcement \n     professional. The police are charged formally with \n     maintaining internal order and security, but in practice \n     law enforcement responsibilities often were shared with \n     the army, especially in rural areas. The security forces \n     regularly failed to confront paramilitary groups, and \n     members of the security forces sometimes illegally \n     collaborated with paramilitary forces. The armed forces \n     and the police committed numerous, serious violations of \n     human rights throughout the year.\n       Despite years of drug- and politically related violence, \n     the economy is diverse and developed. However, the economy \n     has suffered a recession, and there was negative growth of 5 \n     percent in 1999 for the first time in the country's modern \n     history. The Government has privatized many public-sector \n     entities and liberalized trade and financial activity since \n     1991, and it plans further privatizations. Crude oil, coal, \n     coffee, and cut flowers are the principal legal exports. \n     Narcotics traffickers continued to control large tracts of \n     land and other assets and exerted influence throughout \n     society, the economy, and political life. The official \n     unemployment rate peaked at 20 percent, a record high, \n     although it had declined to 18.1 percent by year's end. \n     Inflation at year's end was 9.2 percent. The Government \n     passed an austere budget to address the fiscal gap, which was \n     at 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and has \n     prepared reform proposals in areas such as pensions and \n     regional finance. The balance of payments deficit was 4.5 \n     percent of GDP. Income distribution is highly skewed; much of \n     the population lives in poverty. Per capita GDP was \n     approximately $2,100.\n       The Government's human rights record remained poor; there \n     was some improvement in several areas, and the Pastrana \n     administration took measures to initiate structural reform, \n     but serious problems remain. Government forces continued to \n     commit numerous, serious abuses, including extrajudicial \n     killings, at a level that was roughly similar to that of \n     1998. Despite some prosecutions and convictions, the \n     authorities rarely brought officers of the security forces \n     and the police charged with human rights offenses to justice, \n     and impunity remains a problem. At times the security forces \n     collaborated with paramilitary groups that committed abuses; \n     in some instances, individual members of the security forces \n     actively collaborated with members of paramilitary groups by \n     passing them through roadblocks, sharing intelligence, and \n     providing them with ammunition. Paramilitary forces find a \n     ready support base within the military and police, as well as \n     local civilian elites in many areas.\n       On August 12, President Pastrana signed into law a revised \n     Military Penal Code, which includes provisions that unit \n     commanders no longer may judge their subordinates; that an \n     independent judge advocate general corps is to be created; \n     and that troops are to be protected legally if they refuse to \n     carry out illegal orders to commit human rights abuses. \n     However, necessary implementing legislation had not been \n     passed at year's end. Also on August 12, the Government made \n     public the Government's national human rights plan, which \n     includes a provision that permits the armed forces commander \n     to remove from service summarily any military member whose \n     performance in combating paramilitary forces he deemed \n     ``unsatisfactory or insufficient.'' The State demonstrated an \n     increased willingness to remove from duty security force \n     officers who failed to respect human rights, or ignored or \n     were complicit in the abuses committed by paramilitary \n     groups. The Government removed four army general officers \n     from service during the year; the generals were under \n     investigation for collaborating with or failing to combat \n     paramilitary groups. A few other state security officers were \n     removed from service or suspended during the year. The \n     military judiciary demonstrated an increased willingness to \n     turn cases involving security force officers accused of \n     serious human rights violations over to the civilian \n     judiciary, as required by a 1997 Constitutional Court ruling; \n     however, concerns about impunity within the military \n     judiciary remained.\n       Police, prison guards, and military forces continued to \n     torture and mistreat detainees. Conditions in the overcrowded \n     prisons are generally harsh; however, some inmates use bribes \n     or intimidation to obtain more favorable treatment. Arbitrary \n     arrest and detention, as well as prolonged pretrial \n     detention, are fundamental problems. The civilian judiciary \n     is inefficient, severely overburdened by a large case \n     backlog, and undermined by intimidation and the prevailing \n     climate of impunity. This situation remains at the core of \n     the country's human rights problems. The Superior Judicial \n     Council (CSJ) reported in August that 63 percent of crimes go \n     unreported, and that 40 percent of all reported crimes go \n     unpunished. The use of ``faceless'' prosecutors, judges, and \n     witnesses, under cover of anonymity for security reasons, \n     continued until June 30, in cases involving kidnaping, \n     extortion, narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and in several \n     hundred high-profile cases involving human rights violations. \n     Human rights groups accused these courts of violating \n     fundamental rights of due process, including the right to a \n     public trial. On June 30, a ``specialized jurisdiction'' \n     replaced the anonymous regional court system. The specialized \n     jurisdiction prosecuted and tried cases of extortion, \n     narcotics trafficking, money laundering, terrorism, and \n     serious human rights violations, including massacres, some \n     homicides, torture, and kidnaping. It permitted the use of \n     anonymous witnesses and prosecutor in exceptional\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\n     cases that potentially placed their lives in danger.\n       The authorities sometimes infringed on citizens' privacy \n     rights. Journalists practices self-censorship. There were \n     some restrictions on freedom of movement. There were \n     unconfirmed reports of security forces harassing or \n     threatening human rights groups. Violence and extensive \n     societal discrimination against women, abuse of children, and \n     child prostitution are serious problems. Extensive societal \n     discrimination against the indigenous and minorities \n     continued. Child labor is a widespread problem. Trafficking \n     in women and girls for the purpose of forced prostitution is \n     a problem. ``Social cleansing'' killings of street children, \n     prostitutes, homosexuals, and others deemed socially \n     undesirable by paramilitary groups, guerrillas, and vigilante \n     groups continued to be a serious problem.\n       Paramilitary groups and guerrillas were responsible for the \n     vast majority of political and extrajudicial killings during \n     the year. Throughout the country, paramilitary groups killed, \n     tortured, and threatened civilians suspected of sympathizing \n     with guerrillas in an orchestrated campaign to terrorize them \n     into fleeing their homes, thereby depriving guerrillas of \n     civilian support. Paramilitary forces were responsible for an \n     increasing number of massacres and other politically \n     motivated killings. They also fought guerrillas for control \n     of some lucrative coca-growing regions and engaged directly \n     in narcotics production and trafficking. The AUC paramilitary \n     umbrella organization, whose membership totaled approximately \n     5,000 to 7,000 armed combatants, exercised increasing \n     influence during the year, extending its presence through \n     violence and intimidation into areas previously under \n     guerrilla control. Although some paramilitary groups reflect \n     rural residents' desire to organize solely for self-defense, \n     others are vigilante organizations, and still others are \n     actually the paid private armies of narcotics traffickers or \n     large landowners. Popular support for these organizations \n     grew during the year, as guerrilla violence increased in the \n     face of a slowly evolving peace process. The army's record in \n     dealing with paramilitary groups remained mixed. In some \n     locations the army on rare occasions attacked and captured \n     members of such groups; in others it tolerated or even \n     collaborated with paramilitary groups.\n       The FARC and the ELN regularly attacked civilian \n     populations, committed massacres and summary executions, and \n     killed medical and religious personnel. Guerrillas were \n     responsible for the majority of cases of forcible recruitment \n     of indigenous people and of hundreds of children; they also \n     were responsible for the majority of kidnapings. Guerrillas \n     held more than 1,000 kidnaped civilians, with ransom payments \n     serving as an important source of revenue. Other kidnap \n     victims were killed. In some places, guerrillas collected \n     ``war taxes,'' forced members of the citizenry into their \n     ranks, forced small farmers to sow illicit crops, and \n     regulated travel, commerce, and other activities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         U.S. Aid to Colombia,\n\n                                                    March 8, 2000.\n       Dear Representative: We are writing as religious leaders in \n     the United States to urge you to oppose the two-year $1.3 \n     billion military aid package for the ``Push into Southern \n     Colombia'' proposed by President Clinton on January 11. This \n     aid targeting the coca growing regions of southern Colombia \n     will escalate the violence and undercut efforts for a \n     negotiated peace settlement to Colombia's 40-year civil war. \n     We urge you instead to support much-needed assistance for \n     peace, human rights, justice reform, alternative development, \n     and humanitarian assistance to Colombia's internally \n     displaced.\n       Colombia is currently the third largest recipient of U.S. \n     military assistance. Yet reports from the United Nations, the \n     U.S. Department of State, independent human rights \n     organizations, and Colombian judicial authorities point to \n     continuing ties between the Colombian security forces and \n     brutal paramilitary groups responsible for massacres, \n     assassinations of community leaders and human rights \n     defenders, and over 70% of Colombia's human rights abuses. A \n     report released by Human Rights Watch this month links half \n     of Colombia's 18 brigade-level army units to paramilitary \n     activity.\n       Colombia's internal conflict has produced 1.6 million \n     internally displaced persons, more than in Kosovo or East \n     Timor, and an increasing number of refugees fleeing to Panama \n     and Venezuela. It is our fear the proposed aid package will \n     draw the U.S. deeper into Colombia's civil war, intensify the \n     conflict, and make the U.S. complicit in violations of human \n     rights. Even more disturbing, the proposed aid package \n     includes plans for intensive aerial fumigation that will \n     displace 10,000 more people from southern Colombia, forcing \n     them off of their lands and deeper into the fragile \n     rainforests, causing great human suffering and incalculable \n     environment damage.\n       Aerial fumigation of coca cultivation in Colombia has \n     failed to reduce coca production in Colombia or consumption \n     in the United States. Between 1992 and 1998 the area under \n     coca cultivation has increased from 40,000 to 100,000 \n     hectares despite huge increases in U.S. assistance for \n     weapons, training, and intelligence. This proposed aid \n     package will only expand a failed war on drugs by increasing \n     military force, while failing to address the complex \n     political, economic, and social inequalities at the root of \n     Colombia's internal conflict.\n       On October 24, 1999, more than 10 million Colombians \n     marched for peace. Talks between the Colombian government and \n     the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the \n     largest guerrilla force, have resumed. Progress is being made \n     toward opening negotiations with the National Liberation Army \n     (ELN), the second largest guerrilla group. We ask you to \n     honestly assess the possible negative effects on U.S. \n     military aid on those peace efforts. It is our judgment that \n     such aid will undermine them. We urge you to vote against \n     increased U.S. military involvement in Colombia.\n     Raquel Rodriguez,\n       Program Associate, Latin American and Caribbean Office, \n     Global Ministries, United Church of Christ--Disciples of \n     Christ.\n     David A.

They are opposed to this aid package for the push into \nsouthern Colombia, again with the same concern about the basic \nviolation of human rights and the close connection between the armed \nservices and these paramilitary terrorist organizations.\n  Mr. President, I also have here a document which is from Human Rights \nNongovernmental Organizations and the Peace Movement In Colombia.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Colombia Answers Plan Colombia: A Plan for Peace or a Plan for War?\n\n      (A Declaration From Social and Human Rights Nongovernmental \n  Organizations, and the Peace Movement in Colombia, Bogota, May 31, \n                                 2000)\n\n       We would like express our support for those offers of \n     international assistance that contribute to resolving the \n     armed conflict through a process of political negotiation, \n     and that strengthen and unite Colombian society and the \n     economy. We support proposals that include viable and \n     integral solutions to the problem of drug trafficking, the \n     design of a new development model agreed to by the people, \n     and the strengthening of a new kind of democratic \n     institutionality.\n       However, Plan Colombia, presented by the Government of \n     President Pastrana, has been developed with the same logic of \n     political and social exclusion that has been one of the \n     structural causes of the conflict Colombians have experienced \n     since the time of our formation as a Republic.\n       In this same vein, because we feel it is a mistake, we are \n     obligated to reject the fact that Plan Colombia includes, as \n     one of its strategies, a military component that not only \n     fails to resolve he narcotrafficking problem, but also \n     endangers the efforts to build peace, increases illicit crop \n     production, violates the Amazonic ecosystem, aggravates the \n     humanitarian and human rights crisis, multiplies the problem \n     of forced displacement, and worsens the social crisis with \n     fiscal adjustment policies. In its social component, the Plan \n     is limited to attending to some of the tangential causes and \n     effects of the conflict.\n       What we are proposing is the need for a concerted agreement \n     between different actors in Colombian society and the \n     international community, one where civil society is the \n     principal interlocutor, where solutions to the varied \n     conflicts are found, and where stable and sustainable peace \n     is constructed. We are ready and willing to design \n     strategies, to define forms of implementation and to monitor \n     a plan that reflects these intentions.\n       Taking into consideration the arguments put forth above, we \n     the undersigned are given no choice but to reject the U.S. \n     assistance for Colombia that you are considering at this \n     time.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will quote one section:\n\n       In this same vein, because we feel it is a mistake--\n\n  They are talking about this package--\n\n     we are obliged to reject the fact that Plan Colombia includes \n     as one of its strategies, a military component that not only \n     fails to resolve the narcotrafficking problem--\n\n  I say to the majority leader and others, ``that fails to resolve this \nproblem,'' but that is what we want to do, is resolve the problem--\n\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\n\n     but also endangers the efforts to build peace, increases \n     illicit crop production, violates the Amazonic ecosystem, \n     aggravates the humanitarian and human rights crisis, \n     multiplies the problem of forced displacement, and worsens \n     the social crisis with fiscal adjustment policies.\n\n  It is from a variety of about 70 nongovernment organizations, \nincluding religious organizations as well, in the country of Colombia. \nThey are saying don't do this. Provide the assistance; we need it. \nLet's get it to the civic-building organizations, get it to the police, \nget it to some of the interdiction efforts, get it to some other \neconomic development efforts. But don't put the money into the military \nfor this campaign, given the military's record of torture, murder, and \nwidespread violation of human rights.\n  In short, continuing to pursue our current Colombia counterinsurgency \npolicy, cloaked under the veil of antinarcotics efforts--that is not \nwhat this is about. This is not about an antinarcotics effort. That is \nnot what the vote is about. The vote is about whether or not you are \ngoing to put money into this military anti-insurgency effort. It risks \ndrawing us into a terrible quagmire. History has repeatedly shown, \nespecially in Latin America--just think of Nicaragua or El Salvador--\nthat the practical effect of this strategy now under consideration is \nto militarize, to escalate the conflict, not to end it. That is, I \nthink, the flaw in this package.\n  The call by the administration for a massive increase in \ncounternarcotics assistance for Colombia this year puts the United \nStates at a crossroads. Do we back a major escalation in military aid \nto Colombia that may worsen a civil war that has already raged for \ndecades or do we pursue a more effective policy of stabilizing Colombia \nby promoting sustainable development, strengthening civilian democratic \ninstitutions, and attacking the drug market by investing in prevention \nand treatment at home--the demand side of the equation, right here in \nour own country?\n  The decision to fund the Colombian Army's push into southern Colombia \nis an enormous policy shift. It represents a 7-to-1 shift in funding \nfrom the Colombian police to the army. General McCaffrey says the \npurpose of Plan Colombia is to help the Colombian Army recover the \nsouthern part of the country now under guerrilla control. But honestly, \nif the purpose of this military aid is to stop drug trafficking, should \nsome of that aid not target the northern part of Colombia as well? \nSomething strange is going on here. If we want to deal with the people \nwho are involved in drug trafficking, then one would think we would \nalso have a campaign in the northern part of Colombia. There you have \nthe right-wing death squads involved. Colombia is currently the largest \nrecipient of U.S. security assistance. It is exceeded only by Israel \nand Egypt. Foreign aid and other assistance to Colombia, since 1995, \nnow totals $739 million. Yet the administration's own estimate shows a \n140-percent increase in Colombia coca cultivation over the past 5 \nyears.\n\n  Colombia now produces 80 percent of the world's cocaine. Drugs today \nare cheaper and more available than ever before. If the drug war was \nevaluated like most other Federal programs, I suspect we would have \ntried different strategies a long time ago. More weapons and more \nsoldiers have not and cannot defeat the source of illegal narcotics. \nWhile the Colombian Government and people merit our assistance, more \nmoney for guns is not the answer to Colombia's troubles or our own \ntroubles with the serious use of drugs right here in our own country.\n  Being tough on drugs is important. But we also need to be smart about \nthe tactics we employ. No one disagrees that Colombia faces a difficult \nchallenge and we should respond to President Pastrana's call for help \nto combat illegal drug trafficking. I agree. President Pastrana has \nargued that U.S. support is necessary to ``strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, stop the flow of drugs, and bring peace to the country.'' \nI agree.\n  I would support the army's push into southern Colombia if I felt this \nproposal would make that happen. But, in fact, I think a military push \nwould have the exact opposite effect by weakening democratic \ninstitutions and bringing more hardship to the Colombian people. There \nis not anything in the world we can do, by way of monitoring this, to \nmake sure that this military--which has been so clearly linked to these \nright-wing death squads and terrorist organizations--will change its \npractice.\n  Amnesty International, the State Department report, ``Human Rights \nWorld Watch Report''--I could spend hours just reading from these \nreports on the atrocities committed by the military, or the atrocities \ncommitted by these death squads, these paramilitary organizations \ntoward which the military basically has turned a blind eye. Now we are \ngoing to provide the money for this military, for a military campaign, \nwith American advisers, in the southern part of Colombia? That is what \nis problematical about this.\n  At the same time, however, forces from within Colombia threaten \ndemocracy. Paramilitary groups operating with the acquiescence or open \nsupport of the military--the very military we are going to support--\naccount for most of the political violence in Colombia today. I need to \nmake that point.\n  Yes to interdiction, yes to going after drug trafficking--but \nunderstand that this is a country in civil war. This is a country with \nthe largest internally displaced population, maybe in the world, \ncertainly in the hemisphere. And this is a country where too many \ninnocent civilians are murdered. This is a country where paramilitary \ngroups, operating with the acquiescence or open support of the \nmilitary, account for most of the political violence.\n  Yet Colombia's military leaders have not taken a firm stand or taken \nclear steps necessary to purge human rights abusers from their ranks. \nThe evidence is clear. They have taken no steps to purge human rights \nabusers from their ranks. They have acquiesced to these human rights \nabuses. Sometimes they support these human rights abuses. And we are \ngoing to provide this money for this military with American advisers?\n  I support the addition to this bill that requires conditions on \nassistance based on human rights concerns. But just as the Committee on \nAppropriations noted in its committee report to this bill, I, too, \n``have grave reservations.'' I quote from the Committee on \nAppropriations:\n\n       . . . grave reservations regarding the Administration's \n     ability to effectively manage the use of these resources to \n     achieve the expected results of reducing production and \n     supply of cocaine while protecting human rights.\n\n  Human rights organizations have detailed abundant and compelling \nevidence of continuing ties between the Colombian Army and paramilitary \ngroups responsible for gross human rights violations. In its annual \nreport for 1999, Human Rights Watch reports:\n\n       [I]n 1999 paramilitary [groups] were considered responsible \n     for 78 percent of the total number of human rights and \n     international humanitarian law violations [in Colombia.]\n\n  Human Rights Watch collected this evidence with the help of the \nColombian Commission of Jurists, a highly respected human rights \nwatchdog within Colombia. It has also collected evidence linking half \nof Colombia's 18 brigade-level army units to paramilitary activity.\n  In other words, military support for paramilitaries remains national \nin scope and includes areas where units receiving or scheduled to \nreceive U.S. military aid operate. This is quite unbelievable. I hope \nall Senators will consider this seriously when they vote on this \namendment.\n  I was also given a book detailing the human rights situation in \nColombia by the Twin Cities Chapter of the Colombia Support Network. \nThis organization is working to establish a sister-city relationship \nwith the war-torn town of San Pablo in southern Colombia. San Pablo is \ndirectly in the path of the suggested push into southern Colombia. This \nis just one of hundreds, if not thousands, of heartbreaking stories:\n\n       A young woman, with a confused and almost hopeless air \n     about her, answered my questions and spoke into my \n     taperecorder. She had been forced to join a military patrol \n     and walk for 13 days through the mountains, guiding the \n     soldiers and carrying their knapsacks. Although she witnessed \n     numerous cases of torture and the destruction and burning of \n     humble campesino dwellings, it was the brutal murder of Jesus \n     Pastrana which affected her the most. I myself had\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n     met this campesino leader on one of his visits to Bogota to \n     attend meetings of ANUC (a national peasants organization \n     with strong support during this period). According to the \n     terrible details the young woman gave me, Chucho, as Jesus \n     was affectionately called, died a slow and agonizing death on \n     October 31, 1981. He was hung from a tree as psychopathic \n     soldiers cut off his ears, his fingers, hands, then arms and \n     testicles and finally shot him 21 times.\n\n  Other colleagues have come to the floor to speak, and I want to make \nsure they speak.\n  If this were an isolated example and if I did not have in hand the \nevidence from respected human rights organizations and the State \nDepartment reports of blatant violation of human rights now of these \nparamilitary organizations committing so many of these atrocities, most \nof the violence, with the military acquiescing and sometimes linked to \nit and supporting it, with no evidence the military is taking any steps \nto purge its ranks of human rights abusers, I might think better of \nthis dramatic change in our package, 7 to 1 from military to police, \nfor a campaign in southern Colombia with American advisers, putting us \nin the middle of the civil war aligned with this military.\n  I want to have aid for Colombia. I want President Pastrana to have \nour support, but this effort will not be successful. Moreover, I think, \nwe are, on very treacherous ground, moving into this area.\n  I will summarize so that other colleagues may speak.\n  We could put this money into the demand side. I am simply saying we \ntake $225 million, leaving $700 million, or thereabouts, and we put it \ninto the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant program \nwhich basically is a block grant to our States. Whether or not we are \ntalking about the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy or \nwhether or not we are talking about the data that is collected in our \nStates, we are talking about a situation where 50 percent of adults or \nmore and 80 percent of adolescents or more who need treatment are \nreceiving no treatment because we do not have the funds for the \ntreatment programs.\n  Our police chiefs tell us drug abuse is the most serious problem in \ntheir community. They also identify a shortage of treatment programs as \na real limitation on their ability to deal with it.\n\n  We know from study after study--and I will talk more about this when \nI have more time--that money put into treatment programs pays for \nitself over and over. I have dramatic statistics and data I will \npresent, but the long and the short of it is, if we have this package \nand if there are questions to be raised about the militarization of \nthis aid, putting the money into the military for the southern \ncampaign, a military directly linked to human rights violations, with \nso many organizations in Colombia saying do not do this, it will lead \nto more violence; do not do this, America, you could be sucked into \nthis conflict; at the same time, we could provide a significant package \ninto building democratic institutions for economic aid, $700 million, \nand we could take a tiny portion of it and deal with the demand side \nfor drugs in our own country, which is also critically important, and \nget the funding to the community level that would help us provide some \ntreatment for people, that is a win-win situation.\n  I hope this amendment will receive strong support from my colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3518\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the substance abuse and \n                        mental health services)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 3518.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 143, line 9, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, subject to the 2 \n     preceding provisos, of the funds appropriated for military \n     purposes under this heading for the `Push into Southern \n     Colombia', $225,000,000 shall be made available to the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for \n     carrying out subpart II of part B of title XIX of the Public \n     Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 300x-21 et seq.): Provided \n     further, That amounts made available under the preceding \n     proviso are hereby designated by the Congress to be emergency \n     requirements pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985: Provided \n     further, That such amounts shall be made available only after \n     submission to the Congress of a formal budget request by the \n     President that includes designation of the entire amount of \n     the request as an emergency requirement as defined in such \n     Act''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 26 minutes and has 64 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I sent this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant opposition to this \namendment that has been offered by my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota. I commend him for his commitment to drug use reduction. He \nand I serve on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. We have worked on a number of bills having to do with this \nvery topic, including the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program.\n  Ultimately, however, this amendment is, I am afraid, attempting to \nreallocate resources from one part of our antidrug strategy to another. \nThe amendment raises important questions about the effectiveness of our \nentire strategy and opens, I believe, an important and necessary \ndiscussion about our drug control policy in this country.\n  The sad fact is that since almost the beginning of the last decade, \nour antidrug strategy has not worked. More children are abusing drugs, \nand with an abundant supply, drug traffickers are seeking to increase \ntheir sales by targeting children ages 10, 11, 12, and 13. This is \ncertainly an assault on the future of our children, an assault on our \nfamilies, and an assault on the future of our country. This is nothing \nless than a threat to our national values and, yes, a threat to our \nnational security.\n  All of this, though, begs the question: What are we doing wrong? \nClearly, there is not one simple answer. However, in 1998, a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators--myself; the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell; the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Graham; the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley; \nand the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein--worked together to \ndeal with this problem. We came to the conclusion that our overall drug \nstrategy simply was no longer balanced. I want to talk about this \nbecause I am afraid what my colleague is doing is not helpful as we \nattempt to balance our antidrug strategy.\n  We have been working together since 1998 to restore that balance. The \nemergency assistance antidrug package for Colombia contained in this \nbill is part of that effort to restore this balance, but even with \nthis, we still have a long way to go.\n  The fact is, to be effective, our national drug strategy must have a \nstrong commitment in three different areas: No. 1 is demand reduction \nwhich consists of prevention, treatment, and education. The Federal \nGovernment in this area shares responsibility to reduce that demand, \nalong with State and local governments, local community groups, \nnonprofit organizations, and families.\n  When you are dealing with education, when you are dealing with \ntreatment, you are dealing with something that is a shared \nresponsibility between the Federal Government and the local \ncommunities.\n  The second component is domestic law enforcement. Again, in this \narea, it is a shared responsibility among the Federal Government, the \nlocal communities, and the States. Again, the Federal Government has a \nshared responsibility to use law enforcement resources, along with the \nState and local governments, to detect and dismantle drug trafficking \noperations within our borders.\n  We witnessed a successful return on that investment last week on what \nwas called Operation Tar Pit, when the Justice Department announced it \nhad worked with State and local law enforcement agencies in 12 cities, \nincluding 2 in the State of Ohio, to dismantle\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\na major Mexican heroin trafficking organization. They did a great job, \nin a coordinated effort.\n  The third component in any successful antidrug strategy is \ninternational eradication and international interdiction. This is the \nsole responsibility of the Federal Government. States can't help. Local \ncommunities can't help. We are the only ones who can do this. I am \nafraid my colleague's amendment strikes directly at our attempt to do \nthis.\n  Like our national defense and immigration policies, only the Federal \nGovernment has the authority, only the Federal Government has the \nresponsibility to keep drugs from ever crossing our borders. If we do \nnot do it, no one else will. No one else can. The buck stops in this \nChamber.\n  These three components are all interdependent. We need to have them \nall. A strong investment in each is necessary for them to work \nindividually and to work collectively.\n  For example, a strong effort to destroy or seize drugs at the source \nor outside the United States both reduces the amount of drugs in the \ncountry and drives up the street price. As we all know, higher prices \ndo in fact reduce consumption. This, in turn, helps our domestic law \nenforcement and demand-reduction efforts.\n  As any football fan knows, a winning team is one that plays well at \nall three phases of the sport: Offense, defense, and the special teams. \nThe same is true with our antidrug strategy. All three components have \nto be supported if our strategy is to be a winning one.\n  While I think the current administration has shown a clear commitment \nto demand-reduction and domestic law enforcement programs, the same, \nsadly, cannot be said for our international eradication and \ninterdiction components. This was not always the case.\n  I think these charts I have will show how our commitment has changed.\n  In 1987, a $4.79 billion Federal drug control budget was divided as \nfollows: 29 percent for demand-reduction programs, 38 percent for \ndomestic law enforcement, and 33 percent--one-third--for international \neradication and interdiction efforts. This is the way it should be. \nThis is a balanced program. This is what we had in 1987.\n  Now we fast forward to 1995, and you will see that this balance goes \nout of whack. We no longer had that balance. We no longer had that \nbalance today.\n  The balanced approach worked. It achieved real success. Limiting drug \navailability through interdiction drove up the street price of drugs, \nreduced drug purity levels, and as a result reduced overall drug use.\n\n  From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 percent, cocaine use \ndropped by 35 percent, and overall drug use by American adolescents \ndropped by 25 percent--results. We began to see results.\n  This balanced approach, however, ended in 1993. By 1995, the $13.3 \nbillion national drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent \nfor demand reduction, 53 percent for domestic law enforcement, but only \n12 percent for international interdiction efforts. International \ninterdiction efforts have gone down to 12 percent from 33 percent.\n  Though the overall antidrug budget increased almost threefold from \n1987 to 1995, the percentage allocated for international eradication \nand interdiction efforts decreased dramatically. This disruption only \nrecently has started to change.\n  We have put together, on the floor of the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives, a bipartisan group--a bipartisan group of Senators--\nwho have said: We cannot have this imbalance. We must begin to restore \nthe balance we had a few years ago in 1987. We have to do it.\n  Let me go forward, if I may, to this current budget year, the budget \nyear 2000. In the budget year 2000, 34 percent has been allocated for \ndemand reduction, 51 percent for domestic law enforcement, and 14.4 \npercent for international interdiction efforts.\n  We are slowly moving in the right direction. Even in this year's \nbudget we have a long way to go, with only 14.4 percent for \ninternational interdiction efforts. We have more work to do, more work, \nsuch as the assistance package for the Colombians that we are debating \non the floor today. But we are starting to see some modest progress.\n  But what really matters is what these numbers get you, what they buy \nus as a country, what they buy in terms of resources. The hard truth is \nthat our drug interdiction presence--the ships, the air, and the \nmanpower dedicated to keeping drugs from reaching our country--has \neroded dramatically over the course of the last decade. We are just now \nstarting to restore those valuable resources.\n  In fact, with the modest improvements we have made in our \ninternational drug fighting capability, we have seen progress. In 1999, \nfor example, the U.S. Coast Guard seized 57 tons of cocaine with a \nstreet value of $4 billion. By the way, that is more than the total \noperational costs of the Coast Guard. These operations demonstrate we \ncan make a big difference, a very big difference, if we provide the \nright levels of material and the right levels of manpower to fight drug \ntrafficking. It worked before. It can work again.\n  The emergency assistance package we are talking about today, along \nwith investments included in the Senate-passed military construction \nappropriations bill, is designed to build on that success. The \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota, while it is very well \nintentioned, simply, effectively robs Peter to pay Paul just as Paul is \ngetting back on his feet again. Just look at the example I mentioned \nearlier.\n  Through my visits to the Caribbean, Colombia, and Peru in the last \nseveral years, I have seen firsthand the dramatic decline in our \neradication and interdiction capability. The results of this decline \nhave been a decline in cocaine seizures, a decline in the price of \ncocaine, and an increase in drug use in the United States.\n  We have to turn this around. This is why we need emergency assistance \nto Colombia. We need to dedicate more resources for international \nefforts to help reverse this trend. We have to restore the balance.\n  I want to make it very clear, as I have time and time again, that I \nstrongly support our continued commitment to demand reduction and to \nlaw enforcement programs in the United States. No one is a stronger \nsupporter of these. It has to be a balanced program where we have money \nfor treatment, where we have money for education, where we have money \nfor domestic interdiction and law enforcement.\n  My concern is not that this amendment is not well intentioned, not \nthat we should not be putting more resources in this area. My concern \nis what this does to the other side of the component, and that is \ninternational drug interdiction.\n  Let me make it clear. We do need this balanced program. I believe \nthat reducing demand is the only real way to permanently end illegal \ndrug use. However, this is not going to happen overnight. That is why \nwe need a comprehensive counterdrug strategy that addresses all \ncomponents of this problem.\n  Let me say again, if the United States does not make an effort to \nstop drugs before they reach our borders, no one else will. It is the \nFederal Government's responsibility. I remind my colleagues that our \nantidrug efforts here at home are done in cooperation with a vast \nnumber of public and private interests. Only the Federal Government has \nthe ability and the responsibility to help deal with the problem at the \nsource level overseas. Only the Federal Government has the ability to \nstop drugs in the transit routes. This is our responsibility; the buck \nstops with us.\n  It is not only an issue of responsibility. It also is an issue of \nleadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on an \ninternational level, especially in our own hemisphere, if we expect to \nget the full cooperation of source countries where the drugs originate, \ncountries such as Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, as well as countries in the \ntransit zones, including Mexico and Haiti.\n  In conclusion, ultimately what we are striving for is a balanced, \neffective antidrug strategy. I agree with the Senator from Minnesota; \nwe can and should do more to reduce demand but not at the expense of \nour sole responsibility to stop drugs abroad. That would not result in \nthe balanced approach we are looking for today. That is what we need to \naim for, balance and effectiveness. It worked before; I believe it can \nwork again.\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\n  If my colleague from Kentucky will indulge me, I will respond to a \ncouple comments that have been made by my colleague from Minnesota. \nThis bill is full of human rights, if I may say it that way. It is full \nof attempts by the U.S. Government to condition the money we send to \nColombia and the money that will be spent in the antidrug effort. We \nhave doubled the money for human rights monitoring. We have established \nconditions before the money can be released, including the fact that \nhuman rights violations must be prosecuted in civilian courts pursuant \nto Colombia law; troops will be vetted for abuse.\n  Ultimately, the question my colleague from Minnesota is raising is a \nfundamental question: Will we back away from our responsibilities in \nthis hemisphere--our responsibility to a fellow democracy, our \nresponsibility to our own citizens to protect us from drugs coming from \nColombia into the United States? Will we back away from that, wash our \nhands of it and say we don't want to get involved in this, or will we \nbecome involved only in the sense that we condition the money that we \nsend to Colombia on very tough conditions, great respect for human \nrights, and see what we can do in that arena?\n  I think we are better off staying. We can have more impact; we can \nhave more influence; and it is the right thing to do. It is in our \nnational interest. With this bill, my colleague from Kentucky brings to \nthe floor a balanced approach, a logical approach, an approach that is \nvery concerned about human rights, a bill that is concerned about our \nobligations to ourselves and our obligations in this hemisphere.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOhio for his important contribution to this debate. He is a real expert \non the drug war. He has demonstrated that expertise over the 5 years he \nhas been here. I thank him for his important contribution.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 27\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n\n             1Amendment Nos. 3476, 3164, And 3514, Recalled\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the package of amendments submitted \nearlier today, three amendments currently filed at the desk were \nincluded. I ask unanimous consent that amendment Nos. 3476, 3164, and \n3514 be recalled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The distinguished Senator from Illinois is here and \nwishes to speak, as well as the distinguished Senator from Delaware. I \nhave 27 minutes remaining. How much does my friend from Illinois \ndesire; 10 minutes? I yield to the Senator from Illinois 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, since there are a lot of Senators here \non the other side, I will take 2 minutes to respond to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As long as it is on the time of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased for it to be on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator from Ohio, this effort to deal \nwith the demand side and to get some substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment moneys to our States and our communities, I have no doubt the \nSenator from Ohio is very committed to that. I look forward to working \nwith him on this because, frankly, I think it is a scandal. We have so \nmuch evidence--Bill Moyers, the impressive journalist, has done such \nfine work on this--that we can treat this addiction, that we can make a \nhuge difference. Senator Moynihan has spoken with such eloquence about \nthe whole history of our efforts to constantly try to militarize and go \nfor interdiction and not deal with the demand side. It is a completely \none-sided proposition. I look forward to enlisting the support of my \ncolleague from Ohio on this question. I know he will be there.\n  I will wait to respond to other Senators. I know Senator Durbin is \ngoing to speak and Senator Biden. As I listen to my colleagues, what I \nam hearing--and I think we should be explicit about this--is that this \nis not just a question of a kind of war on narcotics. Otherwise, we \nwould be doing more on the demand side. This is a question of basically \nsaying that we can't just focus on the police. We can't just provide \nhelp to the government for police action and building democratic \ninstitutions and economic development and every other kind of \nassistance possible. We have to directly provide the money for the \nmilitary to basically conduct their anti-insurgency campaign in the \nsouthern part of Colombia with American advisers and support. I believe \nthat means we are taking sides. If we are taking sides and we are now \nin the middle of this war, so be it. That is what I am hearing on the \nfloor. I wanted to comment on that.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.\n  Sunday afternoon, 3 days ago, I was in southern Colombia in a \nBlackhawk helicopter. We spent an hour going over the treetops of a \njungle and looking down. A general from the Colombian army was pointing \nout to me the fields of coca plants, the plant that ultimately produces \ncocaine. After a few minutes, I told him he could stop because we could \nliterally see them in every direction. I am talking about 600 square \nmiles of coca plants growing a product which has one use: to create an \naddictive narcotic. Where will it be sold? Right here, most of it in \nthe United States.\n  I think we all know the devastation it wreaks on this country. The \nlikelihood that one will be robbed or murdered is usually connected to \nnarcotics. The safety of American homes, neighborhoods, and communities \nis usually connected to narcotics. The prisons of America are bursting \nat the seams primarily because of narcotics. Eighty percent of the \ncocaine consumed in the United States comes from one country: Colombia. \nThat is a reality; that is a fact.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is one of my favorite colleagues. I say \nthis in all sincerity. Thank God Paul Wellstone is in the Senate. He \nstands for principle on so many issues and reminds all of us of the \nissues of conscience which should be part of every debate.\n  I am honored so many times to stand as his ally. This is one of the \nrare occasions when I am on the opposite side and will oppose his \namendment. As some would like to construct it, this amendment is a \nFaustian choice, an impossible dilemma. Should we allow drugs into the \nUnited States? Certainly not. Should we support a Colombian military \nthat has a record of human rights abuse? Well, certainly not. But we \nhave to make a choice here.\n  The Clinton administration has come forward, working with the \nPresident of Colombia, and said we think we can find a way to reform \nthe military and we can also reduce the narcotics coming into the \nUnited States.\n  I might add that I salute Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy for \nthis fine bill they have brought to us. They went further than the \nadministration. Please read the section on Plan Colombia, and you will \nsee page after page of efforts by Democrats and Republicans here to \naddress the very real human rights concerns raised by Senator Wellstone \nof Minnesota.\n  Time and again, they come forward and say we are going to do more and \nmake certain, as best we can, that before money comes from our Treasury \ndown to Colombia to eradicate narcotics, the people receiving the money \nare not going to collaborate with the narcotraffickers who are guilty \nof things that have been proven in the past.\n  I salute the committee. For friends of mine in the human rights \ncommunity in the United States, I hope they will read what has been \ndone here by Senators Leahy and McConnell. It is very positive.\n  Imagine, for 40 years Colombia has been involved in what has been \ncalled a civil war or an internal conflict. What does that mean? Forty \nyears ago, groups on the left who were inspired either by Moscow, or \nBeijing, or whatever, came to the front and said, we are going to push \nfor reform in this country so that the poor people of Colombia\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\nhave a better chance. That sort of revolution was taking place all over \nCentral and South America.\n  But things changed over 40 years. What started off as a leftist-\ninspired, popular uprising to improve life for the poor people in \nColombia quickly became subsumed and taken over by the narcotics trade. \nThe World Bank estimates that there is a billion dollars in money \ncoming into Colombia to sustain the narcotics trade. That money is \ngoing to the leftist guerrillas and the right-wing group, the terrorist \nparamilitaries. They all use the same tactics. They don't go into \nvillages and beg for soldiers; they stick a gun to their heads and say, \n``You are now part of our paramilitary group.'' They enslave them. If \nthey don't cooperate, they kill them. And they are involved in \nkidnapping.\n  The President of that country has been kidnapped. His father-in-law \nwas kidnapped and murdered. When we met Saturday morning, the Defense \nMinister said his brother was kidnapped. Everybody there told stories \nabout kidnapped people. If you think this is a typical civil war where \nthe left is moving for poor people and the government is against it, it \ndoesn't fit the description. When we sat down with the human rights \ngroups, they said the guerrillas on the left and the paramilitaries on \nthe right are just as guilty of human rights abuses in this country as \nany other group. No question about it.\n  There are very few good guys in this story. But from the U.S. point \nof view, I think the President is right, and I think this bill is right \nto say we cannot stand idly by and let these drugs flood into the \nUnited States with all of the negative consequences.\n\n  I totally support Senator Wellstone's premise that if we just stop \nthe supply of drugs coming into the United States, that is not enough; \nwe have to deal with the demand side of it. America is a great consumer \nof narcotics. That is why those plants are being grown thousands of \nmiles away. When Senators Wellstone and DeWine come to the floor and \nsay put more money into drug prevention and rehab in the United States, \nthey are right. But it is not an either/or situation; we need both.\n  This bill addresses reducing and eliminating the supply of narcotics \ncoming into the United States. Senator Wellstone believes the military \nin Colombia has a record of human rights abuses, and he is right. The \nState Department stands behind that. This bill addresses that and says, \nwe will bird-dog you every step of the way, demand reforms in the \nColombian society, and we will demand that you not be engaged in human \nrights abuses to be part of this partnership to reduce narcotics in \nColombia.\n  I might also add, to suggest we will give money to the police and not \nto the army really doesn't tell the whole story. They are together in \nColombia. The national police and the army are together. When I sat \ndown with the Minister of Defense, I sat across the table from General \nGilibert, who is head of the police, and General Tapias, head of the \narmy. They work together. We want to use helicopters to secure areas \nwhere we can send down planes to spray with Roundup these coca plants \nand kill them, so that coca is not turned into paste and white powder \nand sold on the streets of Washington, DC, and Chicago, IL, addicting \npeople and sending them to prison after committing crimes. That is a \ngood thing to do. I support the administration in their efforts to \nachieve that.\n  It is true that Senator Wellstone says we may be taking sides. I hope \nwe are taking sides against narcotics and saying to the leftist \nguerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries: We have no use for either one \nof you.\n  As said to me by the President of Colombia, ``They are both our \nenemies. We have to deal with both of them.'' We should view it that \nway. As I met with the Army and Marine Corps personnel from the United \nStates advising these troops in Tres Esquinas, a remote location in the \nPutumayo Province, it is clear that these men in the Colombian Army \nwere prepared to put their lives on the line to stop the \nnarcotrafficking that ultimately will corrupt and kill so many \nAmericans. I think we have to stand behind them. We have no other \nchoice. To step back and say we will do nothing now is unacceptable.\n  This bill makes it clear that we have not forgotten the poorest \npeople in Colombia. I commend again the subcommittee for saying that \nadditional assistance is given to the Agency for International \nDevelopment, so that once that coca planter in Colombia has his crop \nsprayed, we can give him an alternative, find some other agriculture in \nwhich he can be involved. That is the humanitarian and sensible way to \napproach this. This bill does that; it tries to make sure some \nalternative, legal agriculture is available to the people there.\n  Is it worth a billion dollars to America to send this money to \nColombia? I will use my State as an illustration. In 1987, we had 500 \npeople in Illinois prisons for the possession of a thimbleful of \ncocaine. Today, we have 9,000 prisoners in Illinois for the possession \nof a thimbleful of cocaine. It costs us about $30,000 per prisoner a \nyear. The taxpayers of Illinois are spending $270 million a year and \nthe story can be repeated in every other State. That is $270 million a \nyear in Illinois because of what is growing in Putumayo Province in \nColombia.\n\n  I think we have to have a coordinated effort of interdiction and stop \nit at its source, to do everything in our power not to let these drugs \ncome into the country. Then we can deal with the demand side of it and \nsee that drug rehab is available--a sensible and a balanced approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Minnesota want to respond?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is right, yes. I will just be a few minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I know Senator \nBiden wants to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer be allowed to speak after \nSenator Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, since we \nare setting a lineup here, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoverdell from Georgia come after Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his very \ngracious remarks. A lot of times there is unnecessary flattery on the \nfloor that may not seem sincere. I appreciate what he said. At the \npersonal level, I thank him.\n\n  I was thinking about what my colleague from Illinois said. I want to \nraise a couple of quick questions as long as we are having this debate.\n  First of all, in terms of the explosion of the number of men and \nwomen incarcerated, I couldn't agree more.\n  This legislation, which is all about how to deal with the drug \nproblem and is being billed as legislation that deals with trafficking \nof narcotics and trying to protect people in our own country, is very \none sided. I am trying to take a portion of it and say let's deal with \nthe demand side in our country.\n  Soon in this debate I will lay out all of the studies that have come \nout. It is a real scandal.\n  In the State of Illinois and my State of Minnesota, the big part of \nthe problem is that people are not getting treatment. I am simply \nsaying: Can't we take a portion of this legislation, which is all about \ntrying to protect our citizens and trying to deal with this drug \ntrafficking, and deal with the demand side? There is no real \ndisagreement. I think most people in our country would say: Why don't \nwe put money in the demand side and treating people right here?\n  My second point is that President Pastrana has made his own judgment \nabout what he needs to do. I have tremendous respect for the President, \nbut I think we also need to make our own judgment. In all due respect, \nagain if we are talking about moving from police to military in a \npretty dramatic way, and talking about putting ourselves right in the \nmiddle of this conflict, let's understand that we should be having a \npolicy debate about our taking sides in this civil war.\n  I couldn't agree more about the left or the right. You have an \nunbelievable number of atrocities and murder being committed by both \nsides. There is no\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nquestion about it. The question is whether or not we have now decided \nwe are going to be there with aid and our people supporting the \nmilitary in this counterinsurgency effort. Are we going to take sides \nin this military conflict?\n  I hear my colleague from Delaware say yes. I always respect his \ndirectness. But I think that is really what the debate is about. I \nthink probably all of us need to understand, since some who have come \nto the floor have said they are against this amendment, if they are for \nthe war against drugs, this is not a debate about only a war on drugs, \nobviously from what colleagues have said. We have been down this road \nbefore. Now we are going to say we have decided that we have to support \nthe southern Colombia military, and we are going to put the money into \nthis military effort. If we are going to have Americans there \nsupporting it, we are taking sides. OK. As long as that is clear.\n  Third, my colleague from Illinois said that the police and the \nmilitary are in this together, and that they work together. I do not \nknow. Again, I didn't have a chance to visit Colombia. But I do know, \nat least from sort of the one time I was in Latin America and in my own \nstudy, that I always saw in these countries a great difference between \nthe police and the military. You see the police. They are low-level \nguys who do their job. The military are the ``Rambos.'' There is a \ndifference in the groups. They are an entirely different group of \npeople and entirely different people.\n  In all due respect, the evidence we have right now by one human \nrights organization after another after another after another, much \nless the State Department report, is that about 70 percent of the \nviolence has been committed thus far by paramilitary groups to which \nthe military quite often is linked. We haven't been able to vet that. \nAll of a sudden, we are going to be able to vet it, monitor it. We are \ngoing to be able to control it. I think that is a dubious proposition.\n  I think by militarizing this aid package we make a big mistake. I \nthink we could support this amendment which permits extensive \nassistance to Colombia while safeguarding U.S. interests and avoid \nentanglement in a decades-old civil conflict and partnership with an \narmy that is implicated in human rights abuses. Moreover, I think we \ncould take some of the resources and put them where they could do the \nmost good, which would be providing drug treatment programs at home.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, is the Senator from Kentucky able to yield \ntime to me?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 28 minutes, and he has 17 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time does the Senator from Delaware need?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand the Senator's dilemma.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 10 minutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Delaware 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator from Minnesota, \nknowing he was about to give me time, which is his nature. I appreciate \nthat.\n  Mr. President, my mom had an expression. Occasionally, when I was a \nkid, I think she had a good idea and was well intentioned. She would \nsay, ``Joey, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.''\n  I have no doubt about the intentions of my friend from Minnesota. I \nknow he knows that as the author of the drug czar legislation for the \npast, I guess it is about 14 years, I have issued every year a drug \nreport or an alternate drug report laying out a drug strategy for the \nUnited States, usually as a counterbalance on the Republican \nadministration and criticism or one of agreement with the \nadministration.\n  This debate reminds me a little bit of the position in which \nDemocrats have always been put. The Democrats get put in a position \nwhere we are told there is a dollar left and it can be distributed \namong the hearing impaired, the sight impaired, and those children \nneeding emergency medical care. So we have to choose. We have the blind \nfighting the disabled fighting the hearing impaired. Instead of saying \nwe can choose between building a highway and taking care of all the \nneeds of those in desperate need, or we cannot build a submarine, or an \nair base, whatever, we are debating about whether or not we can walk \nand chew gum at the same time.\n  There is no disagreement. I have, as well as my colleagues, pushed--\npushed in the early days when I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee--for major increases in treatment. I have issued a total of \nseven major reports on treatment, its value, its efficacy, and why we \nshould be doing more.\n  I take a backseat to no one in arguing that we do not give enough \ntreatment here in this drug war.\n  I point out that the President's budget, unrelated to the Colombian \naid package, has $6 billion in it for drug treatment and drug \nprevention. That total includes $300 million in funding increases in \nthis area. We don't have to take away from the money that, in fact, \nwould have a significant impact on the reduction of product here. That \nis the bad news.\n  The good news is that, as we have debated the Andean drug policy for \nthe past 12 years, we used to have to deal with the idea that Colombia \nwas a transiting country as well as a country that turned raw product \ninto the materials sold, and the laboratory work and product used to be \nproduced in Bolivia and Peru.\n  The good news is, because of eradication programs, because of U.N. \nleadership, I might add in this area, essentially there has been an \nelimination of the crop in those two countries.\n  The bad news is that it has all moved into Colombia. They now are a \nfull-service operation. The product is there, the narcotraffickers are \nthere, the laboratory laboratories are there, and the transiting is \nthere. That is the bad news.\n  The good news is it is all in one spot for us to be able to hit it. \nIt is all in one spot for us to have a very efficacious use of this \nmoney.\n  I spent days in Colombia. I spent 2 days, 24 hours a day, with the \nPresident of Colombia. I ended up actually going with him on his Easter \nvacation by accident to his summer residence. This is a guy, as my \nfriend from Illinois points out, that is the real deal.\n\n  For the first time, we have a President who understands that his \ndemocracy is at stake. He is willing to risk his life--not \nfiguratively, literally. I went to dinner with he and his children. He \nhas seven bodyguards around his children because of the death threats. \nThis is a guy who is risking his life. He is willing to do it because \nhe understands what is at stake for his country, unlike previous \nPresidents.\n  The next point is, we are making this distinction between police and \nmilitary. With all due respect to my friend from Minnesota, \nhistorically the thugs in South America have been the police. Police \nare not like police here. There is a national police; we have no \nnational police. The Federales in Mexico were police, not army. Often \nthe police in South America are the biggest abusers of human rights.\n  What did we do? We gave the Colombian National Police aid, $750 \nmillion in aid. What did we say? Purge this police department, purge \nthe national police, and they did. And guess what. If I stood on this \nfloor 5 years ago and said the Colombian police are going to crack the \nMedellin and Cali Cartel, no one would have said that is possible. No \none.\n  Guess what. They cracked the Medellin Cartel. They cracked the Cali \nCartel. They put them in jail. They are extraditing the police. Why? \nBecause we trained their police; they purged 4,000 of them.\n  Where are we on military? I met here with every major human rights \ngroup from Colombia, including the bishops who came up. When we push \nthem to the wall and say to them: By the way, you want us out?\n  No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. You have to \nstay in. You have to be involved. We don't like the balance the way you \nhave it here.\n  I say: Fine. No problem.\n  Tell me, bishop, you want us in or you want us out?\n  Stay. Stay.\n  Now, civil war. There is no civil war. We are so caught up in the old \nlogic of\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nhow we deal with things. There is no civil war. Less than 5 percent of \nthe people of Colombia support the guerrillas. Every other guerrilla \nmovement, every other civil war, you go into the village to recruit \npeople. They go in, as my friend Illinois said, to shoot people. There \nis no popular sentiment at all. This is not a civil war.\n  With regard to the paramilitaries, I called President Pastrana a few \nweeks ago. I said, a lot of the criticism of the plan is you have to be \nsure that you are only focusing on the FARC and the ELN and only \nfocusing on the guerrillas. What about the paramilitaries? I said, I \nwant a letter guaranteeing that you will, in fact, move on the \nparamilitary simultaneously. You must change.\n  He changed it. Here is the letter. I ask unanimous consent the letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Santefe de Bogota, May 8, 2000.\n     Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. \n         Senate.\n       Dear Joe: Thank you again for your visit to Colombia and \n     your support of my country. I greatly enjoyed our discussions \n     and valued your insights.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate, as I \n     did personally during your visit here, the commitment of my \n     government to attack drug trafficking and cultivation in all \n     parts of the country and not only in the south, no matter \n     what individual or organization may be promoting them.\n       This policy has been in effect since the beginning of my \n     administration, generating very important results. In 1999, \n     51,415 hectares of coca and poppy were sprayed, 31 tons of \n     coca and 691 kilos of heroin were seized, and 166 labs and 44 \n     airfields were destroyed. Just this past weekend, in an \n     extraordinarily successful operation in Norte de Santander on \n     the border with Venezuela, we were able to destroy 44 \n     laboratories and capture 20 persons, in an area linked to \n     illegal auto-defense organizations, but where guerrilla \n     groups and organized drug traffickers also operate.\n       Plan Colombia is an integral plan for peace designed, among \n     other goals, to eradicate drug cultivation and to address the \n     social problems created by the violence associated with drug \n     trafficking in all the producing regions with an emphasis on \n     the areas where there is the greatest cultivation and/or a \n     marked increase in cultivation in the recent past--areas \n     close to the Ecuadorian border in the south and to the \n     Venezuelan border in the north. Our priorities and the \n     sequence of eradication will depend on the resources \n     available to us, but you are correct in stating the principle \n     that we want to demonstrate that no trafficking organization \n     is immune.\n       Indeed, as you may know the initial effort of the plan \n     marks combined police, military, civilian operations in the \n     Department of Putumayo in the south where not only FARC but \n     also auto-defense organizations are present. In that regard, \n     the coordinated effort at drug eradication alternative \n     development, support for the internally displaced, human \n     rights protection, democratic governance, judicial reform and \n     promotion of the rule of law will work to diminish drug-\n     trafficking and violence in this fragile amazon region. We \n     enjoyed your visit and hope to have you again as our guest. \n     Your interest and that of your government in my nation's \n     future strengthens our commitment and gives us crucial \n     international support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Andres Pastrana Arango,\n                                            President of Colombia.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. When I said, do we take sides? The answer is, yes, we take \nsides. We are not putting anybody in the field. What are we doing? We \nare training three battalions. Why are we training them? For the same \nreason we train the police. We want to open up the eyes of the \nColombian military, who in recent years have been accused of fewer \nhuman rights abuses. They have been accused of turning their heads. \nThey hear the paramilitary coming, they lift the gate, the paramilitary \ncomes through, the paramilitary terminates people, and they go back \nout.\n  Then they ask, what happened?\n  That is what they are doing.\n  Plan Colombia does not only involve U.S. participation. This is a \n$7.5 billion plan. The Colombians are coming up with $4 billion; the \nEuropeans, about $1 billion and the international financial \ninstitutions about $1 billion. If we take out our piece, it all falls \napart. We are not the only game in town. But we are the catalyst. What \nwill happen? The whole world is going to be looking to the Colombian \nmilitary, from Japan to Bonn, because they are all in the deal. They \nare all in the deal. If you want to clean up anybody, anything, any \ninstitution, listen to the dictates of a former Supreme Court Justice: \nThe best disinfectant is the clear light of day.\n  There will be a worldwide spotlight shined upon this military. I have \nnever personally testified on the floor that I have faith in an \nindividual leader, but I have faith in President Pastrana. He is the \nreal deal. What is at stake is whether or not Colombia becomes a \nnarcostate or not. This is not in between. Keep in mind, folks, when \nthe Supreme Courts of Colombia several years ago extradited some, they \nblew the Court up; they blew the building up and killed seven Justices. \nWhen a Presidential candidate took them on, they shot him dead.\n  This is the real stuff. It is not like a Member of this body. The \nworst thing that happens to us is we get a drive-by shooting \npolitically and we lose office. There, you jump in the sucker and you \nlose your life. This is for real. These are courageous people who \nfinally have said: We will take them on.\n  I am convinced--knowing the chairman, and my friend from Kentucky is \na hard-nosed guy--he made a judgment whether these guys are real. He is \nnot about to give $1 billion to anybody.\n  My colleagues, it is very basic. There is a lot at stake. We have a \nsignificant increase in funding for treatment and prevention. It should \nbe more. But we have an obligation, in the interests of our children \nand the interests of the hemisphere, to keep the oldest democracy in \nplace, to give them a fighting chance to keep from becoming a \nnarcostate. Folks, if they lose, mark my words, we are going to reap \nthe whirlwind in this hemisphere on matters that go far beyond drugs. \nIt will include terrorism, it will include whole cadres of issues we \nhave not thought about.\n  I thank the chairman for his time. I truly appreciate the motivation \nof my friend from Minnesota. At the appropriate time, unless the \nchairman of the committee does not want me to, I move to table. I am \nnot trying to cut off discussion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Delaware for an important \ncontribution and assure him at the appropriate time it would be \nappropriate for him to make a motion to table.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nthis amendment and for this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, listening to the Senator from Delaware, \none would think the Wellstone amendment is taking away all the funding \nfrom Colombia. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is leaving in place the funding for \nColombia; that makes good sense. Here is what is left in this bill \nafter the Senator's amendment: Funding for interdiction; funding for \nthe Colombia police; funds for alternative development and internally \ndisplaced people; funds for human rights; funds for regional \nassistance; funds to rehabilitate soldiers under the age of 18 who have \nbeen involved in armed conflict.\n  The only thing the Senator from Minnesota is doing in his amendment \nis making sure this country doesn't get involved in a conflict that \ncould hurt our people eventually. The Senator from Minnesota is saying \nwe are going to help President Pastrana, we will help this country, we \nwill help this region, but we are not going to get involved with the \nmilitary.\n  I thank the Senator from the bottom of my heart for this amendment. I \ndon't care if the Senator gets 2 votes or 22 votes; he is doing the \nright thing.\n  I clearly understand the threat that illegal drugs pose to our \ncountry, to my State of California, and I clearly understand that \nColombia is a major supplier of the cocaine and heroin that reach our \nshores. But let me tell my friends in the Senate, we need a balanced \napproach to this horrible problem of drug abuse. You could have a big \nsupply, but if no one wanted to buy it, it would not hurt anyone. The \nfact is, the people in this country want to buy it. And there is not 1 \ncent in this bill, out of $1 billion--not 1 cent to help us with \neducation, treatment on demand, prevention. This is a lost opportunity. \nWhat my friend from Minnesota is saying is, if we in this Chamber are \nsincere\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nabout fighting drugs, and a war on drugs, then we do not put $1 billion \ninto a foreign country and ignore what is happening here at home.\n  Let me tell you what happens in California and all over this country \nwhen someone is arrested for a violent crime. Mr. President, 50 percent \nto 75 percent of those perpetrators of this violence are high on drugs. \nI cannot tell you how many times when I have been in my State--maybe it \nis because my State is a large State--that I have someone come up to \nme, a parent, saying: I have a son or a daughter who wants to get off \ndrugs; there is no room in a treatment center; we don't have money; we \nhave to spend a lot of money; what are we going to do?\n  I look at that person and all I can say is: Send me a letter and let \nme see if we can help you find some treatment program that might have a \nslot.\n  Does it make sense to spend $1 billion, as this bill does, and ignore \nthe emergency here at home? We are so quick to find the money to send \nsomewhere else, but what about our people who are ready, perhaps, to \ntake that step to get off drugs? Telling them they have to wait 6 \nmonths to get into a program is consigning them to more months of \naddiction. What happens if we can stop this whole thing before it \nstarts, with education, with prevention? I do not quite understand the \nenthusiasm for a bill that does not spend a penny here at home.\n  My friend from Delaware is as eloquent as anyone on this floor. He \nsays, ``Yes, we are spending more.'' Yes, we are spending more in our \nregular appropriation, but if we are facing such a horrible emergency \nthat we have to go in, with $1 billion, I have to say to my friend, why \ncan't we see this emergency here at home, when people cannot get \ntreatment on demand? You don't have a sale if you don't have a willing \nbuyer. Unfortunately, the addicts are here, in this country.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Why doesn't the Senator have an amendment to take $1 \nbillion out of the highway trust fund or $1 billion out of the \neducation budget or $1 billion out of NIH or $1 billion out of the \nDepartment of Energy?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to answer it. Because this is $1 billion \nto deal with the drug problem specifically. That is the point of it. \nThe Senator made that point. The Senator from Illinois made that point. \nThis is money that we are spending because we are stunned at the drug \ntrafficking that is going on--and we should be. All the Senator from \nMinnesota is saying in his amendment, which I am proud to support, is \nwe will leave 75 percent of that money intact to do the things we want \nto do to help the good President of Colombia. But all we are saying is \nbefore we get our advisers caught in a situation over there--you know, \nyou may be right. Maybe nothing will ever go wrong with it. But all we \nare saying is, how about fighting a drug war here at home for a change \ninstead of always spending the money outside of this country?\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will my distinguished colleague yield for another \nquestion, just 10 seconds?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is aware the President's budget calls for \nspending $6 billion in drug treatment and prevention, including $31 \nmillion for substance abuse block grants; that is $54 million on \ntargeted capacity expansion programs, $37 million for research and \ntreatment, $5 million--the list goes on. The Senator is aware of that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may take back my time, and I will not be able to \nfurther yield because I have such a restriction, I stated that. I gave \nmy friend absolute assurance I understand that. We are not doing enough \nwhen 50 percent----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of the addicts in my State are not getting treatment. \nOnly 50 percent can get treatment. The other 50 percent, unless they \nare rich, cannot get the treatment on demand.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For my colleague from California, just so she knows, \nthe particular program we are talking about, which is the block grant, \nthe SAMHSA block grant program to our States and communities for \ntreatment programs, is $1.6 billion.\n  My colleague's figure lumps everything and anything together.\n  Mr. BIDEN. On treatment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am talking about direct treatment out in the \ncommunity. When 80 percent of the adolescents in this country get no \ntreatment whatsoever, and 60 percent of the adults get no treatment \nwhatsoever, it is hard to come out on the floor and say we have already \nmade this tremendous commitment, there is no reason to talk about some \nadditional resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, I represent the largest State in the Union. My \nfriend represents a smaller State. I would just say, maybe it is my \nState, but when I see these figures coming back--and my friend is a \nleader in the whole issue of crime prevention and being tough on crime \nand all the rest, and he knows it is true that if you look at the \narrests for violent crime in our country--I could say particularly in \nCalifornia, 50 to 75 percent of the perpetrators are high on drugs. So \nall my friend from Minnesota is saying in his amendment is everything \nthe Senator said about President Pastrana, everything he said about the \nneed to help his country--I don't argue with that. That is why I am \nproud of this amendment. Everything is left in except getting us \ninvolved in this counternarcotics insurgency, which may well put us in \na situation where we find ourselves between two bad actors: the FARC on \nthe one hand, with a horrible story of violence and human rights \nviolations, and the paramilitary on the right-hand side here, with the \nsame horrible record. Unfortunately, it ties to the military in \nColombia.\n  So here we are, giving us a chance to do all the good things in this \nappropriations bill that we are happy are in there, but to take out the \none for $225 million, that could lead us into trouble.\n\n  Here is the Boston Globe. They talk about targeting addiction. They \nsay:\n\n       The Clinton proposal for U.S. intervention in Colombia's \n     Civil War----\n\n  And that is what is being supported on this floor. They say it really \nisn't going to work. They finish saying:\n\n       History suggests that increased funding for treatment of \n     addicts and programs for prevention--treatment on demand for \n     drugs--can accomplish more to ameliorate the individual and \n     social pathology associated with the endless war on drugs.\n\n  This is the Boston Globe. We have a number of editorials that are \nvery strong on this point.\n  This is the St. Petersburg Times. We have these from all over the \ncountry:\n\n       Have we forgotten the lessons of our involvement in Central \n     America in the 1980s . . .?\n\n  They talk about the fact:\n\n       In an attempt to contain communism, our government provided \n     support to right-wing governments and paramilitary groups \n     that used the aid to slaughter thousands of innocent \n     civilians. This time, America's stated public interest is \n     stopping drug trafficking.\n\n  But, it says:\n\n       It could, however, draw us into a brutal civil war in which \n     civilians are a target.\n\n  This would be a tragedy if we repeated that kind of scenario. We have \nto learn from history. I think the amendment of the Senator is \nprotecting us from just this problem.\n\n       Washington should have learned long ago that partnership \n     with an abusive and ineffective Latin American military \n     rarely produces positive results and often undermines \n     democracy in the region.\n\n  That is from the New York Times. It talks about the fact that \nPresident Pastrana is well intentioned, but all of the programs he \nfaces, we are going to be faced with them as well.\n  Then, from the Detroit News:\n\n       Colombia: The Next Quagmire?\n       The Clinton Administration's proposed aid package intends \n     to break the choke hold of the guerrillas by training and \n     arming Colombia's military. The hope is that returning \n     control to a legitimate government will help curb the \n     illegitimate narcotrade. But this is a naive hope that \n     ignores the other half of Colombia's gritty ground reality. \n     The military is a corrupt institution with close links to the \n     outlawed paramilitary groups that control the drug trade in \n     urban areas.\n\n  It goes on. This is not Senator Boxer speaking or Senator Wellstone. \nThese are editorial boards from all over the country.\n  We have others from California that I wanted to have printed in the \nRecord. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\n      [From the Sacramento Bee, View Related Topics July 31, 1999]\n\n       Five American soldiers were killed in a plane crash the \n     other day in a mountainous region of Colombia. They were on a \n     reconnaissance flight as part of an escalating U.S. effort in \n     support of the Colombian government's war against heavily \n     armed narcotics traffickers.\n       The deaths call attention to a U.S. aid program that has \n     grown rapidly, partly because Washington has more confidence \n     in Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, than in his \n     corrupt predecessor, and partly because of a perception that \n     the threat to this country posed by Colombian traffickers is \n     increasing.\n       That perception is strongly held by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, \n     President Clinton's anti-narcotics chief, who says cocaine \n     production in Colombia has doubled in three years, that 80 \n     percent of the cocaine and heroin entering the United States \n     comes from Colombia and that traffickers have amassed so much \n     wealth that they can buy all the weapons and recruit all the \n     fighters they need, especially in a time of economic hardship \n     for most Colombians, to fend off poorly trained and \n     underarmed government forces.\n       McCaffrey has called for $1 billion in emergency U.S. aid \n     to combat the drug trade in Latin America, most of it for \n     Colombia, which is getting $289 million this year--triple \n     last year's total. (Colombia now ranks third, behind Israel \n     and Egypt, as a U.S. aid recipient.) The money would pay for \n     technical and intelligence assistance, and training by U.S. \n     advisers of a newly created anti-narcotics army battalion \n     whose mission is to attack guerrilla units, clearing the way \n     for police (who get most U.S. aid) to move in and eradicate \n     coca crops.\n       But there are serious obstacles. For one thing, U.S. aid \n     has been meager in the past not only due to corruption but \n     because of rampant human rights violations by soldiers and \n     right-wing paramilitary groups. Thus the new battalion has \n     been carefully recruited and will receive human rights \n     training.\n       A larger problem is that U.S. aid is meant to target only \n     Colombia's narcotics traffickers, not a 35-year-old leftist \n     insurgency. Yet the two have become virtually \n     indistinguishable as guerrillas extort tribute from coca \n     growers and traffic in drugs as well. The largest guerrilla \n     group now controls much of the southern half of the country \n     thanks to Pastrana's policy--deemed naive by many Colombians \n     and by some U.S. officials.--of keeping troops out of the \n     region as an inducement to the rebels to negotiate a peace \n     settlement. But the rebels, while enjoying their immunity, \n     have stalled negotiations.\n       Despite such troubling signs, McCaffrey appears to have \n     strong support in Congress, and to some extent from the White \n     House, for increasing U.S. aid even as drug prevention and \n     treatment programs at home are given only minimal funding. \n     Those priorities are misplaced.\n       The Pentagon insists that U.S. combat troops will not be \n     used in Colombia. Good. But Americans have heard that before, \n     about Vietnam, and rebels say they regard U.S. advisers as \n     targets. While it may be premature to sound an alarm, it's \n     not too early to begin a debate about U.S. interests in a \n     conflict that has at least the potential to suck Americans \n     into another quagmire. Congress and the administration owe it \n     to the country to clarify what's at stake, what is \n     contemplated and what is not, and the sooner the better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee April 5, 2000]\n\nAnti-Drug Folly: U.S. Aid Plan Would Raise Stakes in Colombian Conflict\n\n       By a wide margin, the House of Representatives has approved \n     $1.7 billion to aid Colombia in its fight against drug \n     traffickers who supply the bulk of the cocaine and heroin to \n     the United States. The aim is laudable, but the chances of \n     success seem slight. Before the Senate takes up the measure, \n     which the Clinton administration strongly supports, there \n     must an intensive national debate.\n       The legislation bans the use of U.S. combat troops, but \n     allows that U.S. advisers be sent to train Colombian forces \n     in the use of U.S. helicopters and other equipment and to \n     ensure that American aid is used properly--in particular, \n     that human rights are respected by specially trained \n     Colombian anti-narcotics battalions. Such constraint is \n     important.\n       But staying within those limits will be difficult, given \n     the immense terrain involved, the history of human rights \n     abuses in Colombia and the legislative mandate that aid can \n     be used only against drug traffickers and not against leftist \n     guerrillas who often collaborate with them. And if right-wing \n     death squads that have been closely linked to elements of the \n     Colombian military continue to operate, some of the blame \n     will inevitably accrue to the U.S. program, fairly or not. \n     Add to that Colombia's endemic corruption, deadly political \n     intimidation and the ease with which drug crops can be \n     shifted from areas eradicated and the task seems \n     overwhelming.\n       Undaunted, U.S. officials want funding to be expedited. \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott objects, not to aid for \n     Colombia but to folding it into a $12.7 billion supplemental \n     appropriations bill that includes other military aid, \n     domestic flood relief and various pork-barrel projects. He's \n     right; the Colombian program is too critical to be obscured \n     by typical election-year log-rolling.\n       Opponents fear, reasonably, that the United States could \n     become ensnared in a foreign civil war that is not a vital \n     U.S. interest and that is probably unwinnable without far \n     more intervention than most Americans would support. Backers \n     say that Colombia's plight is a vital U.S. interest because \n     of the impact among drug-addicted Americans. But every study, \n     and common sense, tell us that the solution lies mostly at \n     home--in prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs \n     that badly need more funds.\n       In short, the onus is on the administration to persuade \n     Americans that this program is not the beginning of an open-\n     ended commitment.\n       U.S. aid to Colombia may be justified, but only if it is \n     carefully defined and performance-based in terms of military \n     success and democratic reform. Otherwise, it could turn out \n     to be another nightmare that might have been avoided had we \n     paid closer attention going in.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 15, 2000]\n\nColombia Aid Bill Would Escalate a Failed Policy; Drugs: Treatment and \n           Reducing Cocaine Consumption is a Better Way To Go\n\n                            (By Robert Dowd)\n\n       U.S. demand created the drug crisis situation in Colombia, \n     and our military intervention there merely places American \n     troops and civilian contractors in harm's way in an effort to \n     salvage our failed drug policy.\n       The Clinton administration has proposed, and congressional \n     Republicans seem prepared to accept, a $1.7-billion military \n     aid package to Colombia. This formiable expenditure builds on \n     existing aid--Colombia is already the largest recipient of \n     U.S. military aid outside the Middle East--and involves us \n     more deeply in a 4-decades-old civil war, as well as \n     perpetuates programs that have failed to control drug \n     production.\n       As a veteran, I know the importance of a clear military \n     objective, of having the resources needed for success, and a \n     clear exit strategy. In Colombia, we are sending a handful of \n     helicopters and a few hundred of troops. Yet we were unable \n     to control a smaller Vietnam with hundreds of helicopters and \n     half a million troops.\n       The Colombia military intervention seems poorly planned, \n     unrealistic and doomed to fail. After a few years of military \n     support, we will face the choice of accepting defeat or \n     gradually being pulled into an expensive military quagmire in \n     which victory is unattainable.\n       The reason the U.S. is becoming more involved in Colombia's \n     internal affairs is that our government's efforts to reduce \n     cocaine availability have failed miserably, and drug money \n     has strengthened the rebel armies. We already spend hundreds \n     of millions of dollars annually to eradicate crops in South \n     America, especially in Colombia. According to a 1999 report \n     by the General Accounting Office, ``Despite two years of \n     extensive herbicide spraying, U.S. estimates show there has \n     not been any net reduction in coca cultivation--net coca \n     cultivation actually increased 50%.''\n       Rather than escalate a failed policy, we should recognize \n     that the present strategy cannot succeed and look for new \n     approaches.\n       According to the Rand Corp., eradication is the least-\n     effective way to reduce drug use. Rand's research found that \n     $34 million spent on drug treatment in the U.S. would have \n     the same effect as $783 million in eradication expenditures. \n     Naturally, the less cocaine the U.S. consumes, the less \n     incentive growers in Colombia will have to grow coca. That \n     would be the best eradication policy.\n       Further, we need to face the difficult and politically \n     controversial question of whether prohibition enforced by the \n     drug war provides better control of the drug market than \n     regulation enforced by administrative law. If we want to get \n     international cartels and urban gangs out of the drug market \n     we must determine how to control the market through civil law \n     rather than criminal law.\n       The administration's most frequent rationale for pumping \n     millions of dollars in aid and tons of military equipment \n     into Colombia is the need to fight ``narco-guerrillas.'' In \n     fact, there are reports that all sides--including the side \n     the U.S. supports, the Colombian military--have been tied to \n     the drug trade. It seems that we are supporting one group of \n     drug traffickers while opposing another group.\n       The Colombian aid package is nothing more than an \n     introduction to a quagmire and an escalation of failed drug \n     policy.\n       The administration and Congress should step back and \n     formulate goals they want to achieve in Colombia and then \n     determine how best to achieve them without promoting \n     bloodshed and lawlessness.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I associate myself with their \nconclusion:\n\n       While it may be premature to sound an alarm, it's not too \n     early to begin a debate about U.S. interests in a conflict \n     that has at least the potential to suck Americans into \n     another quagmire. Congress and the administration owe it to \n     the country to clarify what's at stake, what is contemplated \n     and what is not, and the sooner the better.\n\n  The L.A. Times says:\n\n       The administration's most frequent rationale for pumping \n     millions of dollars in aid and tons of military equipment \n     into Colombia is the need to fight ``narco-guerrillas.'' In \n     fact, there are reports that all sides--including the side \n     the U.S. supports, the Colombian military--have been tied to \n     the drug trade. It seems that we are supporting one group of \n     drug traffickers while opposing another group.\n\n  Let's look at this one. What are we doing? We have the left wing on \none side killing people, human rights violations, and violent. We have \nthe right wing on the other side, with which the Colombian military \noftentimes sides, and they are doing the same thing from the right. In \ncomes the United States of America advisers--and I know we have some \nadvisers there already; I am aware of that, but this is clearly an \nescalation of our involvement through the donation of these helicopters \nand advisers--and they are going to become targets in the middle \nbetween the left and the right wings.\n  Even though we say they are there to fight drug trafficking, which is \nlaudable, they may well go into the jungles and encounter some of the \nleft-wing guerrillas and find themselves in a pretty horrible \nsituation, which is something about which we need to be clear and why I \nam so proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment and why, quite frankly, \nI am a little surprised there is not more concern in the Senate.\n  There is a Fresno Bee editorial that is excellent. It says in part:\n\n       [This amendment] allows that U.S. advisers be sent to train \n     Colombian forces in the use of U.S. helicopters and other \n     equipment. . . . And if right-wing death squads that have \n     been closely linked to elements of the Colombian military \n     continue to operate, some of the blame will inevitably accrue \n     to the U.S. program. . . .\n\n  That is another fear. What could be more important to us as Members \nof the Senate than making sure people do not get hurt in our country, \nin the world, that we work for peace and all the right things? If \nsomehow our dollars wind up helping paramilitary groups and they commit \nhuman rights abuses and killings--and we know the list of these abuses; \nthey are horrible--somehow it is definitely going to come back to us. \nIt is going to come back to us, and I do not want that on my hands. I \ndo not want that on the hands of the people from my State.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is giving us today an opportunity to do \nall the good things we should do in Colombia. I will go through them \nagain. There are important things he has left in this bill.\n  He is only taking out 25 percent of this money and transferring it to \nthis country to help us in a war on drugs in our Nation.\n  He is leaving in interdiction, $132 million to pay for new aircraft, \nupgrades for existing aircraft, secure communications, sea- and river-\nbased interdiction.\n  He is leaving in $93 million for Colombian police to pay for spray \naircraft, helicopter upgrade, communications, ammunition, equipment.\n  He is leaving in funds for alternative development for internally \ndisplaced people, $109 million--funds to help displaced people.\n  He is leaving in human-rights-boosting government capabilities. This \nfunding would provide for the protection of human rights workers, \njudicial reform, training of judges, prison security--all the things \nPresident Pastrana needs to strengthen the institutions in Colombia.\n  He is leaving in regional assistance for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. \nThis funding would be used for alternative development programs in \nthese nearby countries.\n  He is leaving in $5 million to help rehabilitate child soldiers, \nchildren who got involved in this conflict.\n  For people to talk against this amendment as if it is eviscerating \naid to Colombia, eviscerating aid to President Pastrana, they have not \nread the Wellstone amendment. The only thing he is taking out is this \ninvolvement on the ground with this counterinsurgency against the \nnarcotics.\n  As I look around my State and I read the studies from my State--for \nexample, in Ventura County, CA, a beautiful part of our State where \nthere is a lot of agriculture and open space and it looks like \nparadise, 40 percent of the county's homeless population is related to \ndrug abuse or alcohol abuse. A San Francisco study found in 1998 that \ndrug abuse was the leading killer of the homeless. There are over \n500,000 drug-related emergency room episodes every year.\n  In 1995, nationwide, drug abuse cost $12 billion in health care--$12 \nbillion in health care costs--and the good Senator is suggesting $225 \nmillion so we can cut down on those expenses. It is an investment to \ncut down on these costs.\n  The loss of productivity in 1992 has been calculated at $69.4 \nbillion. That is a 1-year loss of productivity.\n  In summing up, I consider myself someone who is good at solving \nproblems, and the way one solves problems is not putting blinders on \nand going in one direction, but looking at the whole problem. With the \nWellstone amendment, taking $225 million and putting it in this country \nso we can stop people from becoming addicts and, if they are addicts, \nhelp them get off drugs, this is going to be a really good and balanced \nbill, one that I will be proud to support.\n\n  Again, I thank him for leaving in this package the kinds of things we \nneed to do to build democracy in Colombia, to make sure that regime \nsucceeds, to train the people who need to be trained in judicial \nreform, to help human rights, to help the child soldiers, and to take \nthat $225 million that will involve us, unwittingly, in what I consider \nto be a civil war, to take that out, bring it home--bring it home to \nCalifornia, bring it home to Georgia, bring it home to Minnesota, bring \nit home to New Hampshire, bring it home to our cities and our \ncounties--and let people get the help they need, the help they deserve.\n  So I say to my friend, thank you for your courage in offering this. I \nam proud to stand with you.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield it back to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know the Senator from Georgia is here. I just want \nto thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes of our \ntime and, of course, reserve the remainder of the time when I conclude \nmy remarks for our side.\n  We have heard a lot of interesting remarks. I rise against the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota. I associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Delaware.\n  I would like to try to not repeat everything that has been said but \ntry to underscore several fundamental basic points with regard to these \nissues.\n  The first is that over the last 8 years, funding for drug treatment \nand drug prevention has increased by $1.6 billion. I repeat, it has \nincreased over the last 8 years. The amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota would increase it even further.\n  On the interdiction side of the ledger, during the same 8 years, \nthere has been a decrease in the funding for interdiction. So \ninterdiction is dropping and treatment and prevention is growing.\n  What happens when the Federal Government moves away from its \nresponsibilities to protect our borders and to\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nengage international narcotics entities? I can tell you what happens. \nThe United States is flooded with more drugs--because there is nothing \nthere to stop that--the price of those drugs plummets, and more of our \nchildren become addicted to narcotics. Almost the reverse of what this \namendment seeks to achieve happens.\n  As of Friday, June 9, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \ngave us these alarming figures. In 1991--so this is the same timeframe \nI have been talking about--14.7 percent, about 15 percent, said they \nused marijuana. Who is ``they''? They are 9-year-olds to 12-year-olds--\nchildren 9 years old. By 1999, the figure was 27 percent.\n  This is the period we are all talking about here, where our \ninterdiction dropped and where we increased treatment and prevention. \nWhat has happened? We have had more and more youngsters--kids, \nchildren--using drugs.\n  In 1991, 31 percent of students reported they tried marijuana at \nleast once. By 1999, when we cut off the interdiction, it had grown to \n47 percent.\n  In 1991, 1.7 percent of students said they used cocaine. By 1999, 8 \nyears later--no interdiction--4 percent said they used cocaine. It \ndoubled.\n  What we have essentially seen is that, while we have increased the \nprevention, while we have increased the treatment, and lowered \ninterdiction, more and more kids have taken up using drugs.\n  I have to tell you, the greatest prevention program in the world and \nthe greatest treatment program in the world is to keep the student--the \nchild--from using them in the first place.\n  Point No. 2, our borders and our work with international partners, \nwhether it is Colombia or Bolivia, or Peru, or Panama--you name it--is \nthe sole responsibility of the Federal Government. No other entity can \npractice the interdiction. Georgia cannot do it. California cannot do \nit. Minnesota cannot do it. Only the U.S. Federal Government can \nexercise the muscle to protect our borders and to work with our \nalliances.\n  Prevention and treatment require Federal support, which has been \ngrowing rapidly, with State support and community support. It is a \nmultifaceted effort and should be there. But only the Federal \nGovernment can do what this underlying bill suggests has to be done.\n  Point No. 3, the battle in Colombia is not an ideological battle. It \nstarted out that way, but it isn't anymore. This is a battle against a \nnarcotics insurgency. They have 3 percent support in the entire \ncountry. In that country, 33,000 people have been killed fighting this. \nAnd 800,000 Colombians are displaced, as in Kosovo, and we are going to \nturn our back?\n\n  Colombia sits in the center of the Andean region and has already \npushed its trouble into Panama, into Ecuador, and into Peru. The entire \nregion is being affected by this struggle to maintain a democratic \ngovernment in Colombia. War is a very ugly thing. It is particularly \nugly when it is driven by narcotics and narcotics money, by people who \ncare for no life, none of these 9- to 12-year-olds, no person, not even \ntheir own citizens who would be laced with armaments and blown up.\n  Will this be a perfect exercise? No. It isn't a perfect world. And \nthis is a very imperfect circumstance.\n  We have told the people of Colombia--the President of the United \nStates; his representatives, from Ambassador Pickering to General \nMcCaffrey--that we understand the scope of this problem, both its \nrelationship to Colombia, the United States, and the entire hemisphere, \nand that we are going to help, and that we are going to join the \nEuropeans, and we are going to join the Colombians in the struggle; \nthat we are going to train; that we are going to work on human rights; \nthat we are going to work on social institutions and the fundamentals \nof law and the judiciary.\n  Legislation to do that was introduced last October. The President and \nthe White House endorsed their version of it--it is very similar--in \nFebruary. Here we are in nearly July and we are tied up in knots. You \ncan only say, ``The cavalry is coming'' for so long.\n  The funds for drug treatment and prevention that the Senator from \nMinnesota seeks have been growing and growing rapidly. The interdiction \nhas been collapsing. When it collapses, more drugs are available. The \nnumber of kids using drugs has almost doubled--9-year-olds, 10- and 11- \nand 12-year-olds.\n  The Federal responsibility is to not allow that into our country, and \nno State can do that. This amendment undermines the sole purpose the \nFederal Government has on this issue. This amount of money can be \nsought in 50 different States in 1,000 different communities, which \nthey ought to contribute.\n  Interdiction has collapsed; utilization by our children has doubled. \nIt is a Federal responsibility to address this problem. We better get \non with it. Colombia is the heart of it. If we lose there, we lose \neverywhere. You can't win a war by just treating the wounded.\n  I retain the balance of my time for the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \nthe time will be run off equally from both sides.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Would \nthe time be equally divided in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be equally charged if neither side \nyields time. However, if the Senator suggests the absence of a quorum, \nit will come off of his time, unless there is a unanimous consent \nrequest otherwise.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will now run equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year's foreign operations bill \nprovides $934 million in emergency supplemental funding toward the \nadministration's request for plan Colombia.\n  I again want to express my appreciation to Senator McConnell, and \nother members of the Appropriations Committee, for supporting \nprovisions in the bill that will help protect human rights and \nstrengthen the rule of law in Colombia.\n  I have repeatedly expressed concerns about the administration's \nproposal, particularly the dramatic increase in military assistance. I \nam troubled about what we may be getting into. The administration has \nyet to give me sufficient details about what it expects to achieve, in \nwhat period of time, what the long-term costs are, or what the risks \nare.\n  What the administration has said is that in addition to reducing the \namount of drugs supplied from abroad, Plan Colombia is intended to \nprevent increases in drug addiction, violence, and crime here at home.\n  Those are goals that I strongly support, and I commend Senator \nWellstone for his amendment. It would provide $225 million for \nsubstance abuse prevention and treatment programs in the United States.\n  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, drug abuse \nkills 52,000 Americans each year. It costs our society nearly $110 \nbillion annually. It has strained the capacity of our criminal justice \nsystem and our medical facilities, and brought violence and tragedy to \nfamilies, schools, and communities throughout this country.\n  As of 1996, there were more than 13.6 million illicit drug users in \nthe United States. Some 50 percent of adults in immediate need of drug \ntreatment are not receiving it, and many treatment programs have lines \nout the door.\n  Eighty percent of adolescents who need treatment--those who will, if \nnot provided treatment, sustain the demand for drugs in the future--\ncannot get it.\n  We should help Colombia. I support President Pastrana's efforts to \ncombat the violence, corruption, and poverty which plagues his country. \nBut I am not convinced that the administration's request for Plan \nColombia will effectively address those problems, nor is it likely to \nreduce the flow of drugs into our country or ameliorate the drug \nproblem here at home.\n  We do know, however, that substance abuse treatment and prevention \nprograms work. A frequently cited Rand study showed that, dollar for \ndollar, providing treatment to cocaine users is 10 times more effective \nthan drug interdiction efforts, and 23 times more cost effective than \neradicating coca at its source. Scientific advances promise to make \nfuture treatment and prevention programs even better.\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\n  Ultimately, reducing the demand for drugs--which is what these \nprograms do--is the only long-term solution to reducing the flow of \nillegal drugs from Colombia and elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Wellstone for his leadership on this \nissue and I urge other Senators to support his amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the situation in \nColombia and the question of the U.S. role there.\n  The situation in Colombia has been correctly described as grave. To \nthe extent that ``grave'' can be considered an understatement, however, \nthat is the case with respect to the ongoing conflict in that strife-\ntorn country. The issue ostensibly before us involves the war on drugs. \nWhat is being contemplated, however, should under no conditions be \nconsidered a simple extension of that struggle. What is being \nconsidered is nothing less than an escalated U.S. role in what has \nincreasingly become an all-out civil war. The relationship between the \nnarcotics trafficking that we seek to curtail and the insurgency that \nwe oppose but dare not engage has become dangerously blurred. To \ncontemplate engaging one but not the other is to labor under an \nillusion of alarming dimensions.\n  Mr. President, the conditions on the ground in Colombia are not in \ndoubt. A large, highly motivated, well-armed and funded guerrilla army, \nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and the smaller but equally \nlethal National Liberation Front, have emerged over the last two years \nas a serious threat not just to Colombia, but to the entire Andean \nregion. The FARC, in particular, has evolved into a large-scale threat \nto regional stability. Look carefully at the operations the FARC has \ncarried out over the past two years. What you will see is impressive \nand alarming. Sophisticated battalion-size operations against Colombian \nmilitary and police units, including coordinated multi-objective \noperations spread out across Colombia have become the norm. The March \n1998 battle at El Billar, for example, demonstrated the FARC's ability \nto conduct battalion-size operations employing refined tactics like \nmaneuver warfare against Colombia's best trained units. In a separate \noperation, a 1,200-strong guerrilla force successfully carried out \nsimultaneous attacks on an anti-narcotics police installation and the \narmy base at Miraflores, overwhelming both.\n  This should give us pause. The Colombian government's position is \nprecarious. Already, the fighting has touched Colombia's neighbors. \nPanama, which lacks a military as a result of the post-invasion \nstructure the United States imposed on that country, is now threatened \nby cross-border incursions by guerrillas, whose main arms pipeline \ncrosses its border with Colombia. Colombia's other neighbors in \nEcuador, Peru and Venezuela are all feeling the heat from the war in \nColombia, the latter in the form of refugees escaping the fighting.\n  I point all of this out, Mr. President, because no one here should be \nunder any doubt that the path down which we are heading is potentially \nfraught with peril. I don't know anyone who actually believes that Plan \nColombia is the answer to that country's problems; we support it \nbecause we are at a loss for viable alternatives. But a guerrilla army \nas capable as the FARC will not be defeated by three specially-trained \nand equipped battalions. Much more is needed, including fundamental \nreform and restructuring of the Colombian armed forces to reverse the \nratio of combat units to rear-area units--a key reason an army of \n140,000 is stretched so thin against guerrilla armies numbering around \n20,000.\n\n  And the army and police must be thoroughly inculcated with the need \nto respect human rights. This not just a moral imperative, but a \npractical one as well. Human rights abuses by government forces \nincreases sympathy for guerrilla armies that otherwise lack serious \npopular support. It is never easy, as we learned in Vietnam, to fight a \nguerrilla army that can melt into civilian surroundings and build an \ninfrastructure of support, through force and intimidation if necessary, \nthat government forces are hard-pressed to defeat without inflicting \ncivilian casualties. But Colombia's army and police must not \nunderestimate the importance of maintaining constant vigilance in \nrespecting the rights of the people they purport to defend.\n  The United States role in Plan Colombia is, to date, limited to \ntraining the aforementioned special battalions and equipping them with \nmodern helicopters. Toward this end, we are sending special forces \nteams into the field in the midst of that civil war. The primary role \nof U.S. Army Special Forces is the provision of such training. But we \nmust be assured that their role will not extend to that of active \ncombatants. The bond that will surely develop between our soldiers and \nthose they are training must not extend to a gradual expansion of their \nrole in Colombia.\n  And with respect to the issue of helicopters, Mr. President, I find \nit deplorable that the question of which helicopter should be provided \nto Colombia should be decided on the basis of any consideration other \nthan operational requirements. Blackhawks were selected for the \ncapabilities they provide, capabilities that are not inconsequential in \nterms of the Counter-Narcotics Battalions' ability to deploy to the \nfield with the speed and in the number required to confront opposing \nforces. Their substitution by the Appropriations Committee with Super \nHueys goes beyond the usual fiscally irresponsible approach to \nlegislating that permeates Congress. It is, in fact, morally wrong. We \nare talking life and death decisions here: the ability of soldiers to \nfight a war. That decisions on their equipment should be decided on the \nbasis of parochial considerations is reprehensible.\n  Let me return, though, to the fundamental issue of a counter \nnarcotics strategy that is imbued with an inherent flaw: the misguided \nnotion that the war on drugs in Colombia can be separated from the \nguerrilla and paramilitary activity that is the threat to Colombia's \nexistence. If, as has been suggested, the FARC is reconsidering its \ninvolvement in the drug trade, it is possible that surgical counterdrug \noperations can be conducted without expanding into counterinsurgency. \nThat the guerrillas control the very territory where the coca fields \nare located, however, should continue to cause us concern. To quote one \nunnamed U.S. official in the Christian Science Monitor, ``If the \nguerrillas [so] choose, they don't have to continue to protect the \nnarcos, [but] if they do. . .this [aid] will be used against them.''\n  This, Mr. President, is precisely the problem. Plan Colombia is \nperhaps a last desperate hope to save a nation. But it carries with it \nthe seeds of greater U.S. involvement in a civil war of enormous \nproportions. Those of us who have been witness to our country being \ngradually mired in a conflict in another region, in another time, \nshould not fail to bear witness to the choices we make today. Funding \nfor this plan will go forward, but the Administration and the \ngovernment in Bogota should not be surprised that many of us will be \nwatching the situation there very carefully. To do less would be to \nacquiesce in the possible materialization of that most feared foreign \npolicy scenario, another Vietnam.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I reluctantly oppose the Wellstone \namendment to transfer $225 million from the military purposes of Plan \nColombia to domestic substance abuse programs. The passage of this \namendment would endanger the success of the Administration's plan to \nattempt to prevent the democratic government of Colombia from being \ndestroyed by narco-traffickers. While I strongly support the goal of \nallocating additional funding to substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment programs, this cannot be achieved at the expense of the \neffectiveness of Plan Colombia.\n  In solving the difficult problem of drug abuse and its many negative \neffects, the United States must seek a balanced approach. This approach \nmust include funding for not only drug abuse prevention and treatment \nprograms, but also for international eradication/interdiction and local \nlaw enforcement. Plan Colombia, which stresses eradication and \ninterdiction of narcotics at their source, is a useful part of our \nnation's overall strategy to end drug abuse.\n  Colombia now supplies approximately 80 percent of the cocaine and \nheroin consumed in the United States. The Plan Columbia aid package, \nwhich has been designed by the Administration and the Colombian \ngovernment, is\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\na comprehensive attempt to stem this flow of narcotics. The package \nincludes important funding for counter-narcotics support, economic \ndevelopment, and human rights programs.\n  A particularly important goal of this initiative is the promotion and \nprotection of human rights in the Andean Region. In this respect, the \nSenate Foreign Operations Appropriations bill makes important \ncontributions. The bill provides approximately $138 million in funding \nfor efforts to protect human rights, strengthen the judicial system in \nColombia, and support peace initiatives. In addition, all assistance to \nColombian armed forces is contingent on a screening of security forces \nto ensure that they have not been implicated in human rights \nviolations.\n  Drug abuse has taken a terrible toll on our country. It has led to \nincreased levels of crime, a clogged judicial system, and most \ndramatically, the ruined lives of our nation's citizens and their \nfamilies. It is for this reason that I am committed to effective drug \nabuse and treatment. I have worked hard to win Senate passage of \nlegislation which would enable qualified physicians, under strict \nconditions, to prescribe new anti-addiction medications aimed at \nsuppressing heroin addiction. I have also strongly supported government \nfunding for state and local community-based programs for drug \ntreatment. In Fiscal Year 1999, the federal government spent \napproximately $5.6 billion on domestic programs directed at the \nreduction of drug demand.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  While I share his conviction that we as a country must do more to \nreduce the demand for illegal drugs in our society, I do not believe we \nshould undermine our assistance for Plan Colombia to pay for increased \ndomestic drug treatment and prevention programs.\n  Mr. President, I recently visited Colombia to assess what our aid \ncould accomplish. I went to see the scope of drug crop cultivation and \nprocessing, to look into the political context, the human rights \nsituation, the goals of the Pastrana Government, and to assess the \ncapabilities of the military and the police.\n  I went with an open mind, though I was concerned about the reported \nabuses of human rights and with the effects of Colombian cocaine and \nheroin on the streets of New Jersey and other states.\n  I left Colombia convinced that we can help Colombia and help America \nby cooperating in the fight against drug production, trafficking, and \nuse.\n  Mr. President, aid for Plan Colombia is strongly in the U.S. \ninterest. While there can be legitimate differences of opinion about \nthe exact content of the aid package, such as what kind of helicopters \nshould be provided, we must use the opportunity to cooperate with a \nfellow democracy to fight the scourge of drugs which harms both our \npeople.\n  Colombia's political will is strong. While the political situation in \nColombia is uncertain, President Pastrana and the Colombian Congress \nhave backed away from forcing early elections and appear to be working \nout their differences. But the Colombian people and their elected \nrepresentatives want an end to the violence. They support peace \nnegotiations with the FARC and ELN guerrillas.\n  And they know the violence will not end as long as it is fueled by \ndrug trafficking and its dirty proceeds.\n  The U.S. and Colombia have a symbiosis of interest in combating drug \nproduction and trafficking. While the Colombians mainly want to end \nfinancial support for various armed groups, they are highly motivated \nto cooperate with our main goal--eliminating a major source of \nnarcotics destined for the United States.\n  Mr. President, we absolutely need to improve protection for human \nrights in Colombia. The Colombian people face very real risks of \nmurder, kidnaping, extortion, and other heinous crimes, so they always \nlive in fear. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the violence. \nThe Colombian Government--including the military and the police--take \nhuman rights issues very seriously.\n  We need to hold them to their commitments to make further progress, \nas the Senate bill language Senators Kennedy and Leahy and I authored \nwould do.\n  Mr. President, was particularly impressed that the independent \nProsecutor General's Office--known as the Fiscallia--is firmly \ncommitted to prosecuting criminals, particularly human rights \nviolators. But in meeting with Colombian human rights groups, I learned \nthat the overwhelming majority of human rights abuses are committed by \nthe paramilitary groups, followed by the guerrillas.\n  Colombia must sever any remaining ties between its military and the \nparamilitary groups and treat them like the drug-running outlays they \nare. On the whole, winning the war on drugs in Colombia should do more \nto improve security and safeguard human rights than anything else we or \nthe Colombian government can do.\n  To return to the amendment now before us, Mr. President, I believe we \nneed to keep working to reduce demand for drugs here in America, but \nnot at the expense of cutting efforts to eliminate a major source of \ndrugs to our country.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity--if we are willing to devote a \nreasonable level of funding--to drastically curtail the production of \ncocaine and heroin in Colombia, while supporting democracy and the rule \nof law in that country. And, since Colombia is the source of most of \nthe heroin and 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States, \nthis is a real opportunity to help address the drug problem in our own \ncountry.\n  I agree with the Senator from Minnesota that America must do more to \nreduce the demand for drugs, particularly by helping those already \naddicted. But we should not take away from our support of Colombia's \nefforts in the process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the \namendment I have introduced with Senator Boxer takes nothing away from \ninterdiction. It does not take away from this package. We are focused \non the support for the military in the southern part of Colombia. That \nis what this is about. This is an amendment that would transfer $225 \nmillion from aid to the Colombian military for the push into southern \nColombia into domestic drug treatment programs. It is that simple. It \nis not about not providing assistance to Colombia. It is not about not \nfocusing on interdiction.\n  A number of different questions have been raised. To respond to some \nof what has been said, I will respond to the comments of my friend from \nDelaware.\n  It is important to note that right now in our country, according to \nONDCP--General McCaffrey and others have talked about this quite a \nbit--there are about 5 million people in need of treatment and only \nabout 2 million receive it, private or public. That means about 3 \nmillion people, more than half of the people who need treatment, don't \nget any at all. Why aren't we dealing with the demand side?\n  We have a bill out here, almost a billion dollars, and the majority \nleader comes to the floor and says this is all about the war on drugs. \nI am saying, how about a little bit that focuses on the demand side in \nour country. Let us have some funding for drug treatment programs for \npeople in the United States. Yes, we have some money in the budget, but \nit is vastly underfunded.\n  The 2000 budget for SAMHSA altogether is $1.6 billion. This is the \nblock grant money that goes to drug treatment. The States, which are \ndown in the trenches using a different methodology, report that close \nto 19 million people in our country are going without any treatment. \nThe ONDCP estimates, moreover, that 80 percent of the adolescents in \nour country who are struggling with this problem are getting no \ntreatment at all. For women who are struggling with substance abuse \nproblems, 60 percent of them get no treatment at all. In some regions \nof the country, the waiting list for treatment is 6 months long or \nlonger. The overall cost to our country for elicit drug use is about \n$110 billion a year, according to the ONDCP. Right now we are spending \n$1.6 billion on a block grant program that gets money down to the \ncommunities for treatment.\n  If anybody thinks this is just an inner-city problem, consider a COSA \nreport entitled ``No Place to Hide,'' which showed that drug use, \ndrinking\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nand smoking among young teens, is higher in rural America than our \nNation's urban centers. According to this report, eighth graders, 13-\nyear-old children in rural America, are 50 percent more likely to use \ncocaine than those in urban areas--I remember when I heard Joe Califano \nsay this; I was stunned--and 104 percent more likely to use \namphetamines, including methenamine. Drug treatment is needed to treat \naddiction and to end the demand for drugs. This is not just an urban \nproblem.\n  We are talking about taking $225 million out of this almost-billion-\ndollar package for Colombia. We are saying, cannot any of this be put \ninto treatment, if this is going to be called the war on drugs \nlegislation, as the majority leader identified it. I think we have had \na different debate on the floor. What I am saying as a Senator from \nMinnesota is, can't we take some portion of that and deal with the \ndemand side? Can't we put some money into the war on drugs in our own \ncountry? If 80 percent of the adolescents aren't receiving any \ntreatment and need some help, can't we get some help to them?\n  This amendment is supported by Legal Action Center, National \nAssociation of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, National Council \non Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Partnership for Recovery, and State \nAssociation of Addiction Services.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, this amendment, when all is said and \ndone, is basically saying to Senators that we can provide assistance to \nColombia, and we should.\n  We should provide extensive assistance, including interdiction, but \nat the same time we ought to avoid entanglement in a decades-old civil \nconflict and we ought to avoid partnership with an army implicated in \nsevere human rights abuses. Moreover, I am saying we can take at least \na small portion of the resources and put it where it will do the most \ngood, and that is in providing funding for drug treatment programs at \nhome.\n  I just want to echo the words of my colleague from California. It is \nquite incredible to me that we can find the money for the war on \ndrugs--close to a billion dollars--for Colombia, but we can't take $225 \nmillion and put it into community-based treatment programs in the war \non drugs in our own country.\n  Moreover, we have in this legislation--and I think in particular this \nmay interest the Chair--a shift via a 7-to-1 ratio from money for \npolice to military. This is particularly worrisome because, right now, \none human rights organization after another--and we have our own State \nDepartment report on violations of human rights abuses by paramilitary \ngroups. It points out that we have a country where civilians make up 70 \npercent of the casualties in that horrible war, and paramilitary groups \nlinked to the army commit over 75 percent of the abuses.\n  I say to my colleagues, again, President Pastrana has made the \npolitical decision that he wants to conduct a military campaign in the \nsouthern part of the state. All of a sudden, this debate has shifted \nbecause Senators have come out here and have said: Yes, Senator \nWellstone, we are taking sides and we should take sides. If President \nPastrana says he needs money from us to support his military in this \ncounterinsurgency effort in the southern part of Colombia with U.S. \nsupporters on the ground with them, and if we don't stop this in \nColombia, then, God forbid, for the whole future of South or Central \nAmerica--I have heard this before--at least let's have this debate out \nin the open.\n  I know this is a debate about a war on drugs, in which case I would \nsay, yes, yes, yes. I would say, we have in this package support for \nthe Colombian Government, but if we are going to have a war on drugs, \ndo it in our country and deal with the demand side and put more into \ncommunity treatment programs. I think we win that argument. I am sure \nthe vast majority of people in Minnesota agree. If you are going to \nspend money on the war on drugs, put some money into our own country. \nWe have a package out here that basically says, for the first time, we \nare going to be directly aligned with the military campaign in \nColombia, in the southern part of Colombia.\n  I have some very real doubts that militarizing this conflict is going \nto somehow be a successful war against drugs. Moreover, as I have said \nearlier, I have some very real doubts, which are expressed by human \nrights organizations and religious organizations and a whole lot of \npeople in our country and in Colombia, that we should be taking sides \nand we should be supporting a military which, as recently as this year, \nhas been unwilling to change its practice and stands accused by all of \nthe reputable human rights organizations of human rights violations.\n  Do we want to align ourselves with this military, with these \nparamilitary groups that have committed such terrorism against \ncivilians and are responsible for most of the violence in that country? \nI have not a shred of sympathy or support for the guerrillas, the left-\nwing, the right-wing, any of them.\n\n  The question is, If it is a war against drugs, don't we want to put \nsome money into the war against drugs here? Other than that, do we want \nto take sides in this military conflict? That is what my colleagues \nhave been talking about today, and they say we have to. They say that \nif we do, we will be able to--we have language in this legislation that \nwill safeguard against human rights violations by the military, that we \nwill be able to invest this money in the military operation in southern \nColombia and make sure everything will be above board. Frankly, I think \nthat is problematic at best.\n  I am not sure people in Colombia or in the United States have the \nfaintest idea what we are about to do. We haven't been able to stop any \nof these human rights abuses over the years. But now, all of a sudden, \nwe are going to be right in the middle of this and take sides, and we \nare going to be aligned with this military campaign in southern \nColombia, and we say we are going to vet it and make sure there aren't \nany human rights violations.\n  Never mind that all the human rights organizations on the ground say \nthat will not work and the religious community says it is a profound \nmistake; that all sorts of government organizations in Colombia with a \ntremendous amount of credibility say, don't do this; don't align \nyourselves with this military campaign in southern Colombia. We are \nbeing told, no problem; we can vet this now.\n  I also want to say to my colleagues I don't think we have taken these \nhuman rights abuses, either directly by the military or the military \nassigned with these paramilitary groups, very seriously. Again, that is \na declaration from social and human rights nongovernment organizations \nin Colombia; there must be 45, 50 organizations, or more. We just \ndisregard them. They are saying, yes, interdiction, give us the \npackage. But they are saying don't align yourselves with this military, \nwith such a horrendous, horrific record of violence, murder, violation \nof human rights--alignment with the worst of the atrocities that have \nbeen committed Colombia--just as we don't want to side with the left-\nwing guerrillas.\n  Why are we now taking sides?\n  Again, some of my colleagues come out here and say this amendment is \nbasically taking away assistance to Colombia. It is not. Senator Boxer \ndid a great job on that point. We can take a couple hundred million \ndollars and put it into the war on drugs in our own country. We deal \nwith the demand side. It is so naive to believe that all of what we see \nin our inner cities and our rural areas and suburbs, all of the \naddiction, all of the substance abuse which destroys people's lives--it \nis so naive to believe that if we now put money into a military \ncampaign in southern Colombia, this is the way to fight a successful \nwar on drugs. We have been down this road forever and ever and ever and \never. When are we going to get serious about dealing with the demand \nfor drugs in our own country and the treatment programs? I don't know.\n  My colleagues just sort of give the human rights question the back of \nthe hand in this debate. I have here the annual Human Rights Watch \nReport World 2000--I will read it again--talking about the paramilitary \nkillers and how stark they are in their savagery, and all the ways in \nwhich the military has turned a blind eye to it, and sometimes it is \nconnected to these groups. And now we want to put several hundred \nmillion dollars into supporting this military directly in a campaign in \nsouthern Colombia with some of our people on the ground with them?\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\n  I have to be concerned about the path we are taking. I am not going \nto bore my colleagues with the statistics.\n  Let me ask the Chair how much time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment is a sensible approach \nwhich permits extensive assistance to Colombia while safeguarding U.S. \ninterests and avoiding entanglement in a decades-old civil conflict and \npartnership with an army implicated in serious human rights abuses. \nMoreover, it moves resources to where they will do the most good; that \nis, providing funding for drug treatment programs at home.\n  In my State of Minnesota, according to the Department of Human \nServices, there are 21,277 people who have requested treatment for \nsubstance abuse and have not been able to receive it. An additional \n4,000 received some treatment but then were denied further treatment \nbecause resources weren't available. Most cited lack of funds to pay \nfor the treatment, or they were put on a long waiting list when they \nneeded the treatment the most. Others said treatment services were not \nappropriate for their needs--women with children, people with \ntransportation problems, people who were trying to find jobs and needed \ntreatment. This amendment calls for some balance.\n  When we started this debate several hours ago, the majority leader \ncame out on the floor and in a very heartfelt way said this is about \nthe war on drugs; this is about what is going on in Colombia and the \nways in which that country is exporting their drugs to this country; \nthey are killing our children.\n  If it is about the war on drugs, then let's make it balanced. Let's \nsupport efforts to have a war on drugs in Colombia. But let's also \nsupport the war on drugs in our own country. Some of this money ought \nto be put in treatment programs.\n  It is absolutely naive to believe we are going to be able to deal \nwith the substance abuse problem in our country without dealing with \nthe demand side. It is shameful that we have so little for the \nprevention and the treatment programs. This amendment takes just a \nlittle over $200 million and puts it into community-based treatment \nprograms.\n  I doubt whether there is a Senator, Democrat or Republican, who \neither does not know a friend or even a family member who struggles \nwith alcoholism or drug abuse. We ought to be doing a much better job \nof getting the treatment to people. This war on drugs is focused on \ninterdiction. It is focused on a military solution in Colombia. I argue \nthat it is one-sided. I would argue it is naive.\n  Second, I have today read from about five different human rights \norganizations' studies, human rights organizations that I believe \ncommand tremendous respect, I hope, from all of us. I read excerpts \nfrom the State Department report of this past year. I read a letter \nsigned by 70 nongovernment organization, human rights organizations, \nand people who were down in the trenches in Colombia. They all said it \nwould be a tragic mistake for our Government to now move away from \nsupporting police, supporting interdiction, supporting a lot of efforts \nin Colombia, and shift a considerable amount of money to a direct \nmilitary campaign in southern Colombia--a military aligned with \nparamilitary groups and organizations that have committed most of the \nviolence in the country, a military with a deplorable human rights \nrecord. It would be a tragic mistake for us now to become directly \ninvolved in this civil war. It would be a tragic mistake for our \nGovernment to support this military with Americans on the ground with \nthem in southern Colombia. What are we getting into?\n\n  I conclude this way: I do not agree with some of my colleagues who \nhave said that if we don't do this, it is the end for Colombia, and \nwatch out for all of South America and Central America. I have heard \nthat kind of argument before. It is eerie to me. It has an eerie sound \nto me.\n  I do not agree that we should take sides in this military conflict. \nInstead, I think we should be providing all of the support we can to \nPresident Pastrana in his good-faith effort to deal with drugs in this \ncountry, to build democratic institutions, and to have economic \ndevelopment. I do not believe we should turn a blind eye away from the \nblatant human rights violations of the military. I think it is \nextremely one-sided to ``fight a war on drugs'' which won't work, which \nwill militarize our foreign assistance to Colombia, which will have our \ncountry directly involved in this military conflict, away from at least \nproviding a small amount of money for community-based treatment \nprograms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator McConnell is controlling time, but \nhe is not here. Could I ask how much time is under Senator McConnell's \ncontrol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McConnell has 5 minutes remaining, and \nSenator Wellstone has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. May I request 3 minutes of the remaining time of the \nopponents of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I strongly support the approval of this assistance for Colombia.\n  For the past 8 months I have chaired, together with General Brent \nScowcroft, a Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on Colombia. This \nbipartisan Task Force released an Interim Report in March of this year \nwhich recommended that Congress approve the administration's aid \nrequest for Colombia, with two modifications. The first, that \nadditional support should be provided to Bolivia, Peru, and other \ncountries in the region, has been incorporated into the bill by the \nAppropriations Committee. The second modification, that additional \ntrade benefits should be part of the package, I will address with the \nintroduction of separate legislation later this week.\n  Let me explain why I, and the Task Force, feel so strongly that this \nassistance package for Colombia needs to be approved.\n  There is a crisis in Colombia that demands our immediate attention. \nWhile Colombia has experienced violence and guerrilla insurgencies for \nmany years, the current crisis is unique in several important ways. \nFirst, Colombia is experiencing record violence which is killing over \n25,000 Colombians each year. More than half of all kidnapings in the \nworld occur in Colombia. The FARC and ELN guerrilla forces and the \nparamilitary groups are escalating their violence in ways that have not \nbeen seen before.\n  Second, our success in reducing coca cultivation in Peru and Bolivia \nhas shifted the production and cultivation of coca to Colombia, with an \nexplosion of coca cultivation in southern Colombia in the past five \nyears. Over 90 percent of the cocaine on our streets comes from \nColombia. More importantly, the guerrilla forces operating in Colombia \nhave become directly involved in narco-trafficking. Where they once \nprovided protection for drug traffickers, they now are directly \ninvolved in the production and transport of illegal drugs. This \nprovides them with an almost limitless source of revenue. For the first \ntime we have a guerrilla organization that does not rely on external \nsources of funding.\n  Third, the Colombian economy is experiencing its worst recession \nsince the 1930s. An unemployment rate of over 20 percent is \nexacerbating social and political tensions. The violence is deterring \ninvestment making economic recovery more difficult.\n  Fourth, Colombians are leaving Colombia at record rates. Last year \nover 100,000 Colombians moved to my State of Florida alone. Hundreds of \nthousands more have come to other parts of the United States to escape \nthe violence and instability.\n  It is this combination of factors that led President Pastrana, \nworking closely with our administration, to propose Plan Colombia. To \nmany, Plan Colombia is only about drugs, but in reality it is a broad \nplan that addresses five key areas: the peace process; the Colombian \neconomy; the counter-drug strategy; justice reform and human rights; \nand democratization and social development. It is this broad based plan \nto rebuild the Colombian state that needs our support.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  Some have said that Plan Colombia is only about providing military \nequipment to Colombia. Indeed, Plan Colombia is much more comprehensive \nand far-reaching. But, the United States contribution to Plan Colombia \nis heavily weighted toward military equipment. There is a good reason \nfor this. Plan Colombia is a $7.5 billion plan, of which the Colombians \nthemselves will provide over $4 billion. They are looking to the United \nStates to provide about $1.6 billion and to international community for \nthe remainder.\n  It is appropriate that the portion of the funding being provided by \nthe United States focus on the counter-drug part of Plan Colombia since \nthis is of particular interest to us and since we are the only country \nthat can supply that type of support. It is also the part of Plan \nColombia that is most compelling for U.S. involvement, since it \ninvolves keeping drugs off of our streets.\n  Some have argued that there are risks associated with providing this \ntype of support to Colombia. That is true, but there are also risks \nassociated with doing nothing, and I believe that the risks associated \nwith doing nothing are far greater than the risks involved with helping \nthe Colombian Government and the Colombian people.\n  We have important national interests at stake in Colombia that would \nbe critically harmed were the current situation in Colombia to \ncontinue. First, Colombia is the oldest democracy in South America and \nhas been an important partner in bringing democracy and democratic \nvalues to all of our hemispheric neighbors, with the exception of Cuba. \nWe must act to preserve democracy.\n\n  Second, the entire Andean region is threatened by instability and \nColombia is the center of that instability. Failure to stem the crisis \nin Colombia could lead to increased instability in Ecuador, Bolivia, \nPeru, Panama, and Venezuela. A stronger Colombia means a stronger \nregion and a stronger Western Hemisphere.\n  Third, a complete breakdown in Colombia would make it even more \ndifficult to control the drug trafficking. And the illegal networks \nthat are set up by drug traffickers also involve other illegal \nactivities that threaten our security, such as money laundering and \nfinancial crimes, arms trafficking, human smuggling, cargo theft, and \nterrorism.\n  Fourth, Colombia is an important trading partner for the United \nStates. It is South America's fourth largest economy and the fifth \nlargest export market in Latin America for the United States. Colombia \nhas the potential to be an economic engine for the Andean region and an \neven bigger market for U.S. goods. The violence and instability in \nColombia are preventing economic growth, including the exploitation of \nlarge, newly discovered oil fields that would help to reduce gasoline \nprices in the United States.\n  Fifth, the exodus of Colombians, nearly 1 million in the past 5 \nyears, further exacerbates our own immigration problems. A further \ndownturn in the Colombian situation could lead to an immigration crisis \nthat would directly impact the United States.\n  Finally, for those concerned about human rights, and I consider \nmyself in that category, the deteriorating human rights situation in \nColombia can only be reversed through the implementation of Plan \nColombia, with the government gaining affective control over its \nnational territory. President Pastrana has demonstrated his will to \nimprove the human rights situation in Colombia, and has taken concrete \nsteps, including dismissing senior military officers, to demonstrate \nhis determination.\n  With all of this at stake it is hard to understand why we have not \nbeen able to move faster to approve this assistance package. And there \nare direct costs associated with this delay. Last December I visited \nthe first of the Colombian counternarcotics battalions that are to be \ntrained and equipped by the U.S. as part of Plan Colombia. The U.S. \nSpecial Forces soldiers who were training them reported that their \nmoral was excellent and they were as capable at their tasks as any \nsoldiers they have ever trained.\n  Unfortunately, this battalion has been doing very little other than \ncalisthenics since my visit, largely because of our failure to move \nthis assistance package. They are limited to where they can reach by \nfoot, since they have no mobility capability. They have no fuel for the \nhelicopters they were given on an interim basis by the State \nDepartment. The valuable training they received is wasting away, and \ntheir skills are fading from lack of practice.\n  In addition, the second Colombian counternarcotics battalion has been \nvetted but are unable to begin training. Eradication of coca and opium \npoppy has been halted. Crop substitution and alternative development \nprograms are also on hold, as are the human rights and judicial reform \nprograms that are included in the legislation. Meanwhile, the \nguerrillas and the drug traffickers continue to strengthen and expand \ntheir operations. The peace process has floundered and the violence has \nescalated. Each day we wait the situation worsens, the regional \ninstability increases, the drugs flow out of Colombia, and the money \nand effort required to turn the situation around increases.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to act now and support this vital \npackage of assistance for Colombia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, this is a two front war--we need to \nadvance on both fronts. Clearly, we can't continue the administration's \npattern of ignoring this crisis.\n  I agree that we should increase education, prevention, and treatment \nefforts, as well as local law enforcement efforts. But, will that \neffort pay off, if we do so at the expense of attacking the source \ncountry problem?\n  It is pretty clear that after seven years of doing nothing, the \nadministration is trying to play catch up in this crisis.\n  If we look at trends and commitments, during the Reagan Just-Say-No \nyears, drug production and use plummeted.\n  This trend sharply reversed in 1992 which was exactly when Clinton \nwas asked, ``If you had to do it over again, would you have inhaled?'' \nHe answered, ``Sure, if I could have.''\n  Since 1992, and this unfortunate remark, drug use has soared and \nproduction has tripled.\n  We need to attack both fronts in this war--here, at home, and abroad.\n  I think we have recommended a good balance for the battle abroad.\n  Let me remind everyone it is a very different package than the \nrequest made by the administration--I have much more confidence in the \nbill before the Senate than I did in the request.\n  The most important difference is our emphasis on a regional strategy. \nJust as we saw production spike in Colombia when pressure was applied \nto traffickers in Peru and Bolivia, I believe we would see the problem \nshift back to Peru, Bolivia, and to Ecuador if we don't increase our \nregional support.\n  Without compromising vital support for Colombia, we provided $205 \nmillion in support to Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and other nations in the \nregion. This more than doubles the administration's request of $76 \nmillion.\n  A second key difference between the bill and the request is the \nsupport we offer for human rights programs. As the tempo of operations \nagainst the traffickers pick up, I am concerned that abuses will also \nincrease.\n  Colombia's judicial system is weak and court officials are regularly \nthreatened making investigations and prosecutions extremely difficult. \nMoreover, the military has undermined attempts by civilian courts to \nprosecute officers accused of human rights abuses even though Colombian \nlaw requires the transfer of these cases to civilian courts.\n  To address these concerns we have required certification that the \nmilitary is complying with their own laws and are cooperating in the \npursuit of these cases in civilian court. We also substantially \nincrease aid to government and non-government organizations involved in \nthe protection of human rights.\n  We paid for these increases by changing the helicopter package.\n  Again, let me say, striking the right balance is the key to our \nsuccess.\n  This bill strikes the right balance between domestic and \ninternational law enforcement--the right balance between Colombia and \nthe other countries in the region--and the right balance between our \nsupport for Colombian law enforcement and Colombian human rights \nadvocate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have a copy of Senator Leahy's \nstatement. I am going to read a little from Senator Leahy's statement. \nThis is just a portion of his statement:\n\n       I have repeatedly expressed concerns about the \n     administration's proposal, particularly the dramatic increase \n     in military assistance. I am troubled about what we may be \n     getting into. The administration has yet to give me \n     sufficient details about what it expects to achieve, in what \n     period of time, what the long-term costs are, or what the \n     risks are.\n\n  That is, of course, part of the position that a number of us have \ntaken today. I thank Senator Leahy, who has a tremendous amount of \nexpertise in this area, for his statement. He goes on to say:\n\n       I commend Senator Wellstone for his amendment. It would \n     provide $225 million for substance abuse prevention and \n     treatment programs in the United States.\n       According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, \n     drug abuse kills 52,000 Americans each year. It costs our \n     society nearly $110 billion annually. It has strained the \n     capacity of our criminal justice system and our medical \n     facilities, and brought violence and tragedy to families, \n     schools, and communities throughout this country.\n\n  I could not have said it better. Mr. President, 80 percent of \nadolescents who need treatment--those who will, if not provided \ntreatment, sustain the demands for drugs in the future--today in our \ncountry cannot get it. Some 50 percent of adults in our country who are \nin need of a drug treatment program are not receiving it. Many \ntreatment programs have lines out the door.\n  And the conclusion of Senator Leahy's statement:\n\n       We should help Colombia. I support President Pastrana's \n     efforts to combat the violence, corruption, and poverty which \n     plagues his country. But I am not convinced the \n     administration's request for ``Plan Colombia'' will \n     effectively address those problems, nor is it likely to \n     reduce the flow of drugs into our country or ameliorate the \n     drug problem here at home.\n       We do know, however, that substance abuse treatment and \n     prevention programs work. A frequently cited Rand study \n     showed that, dollar for dollar, providing treatment for \n     cocaine users is 10 times more effective than drug \n     interdiction efforts, and 23 times more effective than \n     eradicating coca at its source. Scientific advances promise \n     to make treatment and prevention programs even better. \n     Ultimately, reducing the demand for drugs--which is what \n     these programs do--is the only long-term solution to reducing \n     the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia and elsewhere.\n       Mr. President, I commend Senator Wellstone--\n\n  Nice of him to say--\n\n     for his leadership on this issue and I urge other Senators to \n     support his amendment.\n\n  I urge other Senators to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are going to have two votes shortly. \nThe Senator from Alabama would like to modify his amendment and take \njust a few moments to describe it. Then the previous plan was to have \ntwo votes, back to back. I believe the Senator from Delaware will make \na motion to table the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is that a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Alabama be \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alabama.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3492, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk. I \nwould like to share a few thoughts about this situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3492), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 155, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       Sec. 6107. Declaration of Support. (a) Certification \n     Required.--Assistance may be made available for Colombia in \n     fiscal years 2000 and 2001 only if the Secretary of State \n     certifies to the appropriate congressional committees, before \n     the initial obligation of such assistance in each such fiscal \n     year, that the United States Government publicly supports the \n     military and political efforts of the Government of Colombia, \n     consistent with human rights, necessary to effectively \n     resolve the conflicts with the guerrillas and paramilitaries \n     that threaten the territorial integrity, economic prosperity, \n     and rule of law in Colombia.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate committees of congress.--The term \n     ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the following:\n       (A) The Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate.\n       (B) The Committees on Appropriations and International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Assistance.--The term ``assistance'' means assistance \n     appropriated under this\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n     heading for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and provided under \n     the following provisions of law:\n       (A) Section 1004 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1991 (Public Law 101-510; relating to \n     counter-drug assistance).\n       (B) Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85; relating to counter-\n     drug assistance to Colombia and Peru).\n       (C) Section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (Public Law \n     90-629; relating to credit sales).\n       (D) Section 481 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (Public Law 87-195; relating to international narcotics \n     control).\n       (E) Section 506 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (Public Law 87-195; relating to emergency drawdown \n     authority).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the people of Colombia are good people. \nThey maintained a democracy for a long time. There are 40 million \npeople in Colombia. They are our fifth largest trading partner in Latin \nAmerica. They are struggling with violence that has been going on for \n40 years. There are at least two major Marxist-oriented guerrilla \ngroups who control nearly 50 percent of the territory of Colombia. They \nhave attempted repeatedly, through President Pastrana, to negotiate \nwith these guerrillas and have had very little success. In fact, the \nguerrillas have taken advantage of the good auspices of the people of \nColombia and President Pastrana, and even strengthened their hold on \nthe territory and strengthened their antidemocratic activities.\n  There are paramilitary groups in the country also who are operating \noutside the law and are involved in drug trafficking.\n  The guerrilla organizations sustain themselves through the most \nactive kidnapping in the world. Colombia has the highest number of \nkidnappings in the world. Its murder rate is probably the highest in \nthe world. The guerrilla groups sell protection for drug traffickers, \nand that is how they make their money to maintain their existence.\n  I believe, as a former Federal prosecutor who has been involved in \nstudying the drug issue and has prosecuted many cases in the district \nof Mobile, AL, involving quite a number of Colombian drug dealers and \ncartel members, we are going to have limited ability containing the \ndrug problem in America through this money. But what we can do with \nthis money and what is critical that we do with this money is \nstrengthen the country of Colombia.\n  We need to say to them: We support you; we believe in your democracy. \nThe 97-plus percent, as Senator Biden said, of the people in that \ncountry support their government, not these guerrilla organizations. \nThey want peace, they want unification, they want economic growth, they \nwant human rights, and they want a rule of law. That cannot be done and \nwe cannot expect Colombia to stop drug trafficking in their nation if \n40 percent of the territory is outside their control--50 percent \nperhaps.\n  I am distressed that this administration in public statements, in \ntestimony before committee hearings, has refused to say: We support \nColombia in their efforts against these guerrillas. They suggest their \nonly motive is to provide money to help knock down drug production in \nColombia. That is distressing to me. Ambassador Pickering testified and \nI cross-examined him. He said: Our emphasis is drugs.\n  That is not the basis of what we are doing. We want to help Colombia. \nWe want Colombia to create a peaceful government to take control of its \ncountry. We want to encourage strong leadership, the kind of leadership \nthat Abraham Lincoln provided when he unified this country. That is \nwhat needs to be done in Colombia to bring this matter to a conclusion \nonce and for all.\n  If we do not do so, we are pouring new wine in old wine bottles. We \nare pouring money down a dangerous rat hole.\n  This amendment says: We support you, Colombia. We believe in you, \nColombia. We explicitly endorse and support your efforts through peace \nnegotiations or warfare, if necessary, to unify your country, to bring \npeace so you can then eliminate the drug trafficking that is occurring \nthere.\n  Drug trafficking is a major problem in Colombia. It is our No. 1 \nsupplier of cocaine. The cocaine production in Colombia has more than \ndoubled in 5 years. Heroin is going up. Seventy percent of the heroin \nin the United States comes from Colombia. The main reason is the \nGovernment of Colombia does not control its territory. There are whole \nareas of territory outside the control of the government. We should \nsupport this country, and this amendment says so explicitly.\n  Mr. President, do I still have a minute under the agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Delaware be recognized to offer a tabling motion on the \nWellstone amendment and that the vote on or in relation to the Sessions \namendment occur immediately after the vote on the Wellstone amendment, \nand that the time on the Sessions amendment be----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object. What did the Senator \nask for?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not ask unanimous consent that \nthe time on the Sessions amendment be limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object. What is the Senator \nasking for?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I asked unanimous consent that the Senator from \nDelaware be recognized to offer a tabling motion on the Wellstone \namendment and that a vote on or in relation to the Sessions amendment \noccur immediately after the Wellstone vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INDOCHINESE PAROLEES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any national of \n     Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos who was paroled into the United \n     States before October 1, 1997 shall be eligible to make an \n     application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 599E \n     of Public Law 101-167.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3519\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we received a request April 21 to allow \nfiscal year 2001 outlays--not budget authority--to be disbursed early \ninto a Federal Reserve account. We have never structured accounts \naround outlays before, so we are looking at the scoring implications as \nwell as what this will provide to Egypt in security assistance.\n  I am not prepared to write a blank check to any government. It is \npossible that this request could generate an additional $35 to $40 \nmillion for the Egyptians to spend on military equipment.\n  I would like to know what they plan to spend these resources on and \nno one can tell me. I think we need to be better informed before \nsigning off on this approach.\n  Another problem with the proposal concerns actual control of the \nresources. The reason there are no scoring consideration is the entire \namount is deemed obligated to Egypt once the funds are transferred into \nthis account. That means the Egyptians could default or cancel a \ncontract with an American company and we would have very little \nrecourse because the money is already in their account. We must be sure \nthat we will continue to have transparency and ongoing U.S. management \nof these resources, both the funds put into the account and the \ninterest generated by the account.\n  Let me add, separate and apart form concerns about the actual account \nstructure, I am not sure we should be increasing U.S. security \nassistance to Egypt. A short while ago, President Mubarak paid a visit \nto Lebanon and issued a statement of support for\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nHezbollah's terrorist war against Israel. At this delicate juncture \nwith rising concern about cross border violence against Israel, Mr. \nMubarek's comments were and are extremely damaging to peace and \nstability, to say nothing of safety of Israeli civilians. I am not sure \nwhat signal it sends to increase military aid after such unfortunate \nremarks. After all, the aid is provided in recognition of Egypt's \nservice to the peace process established at Camp David--the President's \ncomments undermined those very principles and prospects.\n  In the State Department briefing justifying the request, \nU.S. officials urged our support because of Mubarek's need to address \nthe requirements of ``his key constituents, the military.'' Frankly, I \nthink Mr. Mubarek needs to worry less about satisfying the military and \nspend more time and effort shoring up democratic institutions and civic \nsociety.\n\n  Once again this year he demonstrated a heavy handed political style \nbe extending for three more years the State of Emergency which grants \nhim far reaching powers. He has granted and maintained this sweeping \nauthority for nineteen years. Press censorship and restrictions on \npolitical parties and activities are among many authoritarian measures \nwhich are routinely enforced in Egypt--not characteristics of the most \nopen democracy.\n  In spite of my concerns about the trends in Egypt, I am prepared to \nconsider this request fully and carefully in consultation with the \nchairman and others who I know are interested and expect we will have a \nrecommendation by the time we get to conference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3528\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, S. 2522 contains $934.1 million for Plan \nColombia, a counternarcotics initiative. A portion of that is earmarked \nfor the investigations of human rights abuses. Certainly a part of the \ndrug culture that this bill is attempting to address is the abduction \nof individuals by paramilitary groups who either hold their hostages \nfor ransom or use the abduction as a means of intimidation against law \nenforcement. Frequently we hear of witnesses, prosecutors and judges \nbeing taken from their homes, offices or off the street in broad \ndaylight in an attempt to stop the prosecution of drug kingpins. \nHowever, innocent civilians, not involved in the war on drugs, are \ntargets as well. The amendment I am introducing addresses the latter.\n  My colleagues may not be aware but currently there are three American \ncitizens who are being held hostage by FARC, a narco-guerilla group in \nColombia. Many have been involved in obtaining their release but the 7 \nplus years of their captivity has complicated those efforts.\n  On the evening of January 31, 1993, a group of armed guerrillas \nentered the village of Pucuro Panama. Once control of the village had \nbeen secured, the guerrillas went to the homes of the Mankins, Riches, \nTenenoffs, three missionary families with New Tribes Mission who were \ninvited to live in Pucuro by village leaders to teach reading and \nwriting and provide medical care to villagers. David Mankins, Mark Rich \nand Rick Tenenoff were tied up and their wives instructed to prepare \nsmall packages of clothing for them. The guerrillas then forced the men \ntoward a trail that leads to the Colombian border.\n  Shortly after the kidnaping, FARC made contact with New Tribes \nMission, claimed credit for the abduction and demanded a $5 million \nransom. The mission refused to pay the ransom and shortly thereafter \ncontact ceased. Since then there has been many rumors and reports, but \nnot proof on their whereabouts.\n  David Mankins, Mark Rich and Rick Tenenoff have the dubious \ndistinction of being the longest held American hostages. Their families \nhave lived the last 7 years without knowing whether they are dead or \nalive.\n  My amendment condemns the kidnaping; urges members of the European \nCommunity to assist in the safe return of these men by including in any \ndialogue with them the objectives of the safe return of these \nmissionaries; and appeals to the United Nations Commission to pressure \nFARC to resolve this situation.\n  I am proposing this amendment for a couple reasons: first, FARC has \naggressively courted a dialogue with several in the European community. \nIn fact, I understand that in the upcoming weeks there will be \nrepresentatives of FARC in Europe looking for support of their \n``revolution.'' I fear any recognition would be viewed as legitimizing \nthe illegal and cowardly activities of FARC and thereby compound \nefforts to either gain release of these Americans to learn of their \nfate.\n  Secondly, Dr. Larry Maxwell of Patterson Baptist Church in Patterson, \nNew York has begun a 240 mile walk to Washington, D.C. to bring \nattention to the tragic situation of these families. Dr. Maxwell will \nculminate his walk at the Capitol this coming Monday, June 26th, where \nhe will be joined by the families of the kidnapped men.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because these American \ncitizens can easily be forgotten and we must not do that. Dave, Mark \nand Rick needs our prayers and their families need to know that their \nloved ones have not been abandoned. Finally, we need to encourage all \nthose who have worked during the last 7 years to bring an end to this \nhorrific ordeal to continue their effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3519, 3528, and 3532) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington is here and ready to offer an amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3517\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce the amount of funds made available for South \n   American and Caribbean counternarcotics activities, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3517.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning page 141, line 9, strike ``$934,100,000'' and all \n     that follows through line 18 on page 155 and insert the \n     following: ``$200,000,000 to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That the funds appropriated under this heading \n     shall be utilized in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and \n     other countries in South and Central America and the \n     Caribbean at the discretion of the Secretary of State.''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment would be to \nstrike the Colombian drug money appropriation of $934 million and \nsubstitute for that number $200 million. In other words, the passage of \nthe amendment would result in savings--that is to say, not spending--\nalmost three-quarters of a billion dollars, and by implication using \nthat money to pay down the national debt.\n  Curiously enough, I think the justification for the amendment is as \neloquently stated in the bill being managed by my friend from Kentucky \nand by the committee report--which I commend to my colleagues--that \naccompanies that amendment.\n  I will read one paragraph now from the committee report:\n\n       Historically, INL has provided support to the Colombian \n     National Police. The Supplemental anticipates a 7:1 shift in \n     funding from the Police to the Army. Given the past limited \n     role and resources provided for counter-narcotics activities \n     in Colombia and the region, the Committee is concerned about \n     the rapid, new, and unprecedented levels of spending \n     requested. The fiscal year 2000 program level of $50,000,000 \n     for Colombia will now rise to nearly $1,000,000,000. The \n     Committee has grave reservations regarding the \n     Administration's ability to effectively manage the use of \n     these resources to achieve the expected results of reducing \n     production and supply of cocaine while protecting human \n     rights.\n\n  I could hardly state my case better. We have a profound and dramatic \nshift in focus. We have a huge 19-1 increase in the amount of money in \nthis bill focused on this particular problem, and we lack even a clue \nas to whether or not it will have any positive impact on\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\ndrug trafficking between Colombia and the United States.\n  I will read the language found on page 151 of the bill, section 6106:\n\n   Limitations on Support for Plan Colombia and on the Assignment of \n                  United States Personnel in Colombia\n\n       (a) Limitation on Support for Plan Colombia.--Except for \n     appropriations made by this Act and appropriations made by \n     the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2001, for such \n     purpose, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by any Act (including unobligated balances of prior \n     appropriations) shall be available for support of Plan \n     Colombia unless and until--\n       (1) the President submits a report to Congress requesting \n     the availability of such funds; and\n       (2) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     request of the President under paragraph (1).\n\n  In other words, let's spend $1 billion, and after it is spent, let's \nask the President for a justification of why we were spending it and a \nplan for what we are going to do in the future.\n  That is absolutely, totally, completely backwards. This is a major \nundertaking, a huge change in our relationship with Colombia, in what \nwe sometimes fatuously denominate a war against drugs, with some kind \nof hope that it will have a positive impact. My guess is I will very \nshortly be asked to enter into a time agreement so we can vote on this \namendment no later than 6 or 6:30 p.m. today. Time constraints will \nlead me to accept that time agreement. But is it not equally bizarre \nand irresponsible that we should put the United States into another \nmilitary adventure on the basis of so short and superficial a debate \nabout both means and ends in connection with this appropriation?\n  The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, just proposed an amendment \nthat got very few votes, that superficially at least was aimed at the \nsame goal. I say ``superficially'' because Senator Wellstone did not \npropose to save any of the money. He simply proposed to spend about 25 \npercent of it with priorities that differed from those of the committee \nand those of the President of the United States. The war and all the \nequipment were still there under his amendment. We just had a quarter \nof a billion dollars spent on various social program purposes.\n  His amendment, in other words, did not go to the heart of the \nquestion that is before us. That question is, Are we prepared casually, \nat this point, to take the first step in what has often in the past \nbeen an inevitable series of steps toward engaging in another shooting \nwar?\n  I grant you there is a limitation of no more than 250 American \nmilitary personnel to accompany the equipment we will be selling to \nColombia under the provisions of this bill. But isn't that almost \nalways the way we begin an adventure of this nature, with pious \ndeclarations that our participation is limited; we are just helping \nsome other country solve its own problems and challenges in some \nmilitary fashion? I think so.\n  But this is a shift from supporting a police force in a friendly \ncountry to supporting an army engaged in a civil war, a civil war that \nit has not been winning, a civil war in which the other side is very \nwell financed--indirectly, at least, in large part by Americans who \npurchase cocaine--but without the slightest real control over the use \nof the equipment that the Colombian Army will be receiving pursuant to \nthis bill.\n  How long will it be until we read the first news story about some of \nthis equipment showing up in the hands of the rebels, by capture or, \nfor that matter, by purchase? I don't know, but that is what has \nconstantly happened in the past in almost each of the other adventures \nof this nature in which the United States has found itself.\n  But my fundamental point with respect to this amendment is that we \nare voting money first and asking for the justification later. We \nshould get the justification first and make the determination as to \nwhether to spend this amount of money or how much we ought to spend \nafter we know exactly what the plan is and how the plan promises to \nlead to any kind of successful conclusion.\n  But the bill says, right here on pages 151 and 152, we will spend the \n$934 million and then the President will tell us how he is going to \nspend future money, and we will get a joint resolution.\n  At a later stage in a similar adventure, we went through an almost \nidentical debate just a couple of weeks ago on Kosovo. We voted the \nmoney and lacked, by a small margin, the courage even to say that it \nhad to be justified and authorized by Congress a year from now. I hope \nwe may have learned something from that experience. Should we not \nseriously debate this matter first--not just in a couple of hearings in \nan Appropriations Committee and essentially a rider on an \nappropriations bill but seriously and extensively? Is this the single \nbest way in which to spend the almost three-quarters of a billion \ndollars that is the subject of this amendment, even on drug \ninterdiction, much less on any other potential program in the United \nStates? Will it help Colombia? Does it really address drug problems in \nthe United States? Is there an exit strategy?\n\n  We know there was not any in Bosnia. We know there is not any in \nKosovo. And we sure are not told what it is here. One consequence of \npassing this appropriations bill in its present form, however, is \ncertain. It will not be a one-time appropriation. It will not be the \nonly request we are asked to respond to, to deal with the Colombian \nmilitary, almost $1 billion in this appropriation--a downpayment. But \nit isn't a downpayment we make on a home or an automobile. It is a \ndownpayment on which we don't know the schedule of future payments; we \ndon't know the total amount of future payments; we don't know how we \nwill measure success if, indeed, any success exists. It is simply the \nbeginning of an open-ended commitment, with the pious statement that \nthe President must come back a year from now and justify future \nappropriations and get a joint resolution of Congress.\n  I don't think those lines are worth the paper they are printed on \nbecause next year's foreign operations appropriations bill can just \nappropriate another $1 billion, and its passage will be that joint \nresolution, without any more justification than we have today.\n  In one respect, at least, I must interject with this comment: I have \nbeen overly critical. In comparison with the way in which this problem \nhas been treated in the House of Representatives, this appropriation is \na model of responsibility. It includes considerably fewer dollars and \nconsiderably more in the way of conditions--future conditions though \nthey may be. That means, unfortunately, the conference committee will \nend up spending more money than we are spending here and probably with \nfewer and less responsible requirements imposed on the administration \nin the way in which the money is spent.\n  But my points in this amendment are simple. We are asked to engage in \nanother civil war. I repeat that. We are asked to engage in another \ncivil war with a major commitment to equipment and training for the \nColombian Army. Very rarely does this kind of commitment get made \nwithout escalating into something more, in money or in personnel or the \nlike. Very rarely are insurgencies such as the one in Colombia \nsuccessfully met when those insurgencies have as large a source of \nmonetary support as this one seems to have.\n  In any event, I suppose one can even say that this is a good, \nthoughtful, and responsible idea, but we do not know that. We have not \nhad any kind of national debate on the subject. We have not had \nanything more than the most superficial justification for it by an \nadministration whose foreign policy guesses so far during the last few \nyears do not lend a great degree of confidence to most of us with \nrespect to the responsibility of this adventure.\n  In the relatively short period of time we have available, I ask my \ncolleagues to ask themselves the simple question: Do you know enough \nabout this idea to risk $1 billion on it in an open-ended commitment to \nan entirely new adventure in a campaign which has rather spectacularly \nlacked in success for the last 10 or 20 years? Wouldn't you like a \nlittle bit more advanced justification? Wouldn't you like a little bit \nmore time to thoughtfully consider whether we want to involve ourselves \nin this particular civil war? Isn't there somewhere that you can think \nof that $700 million would be spent more wisely, even in connection \nwith our struggle against illegal drug usage in the United\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\nStates or for some other program entirely or for the reduction in the \nnational debt to which we all give so much lipservice, except when it \ncomes up against a new spending program?\n  What I offer is an amendment that will still have us spending four \ntimes as much money in Colombia than we are spending during the course \nof the current year--four times as much money, $50 million to $200 \nmillion--but one that will require the President to come up to us with \nthe very requirements that are set out on pages 151 and 152 of this \nbill but with a difference. He will have to come up and justify it \nbefore we give him the money rather than after it is over.\n  Next year, this request will be a very simple one: Oh, gosh, we have \nalready spent $1 billion. We can't stop now; it is just beginning to \nshow results; the helicopters have only been down there for 2 months; \nwe are only asking another $1.5 billion, or whatever the request; we \ncan't quit now; we won't show constancy; we won't show purpose. The \ntime to show constancy and purpose is right now.\n  This spending program, even with the restrictions and limitations \nincluded in this bill, is not responsible. It is not the right way to \nspend money. It is almost impossible to conceive that it will be \nsuccessful, and we should deal with it today, here and now, by very \nsimply saying: No; no, Mr. President, not until there is a far greater \njustification than any that you have presented so far.\n  We should heed in our votes as well as in our words the very words of \nthe committee and show ``grave reservations regarding the \nadministration's ability to effectively manage the use of these \nresources.'' If we have grave reservations, we should not be spending \nthe money until those reservations are met and we have a far greater \ndegree of confidence than any of us can show today that this spending \nwill be effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a hard time remembering the last \ntime I disagreed with my friend from Washington on an issue, but on \nthis one, regretfully, I do. We had a vote a few moments ago to reduce \nthe Colombian drug war money by $225 million. That was defeated 89-11. \nNow my colleague from Washington would take it all the way down to a \nmere $100 million for this effort. He would be the first one to agree \nthat, in effect, eliminates this effort. I think that is a mistake.\n  I will make the motion to table the Gorton amendment which I would \nlike to schedule for 4 p.m., if that is agreeable with Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am sorry, I did not hear.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was saying to my friend from Washington, I am \nplanning on making a motion to table at 4 p.m. and that would give us a \ntime certain for the vote. We can lay the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington aside and go on to Senator Dodd who has an amendment as \nwell.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, has the unanimous consent request been \npropounded?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not yet.\n  Mr. DODD. I am going to make a suggestion before my colleague makes \nit. There are at least two other people who I know want to speak on the \namendment I am going to offer. I am worried about the timing. If we \nschedule a vote at 4 p.m. and I presume a vote on my amendment to \nfollow immediately thereafter----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was not going to propound that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator has made his case. He will need 5 minutes at \nthe most to repeat it. As the Senator from Kentucky knows, however, a \nsomewhat more drastic version of this amendment received 11 votes on \nthe Appropriations Committee, and there may very well be other Members \nwho do wish to speak on it.\n  While I am perfectly happy at this point to grant unanimous consent \nto go on to another amendment, I would like the two Cloakrooms to be \nable to circulate the thought that this amendment is before the body, \nand if other Members want to come, that they be given an opportunity to \nspeak. I hope he defers his motion to table until that opportunity has \nbeen presented.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to defer. As a fellow chairman of a \nsubcommittee on Appropriations, the Senator is sympathetic, I am sure, \nof my goal to finish the bill. I was trying to move this along. \nObviously, I will defer to my friend from Washington if he is not \nprepared to have that vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. If other people wish to speak, I want them to have that \nopportunity. I am perfectly happy to vote before we leave this evening.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Washington, is there further \ndebate on the amendment? Does the Senator from Connecticut wish to \nspeak to the Gorton amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Briefly. I will not take a lot of time. I know the chairman \nwants to move this bill along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be proposing another amendment \nbriefly. I did not speak during the consideration of the Wellstone \namendment but, in effect, the amendment offered by our friend and \ncolleague from Washington is tantamount to the same conclusion as the \nWellstone amendment. This amount will be reduced, as I understand the \namendment, to some $200 million, in effect gutting the program. An \namendment that says we not spend the money would have the same effect, \nin my view.\n  This is a complicated and difficult issue. I say to my friend from \nWashington, for whom I have the highest regard and respect, and I \nlisten to him carefully when he speaks on any issue, I am deeply \nconcerned. This is not a perfect package by any stretch of the \nimagination. If I were crafting this alone, it would be somewhat \ndifferent than the package before us. I understand with 535 Members of \nCongress and a Defense Department and a State Department and dealing \nwith regional governments as well in the hemisphere who are as \nconcerned about this issue as we are, we cannot craft a package that \nreflects necessarily the views of every single person. We have to put \ntogether a package that seems to make the most sense from a variety of \nperspectives.\n  I did not speak on the Wellstone amendment, but my feelings are very \nstrong when it comes to this issue of Colombia.\n  Colombia is the oldest continuous democracy in Latin America.\n  I do not engage in hyperbole when I suggest to my colleagues that \nthis nation of Colombia is very much, in my view, on the brink of being \ndisintegrated by narcotraffickers and guerrilla forces operating in \nthat country.\n  The narcotraffickers are accumulating a fortune, a vast fortune, \nsignificant parts of which are being used to finance the guerrilla \noperations. The major source of funding for the narcotraffickers, \nregretfully, comes from right here in the United States. We lose about \n50,000 people a year in the United States to drug-related deaths. We \nare the largest market for illegal Colombian drugs.\n  Just in the last 2 years, Colombia's coca production has grown by 40 \npercent. In 1999, the United States estimated the street value of \ncocaine processed from Colombia's coca fields and sold on the streets \nof this country was in excess of $6 billion.\n  Whether we like it or not, we are engaged in the conflict in \nColombia. Because of events in that country and because of our own \nhabits in this Nation, people are dying in the streets of America. This \nis not some distant conflict without any ramifications here at home.\n  I do not believe this issue is necessarily going to be resolved \nbecause we have a military aid package going to Colombia. It is going \nto be resolved through a variety of measures and means. I, frankly, \nhave been terribly disappointed; we are now almost in July--this is a \nrequest for help from our neighbor, from President Pastrana, from a \ndemocratic government, where 1 million people are now displaced because \nof the conflict in Colombia. And 100,000 people leave that country \nevery 6 months because of the war there, many of them coming to our \nshores and many of them going to other nations.\n  Colombia is greatly distressed. Politicians, journalists, judges, and \ninnocent civilians are being gunned down. We think we put ourselves at \ngreat risk\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\nwhen we run for political office if someone slams a screen door in our \nface. In Colombia, if you run for high office, you run the risk of \nbeing killed. That is not an exaggeration.\n  Literally dozens and dozens of people who have had the temerity to \nstand up to the narcotraffickers and to some of these paramilitary \nforces, and others, have lost their lives. President Pastrana, the \nPresident of the country, was actually taken hostage and kept in the \ntrunk of a car not that many years ago as a victim of this conflict.\n  My point is this. This package may not be perfect, but our delay in \nresponding to a neighbor's call for help is getting too long. Every day \nwe wait, every day we delay, means more lives lost, means greater \nstrength for these narcotraffickers, who respect no one, not \nsovereignty, not governments, certainly not democratically elected \ngovernments, and will use whatever means available to them in order to \nsecure their position and gain resources through their illegal trade in \ndeath, a trade in death which costs the lives of people in this \ncountry.\n  Obviously, we have to do a lot here at home. We can't blame the \nColombians because we have illegal drug habits in this country that \nexceed anywhere else in the world. But part of the answer is going \nafter the source. So when we step up to offer the Colombian democracy a \nchance to fight back, we are not only doing it for them; we are doing \nit for ourselves.\n  So with all due respect to my friend from Washington, and others, \nthis may not be a perfect plan, but every day we delay in stepping up \nto help our neighbor, we cause more hardship, more death and \ndestruction in our own country, and greater is the proximity of \nColombia losing its democratic government, losing its sovereignty.\n  So I hope that this amendment will be rejected, as was the previous \namendment, and that we will get about the business of passing this \nlegislation, and giving these people a chance to fight back, and also \ngiving ourselves an opportunity to reduce the hardship in our own \nstreets as a result of the narcotrafficking problem.\n  I do not claim to be any deep expert on the issue of antinarcotics \nefforts, but I respect those who are. From General McCaffrey to our \ncolleagues in this Chamber, and in the other House, who work on this \nissue every single day, almost without exception, they say this is a \nmust-pass program; that if we back away from our responsibility, if we \nback away from an ally and a friend and a neighbor in trouble, then our \ncredibility, when it comes to fighting back on this issue, will be \nseverely damaged, if not lost entirely, in this part of the world.\n  President Pastrana deserves the admiration, support, and respect of \nthe American people and this Congress. From the first days he was \nelected to office, he has sought to resolve the conflict in his country \nwith a major guerrilla group in his nation that has operated for 40-\nsome years, by sitting down with them to try to resolve their \ndifferences. He even turned over a sizable portion of Colombia, his own \nnation--a small percentage of the population resides in this area of \nColombia.\n  I have here a partial map of Colombia. It is not clearly shown on the \nmap, but a substantial portion of Colombia is in an area called the \nllanos, a Spanish word for lowlands, wetlands. When you come out of the \nAndes in Colombia, and come down into the llanos areas, the flat areas, \nthere is a large section of this piece of territory which President \nPastrana and his government conceded--in effect, an autonomous region--\nas part of the effort to try to resolve this 40-year-old conflict with \nthe major guerrilla group called the FARC. As I said, a small \npercentage of the Colombian population actually lives there. But that \nwas part of his concession to try to resolve this dispute. Just \nrecently, he also made a concession of some additional property.\n  I show you a better map of Colombia. It is a little clearer. On the \nmap you can see the darker area. Here is the Andean ridge that runs \nfrom Venezuela down through Ecuador and through Colombia. There are \nmajor population centers in the northern sections of Colombia around \nBogota.\n  This area over here is the least populated area of Colombia. It is in \nthis shaded area shown here where this concession was made. There have \nalso been concessions made in the north.\n  President Pastrana has desperately tried to bring this conflict with \nthis age-old guerrilla operation to a conclusion. But the problem is, \nthe major cocaine and major coca productions occur in areas very \nsimilar--in fact, this is the darkened area, the DMZ area, in an area \ncalled Caqueta and Putumayo. The Putumayo region is along the border of \nEcuador. And the Caqueta region is very similar to it. This is the \nlargest region from which these killer drugs come that end up on our \nstreets.\n  It is estimated, by the way, these narcotraffickers have profits in \nexcess of $1 million a day--some would suggest three times that \nnumber--daily profits made in the streets of the United States to fund \ntheir operations and to support guerrilla activities. They cannot \nhandle this alone. If it is left entirely up to Colombia to solve this \nproblem, it gets worse every hour.\n  I know it is a lot of money, $1 billion. It is not cheap. But every \nday we delay, every day we refuse to step up, this problem becomes \nworse and the narcotraffickers get stronger. They are already now in \nEcuador. They moved into this region, where they moved the product up \nthrough Ecuador to the chemistry laboratories and then back down \nthrough Ecuador and either back into Colombia or out to the United \nStates. It is a serious issue.\n  Their government has pleaded with us for some help for over a year. \nWe are now almost finished with this session of Congress, and we still \nhave not addressed this issue.\n  Again, I respect my colleague from Washington. But there was another \ntime, a half a century ago, when neighbors in another part of the world \nasked for our help--not our direct involvement--in something called the \nLend-Lease Program. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in a national address to \nthe country, described it to the American public in terms of a house \nbeing on fire and neighbors asking for some help.\n  In a sense, today, that is what we are being asked to do. We have \nhere a democratic neighbor, the oldest democracy in Latin America, one \nof our best allies in the world, a group of people who have supported \nus and have been through hell over the last 20 years as judges and \npresidential candidates, prosecutors, state legislators. Anyone who had \nthe guts to stand up to narcotraffickers has gotten gunned down or \ntheir families kidnapped and put through a reign of terror by these \npeople, and now they ask us for a little help. All of those drugs come \nhere. They end up on our streets. They kill our kids. They want to know \nif we will help to put an end to it. I think it is very little to ask, \nconsidering the magnitude of the problem, how precarious it is for us \nhere at home and for this good neighbor and friend to our south.\n  Regardless of party, political persuasion, or ideology, this is a \ntime when we need to say to democratic countries in this hemisphere, we \nstand with you, particularly when the fight involves us very directly. \nI hope this amendment will be resoundingly defeated and a strong \nmessage sent that this Congress, despite its demands for attention and \ntime and resources, is not going to turn its back on the people of \nColombia. Rather we will be saying that we will, in an expeditious \nfashion, provide the resources necessary so these people have a chance \nto fight back against a crowd who wants to take their sovereignty and \nsimultaneously add to the carnage on our own streets.\n  For those reasons, I urge rejection of this amendment. When the \ntabling motion is offered, I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to bring my colleagues attention \nto the importance of what we are trying to do with emergency aid to \nColombia. Why is this aid important? And why is now an emergency?\n  Illegal drugs pose a direct, immediate threat to the health and \nsafety of the citizens of the United States. Today, a majority of the \ncocaine and heroin consumed in the United States, is grown, processed, \nand smuggled from Colombia.\n  The Senate, today, has the opportunity to act. We have the \nopportunity to provide a needed boost to the Government of Colombia and \ntheir efforts to halt illegal drug production in their country. They \nhave a plan, and they have asked the U.S. for support. We should \nprovide it.\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\n  That said, I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking this is \neither the perfect or final assistance package that will come before \nthe Senate for Colombia. However, it is a good start. It will \nstrengthen the Colombian military while emphasizing the importance of \nhuman rights. It will provide additional resources for the Colombian \nNational Police, and strengthen U.S. Colombian, and other nations in \nregional interdiction capabilities in and around Colombia. Personally, \nI would like to see more money for intelligence collection, and more \nemphasis on coordination of activities between the Military and \nNational Police, and more assistance to Colombia to strengthen the rule \nof law. However, these are all things that can be addressed in future \nappropriations. We also need to address economic and trade issues to \nhelp the legal economies in the region. This package provides important \nassistance needed now to a government with the will and ability to act.\n  The drug problem is not going to be solved overnight. To confront \nthis threat, we must work locally, as well as internationally. We must \nprovide assistance so those who have been seduced by drug use can get \nhelp, but we also--and I would say this has to be our first focus--we \nalso must keep people from becoming addicts in the first place. This \nmeans education and prevention. It means using the law to punish those \nwho break it, providing the resources to help those who become \naddicted, and it also means focused programs to stop drugs at the \nsource. That means that it is in both the moral and strategic interest \nof the United States to support the Government of Colombia in its \nefforts to rid the country of drug production. We should not squander \nthis opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate to lay \nthe Gorton amendment aside temporarily and go forward. Is the Senator \nfrom Connecticut ready to offer his amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I am.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Gorton \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3524\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up amendment 3524.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 3524.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 142, on lines 3-5, strike the words ``procurement, \n     refurbishing, and support for UH-1H Huey II helicopters:'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof the following: ``procurement and \n     support for helicopters determined by the U.S. Department of \n     Defense, in consultation with the Colombian military, to be \n     the most effective aircraft to support missions by elite \n     Colombian counter narcotics battalions in eradicating the \n     expanding cultivation and processing of illicit drugs in \n     remote areas of Colombia:''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and others who \nmay wish to join us. I will read the substance of the amendment; then I \nwill go into the language. The substance of the amendment is as \nfollows: We would strike the words ``procurement, refurbishing, and \nsupport for UH-1H Huey II helicopters'' and insert in lieu thereof the \nfollowing: ``procurement and support for helicopters determined by the \nU.S. Department of Defense, in consultation with the Colombian \nmilitary, to be the most effective aircraft to support missions by \nelite Colombian counter narcotics battalions in eradicating the \nexpanding cultivation and processing of illicit drugs in remote areas \nof Colombia.''\n  I begin these remarks by stating what was perhaps obvious to my \ncolleagues but may not be obvious to all who are following this debate. \nMy colleague and I from Connecticut represent a division of United \nTechnologies known Sikorsky Aircraft which produces Blackhawk \nhelicopters. I am not proposing an amendment that mandates that the \nBlackhawk helicopter be the helicopter of choice. I am sure that may \ndisappoint some of my constituents that I am not fighting on behalf of \na particular helicopter. Rather, my amendment provides for the \nhelicopter to be selected on its relative merits.\n  As I said a moment ago, when it comes to narcotics issues, I don't \nclaim great expertise. I don't claim to be a military expert when it \ncomes to making decisions about which helicopters may be the best to \nuse in a given situation. Rather than offer an amendment, which my \ncolleague from Connecticut and I might have done, to say we replace the \nlanguage here, which does call for a specific helicopter, with the one \nthat is produced in our home State, our amendment says, let the people \nwho have to make the assessment about what would work best in Colombia \ndecide, not what the Senators from Connecticut want or the Senators \nfrom Texas or some other place. My amendment would allow our military \nexperts to say what makes the most sense, in consultation with the \npeople who will be receiving this military equipment.\n  Even if Senators disagree with this package in its entirety, I hope \nthey will support this amendment so that at least Colombia will be \nreceiving the kinds of equipment that will be necessary to get the job \ndone.\n  The questions raised by our colleague from the State of Washington \nabout whether or not this policy can work are not illegitimate. None of \nus have a crystal ball to determine whether or not this particular \nprogram is going to produce the desired results of those of us who \nsupport it. One way we can almost guarantee it won't is to insist that \nthe Colombian Government accept only the hardware which we want to give \nthem, not which may be the best in order to deal with the problem but \nthat which we think they ought to have because of some parochial \ninterest.\n  I don't want to be in a position of demanding that the Colombian \nGovernment take a helicopter made in my State. Nor should anyone else \nbe demanding they take one from theirs. Let us let the experts decide \non what works best. That is the reason I am offering this amendment \nwith a number of my other colleagues.\n  The administration's primary rationale in proposing the $1.2 billion \nsupplemental aid package in support of what is called Plan Colombia was \nto assist the Colombian Government in stemming the massive growth in \ncoca cultivation in southern Colombia. Again, it is the area I \ndescribed in the shaded green around the Caqueta and Putumayo region. \nIt is not limited to those areas. There are other areas as well where \nthe products are grown. Those are the principal ones.\n  In the last 2 years, Colombia's coca production has grown by 40 \npercent. In 1999, the estimated street value in the United States was \nin excess of $6 billion coming out of this region, just in a year \nalone. We are talking about a billion-dollar program to deal with a \nsupply in coca alone, in 1 year, 2 years, in excess of $6 billion.\n\n  The Colombian Government has proposed to address the explosion in \ncoca production by going to the source, the coca-producing regions of \nPutumayo and Caqueta in southern Colombia. However, these coca growing \nareas are also strongholds of the FARC guerrilla organizations--\nfrankly, there is a relationship between the drug cultivators and the \nguerrillas in these two areas. There are also right-wing paramilitary \norganizations which operate in these areas, but the paramilitary groups \nare more extensive in the northern part of the country.\n  To address these threat levels and logistical difficulties in \nmounting substantial counter narcotics programs, President Pastrana has \nmade a central feature of his plan the so-called push into southern \nColombia, where the bulk of the problem resides. The key components of \nthe push into southern Colombia are to equip and train two additional \nColombian counter narcotics battalions, the training and deployment of \nthe first battalion having already occurred in December of last year, \nand to provide tactical mobility, which is airlift capacity, to these \nnewly trained battalions so that the Colombian national police will \nhave sufficient area security to carry out\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\neradication and other drug law enforcement operations in southern \nColombia.\n  The Clinton administration specifically requested almost $600 million \nto support that component of Plan Colombia, a request essentially met \nin the House-passed emergency supplemental bill. The success or failure \nof push into southern Colombia depends in no small measure not only on \nthe effectiveness of these battalions but also on the effectiveness and \nthe capacity and capability of the equipment with which we provide \nthem. It is going to be critically important that we not jam down the \nthroats of this government equipment that is not going to meet the \ntest, not going to help get the job done. That is why I offer this \namendment today.\n  President Pastrana and U.S. defense experts spent a number of months \ndiscussing how best to ensure the maximum effectiveness of these \noperations. Contrary to the assertion of my colleague from Washington, \na lot of time has been spent discussing this issue. There has not been \na lack of discussion about what is going on in Colombia. There has been \na lot of discussion, a lot of hearings.\n  Our Pentagon and other experts have determined that the ability to \ntransport substantial numbers of elite Army troops together with \nmembers of the national police quickly and safely to remote areas of \nColombia would be absolutely critical to the overall success of the \nlarger strategy. After reviewing a number of different options, \nincluding the possibility of non-U.S. aircraft, the Colombian Army \nselected the Blackhawk helicopter as their equipment of choice in \ndealing with this issue. According to Gen. Charles Wilhelm, Commander \nin Chief of the Southern Command, our top military person in the \nregion, the ultimate decision to select the Blackhawk over other \noptions was based on its superiority in the following areas: range, \npayload, survivability, versatility, service ceiling, and other \ntechnical considerations.\n\n  Let me share a chart with you that makes the point more clearly than \nanything I could have just said, in very specific terms. I have here a \nchart that shows a comparison between the Huey II, presently demanded \nin this bill, and the Blackhawk. Let me go down each one of the \ncritical areas identified by our top military people in the Southern \nCommand.\n  What is the maximum cruise speed of the Huey II? It is 100 knots. The \nBlackhawk is 155 knots. The maximum number of passengers at sea level \nis 11 persons for the Huey and 24 for the Blackhawk. The maximum \npassengers at 9,000 feet is 8 persons the Huey and 18 persons for the \nBlackhawk.\n  On this other chart, when you are based here in northern Colombia and \nyou have to get to southern Colombia, you have to fly over the Andes. \nThis is not at ground level or sea level. For those people who may be \nfamiliar with the geography of this area, to suggest somehow you are \ngoing to have an effective quick-response team, taking 8 people in a \nHuey helicopter over the Andes, as opposed to a Blackhawk, which can \ncarry 18 at 9,000 feet, is to put this program in serious jeopardy.\n  The maximum flight time is 1.5 hours for the Huey; its 2.5 for the \nBlackhawk. The range of a Huey is 196 nautical miles. It is 300 \nnautical miles for the Blackhawk. The ceiling--how high they can go--is \n16,000 feet for a Huey and 20,000 feet in a Blackhawk. The weight the \nHuey can carry is 10,500 pounds; the Blackhawk can carry 22,000 pounds. \nFuel consumption for a Huey is 600 pounds an hour. For the Blackhawk, \nit is 700 pounds an hour. The sling load is 5,000 pounds for the Huey \nand 9,000 pounds--almost double--for the Blackhawk. The payload at \n4,000 feet again is more than double for the Blackhawk as opposed to a \nHuey.\n  Mr. President, in virtually every category that our top military \npeople have said is important, the Blackhawk outperforms the Huey. I am \nnot offering an amendment that demands that we write in Blackhawk \ninstead of Huey. My amendment says let our military people decide which \nis best. If you are going to vote for this program, then you ought to \nlet the military people decide what is going to give it the greatest \nchance of success, and not have a bunch of Congressmen and Senators \ntell you what is going to have the greatest chance of success. We \nshould give significant weight to what our military people think will \nwork in this area.\n  If you want to condemn the Plan Colombia program to failure at the \noutset, then provide them with inferior equipment so that they can't \nget the job done. I suggest that is what is happening with the present \nlanguage in this bill. In virtually every operational category--speed, \nmaximum passengers, flight time, ceiling, weight-carrying capacity--the \nBlackhawk outperforms the Huey. That is not at all surprising, since \nthe Huey is a Vietnam war vintage aircraft, which first went into \nproduction in 1959--40 years ago. The production of Hueys ended in \n1976, a quarter of a century ago. The Blackhawk is newer; in fact, it \nis still being manufactured. Moreover, the Blackhawk was engineered \nspecifically to address the deficiencies experienced with the Huey \nduring the Vietnam conflict.\n  The so-called Huey II is a retrofitted Huey. The upgrade package that \nthe Committee mark would fund was only developed 4 years ago and sold \nto the Colombian armed forces to improve the performance of Hueys \ncurrently in operation in that country. None of the U.S. services have \nchosen to upgrade Huey inventories using the kits the Appropriations \nCommittee proposes to provide Colombia. In fact, the U.S. Armed Forces \nare in the process of phasing out current inventories of the 800 Huey \naircraft and replacing them entirely with the newer model aircraft, \nincluding Blackhawks. Hueys are no longer used in combat missions by \nany of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  The Appropriations Committee has indirectly acknowledged the \ndifferences in capability of the two aircraft by recommending a 2-for-1 \nsubstitute of Hueys for Blackhawks--60 Huey II's, instead of 30 \nBlackhawks. That also means that the significant cost advantages that \nthe proponents of the Huey II have pointed to as a justification for \nthe substitution is significantly reduced. It is even further reduced \nbecause U.S. military experts who are familiar with the conditions in \nColombia in which the aircraft will be operating have stated it will \nactually take two-plus Hueys to accomplish what one Blackhawk could do. \nIf that is the case, then the cost advantage argument goes out the \nwindow. The mission cost for a typical mission of transporting 88 \ntroops from a base, at a distance of 98 miles or less, would cost \nessentially the same.\n  The committee has asserted in it's committee report that one of the \nrationales for substituting Hueys for Blackhawks was the more immediate \navailability of Huey II's. I think that is disputable, in light of the \nfact that the 60 Hueys would require major refurbishing. There is \ncurrently a limited capacity in the United States, or Colombia for that \nmatter, to do that in a time frame that is much faster than the \ndelivery schedule that Sikorsky has proposed for the 30 Blackhawks. \nHowever, setting that point aside for the moment, there is another more \nfundamental flaw, with all due respect, in the committee's argument. It \nassumes the Colombian army has trained pilots available to fly in the \n60 Hueys once they arrive. Mr. President, that simply is not the case.\n  The expectation is that it will take between 6 to 9 months to train a \npilot to fly those Hueys, or the Blackhawks for that matter. In the \ncase of Hueys, at least double the number of pilots will need to be \ntrained to enable the Colombian Army to have an equivalent air mobility \nfor its elite battalions. You will need at least double the number of \npilots trained to carry out the missions. Frankly, the serious \nquestions as to whether or not that many individuals can be identified \non short notice in Colombia to undergo such training in order to \nactually produce the necessary pilots to operate that many Hueys safely \nand with the capacity and efficiency that is necessary.\n  Again, I don't claim to be an expert on this, conversant in all the \nnuances of various helicopter technologies. For that reason, my \namendment does not demand that the Huey be the choice. I have made a \ncase for it here, but I have tried to point out the fallacies in the \ndemanding choice in the bill.\n  Again, whether or not you agree with this policy overall, I hope you \nwill support this amendment. In fact, if you will oppose the policy \nbecause you think it is not likely to work well,\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\nthen you ought to be for this because at least this increases the \nchance of success of this program. So my amendment simply says let the \npros make the choices--not Senators or Congressmen for a specific \nState, but those who are knowledgeable about this issue, the defense \nexperts in our own country, and those in Colombia who know this \nterrain.\n  Last, I will put up a chart that shows the relative ranges of the two \nhelicopters. If you look at the colored circles on the chart, the red \nline is the range of a Huey. The black line is the range of a \nBlackhawk. Look at the difference in terms of range capacity of these \ntwo pieces of equipment.\n  With that, I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment when \na vote is called for on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. At the outset, neither of these helicopters were made \nin the Commonwealth of Kentucky. My good friend from Connecticut has \ndone, as usual, a very effective job of representing his position. Were \nI the Senator from Connecticut, I am confident I would be making a very \nsimilar speech. Even though the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut doesn't specify the particular kind of helicopter, as a \npractical matter, if you leave that decision entirely to the Pentagon, \nI think the Senator would agree that they are likely to prefer the \nBlackhawk.\n\n  Let me just point out to my colleagues why the committee made the \ndecision that it did. First, this is primarily a cost decision. While \nwe didn't want to compromise on safety or capability, we had to \nconsider the fact that over the next several years of use, this \nsubcommittee will have to provide financial support to maintain and \noperate whatever aircraft is selected to move Colombian troops. Mr. \nPresident, this is not a one-time procurement decision. We will be \ndealing with this in future years. According to the Defense Security \nCooperation Agency, the Blackhawks will cost about $12 million each and \nthen at least $1,200 an hour to operate. Counternarcotics aircraft are \nexpected to average 25 hours of flying time a month year-round. To \ncover these costs, the administration has requested $388 million to \nprocure, maintain, and operate the 30 Blackhawks.\n  In comparison, the Huey II will cost $1.8 million to refurbish, and \nthen roughly $500 an hour for fuel, spare parts, and other operational \ncosts.\n  Frankly, the strongest argument the administration made for \nBlackhawks over Hueys was that the former had twice the troop-carrying \ncapability, as Senator Dodd pointed out. While the Huey manufacturer \nchallenged this argument, I decided it was better safe than sorry. So \nto address the issue, we doubled the number of aircraft we are funding \nto 60. Even doubling the number of helicopters, the cost of the Huey \nprogram stays under $120 million.\n  Supporters of the Huey have also argued that they can be made \navailable sooner than the delivery schedule of the end of the year for \nthe Blackhawk. Given the pilot shortages and the time it will take to \n``train up'' either Blackhawk or Huey pilots, I don't see this aspect \nas particularly decisive.\n  I think we have assured the Colombians that they can successfully \nachieve their mission by taking the approach we recommended in the \nbill.\n  I think we have assured the Colombians that they can successfully \nachieve their mission at a lower cost, not only now but, very \nimportantly, to the budget here in the United States, and lower it in \nthe future for the United States.\n  With the savings we achieved by taking the approach we recommended in \nthe bill, we have been able to increase the regional support for the \nColombian police, increase support for human rights programs, and \nsustain requested levels for equipment, training, and related support \nfor counternarcotics battalions.\n  Senator Dodd's chart points out the precise reason we chose to fund \n60 Huey IIs rather than 30 Blackhawks. His chart points out that the \ncost to operate the Huey is $617 per hour compared with the Blackhawk \ncost of $1,675 per hour.\n  The foreign operations account has to pay for these operational costs \nthis year, next year, and every year after that. Those are years in \nwhich we will probably not have $1 billion in emergency funds for \nColombia. That means we will have to cut into other accounts to keep \nthese helicopters flying in future years. Which accounts do we cut? \nRefugees, UNICEF, funds for Armenia, and Russia, demining, or health? \nWhat accounts will pay the price to fly Blackhawks in the future years \nwhen Hueys would do?\n  These are U.S. units, which do not have Blackhawks, which will have \nto wait while the production line produces Colombia's inventory. Given \nthe short- and long-term costs, and given the impact on the \navailability for U.S. troops, the committee decided to provide twice \nthe number of refurbished Hueys which will meet all the troop transport \nrequirements in Colombia.\n  Those are the arguments for the approach the committee has chosen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am impressed with Senator Dodd's logic and wisdom in \ndrafting legislation which does not direct the purchase but, rather, \nmakes the purchase subject to the decisions of the DOD, which will \nultimately be responsible for the training and military support for the \nColombian Army.\n  I am here today principally because I was fortunate enough last week \nto be in Colombia and in the field with a narcotics battalion, to get \nthe opinions of those Colombian soldiers who actually have to fight \nthese missions, and to get the observations of the American special \nforces troops who are training the Colombians. I think their \nobservations will be very useful and informative to my colleagues. I \nbelieve I have an obligation to speak to those observations.\n  These are both excellent systems. But the question of what system do \nyou purchase and deploy is a function of the mission that the platform, \nthe helicopter, the system must execute.\n  Senator Dodd did a very good job of providing the context for the \nproposed operation. Let me add a bit of detail, if I may.\n  The use of Plan Colombia from a military standpoint is to create a \ncounternarcotics battalion which will push into the South from the \nprovinces of Putumayo and Caqueta. This is part of the Amazon jungle. \nIt is all jungle. The last road ends at Tres Esquinas. All military \nsupplies for the core operation of that base must be done by air. The \ncontext of the operation that is proposed is that they operate from \nTres Esquinas, which is about 150 nautical miles from the operating \nbase. That is their zone of operation.\n  The mission these counternarcotics troops will perform is to airlift \nout of Tres Esquinas, to move into landing zones that are close to \neither final laboratories or other significant assets of the \nnarcoterrorists, and to deliver, at a minimum, two platoons. Those 2 \nplatoons have about 70 personnel. The ultimate lift will be a full \ncompany of about 360 personnel.\n  It has been pointed out before that the range of the Huey II, Super \nHuey, is about 75 nautical miles carrying 10 troops, and the Huey II \ncan range only half the target area, half of the 115 nautical miles, \nwithout expensive refueling operations.\n  So the first tactical decision a commander would have to make if in \nfact he were deploying Super Hueys would be to operate in the full \nrange of the area of operations. You would have to go ahead and \nestablish, at least temporarily, four refueling points so the Hueys \ncould come in and refuel. This is in some respects a tactical hindrance \nto the operation.\n  First of all, you have to defend these positions in the field--in a \njungle area that is literally infested with guerrillas.\n  Second, the element of surprise would be at least somewhat vitiated \nif in fact they were able to see you come in, refuel, and then lift \noff, and go again to a target area.\n  In contrast to the range of the Huey II and the necessary-for-\nrefueling bases to cover the whole area, the Blackhawk has a range of \nabout 730 nautical miles and can carry 18 troops. This disparity \nbetween range and capacity of troop lift also goes to the issue of cost \nbecause obviously, in order to conduct these tactical operations, you \nwill need more of the Super Hueys than you would Blackhawk helicopters. \nThat doesn't completely\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nequate the force, but it in a significant way narrows operational \nforces.\n\n  The military personnel on the ground, the Colombian National Army, \nand the special forces advisers suggest that to put two platoons into \nan LZ someplace in this area of operations would require seven Hueys as \ncompared to four Blackhawks. Again, tactically, four Blackhawk aircraft \nflying at higher speeds and moving in without the necessity to refuel \ngives them more operational capabilities, and it gives them more \ncapability to amass their forces, strike quickly, and pull back \nquickly.\n  There is something else that has to be mentioned. They are flying \nagainst military forces that potentially have fairly sophisticated \ndefense systems, which again puts a premium on speed and surprise--\nbeing able to get in and out--and also the survivability of the \nhelicopters. That is again an issue that requires capital military \njudgments about what system is most capable to operate and survive in \nthis type of environment.\n  There is another aspect to this. The lift capacity of the Blackhawk, \naccording to the people to whom I spoke, gives it an advantage when \nthey operate closely in the highlands of the Andes where you need lift \nsimply because of the altitude. It also gives the Blackhawks some \nrespect.\n  Also, this was suggested to me while I was in the field. If you are \ngoing to do fast-rope rappelling operations, you have to come in, hover \nover the objective, and get your troops out. Many places in this area \nof operation will not be landing zones. You will have to require \nrappelling operations to get your troops on the ground and get them out \nagain.\n  Another aspect that was alluded to by Senator Dodd is the aspect of \nthe ability of the Colombian forces to absorb a number of helicopters. \nRight now, the State Department has managed to procure for the use of \nthe Colombians, at least temporarily, 18 Huey helicopters from Canada. \nThese are ``1-November'' models. Already, that has increased the \naviation capacity potentially of the Colombians by substantial \namounts. They are out finding pilots; they are finding logistical \nsupport.\n\n  If we give them 30 Blackhawks, that will stress their logistical \nability to train pilots, to provide mechanics, to provide crews, to \nprovide the kind of logistic base they need. If we double that by \nproviding twice as many Hueys, we will put additional pressure on the \nlogistical base of the Colombian military forces to do the job. That is \nsomething, practically, that we have to consider with respect to this \nissue.\n  What Senator Dodd has suggested is very thoughtful and appropriate, \nto make this military decision subject to military judgment and not our \nparticular judgment.\n  I was compelled to speak today because I had the chance, \ngratuitously, to be at Tres Esquinas and Larandia on Sunday to talk to \nthe Colombian soldiers who will fly the missions and jump into this \ndifficult area. I talked to our special forces troops and our military \nforces who are advising. They provided information, and it is important \nmy colleagues understand this information. It is appropriate we should \nbe considering this amendment, not to direct that the aircraft be one \nvariety or the other but to ensure that the Department of Defense make \na very careful review based upon some of the issues we have all talked \nabout, including range, lift capability, the nature of the operations, \nthe nature of the Colombian military forces, and their capacity to \nintegrate these platforms quickly into their operations.\n  I hope this debate accomplishes those missions. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the \ncommittee's position on this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, but I have to leave quickly.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to attend the ceremony, as well. Perhaps the \nleadership could provide a window for those who want to attend that \nceremony.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is above my pay grade. I will speak for 2 minutes and \nexpress my position. If the vote occurs while I am gone, people will \nsee an old bull scratch the ground very hard.\n  As a practical matter, this position that we have taken is the best \none for Colombia. We looked at this very seriously. This account is \nunder attack now. Does anyone think year after year after year after \nyear we will be able to declare an emergency on this account?\n  We provided the Hueys. They can have two or more times the number of \nHueys for the cost of what the administration wants to do with \nBlackhawks. The Blackhawks are fighting machines. They will be the tip \nof a sword going into another Vietnam, if we are not careful. What they \nneed are the Hueys. They need to transport these people. They need to \nbe able to fight against the drug people. They do not need to get these \nso they can fight against the insurgents.\n  I urge the Senate to realize what we are doing. We are doing our \nutmost to increase the tremendous pressure upon the drug operations in \nColombia. We want to do that in a way that Colombia can sustain the \ncost without coming back to this Congress year after year after year to \nask for money to maintain what we provided.\n  Others have spoken about the costs. The Huey is a good machine. We \nare upgrading the Huey and providing our own troops for them. There is \nno reason for anyone to be ashamed of flying a Huey in combat. But it \nis not the type of situation that calls for Blackhawks to be a part of \nour operation against the drug lords. What we need to do is provide the \nassistance they need and to give them the ability, if they want to \ncontinue this, to operate these machines.\n\n  I cannot see why we should start this precedent. I assume Senator \nMcConnell made the same comments. We have similar situations all over \nthe world. We are going to be faced in the next decade with trying to \nsuppress the supply of drugs coming literally from all over the globe. \nThis is no time to take the frontline item that we have for war-\nfighting machines and provide it as assistance to people trying to \nsuppress drug producers.\n  I wish I had more time to deal with this because I believe very \nstrongly that if we go to the Blackhawks--with the cost of operation \nper hour, the high maintenance cost, the high cost of continued \noperation--we will start a trendline that this budget cannot sustain \ninto the future. We have to think about this not only in terms of what \nwe will do now but what it will do in terms of outyear costs to \ncontinue this assistance. It is not a 1-year operation. We will not be \nable to stop this drug operation in Colombia in 1 year.\n  We have done our best. In fact, we have not done it yet. If this \naccount gets overloaded, I seriously question even surviving the \nSenate. We have been warned about that in terms of the level of \nsupport. I believe Senator McConnell and his committee have brought to \nus a bill that meets the needs, gives them the assistance, and gives \nthem the support to carry out their operations against the drug lords \nwithout getting the U.S. in the position of building up a military \nforce in Colombia to deal with the other problems they face internally.\n  I hope the Senate agrees with our position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will join my good friend from Alaska \nshortly, but this amendment I have offered says to let the people we \nare going to get into the situation decide. Some people think we ought \nnot be involved with this. I respect their position, but I disagree. If \nwe are going to get involved with narcotraffickers who are as well \nheeled and financed as any military group in the world, if we are going \nto do the job right and properly, we ought to let the military people \ndecide what they need. My amendment says to let the military people \ndecide what works best.\n  Let me read what 24 of our aviation experts sent to Colombia \nspecifically for the purpose of trying to determine what equipment \nwould work best had to say on the impact of substituting 60 Hueys for \n30 Blackhawks, as originally proposed:\n  The superior troop-carrying capacity and range of the Blackhawk \nversus the Huey, coupled with the combat nature of the operations, the \nrequirement to operate at high altitude areas and the increased \nsurvivability of both aircrew and troops, clearly indicate that the \nBlackhawk is the helicopter that should be fielded to Colombia in \nsupporting the counterdrug effort.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n  Additionally, the number of acquired pilots, crew chiefs, gunners, \nand mechanics to operate and maintain the Hueys is twice that of the \nBlackhawks. Infrastructure requirements, maintenance, building, \nparking, and refueling areas, as well as other associated building \nrequirements, are essentially double to support the 60 Hueys as opposed \nto the 30 Blackhawks.\n  If this issue were to be decided strictly on dollars and cents--put \naside the issue of whether or not one piece of equipment is better than \nthe next--the 18 Hueys that are there, plus the 60 they talk about \nsending, those numbers exceed what it would cost in order to have the \nequipment that the military says they need to do the job. These are the \nnumbers from the military.\n  I am not suggesting you blindly follow the military in every case. \nBut my amendment says at least let them make a recommendation as to \nwhat they think is right. It doesn't say you have to take the \nBlackhawk. It says make the proper, intelligent decision.\n  We heard from my colleague from Rhode Island, a graduate of West \nPoint Academy, who served with distinction in the U.S. military for a \ncareer. He was just in Colombia, along with others, going down to \nassess what makes the best sense. He comes back with the same \nconclusion: We ought to let the military people decide.\n  I have been to Colombia many times. I know that terrain, where the \nflatlands are, where most of this problem exists. If I can get that \nchart here which shows the map of Colombia? Let me make the point \nagain.\n\n  When you get down to the area where most of the narcotraffickers \noperate, that is jungle. That is down along that Ecuadorian border, the \nPutumayo River. There are no roads here at all. The roads end up here \nin the highlands.\n  The idea that you are going to have the capacity to handle 90 \nhelicopters--they do not have the personnel in Colombia to do that. If \nyou want to condemn this program to failure, then demand this language \nbe in this amendment. The change we are offering at least offers this \nprogram a much higher chance of success down the road by allowing 60 \nBlackhawks, which every military expert who has looked at this says is \nwhat you ought to have to deal with the altitude of the Andes because \nof its lift capacity, personnel capacity to be able to move into this \narea, and the speed to move in and out.\n  Again, it seems to me, if you look at the charts, on all the \ncomparisons here, using 1976 equipment--the last year the Huey was \nmade--as opposed to a modern piece of equipment is wrong. Unless you \nthink this is not an issue worth fighting over, if you think you want \nto have these narcotraffickers control this country and take over this \nplace and ship on an hourly basis to this country the drugs that are \nkilling 50,000 people a year, we ought not support it at all. But if \nyou are going to do it and you think it is worthy of doing, then do it \nright. Do it with the kind of equipment that will guarantee at least a \nhigher possibility of success, or we will end up doing it ourselves \ndown the road, which I don't welcome at all.\n  We now have Colombians who can fly these helicopters or can be \ntrained to do so. Let them do the job. If we send in inferior equipment \nthat can't get the job done, the problem gets worse, the situation gets \nworse, and then we will be regretting the day we made a political \ndecision about the Hueys rather than a military decision about what \nworks best.\n  I urge colleagues, regardless of their position on whether or not \nthis is a program they want to support, to support this amendment which \nsays this decision ought to be left to the people who make the \ncalculated determinations of what works best. That is all this \namendment does. It does not demand a Blackhawk. It just says make the \ndecision about what makes the best sense. I will live with whatever \ndecision that is. But I don't want to have a political decision, I \ndon't want to be told I have to accept 60 or 90 Hueys, when I know in \nColombia you don't have the personnel to support it. It will take too \nlong, you will never get it done, and you don't have the capacity to \nget the job accomplished.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when it comes to a \nvote. I think my colleague from Connecticut wants to be heard on this \nissue.\n  I don't know how the chairman of the committee wants to handle this. \nI would like to be excused for about an hour to attend a very important \nmedal ceremony for one of our colleagues.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are not ready to schedule a vote yet, I am told.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there are United States units that \ndon't have Blackhawks yet, that will have to wait while Blackhawks are \nproduced to send to Colombia, which could get by on Hueys. My good \nfriend from Connecticut has made a good case for a home State product, \nthe Blackhawk helicopter. The Blackhawk is not made in Kentucky. The \nHuey is not made in Kentucky. What I am concerned about, as chairman of \nthis subcommittee, is two things: No. 1, the fact that even U.S. units \ndon't have Blackhawks yet and will have to wait, as I just said, while \nthese are sent to Colombia. And, No. 2 is the cost of operation.\n\n  We are not going to have $1 billion to spend on Colombia every year. \nThis is a unique year in which we are debating whether to spend $1 \nbillion on the drug war in Colombia--an unusual year. But the cost of \noperating these Blackhawks, if we go in that direction, is going to \ncome back every year and that is $1,000 an hour more than operating the \nHuey--$1,000 an hour more than operating the Huey.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee just \npointed out, and also the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Huey will get the job done for a lower \ncost to the United States. The foreign operations account is going to \nhave to pay for these operational costs, as I just pointed out, not \njust this year but the year after that and the year after that and the \nyear after that. That means we will have to cut into other accounts to \nkeep these helicopters flying.\n  That is the reason the subcommittee decided to go with the Huey \nbecause we think the Huey will get the job done at less cost this year, \nnext year, and in years down the road, which is not to say I am sure \nthe Colombians would not like to have Blackhawks; I am sure they would. \nAll of our U.S. units that need them would like to have them, too, and \nthey don't have them yet. So that is the reason for the recommendation \nof the subcommittee.\n  I hope when we subsequently vote on the Dodd amendment it will be \ndefeated. Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \noccur in relation to the pending Dodd amendment and the Gorton \namendment beginning at 6:10 p.m., with the first vote in relation to \nthe Gorton amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Dodd \namendment, with the time between now and 6:10 p.m. to be equally \ndivided for debate on both amendments, and no second-degree amendments \nbe in order prior to the votes just described, with 2 minutes between \nthe two votes for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, does he have a feeling whether there will be votes after \nthose votes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am told the majority leader wants to continue and \ntry to wrap the bill up tonight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am for that. There may be some difficulty with some of \nthe amendments coming down. I urge Senators who have amendments, even \nif we have to put a couple aside, that they come down and start \ndebating their amendments.\n  I think I can speak for both the distinguished chairman and myself on \nthe pending amendment. There will be no difficulty in having it set \naside for the moment if somebody wants to start debate on another \namendment, especially if it is going to require a rollcall vote. I can \nsee a situation where it can easily be sequenced following these other \ntwo amendments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont, as we speak, staff on\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nboth sides are going over the amendments that were filed prior to the \ndeadline of 3 p.m. Hopefully, we will be able to process some of those \nby agreement during this period between now and 6:10 p.m. I agree with \nthe Senator from Vermont, we want to make progress. If anybody wants to \ncome down and offer an amendment that might be contentious and debate \nit, we will certainly be glad to see them.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The point is, we will jointly move to set something aside \nso they can debate an amendment, if they wish. I urge that. It will \nsave us from having debate quite late this evening. In the meantime, we \nwill try to clear some amendments. Even in that regard, if there are \nSenators who have amendments they wish cleared, we can try to do that.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Virginia on the floor, one of my \nSenators when I am away from home. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I very much want to make a statement in \nsupport of the subcommittee's efforts on the funding for the Colombia \noperation. Our committee had a hearing on the subject. We looked into \nit very carefully. At the appropriate time, I want to be recognized by \nthe Chair. I need a few more minutes to collect my documents, but I \njudge from the managers, I would not be disruptive to what they are \nengaged in were I to seek the floor in the near future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Virginia, there is no time \nlike the present or the near present. Seeing no one else on the floor \nat the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 3529, 3536, 3540, 3544, And 3568, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have some more amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides. Therefore, en bloc, I call up amendments \nNos. 3529, 3536, 3540, 3544, and 3568.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) According to the World Health Organization, in 1999, \n     there were 5.6 million new cases of HIV/AIDS throughout the \n     world, and two-thirds of those (3.8 million) were in sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (2) Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world \n     where a majority of those with HIV/AIDS--55 percent--are \n     women.\n       (3) When women get the disease, they often pass it along to \n     their children, and over 2 million children in sub-Saharan \n     Africa are living with HIV/AIDS.\n       (4) New investments and treatments hold out promise of \n     making progress against mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS. For example--\n       (A) a study in Uganda demonstrated that a new drug could \n     prevent almost one-half of the HIV transmissions from mothers \n     to infants, at a fraction of the cost of other treatments; \n     and\n       (B) a study of South Africa's population estimated that if \n     all pregnant women in that country took an antiviral \n     medication during labor, as many as 110,000 new cases of HIV/\n     AIDS could be prevented over the next five years in South \n     Africa alone.\n       (5) The Technical Assistance, Trade Promotion, and Anti-\n     Corruption Act of 2000, as approved by the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee on March 23, 2000, ensures that not less \n     than 8.3 percent of USAID's HIV/AIDS funding is used to \n     combat mother-to-child transmission.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that of the funds provided in this Act, the USAID should \n     place a high priority on efforts, including providing \n     medications, to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3544\n\n     (Purpose: To require a report on the delivery of humanitarian \n              assistance to Sudan, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

PERU.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) the Organization of American States (OAS) Electoral \n     Observer Mission, led by Eduardo Stein, deserves the \n     recognition and gratitude of the United States for having \n     performed an extarodinary service in promoting representative \n     democracy in the Americas by working to ensure free and fair \n     elections in Peru and exposing efforts of the Government of \n     Peru to manipulate the national elections in April and May of \n     2000 to benefit the president in power.\n       (2) the Government of Peru failed to establish the \n     conditions for free and fair elections--both for the April 9 \n     election as well as the May 28 run-off--by not taking \n     effective steps to correct the ``insufficiencies, \n     irregularities, inconsistencies, and inequities'' documented \n     by the OAS Electoral Observation Mission.\n       (3) the United States Government should support the work of \n     the OAS high-level mission, and that such mission should base \n     its specific recommendations on the views of civil society in \n     Peru regarding commitments by their government to respect \n     human rights, the rule of law, the independence and \n     constitutional role of the judiciary and national congress, \n     and freedom of expression and journalism.\n       (4) in accordance with P.L. 106-186, the United States must \n     review and modify as appropriate its political, economic, and \n     military relations with Peru and work with other democracies \n     in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a restoration of \n     democracy in Peru.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report evaluating \n     United States political, economic, and military relations \n     with Peru, in accordance with P.L. 106-186.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their efforts on \nthis very important piece of legislation. They will have my support.\n  Mr. President, I have been associated with this very important piece \nof legislation providing aid to Colombia since it was first recommended \nto the Congress of the United States.\n  I commend the administration and, in particular, General McCaffrey. I \nhave had an opportunity, as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services \nand, indeed, for some 22 years to work with General McCaffrey, \nparticularly during the period of the Gulf War in 1991 when he showed \nextraordinary leadership as a troop commander in that decisive battle \nto turn back Saddam Hussein's threats.\n  Now he has volunteered, once again, as an American patriot, to take \non this somewhat thankless task of dealing with the almost insoluble \nproblems of the importing into this country of drugs. This is one \neffort by the general--indeed, the administration, and others--to try \nto curtail this illegal importation of drugs.\n  I heard a colleague earlier today concerned about: Well, we are not \nspending enough money here at home. My quick research and consultation \nwith other colleagues indicates that I think some $500 million in \ntaxpayers' money has been added by this Congress to the \nAdministration's budget requests for domestic programs over the past 3 \nyears. This money has been expended in an effort to educate and to, in \nevery other way, help Americans, first, avoid the use of drugs and \nthen, if misfortune does strike an individual and their families, to \ntry to deal with the tragic consequences.\n  So I rise to speak in support of the U.S. counternarcotics activities \nin the Andean ridge and neighboring countries, as provided for in this \nbill, and to address the impact of drug trafficking on the stability of \nthe region.\n  The importance of this region to the United States cannot be \noverestimated. I will give you one example. The region provides the \nUnited States with almost 20 percent of the supply of foreign oil. The \nnumber is likely to increase with the recent discovery, in Colombia's \neastern plains, of reserves estimated at 2 million barrels. The ongoing \ncontroversy over the price of gas by the American motorists at this \nvery moment is reason to help Colombia fight this problem.\n  When I say help this nation, I have been privileged to meet with \ntheir President in the course of his visits here, and also meet with \nthe Foreign Minister, the Ambassador--the very courageous Ambassador \nfrom Colombia to the United States--and many others\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\nfrom that nation. And, indeed, I have met with private citizens here in \nAmerica who have had their origin and background in Colombia. So I have \ntalked to a wide range of individuals.\n  This legislation is the right thing. I commend all those, certainly \nhere in the Senate, and particularly those in the current Government of \nColombia, as well as the citizens who have worked to foster this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate I rise to speak in support of United \nStates counter-narcotics activities in the Andean Ridge and neighboring \ncountries as provided for in this bill, and the impact of drug \ntrafficking on the stability of the region. The importance of this \nregion to the United States cannot be overstated.\n  This region provides the United States with almost 20 percent of its \nsupply of foreign oil--a number that is likely to increase with the \nrecent discovery in Colombia's eastern plains of reserves that are \nestimated at two billion barrels. The ongoing controversy over the \nprice of gasoline that the American motorist is paying only serves to \nreinforce the importance of this commodity in our everyday life and \neconomy.\n  In sharp and tragic contrast is the threat from this same region \nposed by illegal drugs to American citizens on the streets of our \ncities and in the playgrounds of our schools. An estimated 80 percent \nof the cocaine and 90 percent of the heroin smuggled out of Colombia is \ndestined for the United States. Sadly these drugs have caused, directly \nand indirectly the death of 50,000 Americans each year and the loss of \nbillions of dollars from America's economy.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact that narco-trafficking in \nColombia is having on the democratically elected governments in the \nregion. Many of these countries have only recently transitioned from \nmilitary dictatorships to democracies--and as recent events have \ndemonstrated--these democracies are fragile. The ``spill over'' effect \nfrom the narco-trafficking in Colombia could prove enormously \ndestabilizing to the surrounding nations.\n  Additionally, this region is home to the Panama Canal, a waterway of \nsignificant importance to America. With the United States no longer \nmaintaining a permanent military presence in Panama, it is crucial that \nwe be vigilant against any threat as a consequence of drug trafficking \nour friends in the Panamanian Government and the Canal itself.\n  The President's recent request for a $1.6 billion supplemental aid \npackage to assist Colombia and its neighbors in their counter-narcotics \nefforts, and the funding which will be appropriated through this and \nother acts for that purpose, represents an increased U.S. role in the \nregion's difficulties. The rampant violent criminal activities of the \nvarious terrorist organizations and paramilitary groups involved in \nnarco-trafficking, including kidnaping and murder, continue to \nundermine the stability of the democratically elected governments of \nthe region. This is particularly true in Colombia.\n  The proposed aid package, much of which will be provided to Colombia \nin order to fund portions of the $7.5 billion Plan Colombia, represents \none of the most aggressive foreign policy actions of the United States \nin Latin America in recent history. However, the funding contained in \nthis package is only a small part of our overall commitment to this \nproblem. We already spend hundreds of millions of dollars and deploy \nhundreds of military personnel to the region every year. In addition to \nthe proposed increase in funding, our support for Plan Colombia will \nrequire us to deploy many more military personnel in order to train \nColombia law enforcement and military personnel. This is a matter of \ngrave concern for the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has as its \nprimary focus the safety and well-being of the men and women who \nproudly serve in the Armed Forces.\n  The decision by the Congress to support Plan Colombia and an \nincreased American involvement in the region was not to be an easy one \nto make. Some have compared the situation in Colombia to Vietnam, and \nwarn against such a U.S. military involvement in an internal matter. \nOthers believe that such involvement is in our vital interest and warn \nof the consequences if we refuse to engage.\n  On April 4th of this year, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a \nhearing on this issue in order to explore the problem and determine \nwhat, if any, assistance was appropriate. Our witnesses at that hearing \nincluded Brian Sheridan, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special \nOperations and Low Intensity Conflict; Rand Beers, Assistant Secretary \nof State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs; \nGeneral Charles Wilhelm, Commander-in-Chief, United States Southern \nCommand; and Mr. Peter Romero, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for \nWestern Hemisphere Affairs.\n  Mr. President, at that hearing I asked our witnesses five questions I \nbelieve to be essential in making a decision regarding what role the \nUnited States should play in this effort:\n  (1) Is it in our vital national security interest to become involved?\n  (2) Will the American people support this involvement?\n  (3) Can we make a difference if we become involved?\n  (4) Will American involvement create a reaction amongst the people of \nthe region that is counter to our interest? and\n  (5) Are those we propose to help committed to achieving the same \ngoals we support?\n  These are not easy questions but the testimony of the witnesses left \nme to conclude that it is in our interest, that we can make a \ndifference, and that we will have the support of the people of the \nUnited States and the people of the region if we take appropriate and \neffective action to help the democratically elected governments of this \nregion regain control of their sovereign territory.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents that appropriate action and I \nbelieve that our Armed Forces will ensure that it is effective.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time in the \nquorum call be divided equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time come \noff of the time of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we will be voting in just a few moments in \nregard to the Gorton amendment. I rise to talk about the bill but also \nto oppose, with due respect, the Gorton amendment.\n  What is at the heart of this debate on the emergency aid package to \nColombia, the very essence of why we need to help restore stability in \nColombia and help combat the violent insurgents, is the urgent need to \nkeep drugs off our streets in the United States and out of the hands of \nour children. That is what this debate is all about; that is what this \nvote on the amendment is all about.\n  As my colleagues know, this emergency package would provide $934 \nmillion to support Colombian efforts to eliminate drugs at the source, \nimprove human rights programs, improve rule of law programs, and \nincrease economic development. The fact is, there is an emergency in \nour neighbor to the south, in the country of Colombia. This country, \nthis democracy, is embroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war, a \ncivil war that has gone on for decades with a death toll reaching at \nleast 35,000.\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\n  Today, we have heard a lot of speeches about human rights abuses in \nColombia and what has taken place in the past. In that context, I \nremind my colleagues of the fact the current aid package that the \nSenator from Kentucky has put together is based on legislation Senators \nCoverdell, Grassley, Graham, and I introduced last fall, which was \ndeveloped with the protection of human rights in mind. It is an \nintegral part of this bill. Our colleagues have a right to be concerned \nwith past human rights abuses. The way to deal with this is through the \nconditions that are written all through this bill.\n  My office met with numerous human rights organizations. We worked \nclosely with Senator Leahy's office, and many others, to ensure that \nsafeguards were put in place to prevent U.S. assistance from being used \nby those in Colombia who do not respect human rights.\n  Many of those original provisions have been incorporated into the \npackage before us, such as funds to monitor the use of U.S. assistance \nby the Colombian armed forces and Colombian national police; funds to \nsupport efforts to investigate and prosecute members of both the armed \nforces and the paramilitary organizations involved in human rights \nabuses. It also contains funds to address the social and economic needs \nof the displaced population in Colombia.\n  Our provisions were not only developed to punish human rights abuses \nin Colombia but, more importantly, they were developed to prevent those \nabuses.\n  The fact is that this Congress places such a strong emphasis on the \nprotection of human rights that the legislation before us today would \nprovide more funding for human rights--$25 million to be exact--than \nwas in the President's requested budget. It is more than the President \nrequested.\n  This Congress is committed to the protection of human rights and will \ncontinue to monitor the assistance we provide to ensure that every \npenny is used for its intended purpose, which is the respect for and \nprotection of human rights.\n  Many of us on the floor today, and those watching in their offices, \nhave spent a lot of time and energy to expel communism and bring \ndemocracy to this hemisphere and to bring a rule of law and human \nrights protection to this hemisphere. The 1980s were a true success \nstory for the ideals we believe in and for our attempt to spread those \nideals and beliefs in democracy throughout this great hemisphere. The \npeople of this hemisphere paid a very heavy price, but I think that \nprice was worth paying to achieve the spread of democracy throughout \nthe hemisphere. We brought democracy and we brought opportunity to our \nneighbors.\n  Today, the drug trade--not communism--is now the dominant threat to \npeace and freedom in the Americas. It threatens the sovereignty of the \nColombian democracy and the continued prosperity and security of our \nentire hemisphere. Tragically, our own drug habit--America's drug \nhabit--is what is fueling this threat in our hemisphere. It is our own \ncountry's drug use that is causing the instability and violence in \nColombia and in the Andean region.\n  The sad fact is that the cultivation of coca in Colombia has doubled, \nfrom over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Poppy cultivation \nalso has grown to such an extent that it is now the source of the \nmajority of heroin consumed in the United States. Not surprisingly, as \ndrug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among \nadolescents has also increased. To make matters worse, the Colombian \ninsurgents see the drug traffickers as a financial partner who will \nsustain their illicit cause, which only makes the FARC and ELN--these \nguerrillas--grow stronger and stronger day by day. So the sale of drugs \nin the United States today not only promotes the drug business, but it \nalso fuels the antidemocratic insurgents in Colombia.\n  Some may ask, why does Colombia matter? Why are we taking good tax \ndollars to help our neighbors to the south? I think the answer is \nsimple. It matters because Colombia is shipping their drugs into the \nUnited States. It matters because the drug trade is a source of rampant \nlawlessness and violence within Colombia itself--violence and \nlawlessness, which has destabilized that country and now threatens the \nentire Andean region.\n  Fortunately, in the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to \nrecognize the escalating threats, and we have been working to restore \nour drug-fighting capability beyond our shores. Many of us who have \nworked very tirelessly on the Colombian assistance package this year \nalso worked together just a few short years ago to pass the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act, which is now the law of the land. This \n3-year plan is designed to restore international eradication, \ninterdiction, and crop alternative development funding. With this law, \nwhich we passed on a bipartisan basis, we have already made a $800 \nmillion downpayment--$200 million of which represents the first \nsubstantial investment in Colombia for counternarcotics activities.\n  The emergency assistance package that we have before us this \nafternoon is based on a blueprint that Senator Coverdell and I \ndeveloped and introduced last October--3 months before the \nadministration unveiled its proposal. As our plan, the emergency \nassistance package the Senator from Kentucky has crafted goes beyond \ncounternarcotics assistance and crop alternative development programs \nin Colombia. It goes beyond Colombia and targets other Latin-American \ncountries, including Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador.\n  This regional approach is the only approach, it is the right \napproach, and it is critical. Both Peru and Bolivia have made enormous \nprogress in reducing drug cultivation in their respective countries, \nand they have done it with the help, candidly, of our assistance, and \nit has worked. Now, an emphasis only on the Colombian drug problems \nrisks the obvious ``spillover'' effect of Colombia's drug trade \nshifting to adjacent countries in the region.\n  Some of my colleagues have taken the floor today to express hesitancy \nand reluctance and opposition to this assistance package. I wish to \ntake a moment to direct my comments specifically to them and \nspecifically to some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  Our Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act was an attempt to change \nthe direction of our national drug policy--a drug policy that clearly \nwas not working. We took that first step. Today, we must take the \nsecond step. We passed that very important legislation because we had \nto; we had to because the current administration, unfortunately, had \npresided over the literal dismantling of our international drug-\nfighting capability.\n  Let me explain. When President George Bush left the White House, we \nwere spending approximately one-quarter of our total Federal antidrug \nbudget on international drug interdiction, either on law enforcement in \nother countries, on our own Customs, on the DEA, and on crop \neradication. Basically, it was taking that huge chunk of the Federal \nantidrug budget and spending it to try to stop drugs from ever reaching \nour shores. It was a balanced approach and it made sense.\n  After 6 years of the Clinton Presidency, that percentage of our \nbudget--that one-quarter of our total budget--was reduced to 13 to 14 \npercent, which is a dramatic reduction in the percentage of money we \nare spending on international drug interdiction.\n  That is why many of us in this body--on a bipartisan basis, in both \nthe House and here in the Senate--worked to pass the Western Hemisphere \nDrug Elimination Act. Speaker Hastert, before he was Speaker, played a \nmajor role in working on the House version of this bill, as did many, \nmany others.\n  We passed that bill. It became law. It has made a difference. We have \nbegun to at least reverse the direction of our foreign policy. We need \nto get back to that balanced approach, where we spend money on \ninternational interdiction, domestic law enforcement, treatment, and \neducation. It has to be a balanced approach.\n  We passed the bill, it became law, and we started to reverse that \npolicy. The initiative for that came, quite candidly, from this side of \nthe aisle, with support from the other side of the aisle. We saw what \nthe administration was doing and we said that the policy had to change. \nWe said we needed to put more money into interdiction, and that is \nexactly what we did. We said, candidly, we needed a balanced policy\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nand we began to move in that direction. Now, today, we need to build on \nthat effort.\n  We need to build on that effort, which today is focused primarily on \nthe current crisis that we see in Colombia. Senators Coverdell, \nGrassley, Feinstein, and others worked with me to put together a \npackage specifically dealing with the situation in Colombia.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the big picture. Step back from the \ndebate about this amendment and look at where we are going as a \ncountry. Think about what is in the best interest not of Colombia, but \nof the United States. This assistance package before us, which my \ncolleague from Kentucky has put together, was put together because \nColombia is our neighbor, and what affects our neighbor to the south \naffects us. We have a very real interest in helping to stabilize \nColombia and keeping it democratic, keeping it as our friend, keeping \nit as our trading partner, and keeping its drugs off our streets.\n\n  Colombia faces a crisis that is different than any crisis that any \ncountry has ever faced before in the history of the world. Many \ncountries have faced guerrilla movements in the past few decades, but \nno country has ever faced guerrillas with as much money as the \nColombian guerrillas have. I don't know of any country that has ever \nfaced a guerrilla movement supported by so much illegal drug money. A \nsynergistic relationship is involved between the drug dealers and the \nguerrillas; each one benefits from the other; each one takes care of \nthe other. While this is a crisis that Colombia faces, it is a crisis \ndriven by those who consume drugs in our country, and we must admit \nthat it is a crisis that directly impacts all of us in the United \nStates. It directly impacts you; it directly impacts me, our children, \nand our grandchildren.\n  I ask my colleagues to really consider the great human tragedy that \nColombia is today. I ask my colleagues to remember how we got here, and \nto remember what role this side of the aisle, with help from the other \nside, played in trying to deal with the Colombian problem, and what \nrole we played in trying to increase the money we were spending and the \nresources we were providing to stop drugs from ever coming into to our \ncountry.\n  The emergency aid package before us today is in the best interests of \nthe Colombian-Andean region. There is no doubt about that. But, more \nimportantly, and more significantly for this body and for the vote we \nare about to cast, it is in the best interest of the United States.\n  It is clearly something we have to do. It may be tempting on the \nGorton amendment to say: Look. Why don't we just take that money? We \ndon't need to send it to Colombia. We don't need to send it down there. \nWhat do we care about what goes on in Colombia? Let's keep it here, \nspend it here, and apply it to the national debt.\n  I understand how people may come to the floor and say that. I \nunderstand how people may come to the floor and think that and maybe \neven vote that way. But I think in the long run it would be a tragic \nmistake.\n  If we are trying to make an analogy, let me be quite candid. The \nanalogy isn't any long-term involvement in the United States. The \nanalogy shouldn't be to Bosnia; it shouldn't be to Vietnam; It \nshouldn't even be Kosovo. The analogy is what happened in the Central \nAmericas in the 1980s.\n  Quite candidly, many people on this side of the aisle and on the \nother side were directly involved in trying to make sure democracy \ntriumphed in Central America. We were successful because people took \nchances. People cast tough votes. People said we care. Today, when you \ntravel through Central America, you find democracies. I have had the \nopportunity within the last several years to do that, and to travel to \nmost every Central American country. No, things are not perfect. But \neach of those countries is moving towards more democracy. Each of those \ncountries is moving towards more market-driven economies. Each of those \ncountries has a chance to develop a middle class.\n  That is the analogy. The United States cared. We were involved. The \npeople there got the job done.\n  Colombia faces a very difficult challenge. Will this be the only time \nMembers of the Senate are asked to vote on this and to send money to \ndeal with this? Of course not. We all know that. This is a commitment, \nand it is probably going to be somewhat of a long commitment. But I \nthink it is clearly in our national interest.\n  We vote today not to assist Colombia. We vote today really to assist \nourselves because what happens in Colombia directly impacts the United \nStates--whether it is trade, whether it is illegal immigration, or \nwhether it is drugs coming into this country. What happens in that \nregion of the world has a direct impact on people in Cleveland, on \npeople in Cincinnati, or any other State, or any city in the United \nStates. We vote in our self-interest today for this package. We vote in \nour national self-interest, I believe, to vote down the Gorton \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \nconcerns about the foreign operations bill that is before us. I am \nconcerned, and I believe that many of my colleagues will be concerned, \nabout what is in this bill. And I am even more concerned about what is \nnot in it.\n  What is here in this bill, is an extremely expensive package of \nsupport to the Colombian military, designated, of course, as emergency \nspending. I recognize that Colombia is a country in crisis. I believe \nthat it is in the national interest of the United States to help \nColombia emerge from that crisis and into an era in which basic human \nrights and the rule of law are firmly entrenched in the fabric of \nColombian society.\n  I recognize that we all share an interest in fighting the terrible \nimpact that illegal drugs have on our own society and in our own \ncommunities. So I have made a very serious effort to evaluate this \ninitiative over a number of months. I have heard the perspectives of my \nconstituents, of the business community, of human rights activists, and \nof the administration. I have also heard from Colombian civic groups \nand labor unions and from the Colombian government itself. In the end, \nI remain deeply skeptical about the wisdom of this undertaking.\n  My primary concerns about the proposed package of assistance to \nColombia are two-fold. First, I am concerned about the degree to which \nthis package involves the United States in a counter-insurgency \ncampaign in Colombia. The aim of our assistance to the Colombian \nmilitary would be to combat narcotics traffickers, I have no doubt--but \nits primary use would be to wage war against the rebels who control the \nsouth. Our country's history teaches us something about how easy it is \nto get stuck in such situations, about how seductive arguments to \nincrease our involvement might become after we invest massive resources \nin this phase of the counter-insurgency campaign. It troubles me that, \nbecause of the drug-related elements of the Colombia issue, we in this \nbody are not, perhaps, walking into this scheme with our eyes wide open \nto these dangers.\n  But my primary concern, Mr. President, is the impact that Plan \nColombia could have on the human rights of Colombians. The Colombian \nmilitary, which this package of assistance would directly support, has \nbeen involved in serious human rights abuses and has a record of \ncollaborating with the murderous paramilitary forces that terrorize \nColombian citizens. The package in the foreign operations \nappropriations bill seems, in the words of the Economist magazine, to \n``merely bolt three shiny new antidrugs battalions on to an abusive and \nunreformed military force.'' That action would escalate a war in which \ncivilians bear the brunt of the violence. I know that Senator Leahy has \nworked hard to establish human rights conditions for the use of this \nassistance. But I am not at all certain that it is appropriate for the \nUnited States to engage the Colombian military to this degree at this \ntime.\n\n  I note that the Senator from Vermont has a point when he questions\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nthe emergency designation for this spending package. Colombia has been \nin crisis for some time. But of course, the emergency designation frees \nthis body from fiscal discipline--discipline, Mr. President, that we \nbadly need.\n  In contrast, for a genuine emergency, for the devastating flooding in \nsouthern Africa, this bill provides only one-eighth, one eighth, of the \nadministration's request. It was not so long ago, that the entire \ncountry was moved by video and photographs of the people of \nsoutheastern Africa, clinging to life in trees and rooftops as flood \nwaters rushed past them. These floods were particularly tragic because \nthe country most seriously affected by them, Mozambique, has made \nsignificant strides toward recovery from its long and brutal civil war. \nThough the country is still affected by extreme poverty, in recent \nyears Mozambique has enjoyed exceptional rates of economic growth. \nWhile more needs to be done, the country has improved its record with \nregard to basic human rights. Mr. President, the people of Mozambique \nhave been fighting for a better future. This kind of disaster comes at \na terrible time, and it will require the assistance of the \ninternational community to help the people of Mozambique to hold to the \nopportunities that lay before them before the waters rose.\n  And an appropriate level of funding for the communities ravaged by \nflooding in southern Africa is just the beginning. Even a cursory \nglance will indicate that there is a great deal that is not in this \nappropriations bill.\n  The news is not entirely bad. I applaud the increased funding levels \nto combat the global HIV/AIDS crisis, which I believe is one of the \nmost important international issues that this country faces in this new \nmillennium, although I would still like to see that level increase.\n  And I am pleased to see provisions linking the resumption of certain \nmilitary and security assistance programs for Indonesia to key \nconditions--conditions which bolster the position of reformers in the \nnew government by requiring real accountability for human rights abuses \nand real cooperation with the international community on matters \nrelating to East Timorese refugees. On this note, I would point out to \nmy colleagues the fact that UNHCR personnel recently suspended \nactivities in three refugee camps in West Timor because the security \nsituation in these camps, where military-backed militias continue their \ncampaign of intimidation and destabilization, has made it impossible to \nfor humanitarian workers to continue to do their jobs. Provisions like \nthose included in this bill are still critically important as are the \nmore comprehensive provisions of a bill that I have introduced, S. \n2621, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000.\n  Despite the laudable elements, this bill funds only $75 million of \nthe administration's $262 million debt relief request--and that's \nexcluding the $210 million supplemental request, which also goes \nunfunded. This bill barely addresses the crushing debt burden that \nstands as an obstacle to growth and development throughout much of the \ndeveloping world.\n  This bill allocates only $85 million for peacekeeping operations. \nThat is a sizable cut. It is likely to threaten one of the most logical \nand far-sighted initiatives that we have in this area, Mr. President, \nthe African Crisis Response Initiative, or ACRI, which trains African \nmilitaries to help them to become more effective in working to secure \nstability and share the global burden of peacekeeping.\n  This bill cuts two of the most important accounts for international \ndevelopment aid, the ESF account and the World Bank IDA account, below \nfiscal year 2000 levels.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found that the U.S., \nwhen compared to twenty other donor nations worldwide devotes the \nsmallest portion of its national resources to development aid--the \nsmallest portion by far. The typical donor country in the study \ncontributed more than three times the share of national resources that \nthe U.S. contributes. In fact, the U.S. fails--and fails miserably--to \ncontribute the U.N. target level of even point-seven-percent--not seven \npercent, but seven-tenths of one percent--in aid to the developing \nworld. The Center found that, using a number of different sources, the \nlevel of U.S. development aid in fiscal year 2001 would be equal to its \nlowest level since the end of World War II, measured as a share of the \neconomy. That conclusion refers to the Administration's request, a \nrequest that this bill falls $1.7 billion below the President's \nrequest. I believe that we must exercise more foresight and that we \nmust re-think our priorities to make more room for the world around us \nand for the global context in which our great nation will operate in \nthis new century.\n  I believe strongly in fiscal discipline. I believe in governing \nwithin our means. I know that means tough choices. But I also know some \nof the appropriations bills we have just passed and no doubt will see \nmore of the same as we consider spending in fiscal year 2001. Yet we \ncontinue the disturbing trend, a trend that I believe runs counter to \nour national interest and counter to our national identity, of turning \nour back on the rest of the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3517\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Washington. Is there time \nremaining on that issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls the time, \nand there are 17 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry. I was distracted. What is the \nSenator from Florida asking?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is the Senator controlling the time in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Washington?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, by default I am. Would the Senator like some time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I request 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 8 minutes to my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have spoken earlier this afternoon on \nthe issue of Colombia in the context of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Minnesota. But now that we have another amendment relative \nto this provision within the foreign operations appropriations bill, I \nam pleased to have been afforded this opportunity to speak a second \ntime.\n  I believe that the fundamental thrust of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington, which would cut all but $200 million of the \nrecommended appropriations for the United States share of the financing \nplan in Colombia, would essentially eviscerate not only the U.S. \nparticipation but would probably eliminate the prospects of other \nnations, that see themselves looking to the United States for \nleadership in terms of dealing with the crisis in Colombia, and would \nprobably have a very destabilizing effect on Colombia's stated \nintention to provide more than half of the $7.5 billion cost of the \ncomprehensive plan in Colombia.\n  Essentially, what we would be saying, by adopting this amendment, is \nthat we are prepared to see Colombia continue in the almost death \nspiral of downward direction in which it has been in for the past many \nmonths.\n  I would like to first point out what are some of the national \ninterests of the United States that would be sacrificed if we were to \nallow that to occur. Of course, the most fundamental sacrifice would be \nthe loss of an effective democratic partner in the efforts to build \nstability within the Western Hemisphere. Colombia is the longest \ncontinuous democracy on the continent of South America. It is a country \nthat other countries, which are relatively new democracies, look to for \nleadership and example.\n  What a horrendous consequence it would be if, by our lack of \nresponding to the call for help at this critical time, we were to be \nthe principal agent of converting this nation of over half a\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\ncentury of democracy into a failed state.\n  There are also consequences to the region, particularly the Andean \nregion. That is a region that is already in trouble, as I know the \nPresiding Officer is well aware.\n  There is a new and untested government in Venezuela. We have, in \nEcuador, the first successful military coup in Latin America in almost \ntwo decades. Peru is in the midst of a very contentious election \naftermath which in many quarters has been called incredible in the \nsense of not being a credible election.\n\n  Even Bolivia, which has been a source of stability, had to impose \nessentially a period of martial law. And on the north side, we have \nPanama, which has recently been given full control of the Panama Canal, \nand where there are great concerns about the stability of that country, \nand particularly its vulnerability to drug traffickers.\n  So here Colombia sits, in the middle of this very vulnerable, \nfractious part of our hemisphere. If it goes down, it will have \nenormous spillover effects, and the consequences will be dire for U.S. \ninterests.\n  What we most think about when we hear the word ``Colombia'' is drugs. \nColombia has become an even greater source of drugs due, in part, to \nthe success of our efforts in Peru and Bolivia in reducing coca \nproduction, but also, unfortunately, due, in large part, to the fact \nthat we now have a marriage between the narcotraffickers, the \nguerrillas, and the paramilitaries who are all working together in \nvarious places in Colombia, particularly in the southern most regions, \nto have contributed to a doubling, maybe soon a tripling, of drug \nproduction in that nation over the last decade.\n  Colombia is also an important economic partner of the United States. \nIt has one of the larger economies in Latin America, and it has been a \nsignificant trading partner for the United States.\n  Colombia has had a long period not only of democracy but also of \nsustained economic growth. It was not until 3 or 4 years ago that the \nrecord of every year being better than the last was broken in terms of \nthe economy of Colombia. It was able to avoid a series of economic \ncrises in South America and be a solid bastion of economic stability. \nThat pattern is now broken, with 20 percent unemployment, a 3- to 5-\npercent drop in gross domestic product, and an outflow of investment.\n  Finally, we have a national interest in terms of the people of \nColombia believing that their future and their hope is in Colombia, and \nthat they do not have to flee and become another diaspora in the United \nStates.\n  There has been substantial out-migration, oftentimes of the people \nwith the very skills that are going to be necessary to restore the \ndemocracy and economy in Colombia.\n  When I was in Bogota, in December of last year, I was told that if \nyou wanted to apply for a visa to leave Colombia, even as a tourist or \nfor one of the standard visas, it took 10 months to get an appointment \nto meet with the U.S. consulate official to apply to get a visa. That \nis how backlogged they are because of the number of people who are \ntrying to legally leave the country. One can imagine if these \nconditions of violence and economic turmoil continue how many people \nwill be leaving illegally from Colombia with the United States as their \nprimary destination.\n\n  We have a lot at stake. This is not a trivial issue with which we are \ndealing. I hope just as we, by a very strong vote, rejected previous \npropositions that would have diluted our capacity to be a good neighbor \non this critical issue, that we will do so again in defeating the \namendment offered by the Senator from Washington.\n  Once we have acted, we still will have some work to do, in particular \nwork to do in terms of internationalizing the friends of Colombia to be \na strong support group to continue this effort, remembering that 30 \npercent of Plan Colombia is going to be paid by other than the United \nStates or Colombia--the Colombians have yet to identify who will pick \nup that 30 percent of the cost--and that we must put greater emphasis \non the economic recovery of Colombia, which I hope will include items \nsuch as bringing parity to the Andean pact nations vis-a-vis the \nrecently adopted increase in trade preferences for the Caribbean Basin \nand extending the Andean trade preference to the year 2008 in order to \ngive investors greater confidence.\n  There is important work to do today, important work to do tomorrow. \nThe goal is to be a good neighbor and contribute to the salvation of a \nvery good friend of the United States, Colombia, at a time of dire \nneed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 369\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nfirst vote begin at 6:15, with the time between now and 6:15 divided \nequally between the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend and colleague from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that \namendment. I respectfully oppose the amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Washington.\n  As has been amply testified to here on the floor today, Colombia is \nin a crisis that includes a flourishing drug trade emanating from that \ncountry, an aggressive guerrilla movement spreading within it, right-\nwing paramilitary operations, and human rights abuses on all sides. All \nof this represents a fundamental threat to democratic government, the \nrule of law and economic prosperity in Colombia, and undermines \nstability in the region. It also, closer to home, results in the sad \nreality of a continued massive drug flow into these United States. \nThere has been literally an explosion of cocaine and heroin production \nin Colombia, and too much of it ends up in our country.\n  The democratically elected leader of Colombia, President Pastrana, \nhas urgently asked for our assistance and has shown strong leadership \nin developing a long-term comprehensive strategy for dealing with the \nmultifaceted crisis his country faces.\n  The United States is not pushing its way into this situation, nor are \nwe attempting to impose an outside solution. The Colombian Government \nquite simply cannot carry out these constructive plans it has without \nsubstantial help from its friends abroad. Our Government has quite \nresponsibly pledged that the United States will make a major \ncontribution to this critical effort, and I am convinced that is in our \nnational interest to do so. The administration's budget request for \nwhat has become known as Plan Colombia seeks to help that country and \nother nations in the region tackle the issues of the drug trade, \nguerrilla and paramilitary violence, human rights abuses, internally \ndisplaced people, and economic deterioration.\n  This assistance package would allow for the purchase of 30 Blackhawk \nhelicopters to do the essential job of transporting counter narcotics \nbattalions into southern Colombia. These Blackhawks are fast, they have \ntremendous capacity, and they are well suited for long-range \noperations. Unfortunately, the Senate version of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill eliminates the funding for the Blackhawks and \nreplaces them with twice as many of the slower, less capable Huey II \nhelicopters. While the Huey II is an improvement over the 1960s vintage \nHuey helicopter, it does not have the same performance capabilities, \nincluding range, speed, lift, or survivability, at any altitude as does \nthe Blackhawk.\n  The Colombian Army itself chose the Blackhawk to meet its long-term \nrequirements for all of its forces and believes it is the best solution \nfor providing helicopter support to the newly formed counternarcotics \nbattalions. The Blackhawk would allow the Colombians to put more troops \non the ground, more quickly and from greater distances, allowing for a \nhigher initial entry of the battalions and for more rapid \nreinforcement, all necessary to achieve success against opponents on \nthe ground. For some missions in the mountains at high altitudes, the \nHuey II simply will not work at all.\n  In sum, the Colombians have concluded that the Blackhawks best suit \ntheir need for counter drug missions,\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nwhich is at the heart of our American interest in this aid package. \nBoth General McCaffrey and General Wilhelm have strongly concurred.\n  In addition, in May, a team of 24 U.S. Army aviation experts was sent \nto Colombia to conduct an assessment of the operational effectiveness \nand support requirements of the Blackhawks versus the Huey IIs in \nColombia. In a preliminary report on its finding, the team said:\n\n       The superior troop carrying capacity and range of the UH-\n     60L, or Blackhawk, versus the Huey II, coupled with the \n     combat nature of operation, limited size of landing and \n     pick up zones within the area of operations, the \n     requirement to operate in high altitude areas and the \n     increased survivability to both aircrew and troops, \n     clearly indicated that the Blackhawk is the helicopter \n     that should be fielded to Colombia in support of a counter \n     drug effort.\n\n  That was from a U.S. Army report.\n  Senator Dodd and I have offered an amendment that says the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense, in consultation with the Colombian military, \nwill determine what kind of helicopters will be most effective to \nsupport the purposes for which we are spending this money, which are \ncounternarcotics in Colombia. The Senate ought not to micromanage the \ndecision on which helicopters will be used. It is a decision that ought \nto be left to those who are the experts.\n  We cannot pretend this overall emergency aid package is a perfect \nsolution to all the problems confronting Colombia or any of the other \ncountries in the region. Neither is this assistance a panacea to the \nproblems of drug abuse and addiction in the United States. It is a \nstrong and credible step forward.\n  For these reasons, I support the underlying package, oppose the \nGorton amendment, and proudly support and cosponsor the Dodd amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the capacity of this body for self-\ndelusion seems to this Senator to be unlimited. Time after time, we \npermit this administration to involve us in some new armed conflict \nwithout seriously examining the consequences of that involvement, the \ncost of the involvement, the length of the involvement, or even the \npossibility that we will attain the goals of that involvement.\n  Mark my words, we are on the verge of doing exactly the same thing \nhere that we have done so frequently in the last 7 or 8 years. This \nbill includes almost $1 billion for an entirely new, and almost totally \nmilitary, involvement in a civil war in Latin America, without the \nslightest promise that our intervention will be a success, and it does \nit in a totally backward fashion.\n  The very committee report that recommends spending this almost $1 \nbillion says that the committee ``has grave reservations regarding the \nadministration's ability to effectively manage the use of these \nresources to achieve the expected results.''\n  Well, if we have grave reservations, why are we doing it before those \nreservations have been met?\n  The bill is a paradox. It says to the administration, spend $934 \nmillion, and then come to us and tell us what you have done and why it \nshould go on. But if Kosovo and Bosnia are any indication, when the \nadministration comes back next year, the answer will be: Well, we are \nalready in it; we can't quit now.\n  That is what we have been told for 6 or 7 years in Bosnia and 2 or 3 \nin Kosovo, with no end in sight. And there will be no end in sight here \neither, Mr. President. This bill says let's get in a war now and \njustify it later. My amendment says let's hear the justification first; \nlet's seriously consider what we are getting into and then maybe vote \nthe money.\n  This amendment takes $700 million of the $934 million and says, for \nnow, let's pay down the debt with it. Let's expand our present help to \nColombia and its police forces, rather substantially, but let's not get \ninto a new armed conflict until we have far greater justification than \nwe have received to this point.\n  It just seems impossible to me to believe that in the absence of the \ndebate of the whole country, with all of the lessons we must have \nlearned not just in this administration, but in previous \nadministrations, about how easy it is to get in and how hard it is to \nget out, we will blithely make this downpayment--and this is a \ndownpayment only. Next year, maybe we will need a lot more money if \nthey are not doing very well down there. And how much of the equipment \nis going to end up in the hands of rebels by sale or capture or \notherwise? We have no way of controlling that without a presence on the \nground.\n  I urge this body to say to the administration: No, we are not going \nto do this until you first come to us with a formal overall plan with a \nbeginning, middle, and an end, and a plan for how we are going to \nachieve our goals. Get the authority first and then fund it. It is 10 \ntimes better for this society to put that $700 million on our debt and \nnot get in a civil war in South America. That is what this debate is \nall about--not that we don't like the Colombians or that we don't want \nthem to be successful, but we don't want a part of their war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the \nWellstone amendment was defeated 89-7. That would have taken $225 \nmillion out of the committee's proposal to fight the war on drugs in \nColombia. The amendment of the Senator from Washington, my good friend, \nwould leave only $200 million. It would, in fact, completely terminate \nthis effort, as he candidly admits would be his desire. I hope the \nGorton amendment will not be approved.\n  Mr. President, there are several amendments cleared on both sides \nwhich I would like to get out of the way at this point. Temporarily, I \nask unanimous consent to lay aside the two amendments upon which we are \nabout to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 3495, 3491 and 3539, As Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send amendments Nos. 3495, 3491, and \n3539, as modified, to the desk en bloc and ask for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Several Senators have been very helpful, saying they are \ngoing to withdraw amendments or look to another piece of legislation. I \nappreciate that. It is possible to finish this bill this evening if we \ncontinue to have the cooperation we have had on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3524\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nDodd amendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  The Senate will be in order. Senators will take their conversations \nto the Cloakroom, please. If Senators will give their attention to the \nSenator from Connecticut, we can begin.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in one minute: The amendment I am proposing \nalong with my colleague from Connecticut and others merely says the \ndecision on which type of equipment will be used in the Colombian \neffort ought to be determined by the U.S. military in conjunction with \nthe Colombian military. The present language requires specifically a \nHuey helicopter. I do not think that decision\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nought to be made by Members of Congress, necessarily.\n  The military categorically, in a 24-member review of what was needed \nto make the program in Colombia successful, requests that it be the \nBlackhawk helicopter.\n  In a letter from the Colombian Ministry of Defense they specifically \nrequest it. They would have to change their entire infrastructure to \nhandle a Huey helicopter. The cost is excessive--more than the \nBlackhawk. The amendment doesn't say buy Blackhawks, it says let the \nmilitary make the decision. Congress ought not be mandating the kind of \nequipment that is going to help best to make this work. Our amendment \nallows for the experts to make the decision, not Members of Congress.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and ask unanimous consent the letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Republica De Colombia,\n\n\n                               Ministerio De Defensa Nacional,\n\n                                Santa Fe De Bogota, June 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. C.W. Young,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen: We wish to thank the U.S. Congress for its \n     support of Plan Colombia and the U.S. Administration's aid \n     package to assist the people of Colombia in our fight against \n     the explosive cultivation of coca. With your support, this \n     aid will reverse the trend of increased drug production, \n     violence and instability that we are all too familiar with.\n       While we are grateful for your consideration of the aid \n     package, we are concerned with the Senate's proposal to \n     replace the 30 UH-60L, Blackhawks with 60 ``Huey II'' \n     helicopters. The decision to provide the Colombian Military \n     with UH-60 helicopters was determined jointly by Colombian \n     and US Military experts to be the best aircraft for the \n     mission.\n       The Blackhawk is our clear choice given the austere \n     environment in which our security forces must operate. First, \n     it has redundant systems and protections that not only make \n     it much more difficult to shoot down, but more importantly, \n     affords our soldiers and crew increased survivability in a \n     crash. Second, the Blackhawk is 50% faster than the Huey II \n     allowing a quicker response time for our security forces to \n     reach remote, inaccessible drug producing areas. Third, it \n     has much greater range. Therefore, the need for forward \n     arming and refueling stations is significantly reduced. \n     Fourth, the Blackhawk flies and operates better at higher \n     altitudes, an important consideration given that the Andes \n     mountain range runs the entire length of Colombia. Lastly, it \n     carries three times the number of soldiers at high altitudes \n     and twice as much at sea level, inserting more troops and \n     security forces on the ground sooner. Optimal maneuverability \n     at high altitudes and troop carrying capacity is crucial in \n     counter narcotics operations, specially taking in \n     consideration the areas where poppy cultivation takes place.\n       While the Huey II helicopter may be less expensive to \n     purchase and operate, there are considerable indirect \n     expenses not being factored in by the Huey II advocates. For \n     example, 60 Huey IIs require twice the number of trained \n     pilots as 30 Blackhawks. In addition to more trained pilots, \n     they require more trained mechanics, maintenance facilities, \n     spare parts, equipment, force protection, and hangar space at \n     airfields. Any initial savings in acquiring the Huey II's \n     would be offset by these associated logistics and support \n     costs.\n       Blackhawk is the backbone of our military's helicopter \n     combat fleet. Therefore our infrastructure is being \n     standardized around it and more important, our force \n     structure planning for the future is based in this type of \n     aircraft. As for today, our government has already acquired \n     Blackhawks with our own resources and has the appropriate \n     logistic facilities to operate and maintain up to 30 \n     additional UH-60L Blackhawks.\n       Some members of the US Congress have proposed a combination \n     of Blackhawks and Huey's. Given our force structure planning \n     stated above, introducing new Huey II's into our fleet would \n     require separate pilot training, spare parts and \n     supplementary maintenance facilities, not to mention the \n     delays or changes in the projection of the force. This will \n     pose a major logistic problem and extra efforts, since the \n     fleet must be jointly operated increasing tactical, technical \n     and administrative costs. The Ministry does believe that the \n     UH-1Ns will be vitally important for a successful transition \n     to the more advanced UH-60 Blackhawk. We also believe there \n     will be a continuing need to retain some of the UH-INs after \n     the integration of the UH-60 fleet into the Colombian \n     counternarcotics program.\n       If the Congress of the United States considers that \n     additionally to the 30 Blackhawks initially requested, based \n     on our needs and operative and logistical capabilities, the \n     government of Colombia should receive a number of Bell \n     helicopters, we suggest that the U.S. Government give \n     consideration on? supporting our extensive pilot training \n     requirements by starting a program to acquire 20 Bell 206 \n     training helicopters. These aircraft would enable our armed \n     forces to establish a joint pilot training school that would \n     meet our existing and future pilot training requirements.\n       We appreciate the efforts and kind support you have given \n     the aid pack in this process. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n       Sincerely,\n     Mayor General Luis Ernesto Gilbert Vargas,\n       Director of National Police.\n     General Fabio Velasco Chavez,\n       Commander in Chief of the Air Force.\n     Admiral Sergio Garcia Torres,\n       Commander in Chief of the Navy.\n     General Jorge Enrique Mora Rangel,\n       Commander in Chief of the Army.\n     General Fernando Tapias Stahelin,\n       Commander in Chief of the Military Forces.\n     Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna,\n       Minister of National Defense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the issue is this. We do not have \nenough Blackhawks for our own troops, much less the Colombian troops. \nThe Blackhawks are much more expensive, about $1,000 an hour more \nexpensive to operate. The Huey II will get the job done. We ought to do \nthat in the most efficient way, looking not only at this year's \nappropriation but down the road. We will have to pick up the operation \nand maintenance cost on the Blackhawk in subsequent years. The Huey II \nwill do the job.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has done his usual articulate job of \narguing for a home State interest. The Blackhawk is made in \nConnecticut. I would probably be making the same speech if I were from \nConnecticut. But the least expensive alternative is the Huey II. That \nis why the committee recommended what it did.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senators are anxious to get a feel \nfor what the proceedings will be for the remainder of the evening and \nin the morning. I commend the managers for the work they have been \ndoing and commend Members for the help we have been receiving from them \non both sides in terms of disposing of amendments one way or another.\n  I believe we are very close to getting an agreement that would get \nthe remaining amendments done tonight. Then, in the morning, we could \nturn to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill and have stacked votes at 2 \no'clock, both on any amendments and final passage of the foreign \noperations appropriations bill and any amendments that might be ready \nto be voted on and put in that staked sequence at 2 o'clock tomorrow.\n  We do not quite have that agreement yet. But for all Senators who are \nstill working on it, I hope they will work with us to get it completed \nmomentarily. If that cannot be done, I will be calling up the Kyl \namendment No. 3558, and getting a second so we can have a rollcall vote \non that, and other amendments, tonight.\n  I think we can get this bill done without having to have that \nrecorded vote. But if we can't get an agreement as to how we are going \nto complete our work, then we will be having more votes tonight.\n  So for the Senators who are waiting to get final information, just \ngive us a few more minutes. I think we are about to the point where we \ncan enter this agreement, and then we would have a feel for the \nremainder of the night.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator from Mississippi will yield, Senators have \nbeen working very hard on both sides to clear things.\n  I suggest this as an alternative to some of my colleagues. A number \nof matters are things that could just as well be handled in report \nlanguage.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and I, in some of those instances, have \nbeen able to work that out. With the help of both the Republican \nleadership and the Democratic leadership, we have been able to get rid \nof many of these amendments. I think we are so close to working out the \nsuggestion the distinguished Senator from Mississippi has made, that \nSenators should look at that. It is one that is strongly supported by \nthe managers of this bill. I hope we might make it possible to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in cooperation with the manager on our side, \nwe have worked very hard to move this legislation along. On the \nproposed unanimous consent request that would be propounded by the \nmajority leader, we would complete debate on all amendments tonight and \nvote, as the leader indicated, tomorrow after 12 o'clock. We have one \noutstanding objection on that. We are in the process of working to have \nthat resolved. We hope to have that done in the near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 3553, 3537, 3515, 3546, As Modified, 3547, As Modified, \n 3549, As Modified, 3545, As Modified, 3172, As Modified, and 3522, As \n                           Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have some more amendments that have \nbeen cleared on both sides. I call up amendment No. 3553 by myself; \namendment No. 3537, Senator Byrd; amendment No. 3515, Senator Shelby. \nThen the following amendments, Mr. President, I call up and send \nmodifications to those amendments to the desk: Senator Reid, No. 3546; \nSenator Reid, No. 3547; Senator Reid, No. 3549, Senator Chafee, \namendment No. 3545; Senator Helms, amendment No. 3172; Senator \nLandrieu, amendment No. 3522.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I believe there \nis still a question on the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island that we are trying to work out. I wonder if that could be \nwithheld for the moment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator says there is a question about the Chafee \namendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will withhold the Chafee amendment No. 3545. These \nare the modifications which I send to the desk.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will continue to work with my friend from Rhode Island \nto see if we can work out whatever the problem is.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n (Purpose: To transfer $24 million from elsewhere in the bill to Peace \n          Corps to bring FY 2001 funding up to FY 2000 levels)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a Dodd amendment to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] for Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3527.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 28, line 4 strike all after the first comma thru \n     the word ``Provided,'' on line 7, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``$244,000,000, including the purchase of not \n     to exceed five passenger motor vehicles for administrative \n     purposes for use outside the United States: Provided, That \n     $24,000,000 of such sums be made available from funds already \n     appropriated by the Act, that are not otherwise earmarked for \n     specific purposes: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered would restore \nthe FY 2001 appropriations for Peace Corps programs to FY 2000 \nappropriations levels.\n  Today, approximately 7000 Americans are Peace Corps volunteers. They \nare recent college graduates, mid-career professionals, and retired \nseniors. They live and work in the far corners of the globe--in Africa, \nLatin America, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Pacific. \nAs we consider this matter, American volunteers are diligently working \nto improve the lives of citizens in 77 countries throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, the President has requested $275 million in \nappropriations for FY 2001. While I would like to see this Senate \napprove an amendment to increase funding in this bill to meet the \nadministration's request, I am simply asking that the Senate restore \nfunding to the FY 2000 levels.\n  My request of my colleagues is a modest one--their support for an \namendment to raise funding in this bill for the Peace Corps by $24 \nmillion--from $220 million to $244 million--to bring the FY 2001 \nappropriations for this agency up to this fiscal year's appropriations. \nThis amendment does not add any new money to the bill, but rather \nallows the Clinton administration to use unearmarked funds already \nappropriated in this bill.\n  Absent adoption of this amendment, the Appropriations Committee mark \nwill reduce funding for the upcoming fiscal year by 10 percent over the \ncurrent fiscal year's funding for the Peace Corps.\n  What are the consequences of such reductions in funding?\n  Peace Corps posts will have to be shut down in as many as eleven \ncountries;\n  The number of new volunteers accepted by the agency will have to be \ncut by 16 percent, some 1,250 fewer individuals will have the honor of \nserving their country;\n  Plans for new initiatives to enable Peace Corps volunteers to bring \nthe benefits of information technology to underserved communities \nthroughout the world and to bolster HIV/AIDS prevention priorities in \nAfrica and elsewhere will fall by the wayside;\n  New country programs will remain unfunded;\n  The agency's ability to provide future emergency assistance through \nits newly established Crisis Corps of returned volunteers to respond to \nthe devastation of unanticipated disasters such as those experienced in \nCentral America following the 1998 devastation of Hurricane Mitch will \nbe severely impaired.\n  Finally it will undermine the Agency's ability to replace outdated \ncomputer systems in order to meet government financial management \nrequirements, not terribly exciting but very important to the overall \nfunctioning of the Peace Corps as an organization.\n  The funding level in the bill is totally inconsistent with what the \nCongress did in 1999. Last year the Congress went on record in support \nof increased funding for the Peace Corps for\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nFY 2001 to $298 million--beyond the Administration's request--in order \nto support an increase in Peace Corps volunteers.\n  I am not asking the Senate to vote on an increase of that magnitude \ntoday. I am simply asking support for a steady state budget.\n  Mr. President, thirty-four years ago, I was a Peace Corps volunteer \nin the Dominican Republic. My two years as a volunteer had a profound \nimpact on my life. I will treasure my Peace Corps experience forever--\nas will nearly every returned Peace Corps volunteer one meets.\n  Next year the Peace Corps will celebrate its 40th anniversary. It is \nimportant that we insure that the agency is sufficiently funded to live \nup to the expectations that its success has engendered throughout the \nworld.\n  For these reasons I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and the restoration of funding for the Peace Corps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3527) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

SUPPORT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR SERBIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and an \n     indicted war criminal, visited Moscow from May 7 through May \n     12, 2000, as a guest of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation, attended the inauguration of President Vladimir \n     Putin, and held talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor \n     Sergeyev and Army Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin;\n       (2) General Ojdanic was military Chief of Staff of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war and has \n     been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against humanity and \n     violations of the laws and customs of war for alleged \n     atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo;\n       (3) international warrants have been issued by the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for \n     General Ojdanic's arrest and extradition to the Hague;\n       (4) the Government of the Russian Federation, a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council which \n     established the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia, has an obligation to arrest General \n     Ojdanic and extradite him to the Hague;\n       (5) on May 16, 2000, Russian Minister of Economics Andrei \n     Shapovalyants announced\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n     that his government has provided the Serbian regime of \n     Slobodan Milosevic $102,000,000 of a $150,000,000 loan it had \n     reactivated and will sell the Government of Serbia \n     $32,000,000 of oil despite the fact that the international \n     community has imposed economic sanctions against the \n     Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the \n     Government of Serbia;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation is providing \n     the Milosevic regime such assistance while it is seeking debt \n     relief from the international community and loans from the \n     International Monetary Fund, and while it is receiving corn \n     and grain as food aid from the United States;\n       (7) the hospitality provided to General Ojdanic \n     demonstrates that the Government of the Russian Federation \n     rejects the indictments brought by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia against him and other \n     officials, including Slobodan Milosevic, for alleged \n     atrocities committed during the Kosovo war; and\n       (8) the relationship between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Governments of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia and Serbia only encourages the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic to foment instability in the Balkans and thereby \n     jeopardizes the safety and security of American military and \n     civilian personnel and raises questions about Russia's \n     commitment to its responsibilities as a member of the North \n     American Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping mission in \n     Kosovo.\n       (b) Actions.--\n       (1) Fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing all \n     loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government \n     of the Russian Federation or entities acting on its behalf \n     has provided since June 1999, and intends to provide to the \n     Government of Serbia or the Government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or any entities under the control of \n     the Governments of Serbia or the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (2) If that report determines that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation or other entities acting on its behalf has \n     provided or intends to provide the governments of Serbia or \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any entity under their \n     control any loans or economic assistance and oil sales, then \n     the following shall apply:\n       (A) The Secretary of State shall reduce assistance \n     obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in \n     value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales \n     the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and \n     intends to provide to the Governments of Serbia and the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors of the international \n     financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any \n     extension by those institutions of any financial assistance \n     (including any technical assistance or grant) of any kind to \n     the Government of the Russian Federation except for loans and \n     assistance that serve basic human needs.\n       (ii) In this subparagraph, the term ``international \n     financial institution'' includes the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral \n     Investment Guaranty Agency, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n       (C) The United States shall suspend existing programs to \n     the Russia Federation provided by the Export-Import Bank and \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and any \n     consideration of any new loans, guarantees, and other forms \n     of assistance by the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation to Russia.\n       (D) The President may waive the actions described in \n     subsections 2A, 2B, and 2C if he determines and reports to \n     Congress that it is in the national interests of the United \n     States of America.\n       (3) It is the sense of the Senate that--The President of \n     the United States should instruct his representatives to \n     negotiations on Russia's international debt to oppose further \n     forgiveness, restructuring, and rescheduling of that debt, \n     including that being considered under the ``Comprehensive'' \n     Paris Club negotiations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 3522 As Modified\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the rehabilitation of the transportation \n                infrastructure of Bulgaria and Romania)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Of the funds appropriated under the heading ``Support for \n     East European Democracy'' rehabilitation and remediation of \n     damage done to the Romanian and Bulgarian economies as a \n     result of the Kosovo conflict should be given priority \n     especially to those projects that are associated with the \n     Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, done at Cologne June \n     10, 1999 (commonly known as the ``Balkan Stability Pact''), \n     particularly those projects that encourage bilateral \n     cooperation between Romania and Bulgaria, and that seek to \n     offset the difficulties associated with the closure of the \n     Danube River.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, amendment No. 3584 was accepted earlier. \nThe sponsor of that amendment, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Abraham, has agreed to a modification of his amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to send the modification to the desk and ask that it \nbe accepted in lieu of the earlier amendment No. 3584.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't know whether we have reached \nagreement or not or whether there will be time for discussion tomorrow.\n  I thank my colleagues. I believe amendment No. 3568 has been \naccepted. This is an amendment I have offered with Senator Brownback, \nwho is in the chair. I point out to colleagues that this amendment \nwould use $250,000 of the funds appropriated to Kosovo to help police \nbetter identify and respond to cases of trafficking. It also would \nprovide some help for those who live in the Newly Independent States of \nthe former Soviet Union who have been victims of trafficking. I thank \nboth the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Vermont for \naccepting this amendment.\n  I especially thank Senator Brownback for the work I have been able to \ndo with him dealing with the awful aspect of this new global economy: \nthe trafficking of women forced into prostitution, and terrible labor \nconditions. We have a great piece of legislation. Both of us hope it \nwill pass soon. This amendment to this piece of legislation is a good \nstep in the right direction. I thank my colleague, Senator Brownback, \nfor his support. I thank Senators for supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 140, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . UNITED STATES-CUBAN MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN THE \n                   INTERDICTION OF ILLICIT DRUGS.\n\n       Allocation of Funds.--Of the amount appropriated under the \n     heading ``Department of State, International Narcotics \n     Control and Law Enforcement'', up to $1,000,000 shall be \n     available to the Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the \n     United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs Service, \n     and other bodies, to work with the appropriate authorities of \n     the Cuban government to provide for greater cooperation, \n     coordination, and other mutual assistance in the interdiction \n     of illicit drugs being transported over Cuban airspace and \n     waters, provided that such assistance may only be provided \n     after the President determines and certifies to Congress \n     that:\n       (a) Cuba has appropriate procedures in place to protect \n     against innocent loss of life in the air and on the ground in \n     connection with interdiction of illegal drugs; and\n       (b) that there is no evidence of the involvement of the \n     government of Cuba in drug trafficking.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment is that up \nto $1 million shall be made available to the Secretary of Defense on \nbehalf of the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and other \nbodies to work with the appropriate authorities of the Cuban Government \nto provide for greater cooperation, coordination, and other mutual \nassistance in the interdiction of illegal drugs being transported over \nCuban airspace and waters, provided that such assistance may be \nprovided after the President determines and certifies to Congress that \nCuba has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent \nloss of life in the air and that there is no evidence of the \ninvolvement of the Government of Cuba in drug trafficking.\n  The Government of Cuba has been prepared for some time to provide \nfurther assistance to the United States through the use of their \nairspace and coastal waters on drug interdiction.\n  In June of 1999, I had occasion to visit Cuba and I had a long \nmeeting with their President, Fidel Castro. We covered a wide variety \nof subjects. One of them was the issue of drug interdiction.\n  I believe this is a measure which our officials in all branches of \nthe Federal Government favor to try to cut down on the flow of drugs. \nThere is, obviously, a sharp disagreement as to what our policy should \nbe toward Cuba with respect to the embargo. But whatever anybody may \nthink about those subjects, it is my view that there is no doubt that \nwe ought to take up the availability of assistance from Cuba on drug \ninterdiction. That is what this amendment will do.\n  There is a real issue about U.S. policy toward Cuba. I voted against \nthe Dodd amendment, which would create a commission to make \nrecommendations on that policy, because I think that the issue of \npolicy really ought to be decided by the next President of the United \nStates in conjunction with the Congress. The times have certainly \nchanged, so that Castro no longer presents a threat to export communism \nto Latin America. I believe that the consideration of change in policy \nreally ought not to be entrusted to a commission at the present time, \nwhich would report after January 20 of next year, when the issue really \nis for the President of the United States--whoever may be elected.\n  I supported the Gorton amendment, which would strike the funds for \nColombia, although I knew at the time that the funding for Colombia \nwould pass by a large number. I have visited Colombia on a number of \noccasions over the past decade. I am very much in favor of assisting \nColombia in restoring law and order to that nation, to try to avoid the \ndestabilizing effect of the drug cartels. But I do not believe that it \nis appropriate to spend hundreds of millions of dollars--almost a \nbillion dollars in the Senate appropriations and $1.4 billion in the \nHouse. I believe there is currently an imbalance in the $18 billion a \nyear spent on drugs, with about two-thirds of that--or $12 billion--\ngoing to the so-called supply side, and some $6 billion going to the \nso-called demand side.\n  My view is that we would be doing better to spend money on \nrehabilitation and education to try to eliminate the demand for drugs. \nI was an original sponsor of legislation many years ago to bring in the \nmilitary on interdiction, and I think that it is a good policy. But no \nmatter how strong our interdiction is, drugs will come into the United \nStates as long as there is a demand for drugs. My experience as \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia shows that a great deal can be done \nto prosecute drug dealers and street crime and move up the chain to \ndrug kingpins. But, again, as long as there is a demand for drugs, \nthere will be a supply. So it is my view that the wiser course of \naction is to spend more money on education and rehabilitation through \nthe drug courts, which are now part of the crime bill of 1994. It is \nbecause of my view that funds are better spent on rehabilitation and \neducation and the demand side that I supported the Wellstone amendment.\n  I thank my many colleagues who have worked with me to clear this \namendment. As with most Senators, I would like to have a rollcall vote. \nWe are trying to bring this matter to a conclusion. Tomorrow, we are \ngoing to start on the appropriations bill of Labor, Health, Human \nServices, and Education, which comes from the subcommittee I chair. So \nI appreciate the acceptance of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3588) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3569\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3569.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just briefly, this amendment would \ntransfer $100 million away from the Colombian aid into the Department \nof Justice to be used for drug interdiction, for counternarcotic \nactivities including and especially to combat methamphetamine \nproduction and trafficking, which is rampant throughout the United \nstates, and also to use this money to enhance policing initiatives \nthroughout the country in drug hotspots.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues and hope we will have \nan affirmative vote on that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we may need a moment more to have a chance \nto review the unanimous consent proposal. I believe we have one worked \nout that is fair and acceptable to Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nIf we can get this agreement entered into, then there would be no \nfurther votes tonight, nor in the morning. Then we would begin the \nfinal debate at 1:30, with the votes that are necessary stacked at 2 \np.m., and final passage at that time.\n  In the morning, though, we would go to Labor-HHS Appropriations at \n9:30. Any votes relative to that bill would also be put in a stacked \nsequence beginning at 2 p.m., if any are ready. We certainly hope good \nprogress can be made on that bill tomorrow. We look forward to working \nwith the managers of that legislation.\n  I see Senator Reid is looking over the consent request. If he has any \nquestions, I will be glad to respond.\n\n\n                      unanimous consent agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the pending bill be offered and \ndebated tonight, along with any relevant second-degree amendments, and \nthe votes occur in relation to those amendments beginning at 2 p.m. on \nThursday, with\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n4 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  I further ask consent that at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday, the Senate \nresume consideration of the pending bill, and Senator Feingold be \nrecognized to offer his filed amendment regarding Mozambique, and that \namendment be voted on in the voting sequence under the same terms as \noutlined above.\n  I further ask consent that following the introduction of the Feingold \namendment, it be laid aside and Senator Boxer be recognized to call up \nher two filed amendments, Nos. 3541 and 3542, and there be 40 minutes \ntotal for debate on both amendments, with the votes occurring in the \nvoting sequence as outlined above.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \namendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate \nproceed to vote on that motion. I further ask consent that following \nthat vote, the bill then be placed back on the calendar awaiting the \nHouse companion bill.\n  I further ask consent that at 9:30 a.m., the Senate begin \nconsideration of the House Labor-HHS and Education appropriations bill \nand any votes ordered relative to that bill, following the concurrence \nof the two leaders, occur at the end of the voting sequence scheduled \nat 2 p.m. on Thursday, with the same 4 minutes allocated for \nexplanation prior to those votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority leader, with regard to the amendment I intend to offer, I hope \nthe agreement contemplates the possibility that we can work out \nsomething on the amendment so a vote would not be required.\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly. That is always the case. If the Senator gets it \nworked out, or something changes his mind, he obviously would have that \nopportunity. The managers, I am sure, would be glad to work with him \nthis evening to work out some satisfactory way. I don't know the \nsubstance of the amendment, other than it is on Mozambique. Certainly, \nthat would be contemplated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if the \nSenator will yield, the conversation Senator Leahy and I had with the \nmanager of the bill is that we have talked about their reviewing that \nvery closely to see if something can be worked out. Today, there was a \nvery emotional event at the White House. Senator Inouye was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. It was one of the most dramatic events I \nhave ever attended. Senator Akaka is calling and he desires some \nmorning business to talk about this. There are lots of people in from \nHawaii and from around the country. We are coming in at 9:30 a.m. to \nbegin Labor-HHS.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, why don't we amend the request to say that \nwe come in at 9:30, and after the opening and the prayer, we go to \nSenator Akaka for 30 minutes, and we will begin Labor-HHS bill at 10 \no'clock. We are all certainly very proud of Senator Inouye and how he \nand the men of his unit served this country. For it to be appropriately \nmemorialized in this Chamber by his colleague from Hawaii is more than \nappropriate. I am pleased to make that addition.\n  Mr. REID. Further reserving the right to object, when Senator \nMcConnell finishes his business tonight--and that should be shortly--I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode Island be recognized \nfor 30 minutes, and that the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, be able to \nspeak. I have amendments that the committee has worked on during the \nday, and I would like to speak on those after Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nfurther clarify that there would be no prohibition in this unanimous \nconsent agreement if it would be necessary to withdraw the amendment \nwhich I propose.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly know of no reason the Senate \nwouldn't agree to the Senator's amendment being withdrawn if the \nSenator desires to do so.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the majority leader simply have \nthat reflected in the agreement?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I include in the unanimous consent request \nthat if Senator Feingold wishes to withdraw his amendment, that would \nbe in order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be no \nfurther votes tonight, and the next series of votes will occur at 2 \np.m. on Thursday.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would simply like to thank the majority \nleader. Much of this was done to accommodate my daughter's graduation \ntomorrow morning. He went out of his way. I thank him, as well as the \nminority leader and the minority whip, for doing that for me. It shows \nthe comity of the Senate, as well. I thank all of the leaders for that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer. I thank all of my \ncolleagues and the managers for the work they are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for helping us wrap up this matter in due time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield before the majority \nleader leaves?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we were riding up here together, I told \nthe Senator we couldn't finish tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator was right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3589\n\n (Purpose: To provide emergency funding to the Department of Commerce \n  and the Department of Agriculture to assist communities affected by \n         Hurricane Floyd, Hurricane Dennis, or Hurricane Irene)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk that \nhas been cleared on both sides by Senator Edwards on behalf of himself, \nand Senator Torricelli, and Senator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), for Mr. Edwards, \n     Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3589.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 140, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n emergency funding to assist communities affected by hurricane floyd, \n                  hurricane dennis, or hurricane irene\n\n       Sec. 5____. (a) Economic Development Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--There is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal year \n     2000, for an additional amount for ``Economic Development \n     Assistance Programs'', $125,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, for planning assistance, public works grants, \n     and revolving loan funds to assist communities affected by \n     Hurricane Floyd, Hurricane Dennis, or Hurricane Irene.\n       (2) Emergency designation.--The $125,000,000--\n       (A) shall be available only to the extent that the \n     President submits to Congress an official budget request for \n     a specific dollar amount that includes designation of the \n     entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement for \n     the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.); and\n       (B) is designated by Congress as an emergency requirement \n     under section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     901(b)(2)(A)).\n       (b) Community Facilities Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--There is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal year \n     2000, for an additional amount for the rural community \n     advancement program under subtitle E of the Consolidated Farm \n     and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2009 et seq.), \n     $125,000,000, to remain available until expended, to provide \n     grants under the community facilities grant program under \n     section 306(a)(19) of that Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(19)) with \n     respect to areas subject to a declaration of a major disaster \n     under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) as a result of \n     Hurricane Floyd, Hurricane Dennis, or Hurricane Irene.\n       (2) Emergency designation.--The $125,000,000 is designated \n     by Congress as an emergency requirement under section\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senators \nStevens, Lott, McConnell, Leahy, and Byrd for accepting this amendment, \nNo. 3582. Throughout the process of dealing with Hurricane Floyd and \nits impact on my State they have been unstinting in their help and \ndeserve the thanks and deep appreciation of the people of North \nCarolina. I've also had the honor of working with Senators Torricelli \nand Robb on this amendment. They have fought hard for their States.\n  This amendment would provide $125 million in funding to the Economic \nDevelopment Administration this year. It would also provide $125 \nmillion in funding this year for USDA's Community Facilities program.\n  Mr. President, this money is desperately needed. Although 9 months \nhave passed since Hurricane Floyd struck North Carolina, the people of \neastern Carolina are still struggling to rebuild. Thousands still live \nin FEMA trailers. Hundreds of businesses still haven't reopened. \nSeveral cities are still operating under sewage and water moratoria.\n  This amendment will mean the difference between businesses reopening \nand businesses closing, people working and people not working, cities \nthriving and cities withering.\n  I believe this amendment will make a real difference, and will put us \non the road to recovery. Let me submit a list of possible $100 million \nin EDA projects that has been prepared by the State. This list is by no \nmeans exhaustive, but it illustrates the extent of the need and how \nmuch good this money can be used for.\n  I am enormously pleased that this amendment has been accepted. We \nhave a lot more work to do in order to enact it into law. I hope this \nprovision will be incorporated into the final supplemental \nappropriations package that is being negotiated as part of the Military \nConstruction appropriations conference. The innocent victims of \nHurricane Floyd deserve no less.\n  Indeed, the Federal Government has consistently provided this type of \naid to disaster victims. I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nprevious assistance packages be printed in the Record. It is only fair \nto treat this disaster in the same manner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record \nfollowing the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     EXAMPLES OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT REQUESTED EDA FUNDS COULD FUND (50% MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION UNLESS WAIVED)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        Total project\n        District and county                             Applicant                           cost                      Project description\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7--Brunswick......................

Mr. President, there has been discussion of the great \nhonor that the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii earned. He \nactually earned it when I was a child. He earned it on the battlefield \nin Europe, particularly in Italy, my mother country.\n  I will speak further on this at a more appropriate time. But I have \nserved with Dan Inouye for 25 years, and only because I was managing \nthis bill was I not with him when he received the honor today. I talked \nto him before. I told him how enormously proud I am of him--all of his \ncolleagues are proud of him--for the 25 years that I have served with \nhim.\n  While he did not receive the honor at the time it was due--and many \nknow why--his bravery was so well demonstrated at a time in this \ncountry when our sense of inclusion of people of all races was not as \ngood as it is today. But I think the feeling of veterans and the \nfeeling of historians have vindicated his achievements throughout all \nof this time.\n  I think of one thing. I was overseas for the 50th anniversary of D-\nDay, and when Dan Inouye walked onto the stage when his name was \nannounced, veterans from all over this country cheered and applauded. \nHe was accompanied by another distinguished Member of this body who was \nalso cheered, from the Presiding Officer's State, Senator Dole. It was \nan emotional moment for all Senators who were there to see two such \nloved Members of this body received that way.\n  Today we open a new chapter in our country--closing not a very good \nchapter--and we did the right thing telling everybody that Dan Inouye \nearned the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5536-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5536-S5542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3545\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky will yield, I would like to clarify some issues regarding \nadditional assistance to Lebanon.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. As the Senator knows, I have a special interest in the \nprovision of the bill that provides $15 million for development \nactivities in Lebanon, including support for the American educational \ninstitutions there. I am pleased that this year that level of funding \nis maintained in the bill as it was reported from committee, and I wish \nto thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership and the interest \nthat he too has taken in Lebanon's future.\n  As you know, earmarking $15 million in economic assistance is an \nimportant beginning to a comprehensive aid package to Lebanon. However, \nthe recent events in the South of Lebanon call for a more detailed and \nlarger aid package to Lebanon.\n  A larger aid package can help the country rebuild itself due to the \ndevastation of the past 30 years. Specifically, Lebanon needs the \nfinancial assistance to: rebuild its schools; repair and rebuild its \nsewage systems; repair its destroyed power generation plants; upgrade \nits water purification facilities; and construct general infrastructure \nprojects.\n  In my opinion, a package similar to the recent Jordanian package of \n$250 million would provide the type of support needed to effectively \nlaunch the rebuilding effort.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the Administration is not currently \nprepared to present a comprehensive aid package. Several inquiries of \nthe Administration have produced no budgetary figures. This is \ndisappointing in that your legislation is clearly the appropriate \nvehicles in which to include this funding. Notwithstanding their \nreluctance, I would like to offer my amendment to increase Lebanon's \nfunding to $250 million.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Senator Abraham.\n  I, like you, am dismayed to learn that the Administration has not \noffered any budgetary amounts for an aid package to Lebanon. You are \nabsolutely right that the current events in Lebanon demand that we \nreexamine our foreign aid package to that country.\n  As such, I pledge to work with you every step of the way to see that \na more comprehensive aid package to Lebanon is considered here in the \nSenate. I appreciate your suggested amount, and would like to work with \nyou once all the elements for a successive aid package are assembled. \nThis requires input by the Administration, and a plan as to what \nprograms would be funded and which ones would receive priority funding. \nIt is my hope that the Administration will consult with us as soon as \npossible regarding figures for an assistance package. However, until \nthe Administration produces a comprehensive package, I will have to lay \nyour amendment aside.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator's comments are appreciated. As always, I \nwill work with you and consult you as we put this package together. I \nhighly value your expertise on Lebanon.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that clarification. I also wish \nto commend him and his committee for their strong interest in a \nfinancial assistance package for Lebanon.\n\n\n                        climate change language\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sec. 576 of S. 2522 contains language \nregarding implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. I would like to ask the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee two questions to clarify their understanding of this \nprovision.\n  The United States is currently engaged in climate change negotiations \nto ensure meaningful participation of developing countries and to \nensure that greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved in the \nmost cost-effective manner. Is my understanding correct that this \nprovision is not intended to restrict the Administration from engaging \nin these international negotiations related to both the Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (FCCC), which was ratified by the Senate \nin 1992, and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention?\n  As you also know, the Senate has clearly expressed its views \nregarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, adopted unanimously by the \nSenate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the Administration to \nsupport an approach to climate change that protects the economic \ninterests of the United States and seeks commitments from\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\ndeveloping countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The \nAdministration is aggressively engaging developing countries to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions through international projects and activities \nemphasizing market-based mechanisms and environmental technology. It is \nmy understanding that this provision is not intended to restrict \ninternational programs or activities to encourage commitments by \ndeveloping countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nfor his questions. Your understanding is correct. Sec. 576 is not \nintended to restrict U.S. negotiations or activities such as you have \ndescribed. Rather, it is intended to prevent the Administration from \nimplementing the Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator's understanding is correct. Sec. 576 is not \nintended to prohibit the United States from engaging in international \nclimate change negotiations or activities that would encourage \nparticipation by developing countries.\n\n\n                     the inter-american foundation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last year, the Senate adopted an amendment \nto the FY 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act that deleted \nlanguage restricting the availability of funds for the Inter-American \nFoundation. I offered that amendment, which was included in the \nmanagers' amendment to the bill and accepted without objection, because \nthe basis for restricting the Foundation's funding was inaccurate and \nmisleading. Chairman Stevens and Chairman McConnell, when apprised of \nthe facts of the situation, agreed to remove the language from the \nbill, and I appreciate their willingness to do so.\n  This year, the report contains language that is similarly inaccurate \nand misleading, and that implies that a principal reason for \nterminating funding for the Foundation is an ongoing concern about the \nactivities of a staff member of the Foundation. Based on the agreement \nof Chairman Stevens and Chairman McConnell to remove similar language \nfrom the bill last year, as well as the subsequent resolution of this \nmatter, I was surprised to again see a reference to this matter in the \nCommittee's report.\n  First, let me say that I am not passing judgment on whatever other \nreasons the Committee may have for terminating the funding for the \nInter-American Foundation. However, I object to the Committee's \ncontinued reference to an individual staff member of the Foundation as \na reason for shutting down the Foundation. Let me take a moment to \nclearly state the facts of the matter.\n  Last year, the General Accounting Office conducted an investigation \nof allegations of contract and hiring regulatory abuses at the \nFoundation that were reported anonymously to their fraud hotline. The \nGAO completed their investigation and forwarded a report to the \nCommittee on May 20, 1999, and requested permission to brief the Board \nof Directors of the Foundation on their findings, as well as certain \nadditional allegations received during the course of interviews at the \nFoundation. On June 30, 1999, when Chairman Stevens and Chairman \nMcConnell agreed to remove language from the bill last year that \nwithheld funding for the Foundation until GAO completed a further \ninvestigation, the GAO was free to brief the Foundation. At that time, \nthe Chairmen advised me that, by referring the matter to the \nFoundation's Board, the Appropriations Committee would view this \ninvestigation as complete and no further action would be taken by the \nCommittee regarding the subject of the GAO investigation.\n  GAO briefed the Foundation Board on July 23, 1999. The minutes of \nthat Board meeting indicate that GAO investigators stated that GAO had \nissued a final report on their review of the Foundation's contracting \nand personnel actions and that no further review would be undertaken. \nIn addition, GAO investigators stated to the Board that the anonymous \nallegations received against a Foundation staff member were \nadministrative in nature and would not be further investigated by GAO. \nBoard members expressed concern and indignity at the allegations \nagainst the staff member, and concluded that no further action would be \nnecessary. On August 5, 1999, the Board adopted a formal resolution to \nthat effect.\n  Mr. President, continued references to unfounded, disproven anonymous \nallegations against this staff member contribute nothing to the \npublic's understanding of any legitimate reasons the Committee may have \nfor terminating the funding for the Inter-American Foundation. I would \nlike to ask Chairman Stevens if he agrees that long-resolved issues \nregarding a now-former staff member at the Foundation are not related \nto the Committee's action.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I share the views of my colleague, \nSenator McCain, that the Committee's report language could be misread \nto imply that the actions of a former staff member are a principal \nreason to shut down the Foundation, and I do not believe that is or \nshould be cited as a reason for doing so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Senator Stevens. Mr. President, I would also \nlike to ask Chairman Stevens if he would agree to include in the \nconference statement of managers on the FY 2001 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill a clear statement disavowing this report language \nregarding a now-former employee of the Foundation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would be happy to accept the Senator's \nsuggestion that we include clarifying report language in the conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you, Senator Stevens.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for the long-in-coming supplemental appropriations request for \nColombia included as part of this Foreign Operations bill. I believe \nthat there are few requests more important to the security and well-\nbeing of this nation in the coming years than this one.\n  I believe that it is critical that we move quickly to pass the \nForeign Operations bill and this emergency supplemental request for \nColombia.\n  Some have argued that the Colombia proposal is simply too expensive. \nBut I believe that this proposal represents the proper balance \nregarding what should--in fact must--be one of this nation's highest \npriorities: to stop the flow of illegal narcotics into the United \nStates.\n  As we debate this proposal today, Colombia faces an unprecedented \ncrisis.\n  Almost 40 percent of the country--an area itself the size of the \nentire nation of Switzerland--is under the control of the Armed \nRevolutionary Forces of Colombia, FARC. The FARC is an alliance of some \n20,000 drug traffickers and terrorists who threaten the stability not \nonly of Colombia, but of the entire Andean region. And, as we all know, \nthere are right-wing paramilitary groups in Colombia who also have ties \nto the drug trade.\n  Over 80 percent of the world's supply of cocaine is grown, produced \nor transported through Colombia, and large swaths of Colombia, now \nlawless or under FARC or paramilitary control, have become prime coca \nand opium producing zones.\n  These FARC rebels earn as much as two or even three million dollars \nper day from drug cultivators and traffickers who rely on their \nprotection or--perhaps even more likely--who fear their retribution.\n  The FARC is currently holding hostage as many as 1,500 to 2,500 \npeople, including at least 250 military prisoners and 250 police \nofficers.\n  And, as the ability of the government of Colombia to govern large \nareas of their own country continues to disintegrate, the FARC narco-\nterrorists and paramilitaries continue to expand their base of \noperations and attack surrounding areas.\n  All this, and Colombia is facing its worst economic recession in more \nthan 70 years: Real GDP fell by over 3 percent last year. Clearly, \nsomething needs to be done. And clearly, Colombia will need help.\n  The situation in Colombia is not simply a problem in a far away land. \nThe events taking place in Colombia have direct and severe \nrepercussions for the United States and the rest of the world.\n  Colombia is the source country for 80 percent of the cocaine consumed \nin the United States each year, and up to 70 percent of the heroin.\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\n  And the situation is getting worse, not better. Coca cultivation in \nColombia has doubled in the past decade alone, and shows no sign of \nslowing.\n  In addition to undermining the democratic institutions in Colombia, \nthe violence that has become endemic has forced over 500,000 people to \nflee Colombia; 65,000 have sought refuge in the United States.\n  According to the administration, illegal drugs account for over \n50,000 deaths each year in the United States, and cost over $100 \nbillion a year in health care costs, accidents, and lost productivity. \nSo the problem of narcotics production in Colombia is not just a \nproblem in Colombia: To the flow of drugs from Colombia has very real, \nand very damaging effects, on our country.\n  Earlier this year, I joined many of my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee as we met with Colombia's President, Andres \nPastrana. President Pastrana outlined a clear and comprehensive plan to \naddress the drug trade, and to start solving the deeper problems within \nhis country.\n  It is an ambitious plan, but one which I believe can be implemented, \nand can promote the peace process, strengthen democracy, and help \nrevive Colombia's economy.\n  The Plan Colombia encompasses far more than the request we have \nbefore us. A combination of internal and external sources will be \nproviding Colombia with most of the $7.5 billion over three years that \nPresident Pastrana has deemed necessary.\n  The United States need provide but a piece of the overall plan. \nWorking with President Pastrana, President Clinton has asked Congress \nto fund $1.6 billion of that total. The two-year package will assist \nColombia in combating the drug trade; help the country promote peace \nand prosperity; and deepen its democracy. This is a large package, but \nit is in our interest to provide it.\n  Without a major new effort, supported by the United States, the \nColombian military and police simply lack the resources and ability to \ndefeat the FARC and narco-trafficking forces.\n  Plan Colombia is focused on efforts to boost Colombia's interdiction \nand eradication capabilities, particularly in the south, including:\n  Funds for special counter-narcotics battalions to push into coca-\ngrowing regions of Southern Colombia;\n  Funds to purchase helicopters, desperately needed to provide the \nColombian National Police access to the remote and undeveloped regions \nof the country where the narco-traffickers thrive;\n  Funds to upgrade Colombia's interdiction capabilities, with aircraft \nand airfield upgrades, radar, and improved intelligence gathering;\n  Funds for equipment to be used in increased eradication efforts;\n  Funds to provide economic alternatives to coca growers; and,\n  Funds for new programs to promote human rights, help the judicial \nsystem and to crack down on money laundering.\n  As many of my colleague are aware, there is some concern about the \nhuman rights questions raised by this assistance package. This \nsupplemental request, after all, provides military assistance to an \narmy and a police force which, in the past, has had a less than Steller \nrecord on human rights issues.\n  But it is my belief that the Leahy amendment, augmented by specific \nlanguage that has been added to this legislation in committee, goes a \nlong way towards meeting these concerns.\n  To begin with, any U.S. assistance to Colombian military and police \nforces will be provided in strict accordance with section 563 of the \nFY2000 Foreign Operations Act--the Leahy amendment.\n  In addition, this legislation contains new and specific provisions \nintended to guarantee the protection of human rights. Colombian \nmilitary officers accused of human rights violations are to be tried in \na civilian court, for example, not in the military courts which have, \nin the past, been far too lenient in how they treat these cases. There \nare also requirements that any Colombian military units trained by the \nUnited States as part of this antinarcotics effort be screened for \nhuman rights abuses.\n  In addition, the committee has also included language at my request \nrelating to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the \nregions which, I believe, has greatly contributed to the culture of \nviolence and lawlessness in Colombia.\n  I believe that any effective strategy to stabilize the region and \nreduce the influence of the criminals, drug traffickers, narco-\nterrorists, and paramilitaries must include the implementation of \nstringent controls on existing stockpiles and the destruction of \nsurplus and seized stocks of small arms and light weapons.\n  The small arms and light weapons language calls for the creation of a \nserial number registry by the Department of State and by Colombia to \ntrack all small arms and light weapons provided to Colombia under this \nsupplemental request, as well as the creation of a small arms and light \nweapons destruction initiative for the region. If any of the small arms \nand light weapons the United States supplies to Colombia as part of \nthis assistance package are used in violation of human rights, this \nregistry will allow us to track, to the unit, who was using these \nweapons and bring the responsible party to justice.\n  On the question of human rights then, I believe that although we must \nremain watchful, the package crafted by the Appropriations Committee \ndoes a good job in meeting the concerns that have been raised.\n  Let me take a minute here, however, to express my concern about one \nspecific part of the committee recommendations that I hope is addressed \nin conference: The lack of Blackhawk helicopters.\n  The President asked for $388 million to fund 30 additional Blackhawk \nhelicopters.\n  These helicopters fly faster, farther, higher and hold more people \nthan the Huey II helicopters provided for by the committee.\n  In fact, I believe that the Blackhawk is critical to the terrain and \nmission in Colombia for several reasons:\n  The Blackhawk can carry three times as many men as the Huey II; at \nhigh altitudes the advantage of the Blackhawk is even more pronounced; \nand the Blackhawk's maximum speed is 50 percent faster than the Huey \nII.\n  I believe that the drug war is a serious one, and that we should be \ndevoting the best possible resources to this ongoing struggle.\n  I am not a helicopter expert, but the experts in the administration \nand elsewhere are telling us that the Blackhawk is the right equipment \nfor the job. I do not think we should be second-guessing that decision \nwith so much at stake.\n  Let me also talk for a moment today about one other aspect of this \nassistance package for Colombia that has come under some discussions: \nThe issue of demand reduction versus supply reduction.\n  Let me say that I strongly believe that even as we provide the \nresources necessary to implement Plan Colombia that we must also attack \nthe demand side of the drug problem in this country with a multi-\npronged, concerted effort.\n  I support funding for domestic prevention and demand reduction \nprograms, and I believe we must continue to provide domestic law \nenforcement with the tools they need to combat the drug trade within \nour borders.\n  But much of the demand-side, domestic effort can be accomplished by \nstate and local governments.\n  What state and local governments cannot do is to keep drugs from \nentering this country in the first place. That task can only be \naccomplished by the federal government, which has control over our \nborders and over foreign policy.\n  In fact, of the $18 billion in the Federal Government's counterdrug \nfunding, 32 percent goes to domestic demand reduction, 49 percent to \ndomestic law enforcement; 10 percent to interdiction along our borders; \nand only 3.2 percent to international counterdrug efforts.\n  Less than 4 percent for the one area that is clearly and \nunambiguously the one area in this fight that is the sole \nresponsibility of the Federal Government.\n  Even with passage of this package of assistance to Colombia this \nfigure will still be well under 10 percent.\n  So I say to my colleagues who believe more effort needs to be \ndirected to domestic programs to address demand that they are right. \nMore effort in this\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\narea is needed. Our states should do more. Our cities should do more. \nBut clearly more effort supporting our friends and allies in \ninternational efforts to curtail production, refinement, and \ntransportation are needed too. And that is the one area where only the \nFederal government can act.\n  Only with assistance from the United States will the Government of \nColombia be able to eradicate and intercept the tons of illegal \nnarcotics that leave that country each year bound for our shores.\n  The ongoing narco-crisis in Colombia and the overall crisis of drugs \nin America represent an important threat to our nation's security and \nstability. The war against drugs is real, and should be treated with \nthe same seriousness of purpose and resources as any other war.\n  The funding provided for the Colombia supplemental request in the \nForeign Operations bill, although expensive, is clearly within our \nnational interest. We face a crisis in this nation, and that crisis \ndemands action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Colombia package in the Foreign \nOperations bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the foreign operations of the United States \nare all undertaken to promote the national interests of our country. \nThey are all useful and important programs, and they deserve our \nsupport.\n  The national interests that they serve, however, are of varying \nimportance. As George Orwell wrote in his novel ``Animal Farm,'' ``some \nare more equal than others.'' All our foreign operations programs are \nuseful, but some are downright vital to our national security.\n  One element in this bill that is truly vital to our national security \nis severely underfunded. I will introduce shortly an amendment to \naddress that severe problem.\n  The funding line to which I refer is known as ``NADR.'' That does not \nrefer to Ralph Nader. It does refer to ``Nonproliferation, \nAntiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs.'' The 10 programs in \nthis category are all on the front line of protecting our people from \nterrorism and from weapons of mass destruction.\n  Unfortunately, the funding in this bill for 7 of those 10 programs is \n37 percent below the levels requested by the President. (And that \nignores another $30 million that was cut because the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee concluded that a new counter-terrorism training center \nmust be funded in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriation.) I submit \nthat the national security requires that we provide substantially more \nof those requested funds.\n  Let me describe the programs that are treated so badly in this bill:\n  In the non-proliferation field, the Department of State's Export \nControl Assistance program helps foreign countries to combat the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Recently customs agents in Uzbekistan stopped a shipment of \nradioactive contraband from Kazakhstan that was on its way to Iran, \nwith an official final destination of Pakistan. Some press stories \nsuggested that the shipment was really intended for a terrorist group \naffiliated with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, who would have used it \nto build a radiological weapon for use against Americans.\n  Those customs agents were trained by the United States. The equipment \nthey used to detect the radioactive material was provided by the United \nStates. In that case, the funding came from the Cooperative Threat \nReduction program.\n  But the Export Control Assistance program provides the same sort of \nassistance when Nunn-Lugar funds can not be used, and it helps other \ncountries to enact the laws and regulations that they need in order to \nhave effective export controls. The personal ties that are forged by \nthis program with export control officials from other countries are \nequally crucial to improving other countries' export control \nperformance.\n  This year, the Export Control Assistance program will enable the \nDepartment of Commerce to assign a resident export control attache to \nRussia. The Export Control Assistance program also sets up internal \ncompliance programs in Russia's high-tech industries and trains the \nRussian personnel who staff those offices. These programs enable Russia \nto police itself and give us increased visibility into plants that are \nof particular concern from the non-proliferation standpoint.\n  Last year, Congress increased funding for this program from $10 \nmillion to $14 million. Indeed, the report on the bill before us takes \ncredit for that increase. This year, the President asked for $14 \nmillion, to maintain this vital level of effort, but the bill before us \nincludes only $10 million.\n  When the appropriators increased this program last year, they were \nright. This year, they should do it again. We need more export control \nassistance to help other countries keep nuclear materials out of the \nhands of their dangerous neighbors.\n  Earlier this month, the National Commission on Terrorism warned that \nit was ``particularly concerned about the persistent lack of adequate \nsecurity and safeguards for the nuclear material in the former Soviet \nUnion.'' That is a cogent concern, and Export Control Assistance is one \nof the programs that helps to keep dangerous materials from crossing \nformer Soviet borders.\n  By the way, the Foreign Relations Committee favors full funding of \nthe President's request for this program. Indeed, at the suggestion of \nChairman Helms, we added $5 million in our security assistance bill to \nsupport a new project in Malta.\n  Another non-proliferation program, the International Science and \nTechnology Centers, provides safe employment opportunities for former \nSoviet experts in weapons of mass destruction who might otherwise be \ntempted to sell their skills to rogue states. This program not only \nhelps those scientists. It also gives hope to, and helps to preserve \ndiscipline at, the institutes where those experts work.\n  The activities of this program are guided by a Governing Board headed \nby the Honorable Ron Lehman, a wonderful public servant who was \nAssistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration and \ndirector of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Bush \nAdministration.\n  Ron Lehman and I often disagree on policy matters, but we are in \ncomplete agreement on the need to help Russia to restructure its \nbloated, Soviet-era weapons complexes without leaving its \nweapons experts prey to offers from countries like Iran, Iraq or Libya. \nHis program is doing some wonderful things, moreover. Since 1994, the \nScience Centers have supported over 840 projects, employing over 30,000 \nweapons experts at more than 400 former Soviet institutes.\n\n  Some of these projects led to the formation of viable commercial \ncompanies; others resulted in contracts with western companies to \ndistribute new Russian products like medical devices or high \ntemperature batteries. Around a fifth of Science Center funding now \ncomes from Western companies and government agencies that employ former \nSoviet experts through this program.\n  Other projects have put weapons experts to work on public health, \nenvironmental remediation, and non-proliferation projects that provide \nreal benefits to the former Soviet Union and its neighbors.\n  For example, the Russian Academy of Sciences, MINATOM, and the \nprestigious Kurchatov Institute recently completed a six-year project \nto map all the nuclear contamination sites in the former Soviet Union. \nScience Center funding was the lifeblood of that project.\n  The Science Centers also funded fourteen Y2K readiness projects that \nensured the safety of nuclear power facilities and chemical and \nbiological storage areas.\n  The International Science and Technology Centers are multinational. \nThe U.S. Government provided only 31 percent of last year's Science \nCenter funding, compared to 36 percent provided by the European Union. \nJapan, Norway and South Korea also participate in the program. But \nwithout our leadership, this program will fail.\n  The bill before us would give that program only a third of what was \nappropriated for this fiscal year. I know that the budget numbers for \nforeign operations are unrealistically tight. They always are. But if \nwe cut the Science and Technology Centers program that much, we will \nendanger our national security.\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n  It only takes a few experts in nuclear, chemical or biological \nweapons to provide dangerous materials or technology to a ``rogue \nstate.'' We should do everything in our power to make sure that \neconomic desperation in Russia does not result in such a catastrophe.\n  The committee report on this bill states that it:\n\n     was disturbed to learn that, after at least 5 years of \n     interaction between the State Department and Russian \n     scientists, relations remain guarded.\n\n  I, for one, am not disturbed by that. Russia still has a nuclear \nweapons program, just as we do. There are bound to be security concerns \nthat keep us at arm's length.\n  Unlike us, Russia may also have illegal chemical and/or biological \nweapons programs. There are military biological institutes to which we \ndo not have access.\n  As a result, there is always a risk that non-proliferation assistance \nwill be diverted to illegal military research, or that the funds we \nprovide will keep afloat people or institutes involved in an illegal \nchemical or biological weapons program. That risk pales, however, \ncompared to the risk of weapons proliferation if we leave those weapons \nscientists unable to put food on their table. So we must be \n``guarded,'' and we must do more.\n  The Science and Technology Centers program takes great care to \nminimize the risk of diversion. The General Accounting Office, after \nstudying the Science Center's programs to employ Russia's former \nbiological weapons experts, reported recently that the Center:\n\n       . . . has directly deposited grant payments into project \n     participants' individual bank accounts, which prevents the \n     institutes from diverting funds for unauthorized purposes. . \n     . . Program managers from the Science Center review \n     programmatic and financial documents on a quarterly basis, \n     and the Science Center requires a final audit of every \n     project before it releases an overhead payment to an \n     institute.\n       In addition, the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency has \n     conducted internal control audits for 10 Science Center \n     biotechnology projects through 1999.\n\n  Those precautions work. A few months ago, Science Center officials \nwere warned by Russian scientists of a possible diversion of funds. \nThat information was received and acted upon in a timely manner, and \nsteps were taken to make sure that no diversion occurred.\n  The Science Centers program also takes steps to guard against \nproliferation. After all, that's the point of this assistance. We can \nbe proud of the job that this program is doing to reduce the risk of \nproliferation of Russian materials and expertise.\n  When the GAO looked at Science Center biotechnology projects, they \nfound that nearly half the recipients of project assistance were \n``former senior weapons scientists.'' On the average, the scientists \ndevoted more than half of the year to Science Center projects. \nInstitute directors told the GAO that these projects ``were crucial to \ntheir institute budgets.''\n  The GAO also reports:\n\n       Prior to the funding of any U.S. collaborative research \n     project, Russian institute officials must pledge that their \n     institute will not perform offensive weapons research or \n     engage in proliferation activities. According to a January \n     1999 State Department report, engaging in such inappropriate \n     behavior would have an immediate and negative impact on any \n     U.S. assistance.\n  Institute officials with whom we met consistently told us that they \nare no longer involved in offensive biological weapons activities and \nthat they clearly understand the conditions of U.S. collaborative \nresearch assistance.\n\n  The GAO report continues:\n\n       Officials at three institutes we visited reported that, in \n     the past, representatives of countries of proliferation \n     concern had approached them seeking to initiate questionable \n     dual-use research. Officials at the three institutes told us \n     they had refused these offers because of a pledge made to \n     U.S. executive branch officials as a condition of receiving \n     U.S. assistance.\n\n       The pledge includes avoiding cooperation both with \n     countries of proliferation concern or with terrorist groups.\n       State and Defense Department officials identified at least \n     15 former Soviet biological weapons institutes in which the \n     United States has evidence that these programs have \n     discouraged the institutes and scientists from cooperating \n     with countries of proliferation concern such as Iran.\n       The Department of Defense informed Congress in a January \n     2000 report that the access gained through the collaborative \n     research programs has provided ``high confidence'' that \n     Biopreparat institutes such as Vector and Obolensk are not \n     presently engaged in offensive activities.\n\n  Did everyone get that? This program is giving assistance to Russian \nbiological weapons experts in order to keep them out of the clutches of \nrogue states. The GAO has found that it is succeeding in doing that. At \nthe same time, we are guarding against the diversion of our funds to \nimproper purposes. And the access we get to the institutes we assist--\nthanks to this program--has enabled the Defense Department to say that \nthose institutes are clean.\n  Finally, we get useful research as an end product. If the executive \nbranch gets the funding it wants, we will get help on defending against \nbiological weapons. We will also help the Russians safeguard the \ndangerous pathogens that they keep for research purposes, thus guarding \nagainst their sale and reducing the risk of an accidental catastrophe.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee supports this program as well. \nIndeed, in our security assistance bill, we added $14 million, so that \nthe Science Centers could fund all of the deserving projects that have \nbeen proposed.\n  But the bill before us cuts $25 million out of this fine program, \nleaving less than 45 percent of what the President requested, and \nbarely a third of what the Foreign Relations Committee recommends.\n  The price of such cuts could be far more than the $25 million in \nwould-be savings. If we leave Russian weapons scientists underemployed, \nwith time on their hands and not enough food on their tables, how will \nthey resist an offer from Iran or Iraq?\n  When we talk about keeping these Russian scientists usefully \nemployed, we're guarding against the spread of nuclear weapons and \ndreaded plagues. We're not talking about budget caps, but rather about \nlife or death for millions of people.\n  I understand the need for efficient programs. But this program works. \nThat GAO report did not need to make even one recommendation.\n  And when millions of lives are potentially at stake, we should do \nmore than do less.\n  A third non-proliferation program is our contributions to KEDO, the \nKorean Energy Development Organization, pursuant to the Nuclear \nFramework with North Korea. Thanks to this agreement, North Korea has \nceased reprocessing spent nuclear reactor fuel.\n  Indeed, recently the last of the spent nuclear fuel was safely \ncanned, under IAEA supervision. That vastly lowers any North Korean \nability to produce nuclear weapons.\n  The Nuclear Framework Agreement has also led North Korea to let U.S. \nexperts visit an underground site that we feared might be a nuclear \nplant. Our two visits showed that it was not a nuclear facility.\n  But there is a price for all these benefits, and part of that price \nis U.S. contributions of heavy fuel oil. Now, traditionally we have \nspent $35 million a year on that. But other countries have not helped \nout as much as we expected--although South Korea and Japan are spending \nmuch more than we are, to build new reactors in North Korea that will \nnot be readily used for bomb-making. In addition, as we all know, fuel \noil costs a lot more than it used to.\n  Appropriators have refused to allocate more than $35 million, \nhowever. Instead, last year, they kept this line at $35 million and \nadded a separate, unallocated line of $20 million in the NADR account, \nwhich actually went to meet our KEDO obligations.\n  The bill before us again allots only $35 million, but this time there \nis no additional line with $20 million.\n  This money keeps the Nuclear Framework Agreement on track. That \nagreement keeps North Korea from using a handy source of fissile \nmaterial to make nuclear weapons. It also provides a bit of stability \non the Korean peninsula, which has led to a suspension of North Korea's \nlong-range missile tests, to U.S.-North Korean negotiations on an end \nto those programs and to North Korea's missile exports, and now to the \nfirst summit ever between the leaders of North and South Korea.\n  Do we really want to put the Framework Agreement at risk, by failing \nto\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\nfund it? Do we want to derail all the delicate negotiations that are \nongoing with North Korea?\n  Perhaps the authors of this bill intend to fix this in conference, \nonce everybody admits that we need to bust the budget caps on foreign \noperations. If so, I will be relieved. Maintaining KEDO and the Nuclear \nFramework Agreement gets to the heart of our national security, \nhowever, and I think we should make clear that we want this shortfall \nremedied.\n  Another important program in this funding category is our \ncontributions to the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Preparatory \nCommission. These funds are used primarily to procure and install the \nInternational Monitoring system, which serves United States national \nsecurity interests by enabling the world to detect, identify, and \nrespond to any illegal nuclear tests by other countries.\n  The International Monitoring System offers features that are of \nparticular value to the United States. Its network of seismic stations \nwill supplement those that the U.S. Government uses to monitor foreign \nnuclear weapons tests. Indeed, some of those stations will be in \nlocations where we could not hope to get seismic coverage any other \nway.\n  The controlled and affiliated seismic stations will also afford \nregional coverage, rather than just long-range seismic collection. This \nwill result in improved detection, as well as better geolocation of \nsuspect events.\n  The International Monitoring System will include \nhydroacoustic collection in the world's oceans, ultrasound collection, \nand a large network of land-based atmospheric collectors to pick up \ntelltale contamination in the air. Use of those additional monitoring \ntechniques will increase the likelihood of getting multiple-source \nevidence of an illegal nuclear weapons test.\n\n  In addition, the data from the International Monitoring System will \nbe widely available, and therefore usable for enforcement purposes. \nThis is important.\n  Although the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into \nforce, signatories are bound--by international law and/or by custom--\nnot to undermine the ``object and purposes'' of the treaty. We have a \nlegal interest, therefore--and surely a security interest--in making \nsure that other countries do not engage in nuclear weapons tests.\n  How do you enforce a ban on nuclear weapons tests? That takes more \nthan just monitoring. It requires exposure of the offending country and \nconvincing other countries that a violation has occurred. Only then can \nwe rally the world to threaten or impose penalties on the offender.\n  U.S. Government sources of information, as good as they are, often \ncan not be used to create a diplomatic or public case against an \noffender. Our contributions to the CTBT Preparatory Commission will \nhelp us to get the publicly usable information that is so vital to \nputting a stop to any cheating.\n  The report on this bill states that in the past, the President has \nrequested more than was needed for this program. That is true. The \nexecutive branch asks for our share of the coming year's tentative \nbudget, but we also work within the Preparatory Commission to scrub \nthat budget, and it usually comes in a bit lower.\n  But does that mean we can safely cut 30 percent? Not on your life! \nThe final U.S. obligation might be $20 million, as opposed to the \nrequested $21.5 million. But $15 million is simply out of the question. \nThat would presume a $25 million cut in the Preparatory Commission \nbudget proposed by their Secretariat, which would mean an intolerable \ndelay in fielding the monitoring system.\n  There may be some confusion because this program has been able to \nabsorb budget cuts in the past. In those years, the State Department \nwas able to apply previous-year funds to make up for the cuts. \nVirtually all the Fiscal Year 2000 funds, however, have already been \nobligated. Thus, a cut in Fiscal Year 2001 funding will be much more \nharmful than were previous cuts.\n  The report also states that the Preparatory Commission should \nreimburse the United States for services we have performed in setting \nup monitoring sites. That, too, is true, and we will be reimbursed. We \nwill not be reimbursed, however, until the sites that we install have \nbeen certified as operational. That guards against shoddy work by other \ncountries, and I don't think we want to give up that protection.\n  Certification has been achieved for one U.S.-installed site, and we \nwill get $500,000 in reimbursements in Fiscal Year 2001. That is \nalready taken into account in the President's budget request. Several \nmillion dollars in reimbursement will be received in later years. \nCutting the 2001 budget will jeopardize not only the work program for \nthe monitoring system, but also any reimbursements for past or current \nwork that depend upon achieving certification next year.\n  The bottom line is simple: either we pay for our share of nuclear \ntest monitoring costs, or we delay significantly the work on a \nmonitoring system that serves our own national security. If we want to \ncatch any country that cheats and to expose that cheating, so that we \ncan sanction a violator, then we must pay our bills.\n  Non-proliferation programs were not the only ones to be cut in this \nportion of the bill before us. The Department of State's Anti-Terrorism \nAssistance program and its Terrorist Interdiction program are vital to \nthe security of United States diplomatic and military personnel \noverseas.\n  The first line of defense against attacks like those on our embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania, or on the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi Arabia, \nis not ours. Rather, it is the security services of the host countries. \nAll over the world, those countries need our assistance in border \ncontrol and airport security. They need our training in spotting \nterrorist groups hiding behind legitimate charities, and in handling \nterrorist incidents--including future attacks that could use weapons of \nmass destruction. The Anti-Terrorism Assistance program does all of \nthis.\n  Right now, the Anti-Terrorism Assistance program trains up to 2,000 \npeople per year. There is so much demand for our training that we could \nhelp 3,000 a year, if only we had the funds and the facilities. An \nincrease in training funds would make a real contribution to our \nsecurity.\n  The State Department also runs a Terrorist Interdiction Program--\nknown as TIP--that provides other countries the training and equipment \nneeded for them to apprehend terrorists entering their countries. The \nTIP program enables countries to compare a person's travel documents to \ntheir own data-bases. It also works through INTERPOL to link these \ncountries and promote information sharing. Finally, it trains \nimmigration and customs workers in interview and screening techniques.\n  The State Department recently began a program to provide these \nimportant capabilities to Pakistan. We all know about Pakistan, the \ngateway to Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden and his buddies. Can anybody \nthink of a better place to beef up border security, so that terrorists \ncan be apprehended as they go to and from those Afghan training camps?\n  The first phase of the TIP program in Pakistan will be paid out of \nFiscal Year 2000 funds. But the bill for the second phase will come due \nin Fiscal Year 2001. So will the first phase of a program in \nKenya, which we know all too well has been used as a terrorist gateway \nto Africa, and site surveys in four more countries.\n\n  The proposed budget cut in the bill before us would force us to \nchoose between Pakistan and Kenya. It is simply contrary to our \nnational interest to force such a Hobson's choice.\n  These two anti-terrorist programs are utterly vital to our security. \nThey make foreign security services more competent in protecting our \nown personnel, and they also foster ties that can be crucial in a \ncrisis. We should be increasing these programs, and the President's \nproposed budget would do just that.\n  The bill before us would cut 22 percent of the funds requested. It \nwould impose a 7-percent cut from this year's funding for these two \nanti-terrorist programs. This is simply unacceptable.\n  Finally, the Department of State's Small Arms program has \nunderwritten successful arms buy-backs in Africa, notably in Mali. This \nis low-budget program is urgently needed in areas that are emerging \nfrom civil war and still awash in automatic weapons. A\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\nlittle bit of support can go a long way to drain the supply of arms \nthat otherwise end up going to drug-runners, bandit gangs, or renewed \ncivil strife.\n  The President proposed $2 million for this program. The bill before \nus would slice away half of that. This is, indeed, a low-budget \nprogram, but $2 million is really the floor for a workable program. To \ntake away half of that is to throw this effort into the basement.\n  The bill before us, Mr. President, leaves the Senate in a nearly \nuntenable position. It is under the budget request by fully $1.7 \nbillion. This is no way to fulfill our obligations to world \norganizations or to maintain either international influence or our own \nnational security. We must accept that there is no such thing as world \nleadership on the cheap.\n  I deeply wish that I could restore the funds that this bill cuts from \nthe NADR account. The truth is, however, that we must wait for \nconferees to break the ridiculous cap on this whole bill.\n  With that in mind, the amendment that I am introducing simply states \nthe sense of the Senate that the conferees should find the funds needed \nto make NADR whole.\n  We have been through this drill before. In due course, more funds for \nforeign operations will be found. The crucial question is how the \nconferees will allocate those funds. This amendment calls on the \nconferees to give priority to these important national security \nefforts.\n  I am pleased to report that this amendment is co-sponsored by \nSenators Lugar, Hagel, Bingaman, Conrad, Domenici and Levin. I urge all \nof my colleagues to support it.\n  This amendment is not certain to succeed in conference--but it surely \nis the least we can do. The safety of our diplomats and military \npersonnel overseas, and the safety of all of us from the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, demand no less.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering S. 2522, \nthe foreign operations and export financing appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2001.\n  The Senate bill provides $13.4 billion in budget authority and $4.5 \nbillion in new outlays to operate the programs of the Department of \nState, export and military assistance, bilateral and multilateral \neconomic assistance, and related agencies for fiscal year 2001.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $13.4 billion in budget \nauthority and $14.3 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2001.\n  The subcommittee is below its section 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority and at its section 302(b) allocation for outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 2522, FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS, 2001: SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                 [Fiscal year 2001, dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            General\n                                            purpose  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority.......................    13,384         44    13,428\n  Outlays................................    14,273         44    14,317\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................    13,385         44    13,429\n  Outlays................................    14,273         44    14,317\n200 level:\n  Budget authority.......................    15,306         44    15,350\n  Outlays................................    13,527         44    13,571\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.......................    15,097         44    15,141\n  Outlays................................    15,329         44    15,373\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.......................        -1  .........        -1\n  Outlays................................  ........  .........  ........\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.......................    -1,922  .........    -1,922\n  Outlays................................       746  .........       746\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.......................    -1,713  .........    -1,713\n  Outlays................................    -1,056  .........    -1,056\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5542-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5542-S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               METHAMPHETAMINE LAB CLEANUP/CHILD SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly discuss two important \nprovisions regarding child soldiers and methamphetamine lab cleanup \nthat are included in this supplemental spending package in the Foreign \nOperations bill before us.\n  Over the years, Iowa and many states in the Midwest, West and \nSouthwest have been working hard to reduce the sale and abuse of \nmethamphetamine. But meth has brought another problem that we must \naddress: highly toxic labs that are abandoned and exposed to our \ncommunities.\n  We know that it can cost thousands of dollars to clean up a single \nlab. Fortunately, in recent years, the Drug Enforcement Agency has \nprovided critical funds to help clean up these dangerous sites.\n  However, last year, the DEA funding was cut in half, despite evidence \nthat more and more meth labs have been found and confiscated. Because \nof these cuts, in March, the DEA completely ran out of funding to \nprovide meth lab cleanup assistance to state and local law enforcement.\n  Last month, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from other \nDepartment of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab cleanup. \nThis action will help reimburse these states for the costs they have \nincurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of Iowa has already \npaid some $300,000 out of its own pocket for clean up since March.\n  However, we've got another five months to go before the new fiscal \nyear--and the number of meth labs being found and confiscated is still \non the rise.\n  The bill before us contains $10 million I added in Committee to \nensure that there will be enough money to pay for costly meth lab \nclean-up without forcing states to take money out of their other tight \nlaw enforcement budgets.\n  If we can find money to fight drugs in Columbia, we should be able to \nfind money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We cannot risk exposing \nthese dangerous meth labs to our communities.\n  Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee also adopted an amendment \nI offered to provide $5 million provision in the Colombia package to \naddress one of the most alarming aspects of the drug conflict in \nColombia--the use of child soldiers.\n  Human Rights Watch estimates that as many as 19,000 youths--some as \nyoung as eight--are being used by the Colombian armed forces, \nparamilitary groups and guerrilla forces. Up to 50 percent of some \nparamilitary units and up to 80 percent of some guerrilla units are \nmade up of children. Children are used as combatants, guides, and \ninformants. They may be forced to collect intelligence, deploy land \nmines, and serve as advance shock forces in ambushes. Guerrillas often \nrefer to them as ``little bees,'' because they sting before their \ntargets realize they are under attack.\n  These children are forced to carry arms and are enticed by false \npromises or threats to their families. They are often tortured, \ndrugged, sexually abused, and permanently traumatized by the horror and \nbrutality of war. Children who are turned into soldiers lose their \nchildhood.\n  They lose their innocence and their youth. They become instruments of \ndestruction and atrocity. And the longer they remain under arms, the \nharder it is for them to heal and return to any semblance of a normal \nlife.\n  Some of the funds included in the supplemental for Colombia are \nintended to support judicial reform, human rights protection and peace \nnegotiations. Indeed, protecting human rights and rule of law is \ncentral to the overall success of Plan Colombia. The use of child \nsoldiers is a serious human rights abuse prohibited by numerous \ninternational treaties and conventions, including ILO Convention 182 on \nthe Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor--and by the Colombian \ngovernment itself. The International Criminal Court makes the \nrecruitment or use of children under age 15 in military activities a \nwar crime. I can think of no better use for these funds than to assist \nthe demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers.\n  The current generation of children in Colombia is the fourth \ngeneration to grow up surrounded by conflict. The $5 million in the \nHuman Rights part of the Colombia package will help some of Colombia's \nchildren regain their fundamental right to life and peace. The money \nwill be used by NGOs working to provide humanitarian assistance to \naffected children and their families. These NGO's will support programs \nproviding counseling, education and reintegration services to former \nchild\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\nsoldiers; safe houses for escaped child soldiers; and public awareness \nand recruitment-prevention campaigns. Although $5 million represents \nless than one-third of 1 percent of the total supplemental funds for \nColombia, this money may be the most well-spent of all.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as a member for the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I've worked to enact foreign aid bills that reflect our \nnational interests and our values. While I support the FY2001 foreign \noperations appropriations bill, I do have some serious concerns that I \nhope will be addressed during conference.\n  I am pleased that the foreign operations bill provides assistance to \nIsrael, Cyprus and Armenia. I believe that its important that we stand \nby these friends as they make the difficult steps toward peace. I am \nalso pleased that we support bilateral population assistance and \nsupport for micro-enterprise programs. These programs are vital in \nhelping the world's poorest people to help themselves.\n  I am disappointed that the bill does not provide sufficient \nassistance in other crucial areas, such as adequate flood relief \nassistance to Mozambique and the Administration's full funding request \nfor debt relief.\n  In addition, although I am pleased with the human rights requirements \nincluded in the Colombia aid package attached to this legislation, I \nhave grave reservations about the large military aid package to \nColombia.\n  Colombia has been suffering through a civil war for over thirty \nyears. Over 35,000 Colombians have been killed in the last decade. In \nrecent years, this civil war has been exacerbated by the illegal \nproduction and trade of drugs coming out of Colombia--primarily cocaine \nand heroin. Most of these drugs wind up in the United States and \ncontribute to America's growing drug problem. It is clear that the \nUnited States has to help Colombia deal with this volatile situation.\n  It is also clear that we have to do more to stop the growing demand \nand dependence on drugs in our own country. In my own hometown of \nBaltimore--out of a population of 600,000--60,000 people are addicted \nto heroin or cocaine. These individuals not only wreck their own lives \nbut they also have left a horrible mark on the city--drug-related \ncrimes are now at $2 to $3 billion a year. Drugs destroy individuals, \nfamilies and communities. That's why I've always fought for anti-drug \neducation, increased drug treatment programs and strong law \nenforcement.\n  I am not convinced that the military aid provided to Colombia \nincluded in this bill is the best way to fight drugs in the United \nStates.\n  First of all, I'm concerned that we're getting dragged into the \nmiddle of a civil war. I am also concerned that there is no clear exit \nstrategy. The aid package is open-ended. The Administration has \nadmitted that this ``two-year'' package is really expected to run \nlonger--more like five or six years. An open-ended commitment could \nturn into a quagmire.\n  I believe the best way to help Colombia is by supporting its peace \nprocess through a balanced aid package. The package before us is not at \nall balanced. Over 75% of this package is in military arms, equipment \nand training. Only a small fraction of the aid helps to fund economic \nalternatives to drug production, to assist the large number of \ncivilians who will be displaced by this assistance or to address the \ndeeper social problems that have led to Colombia's increasing reliance \non drug production and cultivation in the first place.\n  These funds would be better spent combating the drug problem in the \nUnited States. More funding and support is badly needed for drug \ntreatment and prevention programs in our own country. That is why I \nsupported Senator Wellstone's amendment to reduce the military aid \nprovided to Colombia and re-direct that funding to domestic substance \nabuse programs--in particular to vital state and local community based \nprograms--that are in desperate need of funding. I regret that this \namendment did not pass.\n  Although I regret that such a large percentage of our assistance to \nColombia is in military aid, I am pleased that strong human rights \nrequirements must be met by Colombia's Government and Armed Forces \nbefore this aid is dispensed. President Pastrana has taken important \nsteps to improve the human rights situation in Colombia by disciplining \narmy officials who have committed human rights violations. Nonetheless, \nit is a well-known and well-documented fact that members of Colombia's \nArmed Forces continue to be linked to paramilitary groups that commit \nthese violent acts.\n  The human rights requirements in this legislation helps to address \nthis continuing problem. For example, under this legislation, the head \nof Colombia's Armed Forces must suspend personnel alleged to have \ncommitted gross human rights violations or to have aided or abetted \nparamilitary groups. It also requires the Colombian Government to \nprosecute leaders and members of paramilitary groups as well as \nmilitary personnel who aid or abet paramilitary groups. Before U.S. \nmilitary aid can be dispensed to Colombia, the U.S. Secretary of State \nmust certify that these human rights conditions have been met. By \nenforcing these conditions, I believe that the Colombian Government--\nwith U.S. support--might achieve real progress on Colombia's path to \npeace.\n  I urge that Congress maintain the strong human rights requirements in \nthis legislation. Without such checks in providing assistance to \nColombia, we run the risk of further exacerbating Colombia's civil war. \nWe must also monitor the impact this assistance will have on reducing \ndrug production in Colombia and drug supply in the United States. By \nkeeping this goal in mind, we can evaluate and devise the best method \nfor combating the war against drugs in the United States which, after \nall, is the ultimate aim of this aid.\n  As the strongest nation on earth, and the world's strongest \ndemocracy, our foreign aid must be used to promote peace, stability and \nhuman rights. As a member of the Foreign Operations Conference \nCommittee, I will work to ensure that the final legislation supports \nthese goals and represents our national interests and our values.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think that a brief chronology of \nevents regarding U.S. efforts to provide assistance to Colombia would \nbe instructive. For years, the Administration has neglected the growing \nnarcotics crisis in the Andean Region. Funding for international \ninterdiction declined rapidly under the Clinton Administration. For \nexample, international counter-narcotic funding dropped 56% from 1992 \nto 1996. Also Department of Defense air assets for counter-narcotics \nwere slashed 68% from 1992-1999. As a result, drug production abroad \nand drug usage at home increased dramatically. The statistics are \ndevastating. From 1992 to 1999, for example, cocaine use among 10th \ngraders increased 133%\n  Republicans have long argued for a restoration of balance in the U.S. \ncounter-drug strategy: the 1980s showed that eradicating and \ninterdicting illegal drugs outside our borders is a necessary part of a \nsuccessful drug strategy that also includes strong investments in \ndemand reduction and domestic law enforcement.\n  The Colombia crisis emerged as an international crisis last spring, \n1999. I had the opportunity to travel to Colombia in August of 1999 to \nsee the drug-fueled crisis first-hand. Upon my return, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Grassley and I introduced an assistance package, the Alianza \nAct, in October of 1999. The Alianza Act authorized $1.6 billion over 3 \nyears to support anti-drug efforts, the rule of law, human rights, and \nthe peace process in Colombia and neighboring countries. This was, in \nmy view, a balanced and comprehensive approach to the crisis in \nColombia.\n  Unfortunately, the Administration was nowhere to be seen. Except for \nseveral Administration envoys who arrived to Bogota empty-handed, the \nWhite House did little. Finally, after months of delay, in January 2000 \nthe White House announced a response to Plan Colombia, though failed to \nprovide details until early February. The Administration plan largely \nmirrored the Alianza Act, though fell short in two critical areas; it \nfailed to take a truly regional approach by providing sufficient funds \nfor other countries in the Andean region and it also failed to \nadequately provide for our front-line law enforcement agencies such as \nthe Customs Service and the Coast Guard.\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n  In March, the House passed a $13 billion Supplemental Package, which \nincluded $1.7 for Colombia. The Colombia portion is a good bill that \nrectifies many of the shortcomings in the Administrations proposal. \nThen in May, the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee \nmarked up its bill, which included almost $1 billion for Colombia (the \nMilcon Appropriations Subcommittee also marked up more than $300 \nmillion for Colombia as well).\n  I strongly urge passage of this assistance. There is no doubt that \nthe crisis in Colombia is an emergency that directly affects our \nnational security and threatens to destabilize the entire Andean \nregion. While we may not all agree on every detail of this package, \nimmediate passage of counter-narcotics assistance is crucial to reduce \nthe flow of drugs onto our streets and to bring stability to the Andean \nRegion. It's time to realize that the emergency in Colombia threatens \nan important source of U.S. oil, continues to fuel the flood of illegal \ndrugs entering America's streets, and endangers our hemisphere's common \nmarch toward democracy and free enterprise.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have an amendment on the list. I would like to call this \namendment up tomorrow. I ask unanimous consent that I may be authorized \nto call up one of my amendments on the list tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the underlying \nlegislation that would provide support for the country of Colombia to \nfight the drug problem which not only involves Colombia but involves \nthe United States very decisively and directly.\n  I commend Senators McConnell and colleagues who drafted this \nlegislative vehicle to assist Colombia.\n  Part of my discussion tonight is based upon a trip last weekend that \nI took with Senator Durbin to Colombia. We had the opportunity to \ntravel to Cartegena to meet with President Pastrana and his key \nnational security advisers. We also traveled to Bogota to meet with the \nDefense Minister and the chairman of their joint chiefs of staff.\n  But I think much more importantly, we traveled out to where the \nmilitary forces are being deployed to counteract this drug problem, to \nthe town of Larandia. It is not really a town, it is a base camp. It is \na forward post for the Colombians to conduct these counterdrug \noperations.\n  One of the first impressions you get when you go to Colombia and leaf \nthrough the materials provided by the Embassy is that this country has \na long history of violence--or, as the Colombians say, La Violencia.\n  In fact, according to the Embassy, there is one kidnapping every 5 \nhours in Colombia. And 75 percent of the world's reported kidnappings \noccur in Colombia. The Embassy points out that Bogota is the murder \ncapital of the world. In a city of 7 million people, there are 16 \nmurders a day and 6,000 murders a year.\n  This is a country that has been wracked by political and criminal \nviolence for many decades. The political violence began with some \npresence back in 1940s when elements of what later became the Liberal \nParty and the Conservative Party literally battled for control of the \ncountry. This lasted until 1957, when both parties agreed to form a \nnational front.\n  Then there was a period from 1958 until 1974 in which both parties \nliterally transferred power each 4 years from one president to another, \nand there was a semblance of stability in the country. But certainly by \nthe 1960s, there was renewed agitation by guerrilla forces, principally \nMarxist and Leninist forces--the whole spectrum--the two principals \nbeing Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, and \nEjercito de Liberacion Nacional, or ELN.\n  These forces, spurred on by the success of Castro in Cuba, made \nsignificant inroads in terms of establishing independent zones along \nwith agitators who also fought for agrarian rights in the countryside.\n  In the 1960s, the Colombian military conducted a serious \ncounterinsurgence operation. They were able to eliminate these zones. \nBut in that time, they won for themselves the infamous designation of \nbeing significant abusers of human rights. That reputation--both the \nperception and, unfortunately, reality--continues in the Colombian \nmilitary today.\n  But by the end of the 1960s and the 1970s, they had effectively \npushed the insurgency away from the populated centers of Colombia--\nwhich are the coastline and the Andean plains--into the jungles of the \nAmazon, in an area which is desolate, unpopulated, and, frankly, beyond \nthe effective control of authorities in Bogota and elsewhere in \nColombia.\n  But in the 1970s, the drug trade began to assert itself into the life \nof Colombians, first with the cultivation of marijuana. It took the \nColombian police authority a while to recognize the threat to them as \nwell as to others from this cultivation.\n  Recognizing the problem, they began to organize themselves to conduct \ncounterdrug operations in the police force--not the military.\n  Then, as we all know, marijuana was rapidly displaced in the world \ndrug market by cocaine. The cocaine trade became a curse for Colombia.\n  Within Colombia infrastructure, the leadership of several major \norganizations--the Cali cartel, the Medellin cartel and others--set up \ntheir headquarters in Colombia and began to run worldwide operations. \nMost of the production was done outside in the surrounding Andean \ncountry. This map is a recent example of cultivation areas--the \ncultivation areas in Peru, Bolivia, which have been very successful \nwith eradication, and here is Colombia. Cultivation was typically \noutside Colombia. Within Colombia, they located clandestine \nlaboratories to convert the coca leaf into cocaine base and later \ncocaine. From the 1970s and through the 1980s, there was a fabulously \npowerful and wealthy criminal combination that was destabilizing \nColombia.\n  The United States did not stand aside when this situation developed. \nThe United States supported the Colombian police and insisted that the \nColombian police reform themselves and throw out those who had been \ncorrupted by the narcotraffickers. With cooperation, and with the \nleadership of the Colombian police and with the bravery and the \nsacrifice of scores of Colombian police officers, the Cali cartel was \ndisrupted and the Medellin cartel was disrupted. The leaders of the \ncartels literally died in police shootouts.\n  We have a situation, where through support by the United States and \nthe police forces of Colombia, we defeated a drug combination that was \nthreatening the United States by importing vast amounts of cocaine into \nthe United States.\n  Now there is a new situation and a new crisis. The new crisis is the \nresult of two things: the collision of cocaine cultivation, coca \ncultivation, and these remnants of a political insurgency that has been \nongoing in Colombia for decades. The FARC and other revolutionary units \nare in the hinterland. What has arrived recently has been the \ncultivation of coca. As a result, the FARC--and its other guerrilla \nforces--has been enlisted in the support and protection of these coca \nfields. They are deriving great resources in doing that. They are \nderiving resources to support their political activities.\n  Coca production now has been linked with armed military forces. The \npolice are no longer capable with their equipment and their technology \nto deal with this. This has become a military problem. As a result, we \nare in a military problem that requires military support of the United \nStates, just as it required police support in the 1980s and the early \n1990s.\n  Part of the reason the cultivation has come to Colombia is the fact \nthat we have been successful. As an indication of our success, \nColombian production has surged dramatically. It has surged where in \nother places the production has been cut back. Both in Bolivia and in \nPeru, we have made significant progress--again, working with local \nauthorities, working with their counternarcotics organizations--and we \nhave been able to suppress the cultivation of coca. What has been \nsuppressed in Peru and Bolivia has now blossomed in the southern \nprovinces of Colombia. Again, this combination of coca production and \nguerrillas has produced a military crisis as well as a drug crisis.\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\n  I have heard colleagues come to the floor and talk about the \nsituation, saying: This is Colombia's problem, not our problem.\n  Mr. President, the streets of America are also the battlegrounds for \nthis problem because the final impact of cocaine is felt--as too many \nAmericans are subject to the ravages of cocaine addiction.\n  This chart demonstrates what we are talking about. As I mentioned \nbefore, Peru has shown a 27-percent reduction in cultivation; Bolivia, \na 53-percent reduction in cultivation; Colombia, production has \nincreased and will increase unabated unless we do something.\n\n  The bottom line is, from all these sources, but increasingly from \nColombia, 512 metric tons a year of cocaine is directed to the United \nStates. About 380 metric tons arrive, get through our border \ncheckpoints, get around our intense efforts to stop it, and hit the \nstreets of America.\n  In a real sense, Colombia's problem is our problem and our problem is \nColombia's problem. It is the huge demand of the United States which is \ncausing some of this instability in Colombia. So we have a rather \nstrong national security interest in assisting Colombian forces to do \nthe job we insist they do, which is to stop cocaine production and \ndistribution emanating from Colombia. It is important to note we have a \nsituation where we want to ensure that the Colombian forces help us by \ncurtailing supply, so it does not arrive on the streets of America.\n  The proposal that is included in the legislation before the Senate, \nPlan Colombia, has been carefully worked out. Its focus is \ncounternarcotics--not the political insurgencies that have washed back \nand forth across Colombia for decades. It represents the recognition by \nour Government and the Government of Colombia, first, that there is a \nsignificant problem in Colombia that directly affects the tranquility \nof peace and the security of the United States. Second, I believe it \nalso recognizes the competence of the Colombian authorities to fight \nthe good fight.\n  Again, as I indicated, it was Colombian police officials working with \nthe United States and other international narcotics control officers \nthat went a long way to destroy the Cali cartel and the Medellin \ncartel. Now this is a new phase. It is no longer simply criminal \nsyndicates operating in the cities of Colombia. It is a situation where \nguerrilla forces are protecting and profiting from the cultivation of \ncoca in the hinterlands of Colombia.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, Plan Colombia is a reaction to the \nrecognition of a crisis. It is also proposed as a result of the \nconfidence that has been demonstrated in the Government of Colombia, \ntheir sincere dedication to try to eradicate their own problem with \ndrug cultivation, and also it represents, I think, and based upon my \ntrip, a sense of a reasonable prospect for success because of their \ncommitment and also because of the nature of the problem we face.\n  Plan Colombia has many different aspects. First, it focuses on not \nonly military operations. It focuses on the peace process, which is \nongoing in Colombia today. President Pastrana, when he was elected, was \nelected on a plank that called for sincere and serious negotiations \nwith the guerrilla forces. He has instituted such negotiations. In \nfact, what has happened in Colombia is that he had dedicated an area, \napproximately outlined by this blue, in the hinterlands of Colombia, \nwhich is a DMZ area, controlled by FARC, the principle guerrilla group. \nThis peace process is important.\n  This plan is also an attempt to provide alternate development efforts \nfor the peasants and the cultivators in a region where coca was being \ncultivated. This plan calls not only for military operations but also \ncalls for heightened sensitivity to peace, a commitment and a \ncontribution to economic development. The United States share is just a \nfraction of what the Colombian Government has committed to this effort \nfor economic development and for ways to have alternatives to the coca \ncultivation.\n  Also, and quite rightly, the plan calls for reform of the justice \nsystem and protection of human rights, because, frankly, one of the \nmost feeble institutions within Colombia, and this accounts for many of \ntheir problems, is the justice system and the penal system that is not \nresponsive to efficient, fair, and appropriate justice. Here, too, Plan \nColombia, will call for a reform and renewal of those institutions, \nwhich are so important.\n  Then part of it, of course, is a military component. Without security \nin these areas, in these areas we have talked about--without security \nin these areas, there will be no way in which we can effectively \nconduct--``we,'' meaning the Government of Colombia and its \ninternational partners--can conduct the kind of economic development \nand alternative development that is necessary for long-term stability.\n  Here is another map that focuses clearly on Colombia alone. Here are \nthe regions where the production is significant, Putumayo and Caqueta, \nthese provinces. Here in the pink is the zone controlled by FARC. You \ncan see it really is in between major production areas.\n  In order to get into these areas, in order to provide the kind of \neconomic development that is necessary, there has to be, first, \nsecurity, and, because of the nature of the armed combatants in the \narea, that calls for military assistance.\n  This is a big part but not the only part of Plan Colombia. Within the \ncontext of Plan Colombia, there are basically two significant \ncomponents militarily: first, the training of counternarcotics troops, \nand, second, the provision of helicopters for their mobility, because \nwithout helicopters you really cannot be effective in this region.\n  The training has already been finished for the 1st Battalion and they \nare in Tres Esquinas. The second is up here in Larandia. They are \nawaiting our approval so American special forces troops can conduct the \ntraining. Without helicopters, however, none of these trained troops \ncan effectively get to where the cultivation is taking place, where the \nclandestine laboratories are located, where they must go in order to \nupset and defeat the drug lords in this part of Colombia. So it is very \ncritical we move today with dispatch with this legislation, and move \nforward to allow the military plan to go forward as well as to provide \nthe basis for later alternative development.\n  Many legitimate concerns have been raised with respect to the program \nthat is being presented within this legislation. First of significance, \none we should all be very concerned about, is human rights. There is no \nway we want to be involved in an operation that is not going to \nemphasize the appropriate treatment of human rights, not only because \nthat is the right thing to do but because in the long run that is the \nmost effective way to win away any type of support for drug eradication \nand to build respect for the legitimate institutions of government in \nColombia.\n  We are aided in this effort by provisions that already have been \nincluded under the direction of Senator Leahy. Essentially, under the \nLeahy provisions, units that receive assistance and training from the \nUnited States cannot receive that training unless an individual who \nfaces any type of credible human rights violation has either been \nremoved or appropriate justice has been rendered to that individual. In \na practical sense, this means all the troops who are going to be \ntrained are vetted for human rights abuses. And all of them must pass.\n  Also, the Minister of Defense of Colombia must, every 6 months, \nreport on the process of bringing to justice those individuals who have \nbeen accused of human rights violations. As of today, both of the \ncounternarcotics battalions have been vetted--the 1st Battalion and the \n2nd Battalion. Also, other units of the Colombian Army have been \nvetted. In order to receive our training, these units must receive this \nvetting. And it has already had a positive effect. But rest assured, \nthis is a constant struggle and we must insist and ensure that this \nhuman rights perspective is one that is not lost in our efforts to aid \nColombia.\n\n  There is another point that I think is important to make. There have \nbeen many suggestions that the greatest human rights violation that the \nColombian Army engages in is passive and active cooperation with armed \nmilitias, self-defense forces, or paramilitaries as they are called--\nthe perception that they are really in cahoots with vigilante groups \nthat are\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nout to destroy not only leftist rebels, but anyone who seeks to express \nthemselves or ask for their rights in Colombia. That has been the \nhistory. But at least on the surface, things are changing.\n  One example of that is this particular section of last week's major \npaper in Bogata, Colombia. This is an advertisement that was taken out \nby the military. Essentially it says that 785 families will not \ncelebrate Father's Day. Then it lists the victims of the violence in \nColombia. But I think it is significant to note that they clearly point \nout the violence that is the result of guerrilla, leftist activity, and \nthe violence that is the result of what they determine are \n``autodefensas,'' militias, self-defense forces. This is a result, I \nbelieve, also based on my conversations, that the military authorities \nin Colombia are getting the message. They are getting the message that \nthere is no way we will tolerate alliances with paramilitary forces who \nare trying to subvert our emphasis on human rights. I think this is \ndiscouraging, in the sense that it is a horrible litany of lost souls, \nbut it is also important to note that at least the military is trying \nto address the issue in an evenhanded way, the violence that both sides \nare doing to the fabric of peace in Colombia.\n  There is a situation here on human rights which is serious and in \nwhich the military is, for the first time I believe, taking this \nresponsibility very seriously. There has been vetting of these military \nunits. We are objecting to any type of training that would go to units \ncontaining individuals who have serious human rights violations.\n  There is also a high level of support for the effort to improve the \nhuman rights position in the Colombian Army, both the Defense Minister, \nGeneral Tapias, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and at the \ntactical level in Tres Esquinas, General Montoya. These individuals \nrecognize that the continued cooperation and collaboration with the \nUnited States rests upon sincere and effective efforts to provide \neffective human rights training and effective human rights behavior in \nthe Colombian military.\n  There is another aspect of concern that has been raised by some of my \ncolleagues with respect to operations in Colombia, and that is the \nperception that the elites of Colombia are not actively involved in \nthis struggle. It is most significantly reflected in constitutional \nprovisions that prevent graduates of high school from being sent into \ncombat, where nongraduates can be drafted and sent into combat. This is \nan issue which is both symbolic and substantive, too.\n\n  Our discussions with the Minister of Defense suggest they are also \nrecognizing this issue; that they are consciously moving to \nprofessionalize their force by replacing draftees with professional \nsoldiers; and they are also proposing, according to the Defense \nMinister, legislation within this session of the Colombian Congress \nthat will attempt to prevent this discrimination in favor of high \nschool graduates and against non-high school graduates. It does \nrepresent, once again, a perception on the part of the Colombian \nauthorities that they must not only protect human rights, but they must \nbe fully committed to this struggle in order to receive the support of \nthe United States.\n  There is another criticism that has been lodged by some of my \ncolleagues, and that is that this is just another entre into an \nunwinnable military quagmire, like Vietnam. There are many lessons to \nbe drawn from Vietnam. One lesson is that we cannot fight and should \nnot fight someone else's battle if they do not have the will to do it \nthemselves.\n  In this particular situation, Colombia is unlike Vietnam because the \nColombian forces are asking for our help in terms of training, in terms \nof equipment, but not our troops. They recognize they must do that \nthemselves. Also, their history suggests they have in the past done \nprecisely that. They wanted our training for their police, equipment \nfor their police, intelligence reports for their police, but they went \nafter the cartels themselves. It was their responsibility. They carried \nit out successfully.\n  The other difference between Vietnam and the situation in Colombia is \nthat our focus is on drugs. Our focus is on supporting Colombian \nmilitary authorities to provide the security so that police authorities \ncan destroy labs and destroy coca fields. That is a lot different from \ntrying to win the hearts and minds, to win the political allegiance of \na population, as we were by default forced to attempt in Vietnam.\n  Winning the political allegiance of the people of Colombia is \nstrictly and only the function and responsibility of the Colombian \nGovernment. That is why President Pastrana's peace plan represents a \nsincere effort to do just that. It is their plan, their peace plan. Our \neffort should rightfully be restricted, and is restricted, to the war \non drugs.\n  Our role is also limited operationally because, as I mentioned \nbefore, we are providing equipment, we are providing trainers, and we \nare providing intelligence, but intelligence related only to \ncounternarcotics operations. Again, this is very similar to what we did \nwith the Colombian national police in their successful effort to \ndestroy the cartel.\n  One cannot totally dismiss history. I believe we have to be very \ncareful and cautious so that these steps--appropriate steps and limited \nsteps--do not lead to something more. Part of this debate then should \nbe to not only reassure the American public that what we are doing is \nappropriate, but also that we will continue to be vigilant so that any \ncommitment we make to Colombia will be limited and will strictly be a \nfunction of their capacity and their willingness to fight their own \nfight and not unwittingly involve Americans directly in that fight.\n  There are some other differences between Colombia and those who \nsuggest the Vietnam analogy. First of all, this is an insurgency \nwithout any significant foreign support. With the demise of Castro as a \npotent revolutionary force in Latin America, with the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, this is not a situation where there are indigenous forces \nsupported by outside powers. In fact, the support the guerrillas on the \nleft and the paramilitary on the right are deriving is from their \nparticipation in the drug trade. There is no great popular support \nabroad for the leftist or for the rightist forces who are guerrillas or \nparamilitaries. Public opinion polls suggest they have very limited \nappeal.\n\n  Colombia is a country with strong democratic traditions. It has \nregular elections. Power transfers peacefully. It is a market economy, \nuntil recently a market economy that did very well. For all these \nreasons, I think again we should be watchful, but the analogy to \nVietnam at this juncture fails.\n  Let's also look ahead. There are consequences to our operations in \nColombia. First of all, if there is success in Colombia, we should not \nbe surprised that the level of violence will increase because these \nguerrillas and paramilitary forces depend upon support from somewhere. \nIf they cannot sell drugs--we hope they will not be able to sell \ndrugs--they will return to their old ways--kidnapping, extortion, et \ncetera. We have to recognize, ironically, if the drug war is \nsuccessful, we must see escalating levels of violence.\n  The Colombians recognize that, but they are still willing to pay the \nprice, fight the fight, and destroy narcotics. We have to recognize the \narmed opponents, FARC and others, are well off. They will resist \nprobably, and they will resist with sophisticated weapons and \ntechnology they have acquired through their contributions to their drug \ntactics.\n  There is another consequence that might develop if this plan is \napproved and funds provided to Colombia. That is, if these guerrilla \nand paramilitary units are deprived of their resources from the drug \ntrade to continue their operations, there will, I think, be more \npressure for the peace settlement, more willingness on the part of \nthese combatants to come to the table and try to work out an \narrangement so that decisions in Colombia are decided peacefully and \nnot through armed conflict, as it has been so long and so often in that \ncountry.\n  There is another aspect, of course, that would be very helpful to the \npeace settlements there, and that would be whether the United States \ncould suppress its voracious appetite for cocaine. That would go a long \nway to assist Colombia in being a more peaceful and tranquil society.\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n  So all of our efforts, not only to disrupt production in Colombia and \nelsewhere, but also to suppress demand here in the United States would, \nI think, be helpful.\n  But this particular plan, if it works--and there is a reasonable \nprobability that it will work--could materially and, I hope, \neffectively lead to sincere and renewed peace discussions within \nColombia.\n  There is also a consequence for failure if we fail to approve the \nresources or if the plan fails for other reasons. At least one result \nwould be that President Pastrana, and his government, in the middle of \nthe process, would likely also fail. That could lead to several \nconsequences.\n  First, he could be replaced by someone who is less amenable to the \npeace process. Given the tides of violence in Colombia, there could be \na resurgence or the surfacing of an authoritarian figure who would be \nmuch less sensitive to the peace process.\n  Another possibility would be a recurrence of what happened in a \nprevious administration under President Samper, where, effectively, the \nPresident of Colombia was subverted by narcotraffickers, by drug money, \nand the country was close to falling under the sway of narcotics \ndealers rather than the elected representatives of the people of \nColombia. So there are consequences with which we must wrestle.\n  All in all, our most promising option is to support this bill and \nsupport Plan Colombia. To do nothing renders a severe psychological \nblow to the people of Colombia and to the administration of President \nPastrana, who is committed not only to fighting the drug war, but also \nwaging a peace process in negotiations with the insurgents.\n  I think we ultimately have to conclude that our best course of action \nis to provide the kind of support that is outlined in this legislation, \nsupport that goes to the military aspects that have been created by the \ncollision of the cocaine cultivation in the hinterlands, where armed \nbands roam and derive profit from coca production, together with a \nbalanced approach that emphasizes economic development, particularly \nalternative development for the campesinos, the peasants, that \nstrengthens the governance of Colombia, with particular emphasis on the \njudicial system and the penal system.\n  This comprehensive approach, representing about $1.6 billion in \nAmerican resources, about $4 billion of Colombian resources, and \nhopefully contributions from other countries around the world, is, I \nbelieve, at this point the best hope of significantly undercutting drug \nproduction in Colombia, reducing the flow of cocaine into the United \nStates, making our streets safer, and giving Colombia a chance to move \nto a peaceful, stable, civil society, which has alluded them for many \nyears.\n  With that, Mr. President, I conclude my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5547-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I think we all agree how important it is \nfor our young people to understand the history of our nation and how \nthe events of the past have helped to shape our country today and will \ncontinue to shape it in the future.\n  On August 3, 1949, Congress designated June 14 as Flag Day. Last \nweek, a Dallas Morning News editorial reminded us of the origins and \nmeaning of this national day of commemoration. Flag Day was established \nto ensure that each year on that day we recall our nation's proud \nhistory and its role as a symbol of freedom and democracy to our \ncitizens and to people around the world fighting for justice. I was \nmuch surprised to discover that this editorial, written with great \nwisdom and eloquence, was penned by Elizabeth McGarr, an intern at the \nDallas Morning News in her first week with the newspaper.\n  America is a diverse and culturally rich country, but as Elizabeth \npoints out in her editorial, we are all able to unite around the flag \nand celebrate our commitment to the ideals embodied in the Declaration \nof Independence: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth, \nwho has just graduated from the Hockaday School in Dallas and will \nattend the University of Texas in the fall, is an outstanding role \nmodel for her peers and every American.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth McGarr's editorial be entered \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, June 14, 2000]\n\n        Flag Day: Celebration Has Evolved Over Nation's History\n\n       On June 14, 1777, almost a year after the Declaration of \n     Independence was signed, the Continental Congress proposed \n     that we should display our own flag instead of flying the \n     British Union Jack. Our own national flag. One that would \n     symbolize the life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that \n     the Founders emphasized in the Declaration of Independence. \n     One that would represent America through battles foreign and \n     domestic, through victories and defeats.\n       Each year on June 14, on Flag Day, we celebrate the \n     ``birthday'' of our nation's flag.\n       On the 100th anniversary, in 1877, Old Glory flew outside \n     every government building to honor the adoption of a national \n     flag. Philadelphia observed the first official Flag Day in \n     1893, and New York followed suit in 1897. In 1916, President \n     Wilson proclaimed June 14 National Flag Day, and some states \n     and communities did celebrate this anniversary of the Flag \n     Resolution of 1777. Yet it wasn't until 1949 that President \n     Harry S. Truman finally authorized June 14 as Flag Day \n     nationwide.\n       The American flag is one of the most complex flags to make, \n     as evidenced by the 64 pieces of fabric needed to put it \n     together. Its red, white, and blue parts stand for courage, \n     purity and justice, respectively.\n       But on Flag Day, we celebrate more than the colorful cloth. \n     We celebrate our struggles, trials, travails and victories \n     from the Halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli. And \n     most important, America celebrates all that the country has \n     accomplished and all that it can achieve with a positive \n     attitude and an optimistic spirit.\n       Often concerned with political correctness or societal \n     standards, we too quickly judge people on the basis of skin \n     color, religion or background. In truth, we are more alike \n     than we are different. Is there a more united scene than a \n     crowd of people at a baseball game removing their hats for \n     ``The Star Spangled Banner,'' or schoolchildren placing their \n     hands over their hearts to recite the Pledge of Allegiance? \n     Where the Stars and Stripes is concerned, we are as united as \n     can be, and on this June 14, we celebrate our devotion to \n     country and the patriotic unity that arises when witnessing \n     Old Glory wave in the wind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5547-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5547-S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXPLANATION OF VOTES--S. 2549\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday a delayed flight due to weather \nand the closing of flights through Chicago caused me to miss votes on \nthe Murray Amendment (No. 3252), the Hatch Amendment (No. 3473) and the \nKennedy Amendment (No. 3473) to S. 2549 the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Bill. I would like to state for the record what my votes \nwould have been had I been able to make those votes.\n\n\n                       murray amendment no. 3252\n\n  Had I been present, I would have voted to table the Murray amendment. \nI do not believe we should turn our military medical facilities into \nabortion clinics. The Senate rejected this amendment last year, and I \nsee no reason why the Senate should change its position.\n  Though military facility abortion advocates try to present the \nsituation as otherwise, it is not the case that women in the military \nare deprived of the option of getting an abortion, if they chose to \nhave one. They are simply not able to obtain an abortion in a military \nfacility as an elective procedure.\n  Furthermore, as Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed \nServices Committee, I know our military medical resources are spread \ntoo thin as things are. Not only is allowing abortions in military \nmedical facilities an insult to many of the taxpayers who have paid for \nthose facilities, it forces the hospitals to divert resources that \ncould have been used for preserving life to do the opposite. This \namendment does nothing but support an agenda that promotes abortion. To \nthat I am opposed.\n\n\n                        hatch amendment no. 3474\n\n  I realize that many in the Senate viewed the Hatch Amendment as a \nviable alternative to the Kennedy Amendment on hate crimes.\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\n  As with the Kennedy Amendment, the Hatch Amendment gives statutory \ncredence to creating a special class of protections for crimes \ncommitted against a behavior driven lifestyle. To place sexual \norientation on par with race, color, gender, religion, and national \norigin is simply a terrible precedent for the Senate to be setting.\n  Before anyone accuses me of supporting violence directed against any \nparticular person or group of persons, let me say clearly, I \nunequivocally oppose violence against anyone. Any crime of violence is \na hate crime and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Utah's efforts to provide what he sees \nas an alternative to what I think we would both agree is a worse piece \nof legislation. However, had I been present, I would have opposed his \namendment.\n  While some may say that my NAY vote on the Hatch Amendment would have \nchanged the outcome, the fact is this issue will be rewritten during \nconference.\n\n\n                       kennedy amendment no. 3473\n\n  I would have voted against the Kennedy amendment on hate crimes \nbecause I do not believe it is Constitutional, nor do I think it is \ngood policy.\n  As with the Hatch Amendment, to place sexual orientation on an equal \nlevel with race, color, gender, religion, and national origin is wrong.\n  Again, I unequivocally oppose violence against anyone. Any crime of \nviolence is a hate crime and must be punished to the fullest extent of \nthe law.\n  As a conferee on the Department of Defense Authorization bill, I will \nwork vigorously to drop this language from the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5548-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR NATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Tony Snow wrote an editorial in the \nWashington Times. In this editorial he captures the very essence of \nservice to this Nation by those who have worn the uniform of our Nation \nthroughout its history.\n  This weekend, I and others will be attending ceremonies in \nrecognition of those who served in the Korean war. A few days ago, the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, the Presiding Officer, I, and other \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives attended a \nmagnificent ceremony in honor of those who served during the Korean \nwar.\n  I was privileged to be in the Marine Corps and served in the 1st \nMarine Airwing for a brief period in Korea as a communications officer. \nI have an indelible memory of the sacrifices of many others, those \nparticularly, not myself included, who had to serve in a position in \nharm's way and paid the ultimate price in life or in many cases in \nlimb, and the suffering of their families.\n  Upon their return home, unlike World War II, in which I served a \nbrief period towards the end, America did not welcome them with open \narms. They were returned home from an operation of our military which \nwas indecisive and inconclusive. Those wonderful veterans, these 50-\nsome odd years, at long last deserve the recognition. I think Mr. \nSnow's article captures it exceedingly well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the article to which I \nreferred.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 28, 2000]\n\n                             (By Tony Snow)\n\n       On certain spring mornings, warm winds coax fog from the \n     waters of the Potomac River. Clouds rise in whisps from the \n     banks and march up nearby hillsides, sometimes as high as the \n     quiet hills of Arlington National Cemetery.\n       At those times, the nation's most famous burying ground \n     takes on an ethereal look, its plain white grave markers \n     rising not from earth, but cloud. And on these rare mornings, \n     dewy and warm, one cannot help but feel a sense of sacred \n     awe, looking at the headstones, with the Potomac and the \n     nation's capital spread out below.\n       Most of the men and women who rest here were of minor \n     consequence as far as the history is concerned. They did not \n     serve as presidents, or prelates, or executors of high \n     office. They did not invent great new machines or conquer \n     disease. Many died before they were old enough to make an \n     enduring mark on the world.\n       Yet, they all earned their place among generals and \n     presidents because they did something few of us have done. \n     They marched willingly into battle for the sake of our \n     country.\n       This kind of heroism is becoming increasingly unfamiliar to \n     us. We have not fought an all-out war in a quarter-century, \n     and the nation has not united behind its military in more \n     than 50 years. The draft expired long ago, and the bulk of \n     our young no longer consider service as a career or even as \n     an occupational way-station.\n       Furthermore, technology has brought us the possibility of \n     ``bloodless'' wars, such as the Kosovo incursion--operations \n     in which we kill others from afar, while denying enemies the \n     chance to kill our own. We no longer speak of ``patriotic \n     gore'' or assume we pay for freedom with blood and treasure. \n     For that reason, we don't appreciate fully the lives and \n     deaths of those we commemorate on Memorial Day.\n       But we owe it to ourselves to try. The rows of markers at \n     Arlington and other national cemeteries serve as stark \n     reminders that evil lives and thrives in the world. Humans \n     instituted and maintained slavery for centuries, and \n     Americans tried to maintain discrimination through force of \n     terror for nearly a century after the Civil War. Our fellow \n     humans venerated such butchers as Adolf Hitler and Josef \n     Stalin--treating them as living gods and worshipping them as \n     men of surprising vision and virtue.\n       It has become unfashionable to talk in stark terms of good \n     and evil. We like to pretend they are antediluvian categories \n     that have given way to ``subtler'' distinctions--between \n     justice and injustice, for instance, or between fairness or \n     unfairness. But our own wooziness on matters of morality does \n     not change the fact that good and evil exist--and that most \n     evils flourish under the care of men and women who claim to \n     be doing good.\n       The hills of Arlington attest to this.\n       They tell us more. America became a superpower less than a \n     century ago. We are relatively inexperienced at the business \n     of maintaining peace. But history does disclose a few lessons \n     about how to avoid trouble. The most important is Teddy \n     Roosevelt's injunction that we carry a big stick.\n       Potential enemies don't care much about our prosperity. \n     Many despise it. Would-be assailants worry instead about \n     whether we have the might and will to thrash those who attack \n     us. In the years following the First World War, we converted \n     our swords into plowshares. A grinding depression struck the \n     nation, leaving us both weak and poor--and this combination \n     of unpreparedness and irresolution emboldened the Japanese to \n     bomb Pearl Harbor.\n       Today, we devote less of our federal budget to national \n     defense than we did on the eve of that attack. The president \n     and his party actively have opposed the development of \n     defenses that could protect us against such likely threats as \n     random ballistic-missile attacks. They sneer at strategic \n     defense--not because they have arguments against it, but \n     because they despise the fact that Ronald Reagan thought of \n     it first. And we seem scarcely interested in new forms of \n     warfare--technological espionage and the potential for \n     devastating bio-weapons.\n       Military history teaches us an important lesson about such \n     attitudes. When great powers refuse to keep up with the \n     latest developments in technology, they fall. The best \n     example of the phenomenon took place centuries ago, when \n     Mongol hordes overran China. The attackers prevailed because \n     they moved more swiftly and nimbly on the battlefields. They \n     had adopted the very latest innovation--stirrups on saddles.\n       Memorial Day delivers an important lesson to those who will \n     hear: When nations drop their guard or ignore the reality of \n     evil, innocent people die.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough June 19, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \nthe 2001 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 290), which \nreplaced the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. \n68).\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $2.3 billion in budget authority and by $6.8 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $28 million below the revenue floor in 2000.\n  Since my last report, dated March 8, 2000, in addition to the changes \nin\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nbudget authority, outlays, and revenues from adopting H. Con. Res. 290, \nthe Congress has cleared, and the President has signed, the Wendell H. \nFord Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (P.L. 106-\n181) and the Trade amd Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-200). The \nCongress has also cleared for the President's signature the \nAgricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 2559). This action has \nchanged the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2000.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an opinion piece \nin the June 20 edition of the Washington Post written by Mr. Milan \nPanic, former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and an American citizen.\n  In this article, Mr. Panic argues for getting Russian President Putin \nto agree to offer Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic asylum, in a \ndeal approved by the international community.\n  This is an appalling idea whose time, thank heavens, has not come. At \nleast it would appear so, since it has been widely reported that at \ntheir recent summit meeting Putin told President Clinton that Miami \nseemed to be as good a place for Milosevic as Moscow.\n  President Putin may not be turning out to be a model democrat, but no \none has accused him of being dumb. He obviously feels that having \nMilosevic enlivening the Moscow scene would not exactly burnish his own \ncredentials.\n  All kidding aside, the idea of blithely pronouncing all of our \nefforts in the former Yugoslavia over the last decade a hopeless \nfailure and then letting the architect of the carnage skip off with his \nfamily to exile is both morally reprehensible and politically \ncatastrophic.\n  The international community has labored long and hard to set up the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague, \nand then to get it up and running.\n  Over the past year the number of individuals indicted for alleged war \ncrimes in custody has risen dramatically. Why should we totally \nundercut the Hague Tribunal, just when it is hitting its stride?\n  Why should we undercut the new, reformist government in Croatia, \nwhich has reversed the obstructionist course of the late strongman \nTudjman and has begun cooperating with the Hague? If Milosevic is given \na suspension of prosecution, then why shouldn't all the Croats in \ncustody get the same deal?\n  In arguing against undercutting the Hague Tribunal, I do not wish to \nimply that it has been a complete success. What is missing from the \njail cells in the Hague, of course, are the really big fish--the chief \nvillains of the massive slaughter in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.\n  I am, of course, talking about Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and, \nabove all, the boss of all bosses Slobodan Milosevic. That's the point! \nTo make this promising international effort work we need to do \nprecisely the opposite from granting amnesty to public enemy number-\none. We need to add him to the growing list of indicted suspects in \ndetention.\n  The Panic op-ed argues that we won't be able to capture Milosevic. In \nthe short run, we probably won't. But as\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\nthe vice tightens on Milosevic's cronies and makes it clear to them \nthat they will have absolutely no future in a Milosevic-run state, I \nthink it may occur to them to serve Slobo up on a platter to the Hague.\n  We have all learned not to make rash predictions about when Milosevic \nwill fall from power, and I won't fail into that trap today. But the \nsigns of increasing discontent are everywhere--from the new student-\nrun, grassroots resistance movement called Otpor to the rash of \ngangland style assassinations and assassination attempts among \nMilosevic's retinue and allies.\n  So while I can't say when Milosevic will fall, fall he will. And it \nwill be much better, both for Serbia and for the international \ncommunity, if he falls as a result of pressure from his own people, \nrather than from some sordid deal cooked up abroad.\n  In a larger sense, why should we nip a promising international \njudicial effort in the bud in a misguided attempt to relieve the Serbs, \nin the worst possible way, of a problem that they spawned and that they \nhave the primary responsibility to rectify?\n  Somehow the curse of Milosevic is to be lifted from the Serbian \npeople by a foreign deus ex machina, in this case the good Russian \ntsar. And then, in return for having graciously allowed their dictator \nto depart, the Serbian people would receive and end to sanctions from \nthe international community.\n  Give me a break. Even if we could persuade Putin to go against his \nself-interest--a total impossibility, of course--such a deal would only \nfuel the Serbs' oft-noted passion for blaming others for misfortunes \nthat they themselves have created. Why else would the foreigners have \ngotten rid of Milosevic if they hadn't somehow been responsible for him \nin the first place?\n  And what are we to make of the article's nice plan that part of the \ndeal would be free and fair elections in Serbia under international \nsupervision? I can just imagine what the other war criminals in the \nYugoslav and Serbian governments would think of that idea!\n  The most likely result of an arranged Milosevic departure would be \nanother set of gangsters, not democrats elected by universal suffrage. \nThe Panic op-ed is entitled ``Exit Milosevic.'' It might just as well \nbe entitled ``Enter Seselj''--that is, Vojislav Seselj, the fascist \nDeputy Prime Minister of Serbia. Mr. Panic's naivete gives us a pretty \ngood clue as to why Milosevic so easily outmaneuvered him in 1993.\n  Morality, Serbian politics, and the Hague Tribunal aside, granting \nasylum to Milosevic would be a political disaster for the United States \nand for NATO.\n  Last year President Clinton had a difficult time in rounding up \nsupport within NATO's nineteen members for Operation Allied Force, and \nthen sustaining that support until Milosevic's troops and \nparamilitaries were forced out of Kosovo. But he skillfully managed to \ndo it, and alliance unity was preserved.\n  Then we got our European allies and others to assume 85 percent of \nthe burden of KFOR in Kosovo and also to fund the vast majority of the \ncost of the Stability Pact for South East Europe.\n  Now, after pardoning Milosevic, I suppose we could turn to our \nEuropean allies and say, ``incidentally, friends, we really didn't need \nto fight that pesky, little air war after all. We could have just \nbought off old Slobo last year and sent him packing. But please don't \nignore fulfilling the commitments you made to the Defense Capabilities \nInitiative at the Washington NATO Summit. We really do need an alliance \nwith teeth, so you still have to spend a lot to upgrade your forces. \nDon't worry, though. The Milosevic buyout was just a one-time event. \nNothing like that will happen again. NATO is really not in the amnesty \nbusiness. It's just that the Serbs needed us to take the monkey off \ntheir back, and we're sure that Slobo's successors will now choose to \ncooperate with us.''\n  Pardon my sarcasm, Mr. President, but this amnesty idea is just too \npolitically naive to believe.\n  The Panic article also reveals an impatience as American as apple \npie. We all want a quick fix. But, my friends, there are few quick \nfixes in life that have any permanence, and trying to set the Balkans \nright by way of shortcuts certainly isn't one of them.\n  To have any chance of creating a modicum of stability in the former \nYugoslavia and elsewhere in the region, solutions must be largely home-\ngrown, if under the security umbrella provided by NATO.\n  So, let's consign the Panic op-ed to sophomore political science \nseminars and think-tank luncheons--but not to serious consideration by \nour Government.\n  Let's get on with the vital, if prosaic, business of rebuilding \nBosnia and Kosovo and supporting the opposition in Serbia through a \nvariety of programs, which are in place, ongoing, and which, in time, I \nbelieve, will succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5550-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate debated an issue \nof critical importance--preventing hate crimes. Hate crimes are attacks \non our very culture. What makes the United States different from places \nsuch as the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, or the Middle East, \ncivilizations which are torn apart by prejudice and hatred, is our \nacceptance of diversity. The image of the United States as a melting \npot, where diversity flourishes, is shattered by news stories of hate \nrelated violence. Hate crimes are crimes of intimidation and violence, \nin which a person's civil rights are threatened because of prejudice.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor, does not create a new law, nor does it federalize more \ncrimes. Rather, it clarifies a law that has been on the books for over \nthirty years. Federal hate crimes protections were established as part \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The law sets up a backstop for states \nthat cannot adequately prosecute these hate-based crimes. However, the \ncurrent law's strict dual intent requirement that the defendant acted \nbecause of the victim's race, religion, or ethnicity and because the \nvictim was enjoying or exercising a federally protected right, such as \nvoting or attending public school, is far too constricting. Even the \nheinous dragging death of James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, Texas did not \nqualify under current law as a federal hate crime. Never since the \nstatute was enacted have there been more than 10 prosecutions for hate \ncrimes in a year.\n  The Smith-Kennedy amendment has two major components. First, it \nexpands individuals covered by hate crimes to include sexual \norientation, gender, and disability. Second, it eliminates constraints \nthat make the current law ineffective. The federal government, with the \napproval of a state's Attorney General, would be empowered to prosecute \ncrimes that cause death or bodily injury ``because of the actual or \nperceived race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, \ngender, or disability'' of the victim. According to FBI statistics, in \n1996, almost two-thirds of the reported hate crimes were due to race, \nwhile 12% were based on sexual orientation. It is important that \nprotection from hate crimes be extended to all of America's citizens.\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\n  The Supreme Court has already signaled the constitutionality of hate \ncrime statutes. In Wisconsin v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court unanimously \nupheld the constitutional right of states to enact hate crimes \nstatutes. I believe that it is now time for Congress to act.\n  Mr. President, I cosponsored the Hate Crimes Prevention Act because \nit was the right thing to do. The issue here is civil rights, and as a \nnation we went a long way in the last century toward assuring that the \ncivil rights of ALL Americans were not infringed upon. Let's start this \nnew century with another step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5551-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LEAHY AMENDMENT ON FUNDING FOR TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to be sure there is no \nmisunderstanding about my purpose in offering this amendment, which \nwould reduce funding in the bill by a total of $21 million for programs \nto combat tuberculosis and malaria. The funding for these activities \nwas included at my request, and I want to express my appreciation to \nChairman McConnell for that.\n  Like every Senator, I would like to see the highest possible levels \nof funding to combat these two dreaded diseases, which cause \nimmeasurable suffering in developing countries. I have worked to do \nthat for several years, and I fully intend to continue doing so. If our \nFY01 budget allocation would permit it, I would recommend higher \nfunding for global health programs, including to combat TB and malaria.\n  However, we are forced to make excruciating choices.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again draw \nattention to the continuing war in Chechnya and to urge the \nAdministration to include Chechnya high on the agenda at next months G-\n7 summit.\n  Colleagues, last Wednesday I met with Mr. II-yas AK-ma-dov who was \nhere to present a peace proposal on behalf of the Chechen people. This \npeace proposal calls for the immediate introduction of a formal cease-\nfire, the formation of an international commission to investigate \nallegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict, and the start \nof political negotiations through the mediation of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. Mr. Ak-ma-dov relayed to me his \nserious concern at the desperation of the people in Chechnya, and noted \nthat many of the recent suicide attacks we have heard about are a \ndirect result of that desperation.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, we must seize every opportunity, including \nthe upcoming G-7 summit, to continue to relay our serious concerns with \nthe intransigence of the Russian Federation to acknowledge the concerns \nof the international community. The G-7 summit, which became the G-8 \nwith the inclusion of the Russian Federation, is an association of \ndemocratic societies with advanced economies. Although Russia is not \nyet a liberal democracy or an advanced economy, it was invited to take \npart in this summit in encourage its democratic evolution. Today as I \nwatch Russia continue to deny international human rights monitors \naccess to Chechnya in defiance of the international community, I must \nquestion that evoluation.\n  In February this body passed Rsolution 262 which called on President \nPutin to allow international monitors immediate, full, and unimpeded \naccess into and around Chechnya to report on the situation there and to \ninvestigate alleged atrocities and war crimes. In March, the Council of \nEurope Parliamentary Assembly suspended the voting rights of Russia due \nto the large number of reports of human rights violations in Chechnya. \nAnd Mr. President, at the 56th Session of the U.N. Commission on Human \nRights last April, the Commission harshly criticized the Russian \nmilitary's behavior in Chechnya. The Commission approved a Resolution \ncalling on the Russian government to establish a commission of inquiry \ninto human rights abuses in Chechnya and mandating visits to Chechnya \nby U.N. special envoys on torture, political killings, and violence \nagainst women. Yet, despite all this condemnation, Russia continues to \nignore our requests.\n\n  The war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 left over 80,000 civilians dead. \nThe number of deaths of innocent civilians rises daily as the current \nwar continues. This is due not only to fighting, but to the inability \nof international organizations to easily distribute much needed \nhumanitarian aid. A recent report from the U.N. High Commission on \nRefugees noted that elderly and sick people in the capital Grozny have \ndifficulty reaching soup kitchens which are scattered throughout the \ncity due to continued fighting. Russia has closed investigations into \nalleged human rights abuses by Russian soldiers citing a lack of \nevidence, and none of the U.N. mandated special envoys to Chechnya have \nbeen given access to the area. Just three weeks ago customs officials \nin Moscow confiscated an Amnesty International report on human rights \nviolations in Chechnya.\n  Mr. President, this body and the international community has \nconsistently spoken out demanding the Russian government allow into \nChechnya international human rights monitors. It is important that we \nnot turn silent now.\n  In her address to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March, \nSecretary Albright said that no nation should feel threatened by the \nCommission's work since its task is to support the right of people \neverywhere to control their own destinies, and that the Commission asks \nonly that its members play by global rules. Mr. President, colleagues, \nthe United States must seize the opportunity of next month's G-7 summit \nin Japan to once again demand that Russia play by these rules. Our \nleadership within the G-7 and in the international community deserves \nno less. The people of Chechnya deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I had a chance to meet with the Foreign Minister from \nChechnya last week. I promised him that, as a Senator, I would speak \nout on the floor about what is happening in Chechnya. Just to \nsummarize, the Foreign Minister came here with a proposal. It is a \nproposal that really calls for a cease-fire, calls for a political \nsettlement, calls for international observers to be there.\n  What I want to say on the floor of the Senate is that this is a \nbrutal war. Many innocent people have been killed. Certainly, some of \nthe Chechans are responsible for the murder of Russians; but, overall, \nwhat we have seen is a tremendous loss of life, the decimation of a \ncountry. I have sent letters to Putin. I have spoken out about this. I \nthink it is a human rights question. I call upon our Government, in \nparticular, to be much more actively involved in trying to bring about \nsome resolution to this conflict.\n  There are entirely too many innocent people paying the price. \nEntirely too many innocent people are losing their lives. I think it is \na role for our Government to push for some kind of a peaceful \nsettlement. I know we need to negotiate with Putin and be in contact \nwith the Russian Government and work with them. I am all for that. I am \nnot at all interested in rekindling a cold war. My father is a Jewish \nimmigrant who fled Russia. But I also believe we should not turn our \ngaze away from what is happening in Chechnya.\n  We ought to make it crystal clear to the Russian Government that the \nwholesale violation of human rights and torture and murder of innocent \npeople is simply not acceptable. The sooner there is some kind of a \npolitical settlement, the better off the people in Chechnya and Russia \nand the world\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\nwill be. I don't believe there is any evidence at all that this \nmilitary campaign is going to work. Violence begets violence. Violence \nis met with violence.\n  I think our Government can play a more positive role than we have \nplayed. For the Senate today, I call on the Secretary of State and \nPresident Clinton to be much more actively involved in trying to bring \nabout a resolution to this conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5552-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NECESSARILY ABSENT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to talk to you \ntoday about the Career and Technical Education Program in Walla Walla, \nWashington. Students in this program are learning skills that are \nhighly important in the working world and will give them a leg up on \nthe competition as they enter the workforce. This program has made a \ntremendous impact on the school's learning environment and also gives \nstudents an incentive to stay in school.\n  Fifteen years ago, the faculty at Walla Walla High School wanted to \ncreate a program in which students would gain practical knowledge to \nsupplement what is learned in the traditional classroom setting. The \nCareer and Technical Education Program, created with the help of grant \nmoney, gives students the opportunity to gain technical skills along \nwith the school's curriculum.\n  For example, students enrolled in anatomy or physiology class can put \ntheir knowledge to work by taking Sports Medicine where they learn \nabout treating sports injuries, CPR and other first aid skills. In \naddition, technology labs have been interwoven into the curriculum to \nteach robotics, flight simulation, and bridge analysis to enhance math \nand physics classes. Through this programs, students can see a direct \nlink between their work in the classroom to a potential job.\n  Gerald Cummins, Director of Career and Technical Education, says the \nCareer and Technical Education Program has drastically improved the \ncollege bound population in Walla Walla over the last fifteen years. \n``Fifteen years ago, there were barely any kids continuing on to the \ncollege level. Now most kids are achieving college credits through our \nprogram before even being accepted into college.''\n  The faculty at Walla Walla High School also has established strong \ncommunication between parents, the school and community members, giving \nstudents a sense of support that will encourage them to continue in \ntheir academic pursuits.\n  Much credit should be given to the vision of the Walla Walla School \nBoard and staff who have worked to ensure high standards of teaching. \nThey have found new ways to improve upon their curriculum and provided \nexcellent opportunities for each student to expand his or her \nhorizons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5552-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO RONALD L. FREELAND, NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE \n            CONFERENCE OF MINORITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated and respected leader in public transportation, Ronald L. \nFreeland, Administrator for the Mass Transit Administration of the \nMaryland Department of Transportation. Ron has recently been chosen to \nbe President of the Board of the National Conference of Minority \nTransportation Officials, COMTO, and I would like to express my \nappreciation for the work he has done for Maryland, and my \ncongratulations and best wishes as he assumes his new leadership \nresponsibilities.\n  Throughout his career, Ron Freeland has demonstrated an unwavering \ncommitment to ensuring quality transportation in Maryland. Since 1997, \nRon has overseen the Mass Transit Administration, MTA, which operates \nthe bus, light rail, Metro, and MARC systems throughout the Baltimore-\nWashington area--systems that provide transportation services to \n355,000 people every day. Prior to his service at MTA, Ron was \nAdministrator of the Motor Vehicle Administration, where he made key \nreforms in that agency's operations, including improvements in the \noperation of the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program. His public \nservice also includes tenure as Director of Operations at MTA, \nmembership on the Board of Directors for the Maryland Transportation \nAuthority, and membership on the Board of the Canton Railroad. Well-\nmaintained highways and reliable transit systems provide safe travel \ndaily for millions of Americans, and I want to commend Ron for his \ndedication to improving transportation services in Maryland. I have \nknown Ron for many years and have had the opportunity to work closely \nwith him on many issues affecting transportation in Maryland. I have \nfound him to be a dedicated public servant and a steadfast ally to the \nfriends of public transportation.\n  In addition to his work for the people of Maryland, Ron has fought \ntirelessly for equality within the transportation community. He is \nabout to assume leadership of the Conference of Minority Transportation \nOfficials, a national organization founded in 1971, which now boasts \nover 2,000 members and over 25 local chapters throughout the United \nStates. Ron has been working with COMTO for almost twenty years, and \nhas demonstrated unyielding devotion to COMTO's dual mission of \nachieving inclusion and upward mobility for minorities and women within \nthe industry, and advocating for citizens and groups who are \nunderserved by existing transportation services. His leadership and \nintegrity in this pursuit inspired the members of COMTO to choose Ron \nas National President--and they could not have made a better choice. I \nam confident that, as President, Ron will inspire his colleagues across \nthe country to dedicate themselves to ensuring minorities and women \nequal access to transportation jobs and services. It is the courage and \nhard work of people like Ron Freeland that will make certain no one is \nleft behind as the transportation industry evolves to meet America's \ngrowing needs in the 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5553-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n                      TRIBUTE TO BERT M. CONCKLIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to a patriot, federal servant, and industry \nleader, Bert M. Concklin. I have worked with him closely for nearly \ntwenty years in his capacity as president of the Professional Services \nCouncil (PSC), as a representative of two of the largest employers in \nVirginia, PSC and Computer Sciences Corporation, and as a driving \ninfluence on numerous advisory panels.\n  After more than eight years with PSC, Bert has accepted the role of \nBusiness Systems Modernization Executive at the Internal Revenue \nService. I admire his courageous willingness to tackle such an obvious \nchallenge and I anticipate that he will, as always, perform exceedingly \nwell. The agency is fortunate to acquire such a talented executive.\n  Throughout his career, Bert has proven himself to be an effective \nleader and an even-handed advocate. The fact that he has been such a \ndynamic leader for the professional and technical services industry, \nwhich is populated by so many of our nation's most innovative names, \nhas in no small way made our jobs in the United States Senate that much \neasier. Those companies represent the very heart of our national \ndefense and I know that Bert's dedication originates in large part from \na love of our country that I share. Perhaps this trait comes from his \ndays at the United States Naval Academy, but I suspect he had it even \nbefore.\n  Bert is no stranger to federal service. During his many years of \nservice with the federal government he has held a number of \ndistinguished positions including, Assistant Secretary and Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration; Deputy Administrator for Policy Evaluation for the \nFederal Energy Administration; Administrator of Price Controls for the \nCost of Living Council; and Director of Information Systems with the \nOffice of Management and Budget. He has also held significant special \nassignments including membership on the FAA Blue Ribbon Advisory \nCommittee.\n  I wish every success to Mr. Concklin as he starts the next chapter of \nhis truly remarkable career and thank him for a job exceedingly well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5553-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DUKES CELEBRATE 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate \nThe Rev. and Mrs. Morgan Dukes of Summerville, S.C. who recently \ncelebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. During the past 50 years, \nMorgan and Marie Dukes have lived throughout South Carolina and in \nWashington, D.C. After Morgan graduated from the Southern Baptist \nSeminary in Louisville, Kentucky, the couple moved to Bath, S.C. where \nMorgan led the congregation at First Baptist Church. He served as \nDirector of Religious Activities at Furman University from 1958-1965 \nand then as pastor of First Baptist Church in Walhalla.\n  In 1970, Morgan and Marie moved to Washington, D.C., where Morgan was \npastor of Brookland Baptist Church and later joined the staff of the \nBaptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. For 15 years Marie worked as \na secretary in the office of the Dean of the College of Engineering at \nthe University of Maryland, College Park. They returned to South \nCarolina in 1990 to assist homeless men at the Star Gospel Mission in \nCharleston, a position from which Morgan retired in 1997. Marie worked \nfor 10 years as a realtor in Summerville.\n  The Dukes have accomplished a great deal in their 50 years of \nmarriage and have enriched many communities in South Carolina and here \nin our nation's capital. Peatsy and I join with their friends and \nfamily, including their children Vicki, Betty Ann and David and \ngranddaughter, Lauren, in celebrating this important milestone in their \nlife together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5553-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALUTING LOUISIANA'S COLLEGE ATHLETES\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nbaseball teams at Louisiana State University, LSU, and the University \nof Louisiana-Lafayette, ULL, the LSU women's track team and all \nLouisiana student-athletes.\n  If there is one thing Louisianians take as seriously as our politics \nand cooking, it is our athletics. In fact, Louisiana has an excellent \ntradition when it comes to producing great athletes. This is easily \ndemonstrated in the number of athletes from Louisiana who have played \nor currently play professional sports.\n  Sports teaches us the importance of teamwork, goal-setting and \ndetermination. It also teaches us to never give up, even when faced \nwith seemingly insurmountable odds.\n  No one has to tell the University of Louisiana-Lafayette's baseball \nteam about perseverance and defying the odds. They had to defeat the \nnation's number one ranked team twice in one day to get to the College \nWorld Series. But once there, they defied expectations by posting a \nrespectable two wins and two losses, and etched the mascot ``Ragin' \nCajuns'' into the vocabulary of every college baseball fan.\n  Teams at LSU have also applied the lessons taught in athletics, as \nwell as Yogi Berra's oft-repeated truism ``it ain't over till it's \nover,'' to become one of the finest athletic programs in the country.\n  The LSU baseball team, after starting the season 6-0, struggled to a \n6-5 record in their first 11 games. But, with the help of tremendous \nsenior leadership, self-confidence and the will to win, LSU finished \nstrong by ending the season with an outstanding 52-17 record and their \nfifth national championship in nine years.\n  And the LSU women's track team is no stranger to dramatic finishes, \neither. Down 46 points on the final day of competition, they scored \njust enough points on a winning performance in the final event to win \ntheir 12th NCAA outdoor championship in 14 years.\n  In all, LSU had one of its finest athletic years ever during the \n1999-2000 season. Outside of these two national titles, a total of 11 \nteams finished in the nation's top 10 in their respective sports.\n  This year's two national championships gives LSU a total of 35 \nnational championships, the most of any school in the Southeastern \nConference. And of the 20 sports LSU sponsors on the varsity level, 14 \nfinished the year in the nation's top 25 and participated in NCAA \nchampionship events.\n  I salute the student-athletes who have helped make Louisiana one of \nthe finest states for collegiate athletics in the country. And I \nespecially congratulate the LSU baseball and women's track teams who \nhave proved once again it isn't how you start the game that matters, \nbut how you finish. It is this value that will transcend the playing \nfield to make Louisiana's student-athletes champions in the biggest \ngame of all--the game of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5553-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5553-S5554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALICE M. McCUE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to pay \ntribute to a well-respected and remarkable public servant, Ms. Alice M. \nMcCue, who has worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional \nOffice in Hartford since 1945. On June 25th, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs will recognize her 55 years of service to our nation's \nveterans, and I want to take a few moments to discuss Alice McCue's \nremarkable career.\n  Alice started working for the VA following her graduation from high \nschool at Mt. St. Joseph Academy in Hartford. She began in 1945 as a \ntypist in the Communications and Records Section, and moved to the \nAdministrative Division in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978, Alice held a \nnumber of different positions, including several years as a clerk in \nthe office of the Chief Attorney. Since that time, Alice has been a \nVeterans Claims Examiner.\n  Alice has been a constant force since her first days of employment. \nHer hard work and dedication to the veterans of Connecticut have earned \nher a number of awards and special accommodations. Alice received five \nSpecial Contribution Awards over the past several years, as well as a \nTime-Off Award in 1995, the same year in which she was the recipient of \na Superior Performance Award.\n  Over the years, Alice was involved in a plethora of activities at the \nVA's Hartford office and became an integral component of every project \nin which she was engaged. In the State Income\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nVerification Match Project, she handled several hundred cases. She also \nworked on the Social Security Unverified Match Project, the Committee \non Waivers and Compromises, and as an Equal Employment Opportunity \ncounselor and Third Party Inquiry Coordinator for the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  Alice's influence at the VA is perhaps most truly reflected by her \ncolleagues' words of praise. They describe her as a dependable, hard-\nworking, and professional employee and friend. She not only treats \nevery case as if it was her own, but she also takes the time to assist \nother adjudicators with their cases. When it comes to training and \nteaching less-experienced employees, Alice is an indispensable asset, \nand many in the Hartford office have benefited from her guidance. Her \nsupervisors further cite her willingness to handle the most complex \ncases as well as her amicable air and trustworthiness which have long \nbolstered office morale and increased the sense of community among the \nemployees.\n  On June 26, 2000, the Hartford regional office of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs will hold a luncheon in honor of Alice, who will \nreceive the Secretary's Service Award at that time. Today, it is my \npleasure to join the Department of Veterans Affairs and the countless \nveterans and their families that Alice McCue has helped over the years, \nin thanking her for her exemplary service and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5554-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:51 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2815.

A bill to clarify the authority of the Secretary of \nAgriculture to establish performance standards for the reduction of \nmicrobiological pathogens in meat and poultry; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    microbiological performance standards clarification act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Microbiological \nPerformance Standards Clarification Act of 2000. Passage of this bill \nis vital because on May 25th, the District Court of the Northern \nDistrict of Texas struck down the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \n(USDA) authority to enforce its Microbiological Performance Standard \nfor Salmonella. The District Court's decision in Supreme Beef v. USDA \n(Supreme) seriously undermines the sweeping food safety changes adopted \nby USDA in its 1996 Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point and Pathogen \nReduction (HACCP) rule.\n  The District Court's decision in Supreme says that USDA does not have \nthe authority to enforce Microbiological Performance Standards for \nreducing viral and bacterial pathogens.\n  The Pathogen Reduction Rule recognized that bacterial and viral \npathogens were the foremost food safety threat in America, responsible \nfor 5,000 deaths and 33 million illnesses. To address the threat of \nfoodborne illness, USDA developed a modern inspection system based on \ntwo fundamental principles.\n  The first was that industry has the primary responsibility to \ndetermine how to produce the safest products possible. Industry had to \nexamine their plants and determine how to control contamination at \nevery step of the food production process, from the moment a product \narrives at their door until the moment it leaves their plant.\n  The second, even more crucial principle was that plants nationwide \nmust reduce levels of dangerous pathogens in meat and poultry products. \nTo ensure the new inspection system accomplished this, USDA developed \nMicrobiological Performance Standards. These standards provide targets \nfor reducing pathogens and require all USDA-inspected facilities to \nmeet them. Facilities failing to meet a standard are shut down until \nthey create a corrective action plan to meet the standard.\n  To date, USDA has only issued one Microbiological Performance \nStandard, for Salmonella. The vast majority of plants in the U.S. have \nbeen able to meet the new standard, so it is clearly workable. In \naddition, USDA reports that Salmonella levels for meat and poultry \nproducts have fallen substantially. The Salmonella standard, therefore, \nhas been successful. The District Court's decision threatens to destroy \nthis success and set our food safety system back years.\n  Congress cannot let a court's unfortunate misinterpretation of USDA's \nauthority undermine our efforts to provide the safest food possible and \nthe strongest food safety system available. Whatever the ultimate \noutcome of the Supreme Beef case, it is intolerable to have so much \nuncertainty about USDA's authority to enforce food safety regulations. \nThe public should not have to worry about whether the products on their \ntable have met food safety standards. This legislation provides the \nnecessary clarification and assurance that if a product bears the USDA \nstamp of approval, it has met all of USDA's food safety requirements.\n  I plan to seek every opportunity to get this language enacted. I \nthink it is essential, both to ensuring the modernization of our food \nsafety system, and ensuring consumers that we are making progress in \nreducing dangerous pathogens.\n  I hope that both parties, and both houses of Congress will be able to \nact to pass this legislation before the July 4th weekend. The public's \nconfidence in our meat and poultry inspection system is at stake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2761. A bill to fund task forces to locate and apprehend fugitives \nin Federal, State, and local felony criminal cases and to provide \nadministrative subpoena authority; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    capturing criminals act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a former prosecutor, I am well aware \nthat fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their \ncapture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the \nFBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugitives from justice on \nfederal, state, and local felony charges combined. This means that \nthere are almost as many fugitive felons as there are citizens residing \nin my home state of Vermont.\n  The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from \njustice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in \nviolation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt courts \norder and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses \nundeniable risks to the safety of our citizens. We must do better. The \nLeahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act of 2000,'' which I introduce \ntoday, will provide additional tools and resources to our federal law \nenforcement agencies to pursue and capture fugitive felons on both \nfederal and state charges.\n  Our federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job \nthey have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping \nthe states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The \nU.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested \nover 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, \nincluding more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies \ncombined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special \nfugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that \ntargeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in \narresting over 34,000 fugitive felons.\n  Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task \nForces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around \nthe country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have \nresulted in the arrest of a total of 132,292 fugitives, including \n64,336, who were state fugitives.\n  The Capturing Criminals Act would help our law enforcement agencies \nkeep the pressure on fugitives by authorizing the Attorney General to \nestablish regional Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces, to be coordinated \nby the United States Marshals Service; authorizing administrative \nsubpoenas for use in obtaining records relevant to finding federal and \nstate fugitives; and, finally, requesting a comprehensive report on the \nadministrative subpoena authorities held by federal agencies, which \nvary in scope, enforcement and privacy safeguards.\n  ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a \ndemand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or \nregulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently \nand without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial \nentity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. \nAdministrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and \nthe documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, \nsubject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents \nissue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial officer or \neven a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena \nis issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition.\n  Nonetheless, unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive \ninvestigations present unique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use \ngrand jury subpoenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the \ngrand jury phase of an investigation is usually over. Use of\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\ngrand jury subpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a \nfugitive would be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also \nnot be used, either because the fugitive is already convicted or no \ntrial may take place without the fugitive.\n  This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive \ninvestigations creates a disturbing gap in law enforcement procedures. \nLaw enforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. Sec.  1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all \nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions \nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, \nhowever, for obtaining orders under this Act, and the scope and non-\ndisclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions.\n  Thus, authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the \ngap in fugitive investigations to allow federal law enforcement \nagencies to obtain records useful for tracking a fugitive's \nwhereabouts. The Leahy-Kohl Capturing Criminals Act makes clear that \nthe approval of a court remains necessary to obtain an order for \nnondisclosure of the subpoena and production of the requested records \nto the subscriber or customer to whom the records pertain.\n  I am certainly not alone in recognizing the problem this nation has \nwith fugitives from justice. Senators Thurmond and Biden have \nintroduced the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act,'' S. 2516, specifically to \naddress the difficulties facing law enforcement in this area. I commend \nboth my colleagues for their leadership. While I agree with the general \npurposes of S. 2516, aspects of that bill would be problematic. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to \nresolve the differences in our bills.\n  Without detailing all of the differences in the bills, let me provide \nsome examples. As introduced, S. 2516 would limit use of an \nadministrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' \nwhich fails to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the \nbasis of a ``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an \n``information'' in lieu of an indictment. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing \nCriminals Act,'' by contrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to \ntrack fugitives who have been accused in a ``complaint, information or \nindictment.''\n  In addition, S. 2516 requires the U.S. Marshal Service to report \nquarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit the report to \nCongress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. In my view, while a \nreporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in S. \n2516 is overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The Leahy-Kohl \n``Capturing Criminals Act'' would require the Attorney General to \nreport for the next three years to the Judiciary Committees of both the \nHouse and Senate with the following information about the use of \nadministrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations: the number issued, \nby which agency, identification of the charges on which the fugitive \nwas wanted and whether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state \ncharges.\n  Although S. 2516 outlines the procedures for enforcement of an \nadministrative subpoena, it is silent on the mechanisms for both \ncontesting the subpoena by the recipient and for delaying notice to the \nperson about whom the record pertains. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing \nCriminals Act'' expressly addresses these issues.\n  This legislation will help law enforcement--with increased resources \nfor regional fugitive apprehension task forces and administrative \nsubpoena authority--bring to justice both federal and state fugitives \nwho, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our \nnation's criminal justice system. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2761\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish SHARE Net grants to support the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive, accessible, high-technology \ninfrastructure of educational and cultural resources for nonprofit \ninstitutions, individuals, and others for educational purposes through \na systematic effort to coordinate, link and enhance, through \ntechnology, existing specialized resources and expertise in public and \nprivate cultural and educational institutions; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nsaving humanities, arts, and resources for education networking act of \n                          2000 (share net act)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which \nwill help light the way to a stronger educational system with broader \nreach and deeper substance--the SHARE Net (Saving Humanities, Arts, and \nResources for Education Networking) Act of 2000.\n  Education is not just about schools and colleges. Education is \neverything from our very first breath as infants to our last days. We \nlearn at work, at school, at home and in our cars. We learn from the \npeople around us, from books, newspapers, artwork, radio and \ntelevision, and, more and more, we learn from the Internet and \ncomputers.\n  Our Nation has been rich in learning and education. We have an \nimpressive system of public education, with fundamentally strong public \nschools--yes, some need help, but they continue to reach all children \nand open the doors of learning to over 50 million children each year. \nThe strength of our post-secondary education system is unmatched in the \nworld with an estimated 80 percent of our high school graduates going \non to some post-secondary education. We have public libraries across \nthe country that contribute the building blocks of lifelong learning \nwith educational programs and access to books and other educational \nresources for the public--from the youngest to the oldest. We enjoy \nsignificant cultural institutions--museums, art galleries and other \ncenters--that allow us to explore and continue to learn.\n  This infrastructure of learning has not been achieved without \nsignificant effort. From our very first days, leading Americans have \ndedicated time and resources to developing schools, universities and \nother institutions of learning. Thomas Jefferson viewed the creation of \nthe University of Virginia as one of his greatest accomplishments. \nOther Americans are well known for their passion and vision for \nlearning--from Helen Keller to the Little Rock 9.\n  There have been many here in Congress too who have lead on education \nissues. We tend to remember the more recent steps--the creation of the \nPell Grant program or Head Start. But in fact, our commitment and \ninvolvement in these issues began much earlier. I believe one of these \nmost significant, and overlooked, initiatives was the Morrill Acts of \n1862 and 1890. These initiatives brought about a sea-change in our \nNation's educational system by allocating the proceeds from the sale of \nfederally-held western lands to states for the creation of practical, \naccessible Land Grant Colleges and Universities. These Land-Grant \ninstitutions sparked a revolution in higher education, which had been \nsolely the purview of the wealthy and privileged; Land-Grant \ninstitutions focused on reaching real people with helpful knowledge. \nThey focused on agriculture, teaching and research into other practical \nareas--they encouraged and facilitated broader participation in post-\nsecondary education with low costs and continuing education programs.\n  Today, Land Grant colleges and universities continue to fulfill their \noriginal missions of research, outreach and teaching. They have grown \nto be the very backbone of post-secondary education--providing access \nto quality, affordable higher education. These institutions have also \nemerged as leaders in\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nadvanced research--a vital link in our national economy and one of the \nkeys to our global competitiveness.\n  Morrill's vision was not only hugely successful, it was also simple--\nleverage public assets to transform education. Mr. President, I believe \nanother such opportunity confronts us today as rapidly-developing \ntechnology offers new potential to expand the reach of education.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act and Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nestablished a framework for the transition from analog to digital \ntelevision and for the auction of publically-owned analog spectrum. \nThis auction is expected to produce nearly $6 billion in federal \nrevenue; some believe the figure to be as much as $18 billion. This \nvaluable publically-owned asset is today's equivalent of the frontier \nlands of a century ago.\n  These resources should be tapped to fund the further development of \nour educational system by utilizing today's technologies to expand the \nreach and impact of existing high-quality educational and community \nresources. Advanced Internet, digital spectrum and other \ntelecommunications technologies offer new untapped potential to \nincrease the quality and reach of educational resources.\n  And the educational resources are abundant in our communities. What \nis needed is a systematic effort to link these resources, enhance their \naccessibility and broaden their content. My bill would do just this. It \nwould support the work of local and regional partnerships of \neducational and cultural organizations. These partnerships would survey \nexisting resources, identify and fill gaps, link these resources \ntogether through technology and broaden access to them and, ultimately, \ndevelop a comprehensive, accessible high-tech educational \ninfrastructure to benefit all Americans.\n  Mr. President, there is no question our educational system is strong. \nBut it cannot be neglected. So let's learn from the past success of the \nMorrill Acts and invest today's public resources in our greatest asset \nand the very foundation of our future: education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dodd, Mr. DeWine, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. L.

A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to extend the \nauthorizations of appropriations for the programs carried out under \nsuch acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       the national and community service amendments act of 2000\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a \nbill to reauthorize the Corporation for National Service, along with 25 \nco-sponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  In 1993 Congress created the Corporation for National Service to \nenhance opportunities for all Americans to participate in contributing \nto their communities by actively engaging in local service programs. \nCommunity service should not be an option only for those who can afford \nto perform an important job without pay. It should be an opportunity \nfor everyone. Every week, I have the privilege of reading with a third \ngrade student in Washington, and I have seen her make very impressive \nprogress during the last three years. I know first-hand that those who \nengage in community service gain as much as they give when they \nparticipate.\n  The Corporation for National Service is expanding these opportunities \nfor service by offering stipends and education awards to AmeriCorps \nmembers, and stipends to senior volunteers. It also offers professional \ndevelopment opportunities to teachers and identified leader schools, \nwho will mentor other schools interested in beginning to pursue service \nlearning. In the last five years, 150,000 adults have given a year of \nservice to communities across the country as AmeriCorps members. \n500,000 senior citizens each year provide service to their communities \nin Foster Grandparent Programs, Senior Companion Programs, and the \nRetired Senior Volunteer Corps. In addition, over 1 million school \nchildren each year participate in service learning programs.\n  The national service movement has also encouraged businesses to \nbecome actively involved in improving their communities. Local business \nleaders have stepped up to the plate to sponsor service corps programs, \nto offer technical support for existing programs, and to use community \nservice as a way to work with local schools.\n  As Robert Kennedy said, in words that became the hallmark of his \nlife, ``Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things \nthat never were, and say why not?'' Because of community service, more \nand more citizens are asking that question every day in communities \nacross the country.\n  In Massachusetts, under the leadership of Maureen Curley and her \ntalented Board of Directors, the Massachusetts Service Alliance has \nhelped citizens to act against the injustices that they see around \nthem. From City Year and Peace Games in Boston to Greenfield READS and \nthe Barnstable Land Trust, they have created new opportunities to \ntutor, to provide useful information on health care, to fight domestic \nviolence, to help senior citizens live independent lives, and to repair \nand revitalize their communities in many other ways. They have found \nthat many citizens in their communities are eager to be involved and to \nstay involved, and they have been successful in creating large numbers \nof opportunities for that involvement. Last year, 180,000 citizens \ncontributed 3.5 million hours of service in 140 communities across the \nstate. Programs such as City Year, which began as a dream of Michael \nBrown and Alan Khazei in Boston, has a program in 13 sites across the \ncountry, engaging over 2,000 Corps members in service. We will welcome \ntheir newest site here in Washington in September.\n  This bipartisan bill that we offer today will allow these programs to \ncontinue to grow and enable many more Americans to participate in \nimproving their communities and building a stronger America.\n  Our former colleague, Dan Coats, has written an eloquent article in \nsupport of AmeriCorps. The article appeared in today's edition of The \nHill, and I ask unanimous consent that it be made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, June 21, 2000]\n\n                 Why I Changed My Mind About AmeriCorps\n\n                             (By Dan Coats)\n\n       When I was in the Senate, I did not support the legislation \n     that created AmeriCorps because of my fundamental belief in \n     private voluntary service and my skepticism about government-\n     based solutions. I thought that government supported \n     volunteers would undermine the spirit of voluntary service \n     and that new federal resources might subvert the mission and \n     the independence of the civic sector.\n       My faith in the civic sector has not diminished one bit; in \n     fact, it is stronger today than ever before. However, I have \n     changed my mind about AmeriCorps. Instead of distorting the \n     mission of the civic sector, AmeriCorps has proved to be a \n     source of new power and energy for nonprofit organizations \n     across the country.\n       My changed view about AmeriCorps is in no small measure \n     because of the leadership that Harris Wofford, my Democratic \n     former Senate colleague from Pennsylvania, has given to that \n     program, Wofford and I did not vote on the same side very \n     often in the Senate, and we still differ on many issues. But \n     his leadership of AmeriCorps has convinced me that I should \n     have voted with him on this issue.\n       First, thanks to Wofford's steadfast commitment to place \n     national service above partisanship, AmeriCorps has not \n     become the political program that some of us initially \n     feared. Second, he shares my belief that the solutions to \n     some of our most intractable problems lie in the civic \n     sector. Accordingly, he has set AmeriCorps to the work of \n     support, not supplanting, the civic sector.\n       I have seen firsthand how AmeriCorps members have provided \n     a jolt of new energy to the civic sector from my experience \n     as president of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. As \n     Millard Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity and another \n     former skeptic of government-supported volunteers, also \n     discovered, the leadership provided by full-time AmeriCorps \n     members is a key addition for nonprofit and faith-based \n     organizations that are tackling the most difficult community \n     and human problems.\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\n       AmeriCorps members, through their idealism, enthusiasm and \n     can-do spirit, have multiplied the impact of organizations \n     like Big Brothers Big Sisters and Habitat, and hundreds of \n     other organizations large and small. The number of \n     Republicans who have changed their mind about AmeriCorps \n     continues to grow.\n       In the last year, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Mike \n     DeWine (R-Ohio) and Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) have spoken out \n     about the positive role AmeriCorps plays in strengthening the \n     civic sector. Together, we join a growing bipartisan list of \n     present and former federal and state legislators, governors \n     and civic leaders in support of AmeriCorps.\n       Their support is part of a quiet, yet remarkable, \n     transformation in American politics that has occurred since \n     the white-hot debate that took place a few years ago between \n     those who believed that government should take the lead in \n     solving community problems and those who thought government \n     could accomplish little or nothing, and was even likely to be \n     a negative force.\n       Now, as evidenced by both major party presidential \n     candidates and by growing bipartisan support in Congress, a \n     new middle ground has emerged, leading to a unique \n     partnership between AmeriCorps, the nonprofit organizations \n     and private and religious institutions that are critical to \n     strengthening our communities. It is these institutions that \n     transmit values between generations that encourage \n     cooperation between citizens, and make our communities \n     stronger.\n       In a recent speech to the nation's governors, retired Gen. \n     Colin Powell declared himself ``a strong supporter of \n     AmeriCorps.'' After spending two years working with the \n     organization, Powell concluded ``[W]hat they do in terms of \n     leveraging other individuals to volunteer is really \n     incredible. So it is a tremendous investment in your people, \n     a tremendous investment in the future. . . .''\n       Later this month, a bipartisan coalition in the Senate will \n     introduce legislation to reauthorize AmeriCorps and its \n     parent agency, the Corporation for National Service. I hope \n     that Congress will move quickly to enact this legislation so \n     that AmeriCorps can continue to work with the nonprofit and \n     faith-based sectors to strengthen our communities and build a \n     better future for us all.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this today as an \noriginal cosponsor of the National and Community Service Act of 2000 \nand urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of \nthe Corporation for National Service through this legislation.\n  While Americans often wonder what, exactly, it is that the numerous \nagencies and commissions scattered around town do, it is quite clear \nwhat the Corporation for National Service does. It's members tutor and \nmentor at-risk youth. They build affordable housing and clean up the \nNation's rivers, streams and parks. They help seniors live independent \nand productive lives. They provide assistance to the victims of natural \ndisasters. And perhaps most importantly, they train others to do all of \nthese tasks and dozens more--leveraging their numbers, multiplying \ntheir effect, addressing countless community needs. These are important \ntasks. They empower our citizens. They build our communities. They \nrenew our country. That is what the Corporation for National Services \ndoes in my view--provide a true national service to the citizens of \nthis country.\n  The Corporation for National Service is one of the most impressive \nsuccess stories in recent memory. The numbers are simply remarkable. \nTake the AmeriCorps initiative for example. Since it's inception in \n1993, more than 150,000 Americans have served or are currently serving \nas AmeriCorps members. They have provided much-needed assistance to 33 \nmillion of their neighbors in more than 4,000 communities.\n  Specifically, AmeriCorps members have helped nearly 3 million \nchildren succeed in school through tutoring and mentoring initiatives. \nThey have worked with the police and other community organizations to \nsafeguard our neighborhoods--establishing, operating and expanding over \n40,000 safety patrols and working with 600,000 at-risk youth in after-\nschool programs. AmeriCorps members have improved the daily lives of \nAmericans by building or rehabilitating over 25,000 homes, working with \n340,000 people to find jobs, and providing food, clothing and other \nnecessities to over 2.5 million homeless people. With regard to our \nnatural environmental, AmeriCorps members have planted over 50 million \ntrees and removed 70,000 tons of trash from our neighborhoods. And when \nI talk about the leverage created through AmeriCorps members recruiting \nand training others, I am talking about nearly two million volunteers \nbrought to bear on locally generated programs because of the efforts of \nAmeriCorps members.\n  The National Senior Service Corps has been another resounding \nsuccess. What Tom Brokaw has dubbed ``The Greatest Generation'' is \nstill ready to meet the needs of their communities and they have been \nenergized by the Corporation for National Service. With over 25,000 \nFoster Grandparents, 15,000 Senior companions and 467,000 Retired and \nSenior Volunteer Program members, nearly 250,000 children--including, \n58,000 with learning disabilities or suffering from abuse and neglect--\nhave been given an invaluable source of loving care. Sixty-two thousand \nolder Americans in need of a little extra help have been paired with \nSenior Corps members to make daily life more manageable. These Senior \nCorps members provide a critical bridge to independence for these \nseniors. Whether by helping with the daily tasks or simply being a \nfriendly companion, these Senior Corps members are making a huge \ndifference.\n  Learn and Serve, yet another initiative of the Corporation for \nNational service, has served more than 1.5 million students in \nkindergarten through college and helped them apply academic skills to \nmeet community needs.\n  It is an admirable track record of accomplishment, Mr. President. One \nthat according to recent study returns $1.66 to the community for every \ndollar invested.\n  While compiling the numbers, however, we often forget the impact this \nprogram has on those who dedicate themselves as volunteers. But we must \nnot forget the impact that service has on those who give of \nthemselves--their time and their energy--to make a difference. The \npersonal satisfaction one receives from working for others is a feeling \nI can speak about personally. Long before AmeriCorps was a reality, I \nwas Peace Corps volunteer in a small town in the Dominican Republic. \nBut whether it is in the Dominican Republic or in my home state of \nConnecticut--or any state across this nation--there are many small \ntowns that need help sustaining their educational system or providing \nhealth care to their neighbors or maintaining their environment or any \nnumber of areas. And an honest day's work on behalf of those efforts \ntranslates in any language. It is a source of tremendous satisfaction \nand pride. These are emotions that drive participants in either the \nPeaceCorps abroad or AmeriCorps here at home, to continue to work and \ncontinue to build their communities, something that can't be \nquantified.\n  There is also a real period of personal learning that AmeriCorps \nmembers go through. A study by Aguirre International determined that \n``participation in AmeriCorps results in substantial gains in life \nskills for more than three-quarters of the members'' who participate. \nWhen we talk about life skills here, we are talking about \ncommunications skills, interpersonal skills, analytical problem-\nsolving, organizational skill and using information technology. These \nare necessary skills for the 21st century. AmeriCorps members take \nthese skills with them after their term of service, back to employers \nwho want them, back to communities who need them.\n  The Corporation for National Service awakens in its members a strong \nethic of civil responsibility and a lifelong desire to serve. By \nimmersing its members in local, state and national issues, and asking \nthem to address and interact with these issues, the Corporation for \nNational Service is a catalyst for civic participation. And regardless \nof which side of the aisle you sit on, I think we can all agree that an \nactive and involved constituency is what we all hope for.\n  Acorss the range of initiatives that I have touched upon today, are a \ncouple of common themes. Primarily, these efforts are initiated from \nthe ground-up. These programs were not crafted by Senators or \nCongressmen or someone employed here in Washington, they are generated \nby people within the community they serve and administered at the state \nlevel. That allows these programs the flexibility to take advantage of \nthe individual strengths of each community and as a result, better \naddress their needs.\n  Secondly, these programs harness what we all know is the true \nstrength of America, it's citizens. The corporation for National \nService is channeling\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\na constant flow of human energy, ingenuity, and talent into the states \nand communities of our country. The Corporation partners with \norganizations that have a proven track record to provide the necessary \nhuman resource to grow and expand these already successful programs. It \nis a model that works. It is an idea that has captured the imagination \nand harnessed the energy of this Nation. It is our responsibility to \nensure that it continues.\n  The legislation we offer today will ensure that the Corporation for \nNational Service continues through 2005. It retains the successful \nstructure of the system that has been so effective over the last seven \nyears, but makes allowances for a few improvements in the overall \nprogram, including a more responsive effort to ensure an increased \nparticipation by people with disabilities and a recognition that Indian \ntribes are qualified organizations to receive grants. This is a good \nbill. I hope we can work with our colleagues in the House to ensure \nthat legislation reauthorizing the Corporation for National Service is \npassed by both houses and sent to the president for signature this \nyear.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join a number of \nmy colleagues in introducing the National and Community Service \nAmendments Act of 2000. This legislation will reauthorize the National \nand Community Service Act and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act.\n  The idea of the Federal government becoming a partner in community \nservice originated with President Franklin Roosevelt's creation of the \nCivilian Conservation Corps. It was continued with President Kennedy's \ndevelopment of the Peace Corps and President Johnson's VISTA \ninitiative. President Nixon contributed to the community service \nmovement by expanding senior volunteer programs. In the 1990s, both a \nrepublican president and a democratic president strengthened the \ncommunity service structure. President Bush established the Points of \nLight Foundation and President Clinton created the Corporation for \nNational Service. The Corporation for National Service not only \nincorporated the community service programs previously established, but \nalso created AmeriCorps.\n  Since AmeriCorps began more than six years ago, over 40,000 \nindividual shave become AmeriCorps members, serving local and national \norganizations. Recently, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, which I chair, held a hearing regarding the \nreauthorization of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 and \nthe Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973. One of the witnesses who \ntestified was Emily Zollo, an AmeriCorps member from Cabot, Vermont. \nEmily serves with the Northeast Kingdom Initiative AmeriCorps Program \nin Lyndonville, Vermont. Her assignment involves the Cobleigh Public \nLibrary in Lyndonville where she works with the ``Books on Wheels'' \nbookmobile program. Emily drives the bookmobile and as she eloquently \nstated, ``brings books and stories to seven rural villages and towns \nthat vary in population from 350-5,000 residents.'' Emily Zollo \neloquently summed up her AmeriCorps experience by stating: ``Although \nthe best part of my AmeriCorps experience has been meeting with kids at \nthe various stops, learning how they see the world and introducing them \nto books which help them see a wider world, I have also learned some \nbetter ways to work and serve in the community. I feel that service has \nbecome a part of me and will be incorporated into my life and career. \nIt's great to feel good about what you do, knowing you are making a \ndifference in your community.''\n\n  Other community service programs include Learn and Serve America \nwhich provides assistance to over one million students from \nkindergarten through college who participate in community service \nactivities that are aligned with the students' academic programs. In my \nhome State of Vermont, Learn and Serve is making a difference in a \nnumber of elementary and secondary schools, including vocational \ntechnical educational centers. Another service program, the National \nSenior Service Corps, serves nearly half a million Americans, age \nfifty-five and older, who use their talents as Foster Grandparents, \nserving as mentors to young people with special needs. In addition, the \nSenior Companions program helps other seniors live independently. \nRetired and Senior Volunteer Program members provide an array of \nservices for unmet community needs. The senior programs are very \nessential to rural communities. In Springfield, Vermont, the Windsor \nCounty Retired and Senior Volunteer Program provides services to \nisolated seniors and persons with disabilities.\n  A key aspect of the National and Community Service Act is the State \nCommissions. The State Commissions decide which programs are to be \nfunded, recruit volunteers, and evaluate and disseminate information \nabout community and domestic service opportunities. The important role \nof States was also discussed at the hearing by several witnesses who \nrepresented various regions of the country. We heard about the positive \nimpact of organizing service activities in a small rural State from \nJane Williams, the executive director of the Vermont Commission on \nNational and Community Service. Under Jane's leadership, the Vermont \ncommission has been instrumental in getting 10,000 Vermonters of all \nages and backgrounds involved in 31 community service projects. \nGovernor Marc Racicot of Montana gave an excellent presentation \nregarding the importance of community service in ``building unique \npartnerships between public and private agencies by engaging \nparticularly young people in service to their communities.''\n  Community service is not a democrat, republican, or independent \nissue--it's an ideal--an ideal that is central to the philosophy of \nAmerica--neighbor helping neighbor. It is in that spirit that I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of the National and Community Service \nAmendments Act of 2000.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today Senator Kennedy and a \nbipartisan coalition are introducing the National and Community Service \nAmendments Act of 2000 to strengthen this program of community service \nthroughout our country. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nbill because I know how public service has enriched my life. As elected \nrepresentatives, we are entrusted with preserving the strong democracy \nand just society that our founders envisioned. The programs supported \nby this legislation, such as AmeriCorps, extend the opportunity to \nyoung people to do something for others.\n  While working in the Peace Corps, at an Asian desk, I was motivated \nto accept the challenge made by president Kennedy and I joined VISTA. \nThrough VISTA, I came to West Virginia and a ``coal camp,'' a small, \nstruggling town called Emmons. Working to improve life in Emmons was \nnot easy. But after a lot of effort, I was able to both make friends \nand work to make some kind of difference. We pulled down an abandoned \nschool house in southern West Virginia and hauled the boards back to \nEmmons, where we built a community center. We brought a mobile health \nvan for women to get Pap smears for the first time. And we waged a \nlong, hard fight to get the school bus to stop close enough so the \nteenagers did not have to drop out of school just because the \ntransportation to high school did not exist. Those two years in Emmons, \nand the experiences gained there, changed me forever. I stayed in West \nVirginia and chose to make public service my career.\n  When President Clinton chose to unveil a new domestic civil-service \nprogram in 1993, I was proud to stand by him as he announced the \ncreation of AmeriCorps in Princeton, New Jersey. AmeriCorps is an \nexciting program promoting community service, like VISTA. Under \nAmeriCorps, members invest their time in community service and earn \neducational awards that help finance college or pay back student loans.\n  Since its inception just a few years ago, AmeriCorps has renewed \ncommunity service across our nation with a network of programs designed \nto meet the specific needs of an area. In West Virginia, AmeriCorps has \nestablished more than a half dozen programs that help children learn \nhow to read, provide them with caring mentors, and promote healthy \nlifestyles.\n  In highlighting a few of these programs, I must begin with the \nAmeriCorps Promise Fellows. These individuals service eighteen West \nVirginia counties, striving to mobilize\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\ncommunities to provide children with resources critical to their \ndevelopment. In the same way that I helped the community of Emmons \nbuild a center where young people could learn and play, AmeriCorps \nPromise Fellows work to establish safe places and structured activities \nin their local areas. Another program, Energy Express, provides \nbalanced meals, an environment that abounds with literature, and the \nattention of mentors to school-aged children during the summer months. \nI visited the Energy Express site in Pineville, West Virginia, and read \nto children there. AmeriCorps programs also aid adult members of the \ncommunity, as evidenced by the success of Project MOVE in west-central \nWest Virginia that strives to move people from welfare to work. After \nthe first year, the heads of households in twenty families had become \nemployed and had sustained themselves for more than three months.\n  These three programs are just a sampling of what AmeriCorps does in a \nrural state like West Virginia. In more urban areas throughout the \ncountry, AmeriCorps has programs that address the unique needs of those \ncities and their populace.\n  I place an enormous value on public service, and I know that I gained \nmuch from my VISTA experience in Emmons. Continuing AmeriCorps, VISTA \nand our range of community service programs will enhance the lives of \nAmericans, young and old, who join and enrich our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/21/senate-section/article/S5562-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5562-S5563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 353\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Texas \n(Mr. Gramm) was added as a cosponsor of S. 353, a bill to provide for \nclass action reform, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

SUPPORT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR SERBIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and an \n     indicted war criminal, visited Moscow from May 7 through May \n     12, 2000, as a guest of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation, attended the inauguration of President Vladimir \n     Putin, and held talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor \n     Sergeyev and Army Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin;\n       (2) General Ojdanic was military Chief of Staff of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war and has \n     been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against humanity and \n     violations of the laws and customs of war for alleged \n     atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo;\n       (3) international warrants have been issued by the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for \n     General Ojdanic's arrest and extradition to the Hague;\n       (4) the Government of the Russian Federation, a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council which \n     established the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia, has an obligation to arrest General \n     Ojdanic and extradite him to the Hague;\n       (5) on May 16, 2000, Russian Minister of Economics Andrei \n     Shapovalyants announced that his government has provided the \n     Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic $102,000,000 of a \n     $150,000,000 loan it had reactivated and will sell the \n     Government of Serbia $32,000,000 of oil despite the fact that \n     the international community has imposed economic sanctions \n     against the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     and the Government of Serbia;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation is providing \n     the Milosevic regime such assistance while it is seeking debt \n     relief from the international community and loans from the \n     International Monetary Fund, and while it is receiving corn \n     and grain as food aid from the United States;\n       (7) the hospitality provided to General Ojdanic \n     demonstrates that the Government of the Russian Federation \n     rejects the indictments brought by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia against him and other \n     officials, including Slobodan Milosevic, for alleged \n     atrocities committed during the Kosovo war; and\n       (8) the relationship between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Governments of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia and Serbia only encourages the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic to foment instability in the Balkans and thereby \n     jeopardizes the safety and security of American military and \n     civilian personnel and raises questions about Russia's \n     commitment to its responsibilities as a member of the North \n     American Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping mission in \n     Kosovo.\n       (b) Actions.--\n       (1) Fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing all \n     loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government \n     of the Russian Federation or entities acting on its behalf \n     has provided since June 1999, and intends to provide to the \n     Government of Serbia or the Government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or any entities under the control of \n     the Governments of Serbia or the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (2) If that report determines that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation or other entities acting on its behalf has \n     provided or intends to provide the governments of Serbia or \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any entity under their \n     control any loans or economic assistance and oil sales, then \n     the following shall apply:\n       (A) The Secretary of State shall reduce assistance \n     obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in \n     value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales \n     the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and \n     intends to provide to the Governments of Serbia and the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors of the international \n     financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any \n     extension by those institutions of any financial assistance \n     (including any technical assistance or grant) of any kind to \n     the Government of the Russian Federation except for loans and \n     assistance that serve basic human needs.\n       (ii) In this subparagraph, the term ``international \n     financial institution'' includes the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral \n     Investment Guaranty Agency, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n       (C) The United States shall suspend existing programs to \n     the Russia Federation provided by the Export-Import Bank and \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and any \n     consideration of any new loans, guarantees, and other forms \n     of assistance by the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation to Russia.\n       (D) The President of the United States should instruct his \n     representatives to negotiations on Russia's international \n     debt to oppose further forgiveness, restructuring, and \n     rescheduling of that debt, including that being considered \n     under the ``Comprehensive'' Paris Club negotiations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 3499\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n2522, supra;

USE OF FUNDS FOR THE UNITED STATES-ASIA \n                   ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERSHIP.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts \n     assistance to foreign countries, funds appropriated by this \n     or any other Act making appropriations pursuant to part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that are made available \n     for the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership may be \n     made available for activities for the People's Republic of \n     China.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Baucus-\nRoberts amendment to include China in the environmental and \nhumanitarian U.S.-Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP). This program \nprovides an invaluable service to the rapidly developing countries of \nAsia. Through sharing knowledge and technologies developed to resolve \nproblems with the water, land and sky, the USAEP improves the lives of \nhundreds of millions of people.\n  Unfortunately, China has yet to take part in this important program. \nOur amendment seeks to undo this outdated sanction on Asia's largest \nand most environmentally sensitive nation.\n  Let me share a few highlights about the program. First, the USAEP \nprovides trained environmental and commercial specialists that provide \nbusiness counseling to Asians and Americans. They help to link \nprospective business partners and identify innovative, cost-effective \nsolutions to sensitive environmental problems.\n  Making USAEP funds available for U.S.-China Partnerships would \nbenefit both our countries. For example, access to funding for \npartnerships with China would have a tremendous positive effect on many \nstates such as Montana. These funds would open large markets for \nenvironmental services that, for all practical purposes, have been \nclosed to business from the United States.\n  The Chinese need for environmental services is extreme. China \nrequires more than $10 billion in annual investment to combat water \npollution, air pollution, municipal and industrial waste, agricultural \nrunoff and protection of natural environments. Much of the expertise \nrequired to address these problems will have to come from outside of \nChina.\n  Montana possesses an outstanding environmental industry with the \nskills and experience to help China address these problems. Despite the \nfact that Montana companies have exactly the expertise that China needs \nto address its environmental problems, Montana companies have been \nunable to enter the Chinese market. The State government and the \ncompanies themselves lack the funding required to develop long-term \nrelationships with appropriate Chinese companies or government \nofficials.\n  China already has extensive environmental cooperation with Canada, \nEurope and Japan. Environmental Minister Xie Zhenhua has attributed the \nrelative lack of cooperation between U.S. businesses and China to the \nlow level of U.S. government funding for business development and \ntechnology transfer.\n  This lack of funding for has not only limited U.S. access to Chinese \nmarkets for environmental services but it has increased the income \ndisparity between large exporting states and rural states like Montana. \nCalifornia and Washington, states that can afford to promote business \ndevelopment, have seen exports to China grow significantly over the \npast 5 years. Meanwhile, the incomes of Montanans have experienced a \nsteady decline relative to these richer states.\n  USAEP funding to support development of U.S.-Chinese business \nrelationships is vital to the growth of Montana's environmental \nindustry. Even modest funding for business development could lead to \nmillions of dollars to the Montana economy. Without a\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\ndoubt, similar opportunities would be available nationwide.\n  It's time to do the right thing. The time is ripe for such action, \nparticularly as China prepares to enter the rules-based trading system \nwe know as the World Trade Organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Roberts and me in this important \nendeavor. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BROWNBACK AMENDMENT NO. 3512\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Brownback) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nS. 2522, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 140, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

PERU.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) the Organization of American States (OAS) Electoral \n     Observer Mission, led by Eduardo Stein, deserves the \n     recognition and gratitude of the United States for having \n     performed an extraordinary service in promoting \n     representative democracy in the Americas by working to ensure \n     free and fair elections in Peru and by exposing efforts of \n     the Government of Peru to manipulate the national elections \n     in April and May of 2000 to benefit the president in power.\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\n       (2) the Government of Peru failed to establish the \n     conditions for free and fair elections--both for the April 9 \n     election as well as for the May 28 run-off--by not taking \n     effective steps to correct the ``insufficiencies, \n     irregularities, inconsistencies, and inequities'' documented \n     by the OAS Electoral Observation Mission.\n       (3) the United States Government should support the work of \n     the OAS high-level mission, and that such mission should base \n     its specific recommendations on the views of civil society in \n     Peru regarding commitments by their government to respect \n     human rights, the rule of law, the independence and \n     constitutional role of the judiciary and national congress, \n     and freedom of expression and journalism.\n       (4) in accordance with P.L. 106-186, the United States must \n     review and modify as appropriate its political, economic, and \n     military relations with Peru and work with other democracies \n     in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a restoration of \n     democracy in Peru.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report evaluating \n     United States political, economic, and military relations \n     with Peru, in accordance with P.L. 106-186. Such report \n     should review, but not be limited to, the following.\n       (1) The effectiveness of providing United States assistance \n     to Peru only through independent non-governmental \n     organizations or international organizations;\n       (2) Scrutiny of all United States anti-narcotics assistance \n     to Peru and the effectiveness of providing such assistance \n     through legitimate civilian agencies and the appropriateness \n     of providing this assistance to any military or intelligence \n     units that are known to have violated human rights, \n     suppressed freedom of expression or undermined free and fair \n     elections.\n       (3) The need to increase support to Peru through \n     independent non-governmental organizations and international \n     organizations to promote the rule of law, separation of \n     powers, political pluralism, and respect for human rights, \n     and to evaluate termination of support for entities that have \n     cooperated with the undemocratic maneuvers of the executive \n     branch; and,\n       (4) The effectiveness of United States policy of supporting \n     loans or other assistance for Peru through international \n     financial institutions (such as the World Bank and Inter-\n     American Development Bank), and an evaluation of terminating \n     support to entities of the Government of Peru that have \n     willfully violated human rights, suppressed freedom of \n     expression, or undermined free and fair elections.\n       (5) The extent to which Peru benefits from the Andean Trade \n     Preferences Act and the ramifications of conditioning \n     participation in that program on respect for the rule of law \n     and representative democracy.\n       (c) Determination.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the President shall determine \n     and report to the appropriate committees of Congress whether \n     the Government of Peru has made substantial progress in \n     improving its respect for human rights, the rule of law \n     (including fair trials of accused), the independence and \n     constitutional role of the judiciary and national congress, \n     and freedom of expression and independent journalism.\n       (d) Prohibition.--If the President determines and reports \n     pursuant to subsection (c) that the Government of Peru has \n     not made substantial progress, no funds appropriated by this \n     Act may be made available for the Government of Peru, and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States \n     executive directors to the international financial \n     institutions to use the voice and vote of the United States \n     to oppose loans to the Government of Peru, except loans to \n     support basic human needs.\n       (e) Exception.--The prohibition in subsection (d) shall not \n     apply to humanitarian assistance, democracy assistance, anti-\n     narcotics assistance, or assistance to support binational \n     peace activities involving Peru and Ecuador.\n       (f) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (d) for \n     periods not to exceed 90 days if he certifies to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress that doing so is vital to \n     the national interests of the United States and will promote \n     the respect for human rights and the rule of law in Peru.\n       (g) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, \n     ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations in the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and Committee on \n     International Relations in the House of Representatives.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) According to the World Health Organization, in 1999, \n     there were 5.6 million new cases of HIV/AIDS throughout the \n     world, and two-thirds of those (3.8 million) were in sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (2) Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world \n     where a majority of those with HIVAIDS--55 percent--are \n     women.\n       (3) When women get the disease, they often pass it along to \n     their children, and over 2 million children in sub-Saharan \n     Africa are living with HIV/AIDS.\n       (4) New investments and treatments hold out promise of \n     making progress against mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS. For example--\n       (A) a study in Uganda demonstrated that a new drug could \n     prevent almost one-half of the HIV transmissions from mothers \n     to infants, at a fraction of the cost of other treatments; \n     and\n       (B) a study of South Africa's population estimated that if \n     all pregnant women in that country took an antiviral \n     medication during labor, as many as 110,000 new cases of HIV/\n     AIDS could be prevented over the next five years in South \n     Africa alone.\n       (5) The Technical Assistance, Trade Promotion, and Anti-\n     Corruption Act of 2000, as approved by the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee on March 23, 2000, ensures that not less \n     than 8.3 percent of USAID's HIV/AIDS funding is used to \n     combat mother-to-child transmission.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that of the funds provided in this Act, the USAID should \n     place a high priority on efforts, including providing \n     medications, is prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS.\n\n                           Amendment No. 3541\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n               TITLE  --INTERNATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated in this Act, \n     $94 million shall be available for necessary expenses to \n     carry out the provisions of Chapters 1 and 10 of part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, for global health and \n     related activities: Provided, That of the funds appropriated \n     under this title, not less than $75 million shall be made \n     available for programs to combat HIV/AIDS: Provided further, \n     That of the funds appropriated under this title, not less \n     than $19 million shall be made available for the prevention, \n     treatment, and control of tuberculosis: Provided further, \n     That amounts made available under this title are hereby \n     designated by the Congress to be emergency requirements \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985: Provided further, That \n     such amounts shall be made available only after submission to \n     the Congress of a formal budget request by the President that \n     includes designation of the entire amount of the request an \n     emergency requirements as defined in such Act.\n                                  ____\n\n       On page 155, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n\n   prohibition on use of department of defense resources for certain \n                         activities in colombia\n\n       Sec. 6107. (a) Support for Counterinsurgency Operations.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be \n     obligated or expended for the use of any personnel, \n     equipment, or other resources of the Department of Defense \n     for the support of any training program involving a Colombian \n     unit that engages in counterinsurgency operations.\n       (b) Law Enforcement Activities.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended for the \n     direct participation of a member of the Armed Forces or a \n     civilian employee of the Department of Defense in any law \n     enforcement activities in Colombia, including search, \n     seizure, arrest, or similar activities.\n       (c) Counterdrug Field Operations.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act may be obligated or expended to \n     permit a member of the Armed Forces or civilian employee of \n     the Department of Defense to--\n       (1) accompany any United States drug enforcement agent, or \n     any law enforcement or military personnel of Colombia with \n     counterdrug authority, on any counterdrug field operation; or\n       (2) participate in any activity in which counterdrug-\n     related hostilities are imminent.\n       (d) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States in Colombia \n     should make every effort to minimize the possibility of \n     confrontation, whether armed or otherwise, with civilians in \n     Colombia.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      LANDRIEU AMENDMENT NO. 3543\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to \nthe bill, S. 2522, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 140, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n                      adoption incentive payments\n\n       Sec. 591.

SENSE OF SENATE ON DEBT RELIEF FOR WORLD'S POOREST \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The burden of external debt has become a major \n     impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many \n     of the world's poorest countries.\n       (2) Until recently, the United States Government and other \n     official creditors sought to address this problem by \n     rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt \n     reduction.\n       (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of \n     the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their \n     capacity to repay.\n       (4) In 1996, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the \n     international community that all multilateral and bilateral \n     creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, \n     would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.\n       (5) A wide range of organizations and institutions, \n     including leading churches worldwide have endorsed the \n     concept of writing off the debt of the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries.\n       (6) In 1999, Congress passed and the President signed into \n     law funding for the forgiveness of a portion of the bilateral \n     debt owed by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries to the \n     United States subject to terms and conditions set forth in \n     Public Law 106-113.\n       (7) In the supplemental budget request for fiscal year 2000 \n     and in the fiscal year 2001 budget request submitted by the \n     President, the President asked for $435,000,000 to fund both \n     bilateral debt owed by the HIPC to the United States and \n     contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund which would forgive debt \n     owed by the HIPC to the regional development banks.\n       (8) Funding for United States participation in the HIPC \n     Trust Fund is subject to authorization by the appropriate \n     committees.\n       (9) Legislation fully authorizing the President's fiscal \n     year 2001 budget request for United States participation in \n     the HIPC Trust Fund, and full use of the International \n     Monetary Fund gold earnings, has been reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, and is currently under review \n     by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the relevant committees of the Senate should report to \n     the full Senate legislation authorizing comprehensive debt \n     relief for poor countries;\n       (2) these authorizations of bilateral and multilateral debt \n     relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the \n     private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, \n     support the development of free markets, and promote broad-\n     scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;\n       (3) these authorizations should also support the adoption \n     of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits \n     are shared widely among the population, such as through \n     initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat \n     AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;\n       (4) these authorizations should promote debt relief \n     agreements that are designed and implemented in a transparent \n     manner so as to ensure productive allocation of future \n     resources and prevention of waste;\n       (5) these authorizations should promote debt relief \n     agreements that have the broad participation of the citizenry \n     of the debtor country and should ensure that country's \n     circumstances are adequately taken into account;\n       (6) these authorizations should ensure that no country \n     should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country \n     does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or \n     narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human \n     rights of its citizens, or is engaged in military or civil \n     conflict that undermines poverty alleviation efforts or \n     spends excessively on its military;

SENSE OF SENATE ON DEBT RELIEF FOR WORLD'S POOREST \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The burden of external debt has become a major \n     impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many \n     of the world's poorest countries.\n       (2) Until recently, the United States Government and other \n     official creditors sought to address this problem by \n     rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt \n     reduction.\n       (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of \n     the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their \n     capacity to repay.\n       (4) In 1996, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the \n     international community that all multilateral and bilateral \n     creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, \n     would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.\n       (5) A wide range of organizations and institutions, \n     including leading churches worldwide, have endorsed the \n     concept of writing off the debt of the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries.\n       (6) In 1999, Congress passed and the President signed into \n     law funding for the forgiveness of a portion of the bilateral \n     debt owed by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries to the \n     United States subject to terms and conditions set forth in \n     Public Law 106-113.\n       (7) In the supplemental budget request for fiscal year 2000 \n     and in the fiscal year 2001 budget request submitted by the \n     President, the President asked for $435,000,000 to fund both \n     bilateral debt owed by the HIPC to the United States and \n     contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund which would forgive debt \n     owed by the HIPC to the regional development banks.\n       (8) Funding for United States participation in the HIPC \n     Trust Fund is subject to authorization by the appropriate \n     committees.\n       (9) Legislation fully authorizing the President's fiscal \n     year 2001 budget request for United States participation in \n     the HIPC Trust Fund, and full use of the International \n     Monetary Fund gold earnings, has been reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, and is currently under review \n     by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the relevant committees of the Senate should report to \n     the full Senate legislation authorizing comprehensive debt \n     relief for poor countries;\n       (2) these authorizations of bilateral and multilateral debt \n     relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the \n     private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, \n     support the development of free markets, and promote broad-\n     scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;\n       (3) these authorizations should also support the adoption \n     of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits \n     are shared widely among the population, such as through \n     initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat \n     AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;\n       (4) these authorizations should promote debt relief \n     agreements that are designed and implemented in a transparent \n     manner so as to ensure productive allocation of future \n     resources and prevention of waste;\n       (5) these authorizations should promote debt relief \n     agreements that have the broad participation of the citizenry \n     of the debtor country and should ensure that country's \n     circumstances are adequately taken into account;\n       (6) these authorizations should ensure that no country \n     should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country \n     does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or \n     narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human \n     rights of its citizens, or is engaged in military or civil \n     conflict that undermines poverty alleviation efforts or \n     spends excessively on its military; and\n       (7) if the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) through \n     (6) are met in the authorization legislation currently \n     pending before the relevant committees, Congress should fully \n     fund bilateral and multilateral debt relief to ensure the \n     maximum leverage of international funds and the maximum \n     benefit to the eligible countries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 3552\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Helms) proposed an amendment to the bill S. \n2522, supra;

IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY REFORMS AT THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) On March 18, 1999, President Clinton asked the \n     President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) to \n     undertake an inquiry and issue a report on ``the security \n     threat at the Department of Energy's weapons labs and the \n     adequacy of the measures that have been taken to address \n     it.''\n       (2) In June 1999, the PFIAB issued a report titled \n     ``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst,'' which \n     concluded the Department of Energy ``represents the best of \n     America's scientific talent and achievement, but it has been \n     responsible for the worst security record on secrecy that the \n     members of this panel have ever encountered.''\n       (3) The PFIAB report stated, ``Organizational disarray, \n     managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE \n     headquarters and the labs themselves--conspired to create an \n     espionage scandal waiting to happen.''\n       (4) The PFIAB report further stated, ``The Department of \n     Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is \n     incapable of reforming itself. * * * Reorganization is \n     clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems with \n     security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories, \n     but also to address the lack of accountability that has \n     become endemic throughout the entire Department. * * * real \n     and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the \n     weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current \n     structure and culture;''\n       (5) The PFIAB report stated, ``Specifically, we recommend \n     that the Congress pass and the President sign legislation \n     that: Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency * * * [to] \n     oversee all nuclear weapons-related matters previously housed \n     in DOE.''\n       (6) The bipartisan Select Committee on U.S. National \n     Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's  \n     Republic of China of the House of Representatives released \n     an unclassified report on May 25, 1999 which concluded \n     that ``The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen \n     design information on the United States' most advanced \n     thermonuclear weapons. These thefts of nuclear secrets \n     from our national weapons laboratories enabled the PRC to \n     design, develop, and successfully test modern strategic \n     nuclear weapons sooner than would otherwise have been \n     possible. The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets give the PRC \n     design information on thermonuclear weapons on a par with \n     our own.''\n       (7) The report of the Select Committee further concluded \n     that, ``Despite repeated PRC thefts of the most sophisticated \n     U.S. nuclear weapons technology, security at our national \n     nuclear weapons laboratories does not meet even minimal \n     standards.''\n       (8) In response to the findings of the Select Committee on \n     U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with \n     the People's Republic of China of the House of \n     Representatives and the President's Foreign Intelligence \n     Advisory Board, Senators Kyl, Domenici, and Murkowski offered \n     Amendment 446 to the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence \n     Authorization Act calling for the creation of a semi-\n     autonomous agency to manage all United States nuclear weapons \n     programs, which was passed by the Senate on July 21, 1999, by \n     a vote of 96 to 1. This amendment called for the semi-\n     autonomous agency to be organized with clear lines of \n     authority and accountability to replace the previous \n     structure with confused, overlapping reporting channels and \n     diffused responsibility that led to earlier security \n     failures.\n       (9) The provisions of Amendment 446 were incorporated in \n     the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization Conference Report, \n     which was approved by the House of Representatives on \n     September 15, 1999, by a vote of 375 to 45, and the Senate on \n     September 22, 1999, by a vote of 93 to 5.\n       (10) President Clinton signed the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65) on \n     October 5, 1999.\n       (11) Notwithstanding his signing into law the legislation \n     creating the National Nuclear Security Administration headed \n     by a new\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\n     Under Secretary, on October 5, 1999, President Clinton issued \n     a statement which said, ``Until further notice, the Secretary \n     of Energy shall perform all duties and functions of the Under \n     Secretary for Nuclear Security. The Secretary is instructed \n     to guide and direct all personnel of the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration. . . .''\n       (12) On May 3, 2000 the nomination of General John Gordon \n     to head the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n     was received by the Senate from the President. On June 14, \n     2000, General John Gordon was confirmed by the Senate by a \n     vote of 97 to 0.\n       (13) The Secretary of Energy has failed to fully implement \n     the law signed by the President on October 5, 1999. For \n     example, Section 3213 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65) sates that, with \n     the exception of the Secretary of Energy, NNSA employees, \n     ``shall not be responsible to, or subject to the authority, \n     direction, or control of, any officer, employee, or agent of \n     the Department of Energy.'' Yet page 16 of the Department of \n     Energy's Implementation Plan for the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration released on January 1, 2000, states \n     that in order to manage the performance of non-weapons \n     related work at NNSA facilities such as the three national \n     labs, ``non-NNSA officers or employees of the Department \n     retain the authority to direct NNSA employees and contractor \n     employees with regard to the accomplishment of such work.''\n       (14) On May 26, 1999, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson \n     stated, ``American's can be reassured: Our nation's nuclear \n     secrets are, today, safe and secure.''\n       (15) In response to a question from Senator Fitzgerald at a \n     joint hearing of the Committees on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, and Governmental Affairs of the Senate on October \n     19, 1999, that ``So if there's a problem, God forbid, with \n     security at our Nation's labs while we have not fulfilled or \n     appointed somebody as Under Secretary in this new agency \n     within an agency, you would be willing to assume full \n     responsibility. . . .'' Secretary Richardson testified that, \n     ``I would assume full responsibility.''\n       (16) The recent security lapses at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory demonstrates that security and counterintelligence \n     measures continue to be significantly deficient at United \n     States nuclear facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The national security of the United States has been \n     significantly harmed due to weak and ineffective security and \n     counterintelligence measures at America's nuclear facilities.\n       (2) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2000, if implemented, will improve security and \n     counterintelligence measures at United States nuclear \n     facilities by establishing clear lines of authority and \n     accountability to enable lasting reforms to be put in place.\n       (3) The President and the Secretary of Energy should \n     faithfully implement the provisions of Public Law 106-65, \n     which established the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (4) The Secretary of Energy should permit the Administrator \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration to manage all \n     aspects of United States nuclear weapons programs without \n     interference.\n       (5) The Secretary of Energy should drop efforts to ``dual-\n     hat'' officers or employees of the Department of Energy to \n     serve concurrently in positions within the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration and the Department of Energy. Such \n     efforts to extensively ``dual-hat'' officials are contrary to \n     the intent of Congress when it passed Public Law 106-65.\n       (6) The Administrator of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration shall take all appropriate steps to ensure \n     that the protection of sensitive and classified information \n     becomes the highest priority of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TORRICELLI (AND EDWARDS) AMENDMENT NO. 3559\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Torricelli (for himself and Mr. Edwards)) proposed \nan amendment to the bill S. 2522, supra;

IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY REFORMS AT THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) On March 18, 1999, President Clinton asked the \n     President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) to \n     undertake an inquiry and issue a report on ``the security \n     threat at the Department of Energy's weapons labs and the \n     adequacy of the measures that have been taken to address \n     it.''\n       (2) In June 1999, the PFIAB issued a report titled \n     ``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst,'' which \n     concluded the Department of Energy ``represents the best of \n     America's scientific talent and achievement, but it has been \n     responsible for the worst security record on secrecy that the \n     members of this panel have ever encountered.''\n       (3) The PFIAB report stated, ``Organizational disarray, \n     managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE \n     headquarters and the labs themselves--conspired to create an \n     espionage scandal waiting to happen.''\n       (4) The PFIAB report further stated, ``The Department of \n     Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is \n     incapable of reforming itself. . . . Reorganization is \n     clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems with \n     security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories, \n     but also to address the lack of accountability that has \n     become endemic throughout the entire Department . . . real \n     and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the \n     weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current \n     structure and culture;''\n       (5) The PFIAB report stated, ``Specifically, we recommend \n     that the Congress pass and the President sign legislation \n     that: Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency . . . [to] \n     oversee all nuclear weapons-related matters previously housed \n     in DOE.''\n       (6) The bipartisan Select Committee on U.S. National \n     Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's \n     Republic of China of the House of Representatives released an \n     unclassified report on May 25, 1999 which concluded that \n     ``The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen design \n     information on the United States' most advanced thermonuclear \n     weapons. These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national \n     weapons laboratories enabled the PRC to design, develop, and \n     successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner \n     than would otherwise have been possible. The stolen U.S. \n     nuclear secrets give the PRC design information on \n     thermonuclear weapons on a par with our own.''\n       (7) The report of the Select Committee further concluded \n     that, ``Despite repeated PRC thefts of the most sophisticated \n     U.S. nuclear weapons technology, security at our national \n     nuclear weapons laboratories does not meet even minimal \n     standards.''\n       (8) In response to the findings of the Select Committee on \n     U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with \n     the People's Republic of China of the House of \n     Representatives and the President's Foreign Intelligence \n     Advisory Board, Senators Kyl, Domenici, and Murkowski offered \n     Amendment 446 to the Fiscal Year 2000 Intelligence \n     Authorization Act calling for the creation of a semi-\n     autonomous agency to manage all United States nuclear weapons \n     programs, which was passed by the Senate on July 21, 1999, by \n     a vote of 96 to 1. This amendment called for the semi-\n     autonomous agency to be organized with clear lines of \n     authority and accountability to replace the previous \n     structure with confused, overlapping reporting channels and \n     diffused responsibility that led to earlier security \n     failures.\n       (9) The provisions of Amendment 446 were incorporated in \n     the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization Conference Report, \n     which was approved by the House of Representatives on \n     September 15, 1999, by a vote of 375 to 45, and the Senate on \n     September 22, 1999, by a vote of 93 to 5.\n       (10) President Clinton signed the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65) on \n     October 5, 1999.\n       (11) Notwithstanding his signing into law the legislation \n     creating the National Nuclear Security Administration headed \n     by a new Under Secretary, on October 5, 1999, President \n     Clinton issued a statement which said, ``Until further \n     notice, the Secretary of Energy shall perform all duties and \n     functions of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security. The \n     Secretary is instructed to guide and direct all personnel of \n     the National Nuclear Security Administration. . . .''\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\n       (12) On May 3, 2000 the nomination of General John Gordon \n     to head the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n     was received by the Senate from the President. On June 14, \n     2000, General John Gordon was confirmed by the Senate by a \n     vote of 97 to 0.\n       (13) The Secretary of Energy has failed to fully implement \n     the law signed by the President on October 5, 1999. For \n     example, Section 3213 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65) states that, \n     with the exception of the Secretary of Energy, NNSA \n     employees, ``shall not be responsible to, or subject to the \n     authority, direction, or control of, any officer, employee, \n     or agent of the Department of Energy.'' Yet page 16 of the \n     Department of Energy's Implementation Plan for the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration released on January 1, 2000, \n     states that in order to manage the performance of non-weapons \n     related to work at NNSA facilities such as the three national \n     labs, ``non-NNSA officers or employees of the Department \n     retain the authority to direct NNSA employees and contractor \n     employees with regard to the accomplishment of such work.''\n       (14) On May 26, 1999, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson \n     stated, ``Americans can be reassured: Our nation's nuclear \n     secrets are, today, safe and secure.''\n       (15) In response to a question from Senator Fitzgerald at a \n     joint hearing of the Committees on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, and Governmental Affairs of the Senate on October \n     19, 1999, that ``So if there's a problem, God forbid, with \n     security at our Nation's labs while we have not fulfilled or \n     appointed somebody as Under Secretary in this new agency \n     within an agency, you would be willing to assume full \n     responsibility. . . .'' Secretary Richardson testified that, \n     ``I would assume full responsibility.''\n       (16) The recent security lapses at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory demonstrates that security and counterintelligence \n     measures continue to be significantly deficient at United \n     States nuclear facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The national security of the United States has been \n     significantly harmed due to weak and ineffective security and \n     counterintelligence measures at America's nuclear facilities.\n       (2) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2000, if implemented, will improve security and \n     counterintelligence measures at United States nuclear \n     facilities by establishing clear lines of authority and \n     accountability to enable lasting reforms to be put in place.\n       (3) The President and the Secretary of Energy should \n     faithfully implement the provisions of Public Law 106-65, \n     which established the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (4) The Secretary of Energy should permit the Administrator \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration to manage all \n     aspects of United States nuclear weapons programs without \n     interference.\n       (5) The Secretary of Energy should drop efforts to ``dual-\n     hat'' officers or employees of the Department of Energy to \n     serve concurrently in positions within the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration and the Department of Energy. Such \n     efforts to extensively ``dual-hat'' officials are contrary to \n     the intent of Congress when it passed Public Law 106-65.\n       (6) The Administrator of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration shall take all appropriate steps to ensure \n     that the protection of sensitive and classified information \n     becomes the highest priority of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ABRAHAM AMENDMENTS NOS. 3584-3585\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 2522, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3584\n\n       On page 14, line 4, strike ``$15,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$35,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3585\n\n       On page 14, beginning on line 4, strike ``not less than \n     $15,000,000'' and all that follows through the period on line \n     7 and insert the following: ``and existing accounts, not less \n     than $250,000,000 should be made available to Lebanon to be \n     used for, among other programs, rebuilding power generation \n     plants, schools, water purification facilities, roads, and \n     general infrastructure projects, with the understanding that \n     the most immediate need is in the South of Lebanon.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              EDWARDS (AND TORRICELLI) AMENDMENT NO. 3586\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Torricelli) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 2) to extend programs \nand activities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                  Rural Community Advancement Program\n\n       For an additional amount for the rural community \n     advancement program under the section 381E of the \n     Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2009d), \n     $250,000,000, to remain available until expended, to provide \n     grants under the rural community facilitates grant program \n     under section 306(a)(19) of that Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(19)): \n     Provided, That the entire amount made available under this \n     heading is designated by Congress as an emergency requirement \n     under section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     901(b)(2)(A)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TORRICELLI (AND EDWARDS) AMENDMENT NO. 3587\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Edwards) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2522, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n                  Economic Development Administration\n\n                      Economic Assistance Programs\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Economic Development \n     Assistance Programs'', $250,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended, for planning assistance, public works grants, \n     and revolving loan funds to assist communities affected by \n     Hurricane Floyd, Hurricane Dennis, or Hurricane Irene: \n     Provided, That the entire amount made available under this \n     heading shall be available only to the extent that the \n     President submits to Congress an official budget request for \n     a specific dollar amount that includes designation of the \n     entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement for \n     the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.): Provided further, \n     That the entire amount made available under this heading is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement under \n     section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SPECTER AMENDMENT NO. 3588\n\n  Mr. SPECTER proposed an amendment to the bill S. 2522, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 140, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .
