Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill, S. \n1093, which I introduced on May 20 of this year for the protection of \nvarious historic sites in the Galisteo Basin in my home State of New \nMexico. The basin is located in Santa Fe County, NM. As shown on this \nmap--it is very hard for anyone to see this map I understand--this is \nSanta Fe and the Galisteo Basin is this area south of Santa Fe where \nthe various dots are shown. These dots identify the location of the \nvarious historical sites that are talked about in the bill. To \nunderstand the importance of these sites, it is important to understand \na little history about this basin.\n  When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in New Mexico in 1598, they \nfound a thriving native pueblo culture with its own unique traditions, \nits own religion, and its own architecture and art, which was enriched \nand influenced by an extensive system of trade. The subsequent history \nof conflict and coexistence between these two cultures--the pueblo \nIndian culture on the one hand and the Spanish culture--shaped much of \nthe language and the art and cultural world view of the people in my \nState today.\n  The initial history of cultural interaction in New Mexico encompassed \na period of a little over 100 years from 1598 through the pueblo revolt \nin 1680 and also the period of recolonization by the Spanish in the \nearly 1700s. Among these sites, which are shown on this map and which \nare discussed in the bill, are examples of both the stone and the adobe \narchitectural styles which typified Native American pueblo communities \nprior to and during early Spanish colonization, including two of\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\nthe largest of these ancient towns, San Marcos and San Lazaro Pueblos. \nEach of these large towns had thousands of rooms at their peak.\n  Also included in these sites are spectacular examples of Native \nAmerican petroglyph art, as well as historic missions which were \nconstructed as part of the Spaniards' drive to convert the native \npopulace to Catholicism. The 26 archaeological sites addressed in this \nbill provide a cohesive picture of this crucial nexus of New Mexican \nhistory depicting the culture of the pueblo people and illustrating how \nit was affected by the Spanish settlers.\n  Through these sites, we have an opportunity to truly understand the \nsimultaneous growth and the coexistence of these two cultures. \nUnfortunately, this is an opportunity we may soon lose. Most of these \nsites are currently not part of any preservation program, and through \nweathering, erosion, vandalism, and amateur excavations, they are \nlosing their ability to be interpreted at a later date.\n  This legislation creates a program under the Department of the \nInterior to preserve these sites and to provide interpretive research \nin an integrated manner. While many of these sites are on Federal \npublic land, many are privately owned, and there are a few on State \ntrust lands. The vision behind the legislation is that an integrated \npreservation program at sites on Federal lands could serve as a \nfoundation for archaeological research that could be augmented with \nvoluntary cooperative agreements with State agencies and with private \nlandowners. These agreements will provide landowners with the \nopportunity for technical and financial assistance to preserve the \nsites on their property. Where the parties deem it appropriate, the \nlegislation would also allow for the purchase or exchange of property \nto acquire these very valuable sites. With such a program, we should be \nable to preserve the history embodied in these sites for future \ngenerations.\n  I add that this legislation is supported by the Cochiti Pueblo, which \nis culturally and historically tied to these sites. I have received a \nletter from Isaac Herrera, the Governor of Cochiti Pueblo, expressing \nhis support and that of the tribal council for the legislation. \nGovernor Herrera notes that this tribe has already donated $10,000 to \nthe preservation of one of these sites. So this legislation has the \nsupport of the pueblo. It also has the support of our State land \ncommissioner, Ray Powell.\n  I conclude by showing some examples from these magnificent sites. The \nfirst two charts are from the Comanche Gap site. They are outstanding \nexamples of petroglyph art, of which we have a lot in our State of New \nMexico. These are examples of very intricate work that has been done by \nthe pueblo Indians on the rock formations.\n  The next three charts are of the various pueblo sites. The first is \nPueblo Blanco. As you can see, the drywash at the top of this picture \nand the road at the bottom are the types of erosion threats which I \nmentioned earlier.\n  The next picture is Arroyo Hondo. Again, you have a drywash at the \ntop. This is probably the most extensively excavated of the various \nsites. The School of American Research in Santa Fe has done a \ntremendous amount of work to try to interpret and understand this site.\n  Finally is the Pueblo of Colorado which, once again, shows the threat \nof erosion from the drywashes above the site.\n  So these are examples of what we are trying to preserve through this \nlegislation.\n  I did have a chance this Saturday--2 days ago--to visit the San \nMarcos site and saw the damage that is being done there by erosion. I \nalso saw the value of preserving the site to show where the Spanish \nconquistadors came in and built a church right on a part of that \npueblo. Trying to understand the interaction of the two cultures at \nthat site is a very worthwhile endeavor.\n  I also particularly thank Jessica Schultz who has been an intern in \nmy office this past year. She has done yeoman work providing research \nfor the bill and helping to get the bill drafted.\n  I feel strongly that it will be a major contribution if we can pass \nthis legislation and make it law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill that I referred to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The bill (S. 1093) is printed in the Congressional Record of \nThursday, May 20, 1999.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of information \ngiven the American people in recent days about a potential settlement \nor at least progress with respect to ending the airstrikes in \nYugoslavia. It appears from the reports I have received, both from the \nadministration sources and also press reports, that the airstrikes have \nhad a significant impact on Mr. Slovodan Milosevic, on his Serb troops, \nand on their ability to continue the reign of terror that has been \ncommitted against the Albanians in Kosovo.\n  But as I read all of the reports, I am concerned about one element, \nand that is, if the airstrikes are terminated and if some kind of \nnegotiated circumstance exists by which the Serbs withdraw from Kosovo \nand Mr. Milosevic remains in power, in my judgment, it remains \nunfinished business.\n  We have in this decade been through a circumstance with Saddam \nHussein where a war was concluded with the country of Iraq and Saddam \nHussein retained his power. We have year after year after year had to \ndeal with the consequences of Saddam Hussein remaining in power in the \ncountry of Iraq. It doesn't make any sense to me that we should do the \nsame thing with Mr. Milosevic.\n  With Mr. Saddam Hussein, we knew who he was, we knew what he had \ndone, and this country should well have known that the conclusion of \nthe war with Iraq should have resulted in his departure, or his leaving \nthe leadership of that country. He is, I think, one of the only men in \nthe world who has used weapons of mass destruction to murder people in \nhis own land. We knew that about Saddam Hussein, and yet the war was \nconcluded with Iraq, and he remained in power. The result has been \nproblem after problem and consequence after consequence. We ought to \nlearn from that.\n  However we conclude this terrible chapter of violence committed \nagainst the Albanians in Kosovo, in my judgment, it will always be \nunfinished business if it is concluded in a manner that leaves Mr. \nMilosevic in power. We must find a way, it seems to me, for the \nprotection not only of the Albanians in Kosovo but for some basic \nunderstanding we might have, that we will not have to revisit this \nissue very soon after the airstrikes cease. The only way that will \noccur, in my judgment, is if Mr. Milosevic is driven from office.\n  I have spoken on the floor of the Senate a number of times suggesting \nthat it is time to try Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal. I am pleased to \nsay that he was indicted within the past 2 weeks and that indictment \nwill likely result in trial. My hope is that trial--at least seeing the \nevidence that I have seen about the atrocities committed by Mr. \nMilosevic and the Serb troops--will result in his conviction as a war \ncriminal. The atrocities are really quite unusual. He visited a reign \nof horror on these people in a manner that drove one to one and a half \nmillion of them from their homeland, often with their villages burning, \nwith story after story of mass murder, ethnic cleansing, gang rape, and \ntorture.\n  The question for this country and the NATO allies is, Could we go 2 \nyears, or 5 years, or 10 years down the road and look in our rearview \nmirror and say that we knew that happened but it didn't matter, that it \nwasn't our business? Our country and the NATO allies\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nsaid no, it was our business; it does matter. We have the resources and \nthe capability, through NATO, together to try to do something to put a \nstop to it. That has been the effort. Is the effort perfect? No. Have \nthere been mistakes? Of course. But will we, by the judgment of \nhistory, be seen as a country and a group of countries attempting to do \nsomething in the face of ethnic cleansing, in the face of a ruthless \nleader who packs people into train cars and hauls them off to an \nuncertain fate, who, in the words of all of the refugees who have shown \nup at the border of Albania and Montenegro and other areas, has \npermitted mass rape and torture and murder against the citizens of \nKosovo? Do we understand the consequences of that and the requirement \nto respond to it? The answer is yes.\n\n  But I hope at the end of this chapter, Mr. Milosevic will not be a \npart of an agreement that leaves him in power. That will not, in my \njudgment, be finished business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6457-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. That is a subject I suppose will \nglaze over the eyes of many, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nI was in my home State of North Dakota last week. The Senate was not in \nsession. We did not have votes. I guess I was in 20 or 25 different \ncommunities all across the State, probably at three dozen different \nevents, town meetings and speeches and various things. It will not \nsurprise anyone to learn that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \ndid not come up. We talked about farm policy. We talked about virtually \nevery other thing. We talked about water policy, we talked about \nwelfare, but at none of the meetings in which we discussed public \nissues did anyone raise the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I want to raise the question about this treaty because the President \nof the United States signed this treaty 2\\1/2\\ years ago and sent it to \nthe Senate for ratification. This Senate did not hold a hearing on it \nduring the 105th Congress, no hearing at all. It is now 6 months into \nthe new Congress, with no hearing. I, with some of my colleagues, am \norganizing a letter to the appropriate committee and key people on the \ncommittee to say we would like to see movement here. If one Senator \nopposes this country joining the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, \nthen bring it out here and let's have that debate. I cannot conceive of \nsignificant opposition to a determination by so many countries in the \nworld that we ought to prevent nuclear testing; we ought to have an \nagreement that we do not want the spread of nuclear weapons to \nadditional countries.\n  In the past year or so we have seen activities that concern me and \nmany of my colleagues a great deal. We know how many countries possess \nnuclear weapons. Among those countries that are understood to possess \nnuclear weapons we can now add India and Pakistan, because each of them \nexploded nuclear weapons under each other's noses. These are two \ncountries that do not like each other a great deal. There are great \ntensions. In fact, yesterday on the news you would have seen shelling \non the border between Pakistan and India. Each of these countries \nexploded nuclear weapons, apparently just to show the other country \nthey possess nuclear bombs.\n  North Korea is testing medium-range missiles, firing missiles down \nrange. The country of Iran is testing medium-range missiles. Are these \nthings ominous? Of course they are. Terrorist states acquiring delivery \nmechanisms for long-range missiles and potentially, I assume, to send \nweapons of mass destruction to other parts of the world; is that an \nominous development? You bet it is.\n  We spent a lot of time here in the Senate talking about a national \nmissile defense; if we could just get a national missile defense put in \nplace in this country so if someone shoots a missile at our country we \ncan go up and hit that bullet with a bullet. I guess we have spent $100 \nbillion over the years trying to do that. There is not much talk about \nthe other things that have been far more successful, and that is arms \nreduction and test ban treaties banning nuclear tests, reducing nuclear \nweapons.\n  With consent, I hold up here the part that was taken from the wing of \na backfire bomber. This is the piece of a wing strut from a backfire \nbomber which had its wings sawed off at a former Soviet airbase in \nPriluki, Ukraine. During the cold war, when the Soviet Union was \nconsidered our adversary, the only way I could hold up a piece of the \nwing of one of their bombers was if we had shot the bomber down. So how \ndoes it happen I hold up a portion of a wing of a Soviet backfire \nbomber? That wing was cut off. Why was it cut off? This country helped \nprovide the funds to cut the wings off bombers in the Soviet Union and \nnow Russia and now the Ukraine.\n\n  Why did they agree to that? Because we have an arms control reduction \nagreement in which missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at the United \nStates of America that used to be buried in the ground in the Ukraine \nare now taken out of the ground and dismantled with the warhead still \non. I displayed a picture on the floor of the Senate showing where a \nmissile used to rest in a silo in the Ukraine with the warhead aimed at \nthe United States of America. A sunflower field now exists there. No \nmissile, no nuclear bomb--sunflowers. How did that missile get taken \nout? How did this backfire Soviet bomber wing get chopped off? We have \narms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union, the old Soviet Union, \nand now Russia and the Ukraine, and they are working.\n  We have people here who say: We do not care about those agreements. \nWe want to build a national missile defense system. It doesn't matter \nwhat it costs. It doesn't matter whether it will work. We just want to \nspend the money so we will feel good.\n  One part of what works in arms control, in my judgment, is the Nunn-\nLugar funds which we have spent that accomplished this. The second \npart, in my judgment, is to pass pieces of legislation that we know \nmake sense for this country's future and for the safety of the world. \nOne of those is the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This country \nneeds to pass it. This Senate needs to ratify it. That is the way, as a \ncountry, we make judgments about it.\n  I want to hold up a chart that shows the support for it. This was \npolling done in a range of States around the country: Oregon, Nebraska, \nUtah, Ohio, Kansas, Colorado, Tennessee--support for the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. Look at it. Mr. President, 86 percent in favor \nto 10 percent in Oregon who believe we should not ratify this treaty. \nThis country signed it; so have many other countries around the world, \n152 countries.\n  This country has a responsibility, in my judgment, to provide \nleadership, and leadership will mean this Senate ought to ratify it. In \norder to do that, we must get this treaty out of the committee and get \nit to the floor and have a debate on it. I urge my colleagues who feel \nstrongly about this to join me and say to the committee it is time, \nlong past the time, when this Senate should ratify the Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I will, in coming days, speak again on the floor on this issue and \nthe importance of it. I hope I will be joined by plenty of colleagues \nwho will encourage and urge and push, if necessary, the committee to \nbring this treaty to the floor. Give us a chance to debate this treaty \nand give us a chance to produce the votes to ratify this treaty, for \nthis country's sake and for the sake of added security and safety in \nthe world. We must prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We must \nprevent the spread of technology that allows the delivery of nuclear \nweapons. One way to do that, in my judgment, is to prevent additional \nnuclear testing, and the way to do it is to ratify this treaty.\n  It is long past the time to do it, and we ought to do it now and we \nought to expect that be reported to the floor for debate in the next 2 \nto 3 months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6457-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6457-S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The statement that was just made by the chairman of \nthe committee, the Senator from North Dakota, is certainly appropriate.\n  I agree in every way. The fact is, it is very important that we do \neverything we can to ratify this treaty, and also the Nunn-Lugar money \nhas been some of the money that has been most well spent. I do not know \nof any money we have spent in recent years that has done more good than \nthat money spent to make sure the former Soviet Union is helped to \nretire some of their weapons of mass destruction.

Mr. President, yesterday, I got up very early. I had a 6:30 \na.m. flight leaving from Reno, NV. I was very concerned because that \nsame day, that same time, my friend and someone who is very important \nto the State of Nevada, Andre Agassi, was playing for the championship \nof the French Open. This is a tournament that is world renowned. My \nfriend and one of Nevada's favorite citizens was playing in that \nchampionship.\n  Just a few months ago, he had a series of injuries, and people said \nhe was not going to compete anymore on the high scale he had in the \npast. He surprised everyone, except himself and the people from the \nState of Nevada. We have seen this young man time and time again do \nthings that were said could not be done. There were people who said \nover the years he did not have the basic skills great tennis players \nhave, but he, of course, has shown them that simply is not true.\n  When I arrived in Denver, one of the first things I did was run to a \ntelevision set to see how Andre was doing. How disappointed I was. He \nhad lost the first two sets, and lost them overwhelmingly; he had been \nbeaten, and he was behind in the third set. If you lose the third set, \nit is all over. On the entire trip from Denver to Washington, I was \nvery despondent. This opportunity for Andre Agassi to make world \nhistory was slowly dissipating as I traveled the skies. I knew the news \nwould be bad when I arrived at Dulles.\n  I asked the first person whom I had a chance: What happened to Andre? \nHe said he won. He won the French Open.\n  I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Andre Agassi. As I have \nalready mentioned, he is a prominent Nevadan who has become the first \nman in 30 years to win tennis' four grand slam events. Andre, who lost \nthe first two sets to Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev, rallied in dramatic \nform, to say the least, to win the French Open on June 6, 1999, \nyesterday. He won at Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and the \nAustralian Open in 1995. Andre Agassi now joins the ranks of tennis \nimmortals Fred Perry, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, and Rod Laver. Not only \ndoes this assure him of a place in the record books, but also marks a \nsuccessful resurgence into the very elite of the tennis world.\n  Andre in previous years has been ranked No. 1. He started a few \nmonths ago, ranked 140th in the Nation. He now, of course, is in the \ntop 10 and is rising to where he will be ranked No. 1 again. He was \nranked as high as No. 3 about a year ago.\n  Andre Agassi has proven himself to be not only a world-class athlete \nbut a great citizen of the State of Nevada who has continually given \nback to his community. He should be recognized not only for his \nathletic prowess, but he should be recognized for what he has done in \ncharitable endeavors in the State of Nevada.\n  In April of 1998, the Andre Agassi Boys and Girls Club in west Las \nVegas, a minority community, was chartered as the 2,000th Boys and \nGirls Club in the Nation. This club provides a positive alternative to \ntime on the streets for the youth of Las Vegas and is dedicated to the \naid and education of children who are at risk of becoming involved with \ngangs, drugs, or both.\n  Not only has Andre Agassi done this, but he has also founded the \nAndre Agassi Charitable Foundation dedicated to the continued support \nof children's organizations, as well as domestic violence support \nprograms.\n  Andre Agassi has done more than make appearances. He personally has \ngiven and raised millions of dollars to these charities. He is an \noutstanding example of an athlete and demonstrates how they should \nreturn to their communities.\n  I admire Andre Agassi for a number of reasons, some of which I have \nlaid out today. He is a great athlete and, of course, we all admire \ngreat athletes. He is a great athlete who has returned much to his \ncommunity. But one of the reasons I admire Andre Agassi is he has not \nforgotten from where he came. He recognizes the millions he has made in \nendorsements, and playing tennis did not come, in effect, because he \nwas born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He recognizes he came from a \nfamily that had very little. He came from a family that worked in the \nrestaurants and hotels of Las Vegas. He has not forgotten his roots. It \nis this trait I admire more than any other of this world renowned \nathlete. I am pleased to acknowledge the achievements of this great \nathlete, great Nevadan, great American, Andre Agassi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6458-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1122, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1122) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair for bringing the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2000 before the Senate.\n  It is my privilege to once again bring this defense bill to the \nMembers of the Senate in partnership with my distinguished colleague, \nthe Senator from Hawaii.\n  I hope all Senators were able to see or at least learn of the very \ndistinguished memorial that was created to honor the 442nd, which was \nthe most decorated unit of World War II; our colleague, Senator Inouye, \nwas part of that unit. I am very pleased we are once again able to come \nbefore the Senate to pursue a matter of great concern to each of us, \nand that is the defense of our country.\n  We have served together on this subcommittee now for more than 20 \nyears, and we have been chairman or ranking member, depending upon the \npolitical tides of this country. I want the Senate to know that I could \nnot have brought this bill to the Senate so early this year without the \nwisdom, experience, and judgment of my good friend from Hawaii.\n  I also commend Senator Levin and Senator Warner of the authorization \ncommittee for their handling of the defense authorization bill. We have\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nworked closely together with that committee to stay close to the budget \nand the policy determinations which were made in the armed services \nbill. Amendments which we will offer later today reflect adjustments \nmade to that bill to make this appropriations bill fully compatible \nwith the authorization process.\n  As Senator Inouye and I reported to the committee when we considered \nthis bill in the committee, and as reflected by the Armed Services \nCommittee in their bill, the military has faced a difficult challenge \nin meeting critical readiness and quality-of-life needs while \nmodernizing our total force for the 21st century.\n  The armed services have sought to maintain that balance while \nundertaking contingency operations in the Balkans, southwest Asia, and \nthe heightened alert on the Korean peninsula. Last month, the Congress, \nat our request, provided a second emergency supplemental bill for the \nfiscal year 1999 to meet some of those contingency requirements.\n  For fiscal year 2000, our committee was presented a budget that \nreflected real progress compared to the original forecast for the \nupcoming fiscal year.\n  More realistic estimates for the Bosnia operations and procurement \nand development of a national missile defense system established a \nbetter baseline for our national defense program.\n  Initiatives by OMB did leave real holes in the budget for fiscal year \n2000, with incremental funding for MILCON, the military construction \nbill, and a $1.65 billion unspecified rescission recommended by the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  The budget resolution adopted by Congress has provided adjustments \nfor the defense function that offset some of those defense gaps.\n  The $8.3 billion increase in the new defense budget authority enabled \nthe committee to restore the military construction reduction and to \noffset the suggested rescission. In addition, needed increases were \nprovided for defense functions of the Energy and Water and \nTransportation Subcommittees.\n  Our bill reported by the Appropriations Committee is within the \n302(B) allocation for the Defense Subcommittee. That is an allocation \nmade pursuant to the budget resolution.\n  As I noted at the outset, the bill before the Senate follows closely \nthe Defense Department authorization bill that passed this Senate by a \nvote of 94-4. Our bill fully funds the authorized 4.8-percent pay raise \nfor military personnel. This bill adds $598 million to the O \naccounts, the operation and maintenance accounts, and provides \nflexibility to accommodate a larger civilian pay raise, if that is \nauthorized. The increase in O spending will also protect the \nreadiness of our forces and the quality of life for military personnel \nand their families.\n  This bill before the Senate does not include any funding for the war \nin Kosovo; no assumptions are made concerning either extension of the \nair war or a ground campaign or peacekeeping force. At this tense \nmoment in the peace negotiations in Europe, I hope all Members of the \nSenate will be cognizant of these efforts in their comments and the \namendments offered to this bill.\n  We will probably have another supplemental yet for peacekeeping \noperations in Kosovo for fiscal year 2000. That additional funding will \nbe essential to avoid reductions in readiness and modernization for the \narmed services next year, if there is a peacekeeping operation, which \nwe all expect.\n  To achieve the modernization goals by Secretary Cohen and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the recommendation increases procurement spending by \n$2.7 billion.\n  Looking further out in the future to the next generation of weapons \nsystems, the bill before the Senate recommends an increase of $2.1 \nbillion in research and development.\n  Funding for the defense health program continues to be the fastest \ngrowing component of our defense budget. The request for fiscal year \n2000 grew by 7 percent compared to the appropriation of 1999. And the \nrecommendation provides an increase of more than $1 billion for fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  Included in that defense health program is $300 million for medical \nresearch, with $175 million allocated to breast cancer research and $75 \nmillion allocated for prostate cancer research.\n  One new initiative is the transfer of the responsibility for the \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen homes from the Labor, Health, and Human \nServices Subcommittee to our Defense Subcommittee. These facilities are \nmore appropriately funded in conjunction with the Department of \nDefense, in our judgment. I hope the Senate will approve that \nrecommendation.\n  To reflect fact-of-life economic assumption changes since the budget \nwas prepared last autumn, our bill makes a series of adjustments. These \nchanges are based upon the Department of Defense authorization bill and \nrevised Office of Management Budget estimates. These estimates and \nitems include adjusted prior year inflation rates, fuel costs, foreign \ncurrency rates, and underexecution of civilian personnel allowances. \nAll of those are adjustments that must be made to the bill.\n  The bill also includes a general provision, section 8108, that \nreduces funding to reflect the amounts anticipated to carry over from \nthe recently enacted Kosovo supplemental.\n  Mr. President, $3.1 billion is reduced from this bill and was shifted \nto the Deficiencies Subcommittee of our Committee. Those funds will be \nreallocated to other subcommittees as we proceed with the remaining \nfiscal year 2000 bills.\n  This adjustment holds the total defense funding for the fiscal year \nat roughly the level set in the budget resolution that was adopted by \nCongress earlier this year.\n  The Appropriations Committee also reported S. 1186, the Department of \nEnergy appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. That bill contains \nnearly $12 billion in defense funding. Our committee will also report \nthe military construction bill later this week.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Inouye for his support and input in this \nbill and thank him again for his cooperation.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii for any statement he \nwishes to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before I proceed, I thank my colleague \nfrom Alaska for his very generous remarks.\n  I will take a few moments to discuss the DOD appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000. Let me begin by congratulating our chairman, Senator \nTed Stevens of Alaska.\n  To meet our Senate leaders' desire, the chairman and his staff \nexpedited the review and preparation time and put this bill together. \nThen, after they had crafted a very good package, as you know, we were \ntold to reduce this package by $3 billion. We had to go back to the \ndrawing board again.\n  When one takes into consideration how this package was reshaped to \nmeet those very difficult goals, I believe the committee has prepared \nthe best bill that could have been recommended.\n  First of all, if adopted, it will fulfill the committee's No. 1 \npriority. It will provide adequate funding to ensure that our men and \nwomen in the armed services are fairly compensated. It also will \nprovide sufficient funding so that they can be well prepared, trained, \nand ready to meet the Nation's requirements.\n  This bill funds a 4.8-percent pay raise, the largest percentage \nincrease since the early 1980s. This increase is between 2 and 3 \npercent more than current forecasts of inflation. The bill also funds \nchanges in the military retirement system and reforms the pay table \nsought by the administration.\n  The total funding in the bill represents an increase of $1.4 billion \nabove the President's budget request. In addition to fully funding the \nneeds of our military personnel, the bill provides $300 million for \nadditional medical research: As the chairman indicated, $175 million \nfor breast cancer research; $75 million for prostate cancer research, \nand $50 million to cover many of the high-priority medical research \nprograms of interest to the Members.\n  More than $2.8 billion is added for procurement for two more F-16 \naircraft, 15 more Black Hawk helicopters, and a half-billion-dollar \ndownpayment in the next Marine amphibious assault ship, the LXD-8.\n  For research for new technology, the bill is $2 billion over the \nPresident's request. This includes $400 million for missile defense and \nrelated programs.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  The bill before us does not match, dollar for dollar, the \nauthorization bill we approved last month, but it is in general quite \nconsistent with the recommendations of the authorizing committee.\n  To my colleagues on my side of the aisle, I realize that the bill \nprovides funds in some areas which you may not all endorse fully. But, \nin total, the bill offers a good balance between current operations and \nfuture modernization. It funds both the needs of the military and the \npriorities of the Congress. I believe it is a very good bill that we \nshould all support.\n  In closing, may I just add a footnote to my remarks.\n  Senator Stevens and I are two of the few remaining Members who served \nin World War II, the ``ancient'' war. In that war, over 10 percent of \nour Nation's population stepped forward to put on the uniform of the \narmed services. Today, fewer than 1 percent have done so.\n  Today's military force is an All Volunteer Force. But beyond that, \nthere are other vast differences.\n  In my youth, only 4 percent of my regiment had dependents. The \nremaining 96 percent were single men. Today, the average is about 70 \npercent with dependents. Therefore, it is essential that we provide in \nareas that were not considered during World War II, such as day care \ncenters and hospitals.\n  In the hospital in which Senator Stevens and I spent some time, there \nwere just men--men in uniform. It may be of interest to Members to note \nthat today at Walter Reed, 14 percent of the beds are occupied by \nactive-duty personnel, and 86 percent are occupied by dependents and \nretirees. There are more gynecologists in hospitals today than \northopedic surgeons, and there are more pediatricians than orthopedic \nsurgeons. That is a difference of which most Members of the Senate, and \nI believe most Americans, are not aware.\n  The largest cost of defense is not missiles; it is not bullets; it is \nnot ships; it is personnel; it is people. If we want the best military, \nmen and women who are willing to step forward in harm's way and, if \nnecessary, give their lives for our Nation, then we should be able to \nprovide the very best--not just in pay, but make certain that their \nhealth care and educational system are the finest.\n  We use the phrase ``quality of life'' quite often. If quality of life \nis not what the people receive, then I don't think we can anticipate \nthe very best of our Nation volunteering to serve. After all, I want my \nson to go to college; I am certain that a man in uniform wants his son \nor his daughter to go to college. We should give them the same \nopportunity.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a staff member, Patricia Boyle, be given \nthe privilege of the floor during this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 540\n\n     (Purpose: To reduce to $500,000 the threshold amount for the \napplicability of the requirement for advance matching of Department of \n            Defense disbursements to particular obligations)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to the \nfact that yesterday, June 6, marked the 31st anniversary of the death \nof a former Member of this body, Senator Robert F. Kennedy. I can think \nof no more fitting way to remember Robert Kennedy's legacy than to \nrecall some of the words he delivered to students at the annual Day of \nReaffirmation of Academic and Human Freedom at the University of Cape \nTown in South Africa.\n  Ironically, this speech was delivered June 6, 1966, just 2 years \nbefore Robert Kennedy's death. I will read portions of the speech:\n\n       Our answer is . . . to rely on youth. The cruelties and \n     obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to \n     obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by \n     those . . . who prefer the illusion of security to the \n     excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful \n     progress.\n       This world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of \n     life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of \n     the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of \n     the appetite for adventure over the love of ease . . . .\n       These [people] moved the world, and so can we all.\n\n  I am reading portions of the speech.\n\n       Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but \n     each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and \n     in the total of all those acts will be written the history of \n     this generation.\n\n  This is perhaps my favorite quote from what anyone has ever said.\n\n       It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief \n     that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for \n     an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes \n     out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, \n     and crossing each other from a million different centers of \n     energy and daring those ripples build a current which can \n     sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\n\n  Robert Kennedy's brother, our colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, has \nsaid that his brother ``need not be idealized or enlarged in death \nbeyond what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good and \ndecent man who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried \nto heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.''\n  I do not presume to improve upon either Robert Kennedy's own words or \nupon his brother's tribute. I recall the words today only to mark June \n6 1968, as a tragic and sad day in the history of our country. As Ted \nhas said, to pray that what Robert Kennedy ``was to us and what he \nwished for others will some day come to pass for all the world.''\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I listened to my colleague, Senator Inouye, in his \nopening remarks. He reminded me of an issue that I think is extremely \nimportant. Over this Memorial Day recess, the DAV, Disabled American \nVeterans, organized a big forum in Minnesota. I think they had 130 \nforums over the recess period. The veterans wanted to\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nfocus attention on our commitment--hopefully, our commitment--to \nveterans.\n  They were saying there is a whole set of issues that are really \nimportant to their lives. Some of them have to do with the ever-aging \nveteran's population and how we will deal with these needs. Some of \nthem have to do with veterans, a third of the homeless population being \nveterans, which I think is just a national disgrace. Many of those \nveterans are struggling with substance abuse problems and they were \nsaying: Where is the treatment for these veterans? But some of what \nthey were saying was, even if you put aside some of these challenges \nand the flatline budget proposed by the President--and then they were \nlooking at our budget resolution and what we have come up with--it \ndoesn't even keep up with medical inflation.\n\n  The point was: We are worried about access to services. We are \nworried about much longer waits. We are worried about a lot of the \nstaffs at medical centers having to work double shifts. We are worried \nabout some of the facilities having to close. We are worried about not \nbeing able to get the care that we so desperately need and, I argue, so \nclearly deserve.\n  I just wanted to say, since I heard my colleague from Hawaii speak--\nas he knows, I am critical of the Pentagon budget. I admire the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, and I absolutely mean that, but I don't usually agree with \nthese budgets. I usually disagree with some portions. As long as we are \ntalking about our Armed Forces, I hope when we get to the veterans \nappropriations bill, we will get this right, and I hope we will make \nthe investment we should make.\n  There is a considerable amount of indignation on the part of \nveterans. And they are right; I wish they were wrong, but I have had a \nchance to see some of this firsthand. They just feel a sense of \nbetrayal. I hope we are going to rectify what I think is a real \ninjustice to veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6461-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the other matter I wanted to bring up \nis the amendment to the DOD authorization bill which lost on a 50-49 \nvote. I don't know whether I will do an amendment on this bill or \nwhether I will wait for the bankruptcy bill, but my amendment had to do \nwith the compelling need for all of us as responsible policymakers to \ndo some systematic and systemic evaluation of what is going on with \nwelfare reform.\n  I want to know about those mothers and those children. I have come to \nthe floor and I have said it is fine that we have reduced the caseload \nby a third, or thereabouts, but the question is; has the reduction in \nwelfare led to a reduction in poverty? Where are the women and \nchildren? What kind of jobs do they have? What kind of wages do they \nearn? Is there decent child care?\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues the General Accounting \nOffice report of May 27, 1999, and I point out a quote on page 2 at the \nbeginning of this report:\n\n       Because there are no Federal requirements for States to \n     report on the status of former welfare recipients, the only \n     systematic data currently available on families who have left \n     welfare come from research efforts initiated by States to \n     meet their own information needs.\n\n  Then they go on to point out that only States currently provide \nadequate data. So I will be coming to the floor again and taking up a \nconsiderable amount of time. I will be drawing from a lot of reports \nabout some pretty brutal conditions, because I am determined to win \nthis vote. I really do believe that it is not too much to ask that the \nSenate--for that matter, the House of Representatives--go on record \ncalling on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to call on States \nto provide the data as to what is happening to these families. Yes, \nthey are poor families, and I understand that sometimes to be poor and \nto be on welfare is to be despised in America, but I think we ought to \nknow what is going on with these women and children. That is what we \nare talking about--women and children.\n\n  So I thought, since I had a moment, I would announce that maybe on \nthis bill, or maybe on the next bill, I am going to come back with this \namendment, and I will bring out some of the important reports by the \nConference of Mayors, the Catholic Church's Network Organization, which \nhas done some wonderful work, and what the Conference of State \nLegislatures is saying, and the reports on the rise of homelessness \nwith a special emphasis on the population of women and children. Then, \nafter going through all of that, and also talking about some of my own \nobservations as a Senator who has done a lot of work with low- and \nmoderate-income people, one more time, I will call on the Senate to \nvote for this very reasonable amendment.\n  We ought to know what is going on in the country. It is irresponsible \nfor us not to have the information to see whether or not this \nlegislation is really working. I say that because pretty soon, over the \nnext couple of years, we are going to reach a drop-dead date where, in \nall of the States--5 years being the maximum period of time from when \nwe pass this bill--everybody is going to be driven off the rolls. There \nis going to be no assistance any longer. Of course, we are talking \nabout a lot of women who have been battered, who have struggled with \nsubstance abuse, and who have struggled with mental illness. It is not \nclear whether they are going to be able to work or what will happen to \nthem and their children. It is not at all clear what is happening right \nnow to some women and children in this country. Have we made it \npossible for them to move to economic self-sufficiency, to live more \nindependent lives?\n  I say to the Chair, who cares an awful lot about children, are these \nchildren better off? We need to know. I want to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues that I want to come back with this amendment, and I am \nhoping that a couple of Senators, this time around, will be willing to \nvote for it on a different piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6461-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1122\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The Home Base Commander is currently Major General \nKenneth R. Bowra, Commander and Commandant, U.S. Army John F. Kennedy \nSpecial Warfare Center and School.\n  The U.S. Army Regimental System was created by Army Regulation 600-82 \n``to enhance combat effectiveness through a framework that provides the \nopportunity for affiliation, develops loyalty and commitment, fosters \nan extended sense of belonging, improves unit esprit, and \ninstitutionalizes the war fighting ethos to provide each soldier with a \ncontinuous identification with a single regiment.''\n  On June 16, 1989, an activation ceremony for the Corps was conducted \nduring the Civil Affairs Association Annual Conference in Pensacola, \nFlorida. At that time, the Corps distinctive standard was uncased and \nthe Corps insignia adopted. The following designations were made: MG \nWilliam R. Berkman as Honorary Chief of Civil Affairs; COL Eli E. \nNobleman as Honorary Colonel; CSM Raymond A. Lash as Honorary Sergeant \nMajor; COL Joseph P. Kirlin III as Adjutant; and COL Kalman A.

Currently, there are more than 2,200 soldiers who are \nmembers of the Corps.\n  The Corps Committee operates under a charter to provide advice and \nassistance to the Honorary Chief of Civil Affairs and the Corps Home \nBase Commander with respect to Corps matters. The Corps Committee \npresently includes the Chairman, Adjutant, Honorary Colonel, Honorary \nWarrant Officer, Honorary Sergeant Major, Commanding Generals and \nCommand Sergeant Majors of the five major Civil Affairs commands and \nother members designated by the Honorary Chief of Civil Affairs. The \nHome Base Commander and the Honorary Chief of Civil Affairs are ex-\nofficio members. The Committee meets biannually at the times and sites \nof the meeting of the Civil Affairs Association Board of Directors.\n  Support to the Corps is provided by the Civil Affairs Association. \nThe Association has existed since its formation in 1947 with a \nprincipal purpose to maintain and enhance the Civil Affairs \ncapabilities required by the Armed Forces of our Nation. Support of the \nCorps is included in the broad objectives of the Association. The Corps \nand the Association have worked together to implement their common \nobjectives.\n  The efforts of the Corps and Association to enhance Civil Affairs \nsoldiers' esprit de corps have included:\n  1. Civil Affairs Symposium. Co-sponsorship in 1991 of a symposium at \nU.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort \nBragg on ``Civil Affairs in the Persian Gulf War'' and publication of \nthe proceedings of that symposium.\n  2. Commemorative Stone. The 1994 dedication of a Civil Affairs \ncommemorative stone and its emplacement in the Memorial Plaza of the \nHeadquarters, U.S. Army Special Operations Command which recognizes the \nservice of soldiers in Civil Affairs/Military Government assignments--\npast, present, and future.\n  3. Shrivenham Plaque.

The first medallion was presented to \nSenator Strom Thurmond who served in combat in World War II as a G-5 \nstaff officer and later, in the Army Reserve, commanded major Civil \nAffairs units and retired as a Major General.\n  7. Awards Programs--Units. Distinguished Unit Citations have been \nawarded to Civil Affairs units in recognition of their accomplishments \nand contributions in military operations in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, \nthe Persian Gulf War and Haiti.

MEINERS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on July 1, my friend, Donald Meiners, \nwill retire from Entergy-Mississippi after 39 years of service. Mr. \nMeiners began his career in 1960 as a residential salesman in Jackson \nfor what was then Mississippi Power & Light Company. He was quickly \npromoted in the marketing and operations divisions which involved \nnumerous moves across the state of Mississippi. He became an officer in \n1978. After several promotions with Middle South Utilities, the parent \ncompany of MP, which now is Entergy Corporation, Don returned to his \nhome state of Mississippi as president and chief operating officer of \nEntergy-MS. Then, he became president and chief executive officer.\n  While Mr. Meiners is well respected in the corporate world, many \nMississippians know him for his dedication and service to charities and \ncivic organizations within his community and state. He has served as \nChairman of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of Commerce, Jackson United Way \nand the Multiple Sclerosis Chapter of Mississippi.\n  While Chairman of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of Commerce, Don was \ninstrumental in forming the Metro Economic Development Alliance which \nunites economic development professionals in the Jackson area and \nencourages a team effort in recruiting new industry to the area. He \nserved as the first chairman of the Metro Jackson Housing Partnership. \nDon has also been a leader of national organizations as well. He serves \nas a National Trustee of Boys and Girls Clubs of America and just last \nyear served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Business and \nIndustry Political Action Committee in Washington, DC.\n  Duane O'Neill, who is President of the Metro-Jackson Chamber of \nCommerce, said, ``Don Meiners personifies a visionary leader, and he \npossesses the technical skills to translate that vision into action. \nHis unquestioned integrity has always brought people together in an \natmosphere of cooperation.''\n  I am personally grateful for Don's work and involvement to help \nimprove the state's economy. As an example of his outstanding community \nservice, in 1996, Don Meiners was recognized as the outstanding \nvolunteer of the year in economic development for the state of \nMississippi.\n  Don has been married for 42 years to his high school sweetheart, Pat, \nwho has been a tremendous asset to him and to the communities where \nthey have lived. They have two sons, Chris and Chuck, and a daughter-\nin-law Pam. When I asked Don what he would do in retirement he quickly \nmentioned spending time with the ``light of his life'', his \ngranddaughters Hannah and Mallory.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate the career and influence of my friend Don Meiners, and to \nthank him for his many years of service to Entergy and the people of \nMississippi. Mississippi is a better place because of him. While Don is \nretiring from the utility business, I know he will go on working to \nhelp make life better in his community and in our state.\n  I wish Don and Pat much continued success and happiness in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6464-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6464-S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE D-DAY LANDINGS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, June 6, 1999, was the 55th Anniversary \nof the historic Allied invasion of Europe on the beaches of Normandy, \nFrance, that spelled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.\n  In America today, with unprecedented prosperity and material comfort, \nit is hard to appreciate the American experience leading up to World \nWar II and the war itself.\n  When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States was \nnot only caught off guard, we were also caught unprepared for the war \nthat loomed in Europe and in the Pacific that would involve the United \nStates for 5 long years.\n  Still plagued by the Great Depression, unemployment sky high and \npoverty all around, Americans accepted the challenge and responded like \nno people ever had.\n  With scrap metal drives, rubber drives, gasoline and food rationing, \nand other efforts American men and women pulled together and \ncontributed to the massive war effort.\n  Americans of all races, creeds, colors, and backgrounds joined the \nmilitary, worked in industrial plants, and assisted in too many ways to \nmention as\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nthe nation joined together to battle tyranny and oppression.\n  America's economic and military might was called on to produce \nhundreds of thousands of planes, tanks, trucks, ships, boats, and \nweapons. We not only produced the materials for our own efforts but \nkept our Allies supplied with civilian and military goods to ensure an \nAllied victory.\n  The ``Arsenal of Democracy'' was running at high gear from 1941 on, \nand all of these efforts came to a head in June, 1944.\n  Even after the successful Africa campaign showed that the German war \nmachine was not invincible, America and her Allies looked for a \n``second front'' to draw Nazi Germany's attention and resources into \nother battles.\n  Under the leadership of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allies \nbegan planning for just such a front with an amphibious invasion in \nEurope and America's fighting forces made the necessary preparations.\n  Millions of men, and millions of tons of equipment, supplies, \nvehicles and weapons were delivered from the United States to England \nin preparation for the assault.\n  Postponed several times because of poor weather in the English \nChannel, on June 5, 1944, General Eisenhower gave the final order that \nwould unleash the historic battle.\n  In the morning hours of June 6th, over 175,000 men from the streets \nof Philadelphia to Indian reservations of Arizona, from Alaska to \nFlorida, landed on the beaches of Normandy, France.\n  In the years since that day, we have seen movies about this, the most \nambitious amphibious invasion ever attempted in history. Just last year \nwe saw it vividly replayed with the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' in \nwhat the soldiers themselves said was an accurate portrayal what \noccurred so many years ago.\n  As a veteran, and having read many eyewitness accounts of that day, I \nthink that the real horrors of that day, and especially the first \nminutes of that historic landing, are simply unimaginable to us.\n  Though the Allies enjoyed complete air superiority in the Normandy \narea, clouds shrouded the beaches diminishing the effect of Allied air \npower.\n  At the landing beach that quickly became known as ``Bloody Omaha'', \nthe Americans took the brunt of the German defenses.\n  Entire companies of men were chopped down seconds after the doors \ndropped on the landing craft. The Germans poured fire down on the \nAmericans, but they kept coming ashore wave after wave.\n  Only alter an exhaustive day of fighting and dying, was the beachhead \nestablished.\n  In 1999, it is easy to think of the D-Day invasion and of the Allied \nsuccess in World War II as pre-determined. In 1944, it just was not so \nand Eisenhower and the Allied leaders knew that at that point victory \nwas not assured and that the war could still be lost.\n  It is humbling to read the never-delivered address General Eisenhower \npenned in case the Allies were driven back into the sea.\n  In it, Eisenhower assumed all fault for a failed invasion attempt. \nThankfully, he never had to deliver that address.\n  From the beaches at Normandy, the Allies broke out, fought through \nthe hedgerows, and went on to liberate Paris in July, 1944.\n  From Paris to the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes, through the \nlow countries and ultimately sweeping on to Berlin the Allies--with the \nAmericans taking the lead--secured victory over Nazi Germany in April, \n1945.\n  It took four more months of island-to-island combat to defeat the \nJapanese Empire in August, 1945, and to achieve complete and total \nvictory in World War II.\n  This nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women who \nmade Normandy and the entire war effort the success it was.\n  With each day, scores of D-Day veterans, many in their late 70's and \n80's, pass away. As a generation, this group was unique in living and \nmaking real their unspoken code: faithfulness and duty to God, family, \nand country.\n  The brave men of Normandy--both the survivors and those buried in the \nAmerican Cemetery just up the hill from the landing beaches--from both \nhumble and privileged beginnings, deserve to be honored by the Senate \nand the nation as whole.\n  In this spirit I urge my colleagues to support me in honoring the \nveterans of D-Day and all veterans who have sacrificed for this great \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6465-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6465-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6465-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated on Thursday, April 22, 1999:\n\n       EC-2681.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark \nExpedition, and for other purposes, to the committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   the lewis and clark expedition bicentennial commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Lewis and \nClark Expedition Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.'' This act \nauthorizes the U.S. Mint to produce a commemorative coin honoring the \nLewis and Clark Expedition. This is a bill I introduced in the last \nCongress and which had the support of 43 other Senators. The bill is a \ncompanion to one that has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Bereuter.\n  I am introducing this legislation to ensure that one of America's \nfinest moments will be forever memorialized. The Lewis and Clark \nExpedition, called the Corps of Discovery, represents the finest in \nAmerican history. The Expedition began in 1803 when President Thomas \nJefferson commissioned the exploration of the newly purchased Louisiana \nTerritory and ended in 1806 with the Expedition's triumphant return.\n  When considering why we should commemorate the Expedition, it's \nimportant to recall Thomas Jefferson's vision for America's future and \nhis dedication to expanding not only our geographic frontiers, but the \nfrontiers of knowledge as well. Jefferson's vision is epitomized by his \ncommissioning of the Expedition. Further, the Expedition represents a \nhallmark for peaceful diplomacy, as demonstrated by the friendly \nrelations the Expedition established with the Native Americans it \nencountered on its journey. These are a few of the many valuable \nlessons from the Expedition that we should carry forward into the \nfuture.\n  The minting of the Lewis and Clark Commemorative Coin was endorsed in \nthe 1998 recommendations of the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \nCommittee (CCCAC), which was established by the 102nd Congress. If, as \nexpected, the coin sells out, approximately $5 million would be \navailable to help fund bicentennial celebrations. After the Treasury \nDepartment has recovered all costs of minting this coin, two-thirds of \nthe surcharge received would be available for the National Lewis and \nClark Bicentennial Council's commemorative activities.\n  The Council is an outgrowth of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage \nFoundation, Inc., which was created in 1969 to continue the work of the \nLewis and Clark Trail Commission, established by Congress in 1964. The \nremaining one-third of the surcharge will be donated to the National \nPark Service to help offset costs associated with their planned \nactivities to commemorate the bicentennial.\n  I feel confident that, with the support of my Senate colleagues and \nthe passage of this bill, we can appropriately celebrate a vibrant and \nhistorically significant event.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S.J.

Res. 28. A joint resolution disapproving the extension of the \nwaiver authority contained in section 402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \nwith respect to Vietnam; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               disapproval on trade benefits for vietnam\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two \nresolutions concerning our trade relationships with the People's \nRepublic of China and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Last Thursday, \nJune 3, 1999, the President of the United States formally recommended \nwaivers of the application of the Trade Act of 1974 provisions with \nrespect to China and Vietnam, thereby allowing U.S. taxdollars to \nsubsidize business operations in these countries. In the case of China, \nthe waiver also allows for continuation of most-favored-nation trade \nprivileges, now known as normal trade relations. Mr. President, there's \nvery little that is normal about our relationship with these communist \ncountries. In short, I think the President's policy is seriously flawed \nand deeply troubling, especially in view of recent events.\n  Mr. President, on November 26, 1974, in its report on the Trade Act, \nthe Senate Committee on Finance stated: ``The Committee recognizes that \nsegments of the private sector wish the U.S. Government to provide \ncredits and investment guarantees, and other conditions before private \ncapital investments are ventured. The Committee believes that it is \nequally reasonable to establish conditions on all basic human rights, \nincluding the right to emigrate, before extending broad concessions to \ncommunist countries.'' The resolutions I have introduced keep faith \nwith the original Congressional intent of the Trade Act of 1974. One \nneed only read the annual State Department Human Rights Reports on \nChina and Vietnam to recognize that they have failed to meet any \nrecognized standards with respect to human rights. Moreover, there are \na myriad of other national security and foreign policy issues \nconcerning our current relationship with Beijing and Hanoi--from \nwholesale espionage of our nuclear secrets to POW/MIA accounting--which \nwarrant support for my resolutions. We should not be putting profit \nover principle. These waivers from the President should be overturned \nby the Congress, using the procedures provided for by law. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

   and the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1789 were \n     principal events in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas these documents stand as the foundation of our form \n     of

Mr. President, today my good friend Senator Wyden \nand myself are filing an amendment in the Record to S. 542, the New \nMillennium Classrooms Act. The Abraham-Wyden amendment would mandate \nthat in order for a company to receive the enhanced computer donation \ntax credit, the computer must be equipped with an operating system, \nensuring donated computers will be fully operational as soon as they \nare received by schools.\n  All of us can agree that our schools are in desperate need of high \ntech computer equipment and Internet access. The New Millennium \nClassrooms Act address this need through enhanced tax incentives for \ncompanies donating computers to schools.\n  Mr. President, we can also agree that this valuable equipment is \nrendered useless if it is given to schools incomplete. To work \nproperly, computers must be furnished with an operating system. Without \nthis software, the equipment simply sits on a shelf until the school \nitself can find the means to procure and then install the necessary \noperating system. Mr. President, this equipment offers nothing toward a \nchild's knowledge and education if it is capable of little more than \nfilling storage space and gathering dust. The Abraham-Wyden amendment, \nrecognizing this reality, requires an operating system to be installed \non donated computers, guaranteeing complete, quality, ready-to-go \nequipment.\n  In addition, the Abraham-Wyden amendment would ensure that schools \nare not subjected to faulty or broken hardware. Without an operating \nsystem there is no way to tell if a donated computer is functioning \nproperly. Sophisticated hardware can be easily damaged during transport \nor even when the donating company's private files and documents are \nremoved. With an operating system installed, ascertaining the condition \nof the equipment is as simple as plugging it in and turning it one. \nWithout the operating system, it could be weeks before the school is \naware of any problems concerning the donation, burdening an already \nfinancially strapped school with added, and unnecessary, costs.\n  Mr. President, allow me to reiterate how important this technology is \nto our children's future. By the year 2000, less than one year from \nnow, more than 60 percent of all jobs in this country will demand high \ntech skills. Computers and the Internet continue to drastically change \nthe face of business and communications on a global level, developing \nat a pace far surpassing what anyone predicted even just a few years \nago. With the passage of the New Millennium Classrooms Act, all our \nchildren will have a chance at succeeding in the new technological \nmillennium.\n  I ask that the text of the letter of support from Microsoft for the \nNew Millennium Classrooms Act be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\n  The letter is printed as follows:\n\n                                            Microsoft Corporation,\n\n\n                                    Law and Corporate Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 28, 1999.\n     Hon.

We work closely with businesses, charitable \n     organizations, and educators in an effort to increase the \n     technology available in schools in order to create \n     opportunities for learning by our children.\n       to help accomplish this goal, Microsoft supports efforts to \n     stimulate the charitable donation of personal computers to \n     schools. The New Millennium Classrooms Act provides a helpful \n     incentive to spur donations of computers to schools. We also \n     appreciate your interest in ensuring that donated computers \n     have valid operating systems, which helps to promote \n     legitimate software use and to fight software piracy. Under \n     this program, Microsoft will approve a transfer without \n     charge from the donor to the school of the valid Microsoft \n     operating system license on the computer at the time of \n     transfer.\n       We believe the New Millennium Classrooms Classrooms Act is \n     helpful legislation for our nation's schools and we are proud \n     to support it.\n       Thank you for once again demonstrating your leadership on \n     high technology issues and your commitment to our nation's \n     schools and children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jack Krumholtz,\n         Director of Federal Government Affairs, Senior Corporate \n     Attorney.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6469-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 540\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Grassley) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n1122) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the general provisions, add the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nmake my colleagues aware of the accomplishments of an outstanding \nIllinois citizen. This Thursday, June 10, Ira P. Weinstein will turn \n80. As we celebrated Memorial Day just a week ago, I think it is \nappropriate to mention Mr. Weinstein's service to our country as it is \na constant reminder that without the dedication and bravery of so many \nlike him, the freedom we are privileged to enjoy could not be possible.\n  Born in Chicago, Illinois on June 10, 1919, Mr. Weinstein entered the \nU.S. Army Air Corps in 1942, just as America was being drawn into World \nWar II. Trained as a Navigator-Bombardier, Mr. Weinstein rose to the \nrank of First Lieutenant and proceeded to fly 25 missions during World \nWar II as a member of the 8th Air Force 445 Bomb Group, 702nd Squadron. \nAlthough the 24 previous missions he flew had been safe ones, Mr. \nWeinstein's 25th would be his most harrowing.\n  On September 27, 1944, Mr Weinstein's plane was shot down over \nGermany during the Kassell Mission. As he parachuted to the ground, Mr. \nWeinstein found safety and eluded capture for six days. Unfortunately, \nhe was found by the enemy and held as a Prisoner of War in Stalag Luft \nI, in Barth, Germany. On May 11, 1945, the camp where Mr. Weinstein was \nheld was liberated, ending an eight-month ordeal as a POW. For his \nheroism, Mr. Weinstein was awarded several distinguished service \nmedals. These include the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, the POW Medal, a \nPresidential Citation, the American Campaign and European Campaign \nMedals, the WW II Victory Medal, and the distinguished French Croix de \nGuerre.\n  After returning from the war, Mr. Weinstein, like so many others of \nhis generation, went on to become accomplished in the world of \nbusiness, building a successful advertising agency respected throughout \nthe Chicago area. Despite the loss of his wife several years ago, Mr. \nWeinstein, now retired, enjoys being a grandfather and takes special \npride in his expertise as a horticulturist.\n  I am pleased to take this opportunity today to honor an American hero \nand one of my constituents. As we did one week ago today, we should not \nhesitate to honor our defenders of freedom every day as we enjoy the \nliberty they fought so hard to protect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6469-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today, I would like to pay \ntribute to Mr. David S. Liederman, the outgoing Executive Director of \nthe Child Welfare league of America. Throughout his long, distinguished \ncareer, David Liederman has fought hard to make a difference in the \nlives of families and children, especially some of the most vulnerable \nchildren who are at risk of abuse and neglect.\n  Over many years, I have been privileged to work directly with David \nLiederman and the extraordinary team of dedicated professionals whom he \nhas assembled at the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA). David has \nthe unique ability to be a leader on a variety of levels--within his \nown organization, throughout the country with many CWLA affiliates, and \nin Washington as a policy maker and advocate.\n  Early in his career, he had the vision and the determination to seek \nbold policy answers by helping to creating the original Independent \nLiving Program. We worked closely together in 1993 to secure over a \nbillion dollars in new investments in prevention services for abused \nand neglected children. In 1997, David was an effective ally and \nadvocate in the effort to enact the Adoption and Safe Families Act \nwhich ensures that a child's health and safety are paramount, and \ncontinues the investments in prevention to deliver on this promise.\n  Those who know David Liederman's personal history are not surprised \nby his commitment, or his successful record of accomplishments. David \nbegan his career working directly with families and serving \ndisadvantaged youths living in public housing in the Boston area. These \nyears in the trenches instilled in him a sense of compassion and the \nchallenges wrought by the harsh realities many of our Nation's citizens \nface. After working in direct services, he went on to serve the people \nof Massachusetts first in the State Legislature and then as Chief of \nStaff\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nto Governor Michael Dukakis. After years of service in Massachusetts, \nDavid decided to focus on National issues when he accepted the helm of \nthe Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and began to lead national \ndiscussions setting the agenda on policy issues facing children and \nfamilies. For fifteen years, he led CWLA and was a well-known advocate \nand spokesman for needy children and families.\n  In honor of his many achievements, David Liederman won the 1996 Award \nfor Excellence in national Executive Leadership and the 1997 National \nLifetime Achievement Award from the national Association of Social \nWorkers.\n  I am proud to have worked with David Liederman over so many years, \nand am proud to call him a friend. His voice will be truly missed on \nchild welfare issues in Washington, But he has our best wishes as he \nseeks new challenges and opportunities in public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6470-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    McDONALD COUNTY SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to commend the \nsesquicentennial celebration of the founding of McDonald County, \nMissouri. On March 3, 1849, the Missouri State Legislature established \nMcDonald County, which was named in honor of a hero of the \nRevolutionary War, Alexander McDonald.\n  McDonald County is rich in hospitality, heritage and history. During \nthe Civil War, McDonald County was the scene of many battles, including \nbattles at Pineville on November 19, 1862, and August 13, 1983. Through \nthe hardships of the war, and through the challenges of peace, the good \npeople of McDonald County stood fast for the values of faith, family, \nfreedom, and hard work. Today, the county celebrates 150 years of \nhistory.\n  An exciting time came in 1938, during the Great Depression, when \nHollywood came to McDonald County to make the movie ``Jesse James,'' \nwhich starred Tyrone Powers, Henry Fonda, and Randolph Scott.\n  Each Christmas, the city of Noel in McDonald County receives \nthousands of cards from all over the country, and affixes the \n``Christmas City'' message on cards that wish the joy of the season to \nfamily and friends all over the U.S.\n  In addition to agriculture and industry, McDonald County is a \nparadise for outdoor recreation. Its rugged hills and valleys, watered \nby springs, rivers, and streams, attract thousands of anglers, boaters, \nhikers, and others.\n  It is an honor to join with the people of McDonald County in \ncelebrating 150 years of history. Mr. President, I ask that members of \nthe Senate join me in recognizing this historic milestone for McDonald \nCounty, Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6470-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNITION OF WV JUVENILE JUSTICE COMPLIANCE MONITORING BY DCJS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my honor to commend the \nWest Virginia Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) for its \noutstanding compliance monitoring program. The exceptional quality of \nthis program has been recognized by Attorney General Janet Reno and the \nDepartment of Justice as an example of how a monitoring program should \nwork. All new Juvenile Justice Compliance Monitors will travel to West \nVirginia to be trained by DCJS staff.\n  The West Virginia Division of Criminal Justice Services has an \nadmirable track record of meeting or surpassing the goals set for \njuvenile justice systems by federal and state regulations. In August \n1998, a five-year compliance audit of the DCJS reported a faultless \nmonitoring system for its juvenile justice and delinquency programs \n(JJDP). West Virginians are right to be proud of the efficient, \norganized system in use by DCJS, and we can take even more pride in the \nfact that the DCJS compliance monitoring program will serve as a guide \nfor compliance monitors throughout the country. West Virginia expertise \nand innovation will be instrumental in streamlining juvenile justice \nand delinquency prevention programs.\n  The recent acclaim for West Virginia's compliance monitoring program \nis a reflection of the many other virtues within the Division's \npurview. The success of the Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition plan \nhas prompted other states' juvenile justice agencies to model their \nprograms after West Virginia's. In her speech, Attorney General Reno \nnoted our state's Underage Drinking Plan as a possible approach for \nother jurisdictions. To their credit, the staff and management of DCJS \ndo not invest these laurels with more importance than they have. The \nhard-working people of DCJS understand that one of their agency's \ngreatest strengths is the sharing of responsibility and expertise among \nDCJS, state juvenile justice facilities, and other state agencies in \ncomplying with regulations. Rather than imposing its will on the \nagencies with which it works, DCJS builds lasting relationships with \ncorrectional facilities to help meet statutory and administrative \nmandates in a cooperative fashion.\n  Further, DCJS operates with a definite purpose and an open mind. The \nagency is firmly grounded in law, yet remains flexible with respect to \nimprovements and changes in regulations. Such a balance is particularly \nimportant in the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention context, \nwhere frequent governmental experiments result in the involvement of \nnew agencies and new personnel, and increased societal vigilance adds \neven more members to the pool of at-risk youth. Finally, through its \ncarefully organized and straightforward monitoring program, DCJS \nstrives to teach while it continues to serve. In so many respects, the \nWest Virginia DCJS juvenile justice program is a model for the nation.\n  I wish to express my sincere admiration and heartfelt thanks to the \nDivision of Criminal Justice Services for making juvenile justice \nservices in West Virginia, and now the rest of America, more efficient \nand effective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6470-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATION OF THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ALLIED INVASION AT \n                                NORMANDY\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 55th \nanniversary of the Allied invasion at Normandy. On June 6, 1944, \ncourageous members of our Armed Forces defended the world from assaults \nagainst humanity. During that misty and chilly day, 156,000 Allied \nsoldiers crossed the English channel in one of history's greatest \nmilitary operations. Every soldier, every sailor, and every airman \nunited to challenge the injustices that terrorized and enslaved Europe. \nWith soldiers from other Allied nations, American soldiers stormed the \nbeaches, bombed enemy encampments, fought in the front lines, and \nensured Europe's liberation.\n  When the paratroopers descended from the dark skies and the soldiers \ncharged forward from the churning seas, the tide of the war changed. \nWhile we salute those who returned from this battle and World War II to \nenjoy the world they liberated, we also remember those who never came \nhome. On D-Day alone, 2,500 of our GIs gave their lives for the hope of \na better tomorrow. When the Allied forces defeated Nazi Germany 11 \nmonths later, it was reaffirmed that they did not die in vain.\n  These dedicated Americans secured the future and freedoms that we now \nenjoy. All Americans are forever in debt to the members of our Armed \nServices, past and present, who put their lives on the line to \nguarantee our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6470-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6470-S6471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHARACTER COUNTS!\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Character Counts! initiative introduced by Senator \nDomenici and others on May 6, 1999. I avidly support education in West \nVirginia and the United States, and I believe this should include an \nemphasis on basic character and good citizenship. In the words of \nTheodore Roosevelt: ``To educate a person in mind and not in morals is \nto educate a menace to society.''\n  Character Counts! recognizes and addresses that there is a connection \nbetween one's personal life and one's business or political abilities. \nCharacter Counts! understands that morals and character development go \nhand in hand, and that it is never too late to teach the tools to help \ndevelop personal character. The promotion of healthy character \ndevelopment is a necessary precursor to reaching the ultimate goal of \nteaching people to take personal responsibility.\n  The Character First! training series is based in Oklahoma City, \nOklahoma. The Character Bulletin Series provides\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\na flexible system that is designed to meet any needs or schedule. It \nuses a monthly four-step program to teach necessary tools for character \ndevelopment. The first step of every month is a Character Bulletin. \nThis provides a character quality, such as virtue, along with tools to \nhelp build it. The second step contains Supplements, including the \nIntroducing ``Character'' Leadership Supplement, which provides \nadditional resources for teaching others about the character quality, \nand Building ``Character'' Leadership Notes, which challenges those in \npositions of leadership to hold themselves to higher standards. The \nthird step is called Character at Home, and provides ways to use the \nCharacter Bulletin Series at home. This step is particularly helpful \nfor parents who want to play an active role in their child's \ndevelopment. The final part of the series is a Character Poster, a full \ncolor poster to remind people of the quality of the month. Recently a \ncooperative effort to promote Character Counts! began in Baton Rouge, \nLouisiana. Their city-wide effort involves government personnel, \nbusinesses, churches, schools, and others in the community. We should \ncelebrate this city-wide effort to educate people about character and \nimplement the Character Counts! program in other communities \nnationwide.\n  Educating people about character and citizenship is crucial to create \nhealthy communities. Years ago, as Chairman of the National Commission \non Children, I worked hard to include an entire chapter in our \ncomprehensive report called Creating a Moral Climate because I felt \nstrongly about the issue. Everyone of us has an obligation to create \nsuch a climate for our family, our friends, and especially children in \nour communities.\n  Character Counts! provides this type of leadership and resources to \nsupport character education which will promote continuous growth and \ndevelopment. It is our responsibility to educate people, and I commend \nCharacter Counts! for providing a much needed educational \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6471-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FEDERAL PRISONER HEALTH CARE COPAYMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  On May 27, 1999, the Senate passed S. 704, a bill to amend title 18, \nUnited States Code, to combat the over-utilization of prison health \ncare services and control rising prisoner health care costs.

POSTHUMOUS ADVANCEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL (RETIRED) \n                   HUSBAND E. KIMMEL AND MAJOR GENERAL (RETIRED) \n                   WALTER C. SHORT ON RETIRED LISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel, \n     formerly serving in the grade of admiral as the Commander in \n     Chief of the United States Fleet and the Commander in Chief, \n     United States Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and \n     unassailable record throughout his career in the United \n     States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (2) The late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short, \n     formerly serving in the grade of lieutenant general as the \n     Commander of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had \n     an excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941 attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that then Admiral Kimmel and then \n     Lieutenant General Short were not provided necessary and \n     critical intelligence that was available, that foretold of \n     war with Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that \n     would have alerted them to prepare for the attack, including \n     such essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb \n     Plot message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from \n     the Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese \n     Ambassador in the United States from December 6-7, 1941, \n     known as the Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry--\n       (A) exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his \n     military decisions and the disposition of his forces at the \n     time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor were \n     proper ``by virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had \n     at hand which indicated neither the probability nor the \n     imminence of an air attack on Pearl Harbor'';\n       (B) criticized the higher command for not sharing with \n     Admiral Kimmel ``during the very critical period of 26 \n     November to 7 December 1941, important information . . . \n     regarding the Japanese situation''; and\n       (C) concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that--\n       (A) Lieutenant General Short had not been kept ``fully \n     advised of the growing tenseness of the Japanese situation \n     which indicated an increasing necessity for better \n     preparation for war'';\n       (B) detailed information and intelligence about Japanese \n     intentions and war plans were available in ``abundance'', but \n     were not shared with Lieutenant General Short's Hawaii \n     command; and\n       (C) Lieutenant General Short was not provided ``on the \n     evening of December 6th and the early morning of December \n     7th, the critical information indicating an almost immediate \n     break with Japan, though there was ample time to have \n     accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) \n     Short were denied their requests to defend themselves through \n     trial by court-martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (12) On April 27, 1954, the then Chief of Naval Personnel, \n     Admiral J. L. Holloway, Jr., recommended that Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (13) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that the late Major General \n     (retired) Short ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' \n     to advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the \n     retired list''.\n       (14) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel (by \n     then deceased) and recommended that the case of Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be reopened.\n       (15) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of the late \n     Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel or the late Major General \n     (retired) Short in grade, it did set forth as a conclusion of \n     the study that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster \n     should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared''.\n       (16) The Dorn Report found--\n       (A) that ``Army and Navy officials in Washington were privy \n     to intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications . . . which \n     provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war'';\n       (B) that ``the evidence of the handling of these messages \n     in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some unwarranted \n     assumptions and misestimations, limited coordination, \n     ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up \n     at higher levels''; and\n       (C) that ``together, these characteristics resulted in \n     failure . . . to appreciate fully and to convey to the \n     commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus and urgency that \n     these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (17) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from then \n     Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.\n       (18) Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General \n     (retired) Short are the only two officers eligible for \n     advancement under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 as senior \n     World War II commanders who were excluded from the list of \n     retired officers presented for advancement on the retired \n     lists to their highest wartime ranks under that Act.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement of Rear \n     Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) Short \n     from the Navy retired list and the Army retired list, \n     respectively, serves only to perpetuate the myth\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n     that the senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their \n     duty and responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, and is a distinct and unacceptable expression of \n     dishonor toward two of the finest officers who have served in \n     the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (20) Major General (retired) Walter Short died on September \n     23, 1949, and Rear Admiral (retired) Husband Kimmel died on \n     May 14, 1968, without having been accorded the honor of being \n     returned to their wartime ranks as were their fellow veterans \n     of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, and \n     other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of the late Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and the late \n     Major General (retired) Short through their posthumous \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     grades.\n       (b) Request for Advancement on Retired Lists.--(1) The \n     President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. \n     Kimmel to the grade of admiral on the retired list of the \n     Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General (retired) Walter C. \n     Short to the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list \n     of the Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or otherwise modify \n     the compensation or benefits from the United States to which \n     any person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon \n     the military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel \n     performed his duties as Commander in Chief, United States \n     Pacific Fleet, competently and professionally, and, \n     therefore, the losses incurred by the United States in the \n     attacks on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other \n     targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, \n     were not a result of dereliction in the performance of those \n     duties by the then Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short \n     performed his duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian \n     Department, competently and professionally, and, therefore, \n     the losses incurred by the United States in the attacks on \n     Hickam Army Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and \n     other targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, \n     1941, were not a result of dereliction in the performance of \n     those duties by the then Lieutenant General Short.\n\n     SEC. 583. EXIT SURVEY FOR SEPARATING MEMBERS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop \n     and carry out a survey on attitudes toward military service \n     to be completed by members of the Armed Forces who \n     voluntarily separate from the Armed Forces or transfer from a \n     regular component to a reserve component during the period \n     beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on June 30, 2000, or \n     such later date as the Secretary determines necessary in \n     order to obtain enough survey responses to provide a \n     sufficient basis for meaningful analysis of survey results. \n     Completion of the survey shall be required of such personnel \n     as part of outprocessing activities. The Secretary of each \n     military department shall suspend exit surveys and interviews \n     of that department during the period described in the first \n     sentence.\n       (b) Survey Content.--The survey shall, at a minimum, cover \n     the following subjects:\n       (1) Reasons for leaving military service.\n       (2) Plans for activities after separation (such as \n     enrollment in school, use of Montgomery GI Bill benefits, and \n     work).\n       (3) Affiliation with a Reserve component, together with the \n     reasons for affiliating or not affiliating, as the case may \n     be.\n       (4) Attitude toward pay and benefits for service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (5) Extent of job satisfaction during service as a member \n     of the Armed Forces.\n       (6) Such other matters as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate to the survey concerning reasons for choosing to \n     separate from the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than February 1, 2001, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of \n     the surveys. The report shall include an analysis of the \n     reasons why military personnel voluntarily separate from the \n     Armed Forces and the post-separation plans of those \n     personnel. The Secretary shall utilize the report's findings \n     in crafting future responses to declining retention and \n     recruitment.\n\n     SEC. 584.

and\n       (C) a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and \n     certain oil equipment to Libya, and a blocking of Libyan \n     Government funds in other countries.\n       (6) Colonel Muammar Qadhafi for many years refused to \n     extradite the suspects to either the United States or the \n     United Kingdom and had insisted that he would only transfer \n     the suspects to a third and neutral country to stand trial.\n       (7) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom agreed to the proposal that Colonel Qadhafi transfer \n     the suspects to The Netherlands, where they would stand trial \n     under a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel \n     of Scottish judges.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998 in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States, consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions, called on Libya to ensure the \n     production of evidence, including the presence of witnesses \n     before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (10) After years of intensive diplomacy, Colonel Qadhafi \n     finally transferred the two Libyan suspects to The \n     Netherlands on April 5, 1999, and the United Nations Security \n     Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that \n     same day.\n       (11) Libya has only fulfilled one of four conditions (the \n     transfer of the two suspects accused in the Lockerbie \n     bombing) set forth in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 that would justify the lifting \n     of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Libya.\n       (12) Libya has not fulfilled the other three conditions \n     (cooperation with the Lockerbie\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\n     investigation and trial; renunciation of and ending support \n     for terrorism; and payment of appropriate compensation) \n     necessary to lift the United Nations Security Council \n     sanctions.\n       (13) The United Nations Secretary General is expected to \n     issue a report to the Security Council on or before July 5, \n     1999, on the issue of Libya's compliance with the remaining \n     conditions.\n       (14) Any member of the United Nations Security Council has \n     the right to introduce a resolution to lift the sanctions \n     against Libya after the United Nations Secretary General's \n     report has been issued.\n       (15) The United States Government considers Libya a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and the State Department Report, \n     ``Patterns of Global Terrorism; 1998'', stated that Colonel \n     Qadhafi ``continued publicly and privately to support \n     Palestinian terrorist groups, including the PIJ and the PFLP-\n     GC''.\n       (16) United States Government sanctions (other than \n     sanctions on food or medicine) should be maintained on Libya, \n     and in accordance with United States law, the Secretary of \n     State should keep Libya on the list of countries the \n     governments of which have repeatedly provided support for \n     acts of international terrorism under section 6(j) of the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979 in light of Libya's ongoing \n     support for terrorist groups.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should use all diplomatic means necessary, \n     including the use of the United States veto at the United \n     Nations Security Council, to prevent the Security Council \n     from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all \n     of the conditions set forth in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 883.\n\n     SEC. 1069.

The notice shall include a justification for \n     the waiver.\n       (c) Notice in Applications.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that any United States person or firm subject to an \n     investigation described in subsection (a) that submits to the \n     United States an application for the export of a commercial \n     satellite should include in the application a notice of the \n     investigation.\n       (d) Protection of Classified and Other Sensitive \n     Information.--The Senate and the House of Representatives \n     shall each establish, by rule or resolution of such House, \n     procedures to protect from unauthorized disclosure classified \n     information, informatioin relating to intelligence sources \n     and methods, and sensitive law enforcement information that \n     is furnished to Congress pursuant to this section.\n       (e) Exception.--The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) \n     shall not apply if the President determines that notification \n     of Congress would jeopardize an on-going criminal \n     investigation. If the President makes such a determination he \n     shall provide written notification to the Majority Leader of \n     the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives. Such notification shall include a \n     justification for any such determination.\n\n     SEC. 1070.

DISENGAGING FROM NONCRITICAL OVERSEAS MISSIONS \n                   INVOLVING UNITED STATES COMBAT FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the National Security Strategy of the United \n     States to ``deter and defeat large-scale, cross-border \n     aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time \n     frames''.\n       (2) The deterrence of Iraq and Iran in Southwest Asia and \n     the deterrence of North Korea in Northeast Asia represent two \n     such potential large-scale, cross-border theater \n     requirements.\n       (3) The United States has 120,000 troops permanently \n     assigned to those theaters.\n       (4) The United States has an additional 70,000 forces \n     assigned to non-NATO/non-Pacific threat foreign countries.\n       (5) The United States has more than 6,000 troops in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina on indefinite assignment.\n       (6) The United States has diverted permanently assigned \n     resources from other theaters to support operations in the \n     Balkans.\n       (7) The United States provides military forces to seven \n     active United Nations peacekeeping operations, including some \n     missions that have continued for decades.\n       (8) Between 1986 and 1998, the number of American military \n     deployments per year has nearly tripled at the same time the \n     Department of Defense budget has been reduced in real terms \n     by 38 percent.\n       (9) The Army has 10 active-duty divisions today, down from \n     18 in 1991, while on an average day in fiscal year 1998, \n     28,000 United States Army soldiers were deployed to more than \n     70 countries for over 300 separate missions.\n       (10) Active Air Force fighter wings have gone from 22 to 13 \n     since 1991, while 70 percent of air sorties in Operation \n     Allied Force over the Balkans are United States-flown and the \n     Air Force continues to enforce northern and southern no-fly \n     zones in Iraq. In response, the Air Force has initiated a \n     ``stop loss'' program to block normal retirements and \n     separations.\n       (11) The United States Navy has been reduced in size to 339 \n     ships, its lowest level since 1938, necessitating the \n     redeployment of the only overseas homeported aircraft carrier \n     from the Western Pacific to the Mediterranean to support \n     Operation Allied Force.\n       (12) In 1998 just 10 percent of eligible carrier naval \n     aviators--27 out of 261--accepted continuation bonuses and \n     remained in service.\n       (13) In 1998 48 percent of Air Force pilots eligible for \n     continuation opted to leave the service.\n       (14) The Army could fall 6,000 below Congressionally \n     authorized troop strength by the end of 1999.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:\n       (1) The readiness of United States military forces to \n     execute the National Security Strategy of the United States \n     is being eroded from a combination of declining defense \n     budgets and expanded missions.\n       (2) There may be missions to which the United States is \n     contributing Armed Forces from which the United States can \n     begin disengaging.\n       (c) Report Requirement.--Not later than March 1, 2000, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives, and to the Committees on \n     Appropriations in both Houses, a report prioritizing the \n     ongoing global missions to which the United States is \n     contributing troops.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Public Law 99-606 authorized public land withdrawals \n     for several military installations, including the Barry M. \n     Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, the McGregor Range in \n     New Mexico, and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely in Alaska, \n     collectively comprising over 4 million acres of public land;\n       (2) these military ranges provide important military \n     training opportunities and serve a critical role in the \n     national security of the United States and their use for \n     these purposes should be continued;\n       (3) in addition to their use for military purposes, these \n     ranges contain significant natural and cultural resources, \n     and provide important wildlife habitat;\n       (4) the future use of these ranges is important not only \n     for the affected military branches, but also for local \n     residents and other public land users;\n       (5) the public land withdrawals authorized in 1986 under \n     Public Law 99-606 were for a period of 15 years, and expire \n     in November 2001; and\n       (6) it is important that the renewal of these public land \n     withdrawals be completed in a timely manner, consistent with \n     the process established in Public Law 99-606 and other \n     applicable laws, including the completion of appropriate \n     environmental impact studies and opportunities for public \n     comment and review.\n\n     SEC. 2902. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PROPOSAL TO RENEW \n                   PUBLIC LAND WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of the Interior, consistent with their \n     responsibilities and requirements under applicable laws, \n     should jointly prepare a comprehensive legislative proposal \n     to renew the public land withdrawals for the four ranges \n     referenced in section 2901 and transmit such proposal to the \n     Congress no later than July 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 2903. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING WITHDRAWALS OF CERTAIN \n                   LANDS IN ARIZONA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is vital to the national interest that the \n     withdrawal of the lands withdrawn by section 1(c) of the \n     Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-606), \n     relating to Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and the Cabeza \n     Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which would otherwise expire \n     in 2001, be renewed in 1999;\n       (2) the renewed withdrawal of such lands is critical to \n     meet the military training requirements of the Armed Forces \n     and to provide the Armed Forces with experience necessary to \n     defend the national interests;\n       (3) the Armed Forces currently carry out environmental \n     stewardship of such lands in a comprehensive and focused \n     manner; and\n       (4) a continuation in high-quality management of United \n     States natural and cultural resources is required if the \n     United States is to preserve its national heritage.\n\n DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY AUTHORIZATIONS AND \n                          OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n      TITLE XXXI--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAMS\n\n         Subtitle A--National Security Programs Authorizations\n\n     SEC. 3101.

POSTHUMOUS ADVANCEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL (RETIRED) \n                   HUSBAND E. KIMMEL AND MAJOR GENERAL (RETIRED) \n                   WALTER C. SHORT ON RETIRED LISTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel, \n     formerly serving in the\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\n     grade of admiral as the Commander in Chief of the United \n     States Fleet and the Commander in Chief, United States \n     Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and unassailable record \n     throughout his career in the United States Navy prior to the \n     December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       (2) The late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short, \n     formerly serving in the grade of lieutenant general as the \n     Commander of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had \n     an excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941 attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that then Admiral Kimmel and then \n     Lieutenant General Short were not provided necessary and \n     critical intelligence that was available, that foretold of \n     war with Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that \n     would have alerted them to prepare for the attack, including \n     such essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb \n     Plot message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from \n     the Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese \n     Ambassador in the United States from December 6-7, 1941, \n     known as the Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry--\n       (A) exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his \n     military decisions and the disposition of his forces at the \n     time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor were \n     proper ``by virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had \n     at hand which indicated neither the probability nor the \n     imminence of an air attack on Pearl Harbor'';\n       (B) criticized the higher command for not sharing with \n     Admiral Kimmel ``during the very critical period of 26 \n     November to 7 December 1941, important information . . . \n     regarding the Japanese situation''; and\n       (C) concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that--\n       (A) Lieutenant General Short had not been kept ``fully \n     advised of the growing tenseness of the Japanese situation \n     which indicated an increasing necessity for better \n     preparation for war'';\n       (B) detailed information and intelligence about Japanese \n     intentions and war plans were available in ``abundance'', but \n     were not shared with Lieutenant General Short's Hawaii \n     command; and\n       (C) Lieutenant General Short was not provided ``on the \n     evening of December 6th and the early morning of December \n     7th, the critical information indicating an almost immediate \n     break with Japan, though there was ample time to have \n     accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) \n     Short were denied their requests to defend themselves through \n     trial by court-martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (12) On April 27, 1954, the then Chief of Naval Personnel, \n     Admiral J. L. Holloway, Jr., recommended that Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (13) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that the late Major General \n     (retired) Short ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' \n     to advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the \n     retired list''.\n       (14) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel (by \n     then deceased) and recommended that the case of Rear Admiral \n     Kimmel be reopened.\n       (15) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of the late \n     Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel or the late Major General \n     (retired) Short in grade, it did set forth as a conclusion of \n     the study that ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster \n     should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared''.\n       (16) The Dorn Report found--\n       (A) that ``Army and Navy officials in Washington were privy \n     to intercepted Japanese diplomatic communications . . . which \n     provided crucial confirmation of the imminence of war'';\n       (B) that ``the evidence of the handling of these messages \n     in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some unwarranted \n     assumptions and misestimations, limited coordination, \n     ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up \n     at higher levels''; and\n       (C) that ``together, these characteristics resulted in \n     failure . . . to appreciate fully and to convey to the \n     commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus and urgency that \n     these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (17) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from then \n     Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.\n       (18) Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General \n     (retired) Short are the only two officers eligible for \n     advancement under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 as senior \n     World War II commanders who were excluded from the list of \n     retired officers presented for advancement on the retired \n     lists to their highest wartime ranks under that Act.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement of Rear \n     Admiral (retired) Kimmel and Major General (retired) Short \n     from the Navy retired list and the Army retired list, \n     respectively, serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     and is a distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor \n     toward two of the finest officers who have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (20) Major General (retired) Walter Short died on September \n     23, 1949, and Rear Admiral (retired) Husband Kimmel died on \n     May 14, 1968, without having been accorded the honor of being \n     returned to their wartime ranks as were their fellow veterans \n     of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, and \n     other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of the late Rear Admiral (retired) Kimmel and the late \n     Major General (retired) Short through their posthumous \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     grades.\n       (b) Request for Advancement on Retired Lists.--(1) The \n     President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. \n     Kimmel to the grade of admiral on the retired list of the \n     Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General (retired) Walter C. \n     Short to the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list \n     of the Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or otherwise modify \n     the compensation or benefits from the United States to which \n     any person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon \n     the military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral (retired) Husband E. Kimmel \n     performed his duties as Commander in Chief, United States \n     Pacific Fleet, competently and professionally, and, \n     therefore, the losses incurred by the United States in the \n     attacks on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other \n     targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, \n     were not a result of dereliction in the performance of those \n     duties by the then Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General (retired) Walter C. Short \n     performed his duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian \n     Department, competently and professionally, and, therefore, \n     the losses incurred by the United States in the attacks on \n     Hickam Army Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and \n     other targets on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, \n     1941, were not a result of dereliction in the performance of \n     those duties by the then Lieutenant General Short.\n\n     SEC. 583. EXIT SURVEY FOR SEPARATING MEMBERS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop \n     and carry out a survey on\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\n     attitudes toward military service to be completed by members \n     of the Armed Forces who voluntarily separate from the Armed \n     Forces or transfer from a regular component to a reserve \n     component during the period beginning on January 1, 2000, and \n     ending on June 30, 2000, or such later date as the Secretary \n     determines necessary in order to obtain enough survey \n     responses to provide a sufficient basis for meaningful \n     analysis of survey results. Completion of the survey shall be \n     required of such personnel as part of outprocessing \n     activities. The Secretary of each military department shall \n     suspend exit surveys and interviews of that department during \n     the period described in the first sentence.\n       (b) Survey Content.--The survey shall, at a minimum, cover \n     the following subjects:\n       (1) Reasons for leaving military service.\n       (2) Plans for activities after separation (such as \n     enrollment in school, use of Montgomery GI Bill benefits, and \n     work).\n       (3) Affiliation with a Reserve component, together with the \n     reasons for affiliating or not affiliating, as the case may \n     be.\n       (4) Attitude toward pay and benefits for service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (5) Extent of job satisfaction during service as a member \n     of the Armed Forces.\n       (6) Such other matters as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate to the survey concerning reasons for choosing to \n     separate from the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than February 1, 2001, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of \n     the surveys. The report shall include an analysis of the \n     reasons why military personnel voluntarily separate from the \n     Armed Forces and the post-separation plans of those \n     personnel.

and\n       (C) a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and \n     certain oil equipment to Libya, and a blocking of Libyan \n     Government funds in other countries.\n       (6) Colonel Muammar Qadhafi for many years refused to \n     extradite the suspects to either the United States or the \n     United Kingdom and had insisted that he would only transfer \n     the suspects to a third and neutral country to stand trial.\n       (7) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom agreed to the proposal that Colonel Qadhafi transfer \n     the suspects to The Netherlands, where they would stand trial \n     under a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel \n     of Scottish judges.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998 in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States, consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions, called on Libya to ensure the \n     production of evidence, including the presence of witnesses \n     before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (10) After years of intensive diplomacy, Colonel Qadhafi \n     finally transferred the two Libyan suspects to The \n     Netherlands on April 5, 1999, and the United Nations Security \n     Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that \n     same day.\n       (11) Libya has only fulfilled one of four conditions (the \n     transfer of the two suspects accused in the Lockerbie \n     bombing) set forth in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 that would justify the lifting \n     of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Libya.\n       (12) Libya has not fulfilled the other three conditions \n     (cooperation with the Lockerbie investigation and trial; \n     renunciation of and ending support for terrorism; and payment \n     of appropriate compensation) necessary to lift the United \n     Nations Security Council sanctions.\n       (13) The United Nations Secretary General is expected to \n     issue a report to the Security Council on or before July 5, \n     1999, on the issue of Libya's compliance with the remaining \n     conditions.\n       (14) Any member of the United Nations Security Council has \n     the right to introduce a resolution to lift the sanctions \n     against Libya after the United Nations Secretary General's \n     report has been issued.\n       (15) The United States Government considers Libya a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and the State Department Report, \n     ``Patterns of Global Terrorism; 1998'', stated that Colonel \n     Qadhafi ``continued publicly and privately to support \n     Palestinian terrorist groups, including the PIJ and the PFLP-\n     GC''.\n       (16) United States Government sanctions (other than \n     sanctions on food or medicine) should be maintained on Libya, \n     and in accordance with United States law, the Secretary of \n     State should keep Libya on the list of countries the \n     governments of which have repeatedly provided support for \n     acts of international terrorism under section 6(j) of the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979 in light of Libya's ongoing \n     support for terrorist groups.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should use all diplomatic means necessary, \n     including the use of the United States veto at the United \n     Nations Security Council, to prevent the Security Council \n     from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all \n     of the conditions set forth in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 883.\n\n     SEC. 1069.

The notice shall include a justification for \n     the waiver.\n       (c) Notice in Applications.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that any United States person or firm subject to an \n     investigation described in subsection (a) that submits to the \n     United States an application for the export of a commercial \n     satellite should include in the application a notice of the \n     investigation.\n       (d) Protection of Classified and Other Sensitive \n     Information.--The Senate and the House of Representatives \n     shall each establish, by rule or resolution of such House, \n     procedures to protect from unauthorized disclosure classified \n     information, informatioin relating to intelligence sources \n     and methods, and sensitive law enforcement information that \n     is furnished to Congress pursuant to this section.\n       (e) Exception.--The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) \n     shall not apply if the President determines that notification \n     of Congress would jeopardize an on-going criminal \n     investigation. If the President makes such a determination he \n     shall provide written notification to the Majority Leader of\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\n     the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives. Such notification shall include a \n     justification for any such determination.\n\n     SEC. 1070.

DISENGAGING FROM NONCRITICAL OVERSEAS MISSIONS \n                   INVOLVING UNITED STATES COMBAT FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the National Security Strategy of the United \n     States to ``deter and defeat large-scale, cross-border \n     aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time \n     frames''.\n       (2) The deterrence of Iraq and Iran in Southwest Asia and \n     the deterrence of North Korea in Northeast Asia represent two \n     such potential large-scale, cross-border theater \n     requirements.\n       (3) The United States has 120,000 troops permanently \n     assigned to those theaters.\n       (4) The United States has an additional 70,000 forces \n     assigned to non-NATO/non-Pacific threat foreign countries.\n       (5) The United States has more than 6,000 troops in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina on indefinite assignment.\n       (6) The United States has diverted permanently assigned \n     resources from other theaters to support operations in the \n     Balkans.\n       (7) The United States provides military forces to seven \n     active United Nations peacekeeping operations, including some \n     missions that have continued for decades.\n       (8) Between 1986 and 1998, the number of American military \n     deployments per year has nearly tripled at the same time the \n     Department of Defense budget has been reduced in real terms \n     by 38 percent.\n       (9) The Army has 10 active-duty divisions today, down from \n     18 in 1991, while on an average day in fiscal year 1998, \n     28,000 United States Army soldiers were deployed to more than \n     70 countries for over 300 separate missions.\n       (10) Active Air Force fighter wings have gone from 22 to 13 \n     since 1991, while 70 percent of air sorties in Operation \n     Allied Force over the Balkans are United States-flown and the \n     Air Force continues to enforce northern and southern no-fly \n     zones in Iraq. In response, the Air Force has initiated a \n     ``stop loss'' program to block normal retirements and \n     separations.\n       (11) The United States Navy has been reduced in size to 339 \n     ships, its lowest level since 1938, necessitating the \n     redeployment of the only overseas homeported aircraft carrier \n     from the Western Pacific to the Mediterranean to support \n     Operation Allied Force.\n       (12) In 1998 just 10 percent of eligible carrier naval \n     aviators--27 out of 261--accepted continuation bonuses and \n     remained in service.\n       (13) In 1998 48 percent of Air Force pilots eligible for \n     continuation opted to leave the service.\n       (14) The Army could fall 6,000 below Congressionally \n     authorized troop strength by the end of 1999.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:\n       (1) The readiness of United States military forces to \n     execute the National Security Strategy of the United States \n     is being eroded from a combination of declining defense \n     budgets and expanded missions.\n       (2) There may be missions to which the United States is \n     contributing Armed Forces from which the United States can \n     begin disengaging.\n       (c) Report Requirement.--Not later than March 1, 2000, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives, and to the Committees on \n     Appropriations in both Houses, a report prioritizing the \n     ongoing global missions to which the United States is \n     contributing troops.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Public Law 99-606 authorized public land withdrawals \n     for several military installations, including the Barry M. \n     Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, the McGregor Range in \n     New Mexico, and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely in Alaska, \n     collectively comprising over 4 million acres of public land;\n       (2) these military ranges provide important military \n     training opportunities and serve a critical role in the \n     national security of the United States and their use for \n     these purposes should be continued;\n       (3) in addition to their use for military purposes, these \n     ranges contain significant natural and cultural resources, \n     and provide important wildlife habitat;\n       (4) the future use of these ranges is important not only \n     for the affected military branches, but also for local \n     residents and other public land users;\n       (5) the public land withdrawals authorized in 1986 under \n     Public Law 99-606 were for a period of 15 years, and expire \n     in November 2001; and\n       (6) it is important that the renewal of these public land \n     withdrawals be completed in a timely manner, consistent with \n     the process established in Public Law 99-606 and other \n     applicable laws, including the completion of appropriate \n     environmental impact studies and opportunities for public \n     comment and review.\n\n     SEC. 2902. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PROPOSAL TO RENEW \n                   PUBLIC LAND WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of the Interior, consistent with their \n     responsibilities and requirements under applicable laws, \n     should jointly prepare a comprehensive legislative proposal \n     to renew the public land withdrawals for the four ranges \n     referenced in section 2901 and transmit such proposal to the \n     Congress no later than July 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 2903. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING WITHDRAWALS OF CERTAIN \n                   LANDS IN ARIZONA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is vital to the national interest that the \n     withdrawal of the lands withdrawn by section 1(c) of the \n     Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-606), \n     relating to Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and the Cabeza \n     Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which would otherwise expire \n     in 2001, be renewed in 1999;\n       (2) the renewed withdrawal of such lands is critical to \n     meet the military training requirements of the Armed Forces \n     and to provide the Armed Forces with experience necessary to \n     defend the national interests;\n       (3) the Armed Forces currently carry out environmental \n     stewardship of such lands in a comprehensive and focused \n     manner; and\n       (4) a continuation in high-quality management of United \n     States natural and cultural resources is required if the \n     United States is to preserve its national heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/07/senate-section/article/S6632-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6632-S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NATIONAL SECURITY ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n  On May 27, 1999, the bill, S. 1062, was passed by the Senate.
