Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nfiled this past week to H.R. 3709, the Internet Nondiscrimination Act. \nThis amendment has a twofold purpose. First, it highlights the need to \nact on S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities' Access to Local \nTelevision Act of 2000. This critical legislation passed the Senate by \na unanimous, 97-0, vote on March 30 of this year. The House version of \nthis bill, H.R. 3615, also passed by an overwhelming 375-37 margin. Yet \nhere we are 2\\1/2\\ months later with no effort to move this bipartisan \nlegislation forward toward enactment.\n  In the meantime, the other body has considered an extension of the \nInternet tax moratorium for an additional 5 years. I supported the \noriginal Internet Nondiscrimination Act which created a 3-year \nmoratorium on new taxes on the Internet while we considered the various \nramifications of e-commerce taxation issues.\n  That original moratorium does not expire until next October. Yet here \nwe are 16 months in advance of that expiration preparing to consider an \nadditional 5-year expansion. Not only that, but with this new \nlegislation, we renege, frankly, on a promise made under the 1998 act \nwhich grandfathered existing State taxes on Internet services. That \nagreement was essential to securing the overwhelming support which S. \n442 ultimately received.\n  I believe we should not be placing taxes on access to the Internet, \nbut that is not the issue. The issue is the implementation of already \nexisting sales tax responsibilities. Sales tax is a critical component \nof State and local revenues, especially in States such as South Dakota \nthat do not have an income tax. More than half of our State budget \nderives from the sales tax. That is the money that goes to education,\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\ncrimefighting, and other essential services. This online-commerce \nloophole in sales tax collection results in an unfair situation for \nSouth Dakota merchants, and threatens the treasuries of State and local \ngovernments with the loss of millions of dollars in revenue. There is a \ngreat need for State tax laws to be applied to all sales regardless of \nwhether the sales are made at a local store, over the Internet, or by \nany other means.\n  H.R. 3709 does not foreclose the possibility of collecting sales tax \non products purchased over the Internet. In fact, it is silent on this \nissue. That silence, however, is almost as dangerous to State and local \ngovernment as an explicit rejection of equal treatment for brick and \nmortar stores. By filing this amendment to H.R. 3709, I want it made \nclear that I will oppose this legislation moving forward until it \nestablishes a comprehensive review of Internet-related tax policy.\n  I remain absolutely opposed to any new tax on the Internet. Internet \nusage ought to be encouaged and kept affordable. Public policy ought to \npromote tax-free Internet access, but it makes no sense that some sales \nare subject to sales tax while others are not. We need a level playing \nfield for everyone. It is up to each individual State and municipality \nto decide for itself whether it wants to have a sales tax--but once \nthat decision is made, it ought to apply uniformly to sales without \nregard to the particular technology utilized in making the sale. This \ncorrection must be considered in the context of any effort to extend \nthe ongoing Internet tax moratorium.\n  Although there are many pieces of critical legislation which would \nserve to highlight the tax fairness issues raised by H.R. 3709, I want \nto focus on S. 2097, the local-into-local television act.\n  Under legislation we passed this past year, satellite companies are \nfor the first time free to broadcast local network programming into \nlocal markets. That ability has already benefited thousands of viewers \nand promoted competition in the broadcast delivery industry. What S. \n2097 seeks to accomplish is to make that benefit a reality for \nAmericans who live outside the largest 40 television markets.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I represent a State, South Dakota, with \nrural viewers that should not be left out of the information age. South \nDakota is one of the 16 States that do not have a single city among the \ntop 70 markets. Sixteen States have no television markets within the \ntop 70. Without this loan guarantee, markets such as Sioux Falls and \nRapid City will never get local-into-local service, and rural South \nDakotans will not have an opportunity to receive their local networks \nover the satellite signals.\n  This proposal is more than just getting sports or entertainment \nprogramming over your local channels. It is a critical way to receive \nimportant local news, storm information, road reports, school closing \ninformation, and civic affairs information.\n  Rural Americans need the same opportunity to access their local \nnetworks as do our urban friends. This legislation will provide that \nopportunity.\n  We have worked very hard in the Banking Committee and on the floor to \nachieve strong bipartisan legislation. Senators Sarbanes, Baucus, \nGramm, Burns, and others worked diligently to find the accommodations \nto satisfy everyone's concerns. We have a final product which will \nultimately result in local-into-local broadcasting for rural America, \nand it does so in a fiscally responsible manner that limits the \ntaxpayer exposure.\n  The overwhelming vote in both the House and Senate demonstrates the \nsoundness of this legislation. It is absolutely critical for the \nmillions of Americans who live outside our major urban areas. It is the \npromised missing component of last year's Satellite Home Viewer \nImprovements Act.\n  This issue has aroused the greatest level of constituent concern in \nmany States in quite some time. S. 2097 provides a fiscally responsible \nand prudent response to the concerns raised by thousands of our \nconstituents, protecting the taxpayer interests while at the same time \nhelping to provide this service. I intend to offer this legislation to \nevery vehicle possible this year until we have the opportunity to \nfinish what we started and provide this essential service to all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4938-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I have not a speech but a story to tell. \nThe name of that story could very well be ``What Would Have Happened To \nFrankie Vee?'' Now, they say confession is good for the soul. I confess \nthat during the Memorial Day recess a couple weeks ago I did not work \nduring the whole recess. I spent some time with my family, with my \nwife, with my daughter Katie, her husband Brad, their baby, and some of \nthe other kids, and we went to south Texas where we own some property. \nThere is a little\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\ntown down there called Port Isabel. There is a restaurant there that \nnone of the tourists go to. It is just the local people who go there. \nIt is right there on the channel that goes out ultimately to the gulf.\n  There is a guy down there who sings. You sit down and you have \ndinner. He has these machines he turns on; they make music. He has a \nmicrophone, and he sings. He has a beautiful voice. The reason I like \nit is he sings the kind of songs I know such as ``Your Cheatin Heart'' \nand ``Lord, Help Me, Jesus,'' and songs like that. While he is singing, \nhis wife sways to the music with her eyes closed. It is just a \nbeautiful setting there.\n  This was going on when all of a sudden a light went on, and I do not \nknow how this happened, but I was looking at this guy, who is just an \nordinary person--he is about my age. He has gone through tough times in \nhis life like I have. He has made money; he has lost money; but he is \njust a very typical American. He is someone who has to obey the laws, \nhas to work hard, and has to pay taxes. What occurred to me was that if \nFrankie Vee had blatantly and knowingly and wrongfully committed a \ncrime like Kenneth Bacon, blatantly and knowingly and willingly \ncommitted a crime, he would not be singing there and spreading joy in \nthe hearts of many while his wife is swaying. He would be serving time \nin a Federal penitentiary.\n\n  I am not outraged; I am not mad; and I am not feeling any anxiety \nabout this. I guess the best way to characterize my feelings after the \nlast 7\\1/2\\ years of this administration using the Justice Department \nto protect its friends and to punish its enemies is just something that \nI feel numb about. I am proud of two of the mainstream media--only \ntwo--that have been willing to write about these things. And that is \nFox News and the Washington Times.\n  So in this case, we have talked about comparing the crime that was \ncommitted by Kenneth Bacon with other crimes that were committed--and I \nam going to talk about that in just a minute--by other people in other \nadministrations. But what occurred to me was that every citizen out \nhere, whether in Wyoming or Oklahoma, has to obey the law and has to be \npunished under the law if that person disobeys the law, and that he \nwould be prosecuted if there was justification for prosecution and then \nwould be punished accordingly--except in this administration.\n  On Thursday, May 25, which was the eve of the Memorial Day recess \nwhen we left for about a week, the Clinton administration perpetrated \nanother outrage to add to its long trail of operations, I guess you \nwould say. In the face of the Pentagon inspector general's firm \nconclusion that Kenneth Bacon and Clifford Bernath violated the Privacy \nAct and broke the law and committed a crime, the Secretary of Defense \nannounced that he would do nothing to hold these men accountable for \ntheir actions. And this neatly follows the earlier decision of the \nJustice Department not to prosecute after engaging in a 2-year coverup.\n  Now, as I have said before, this case has broad implications for what \nhas been done to the rule of law and to the concept of honesty and \nintegrity in Government over the past 7\\1/2\\ years. Above all else, the \nsystemic undermining of these time-honored principles constitutes the \ntrue and lasting legacy of the Clinton and Gore administration. Time \nafter time after time, again and again, the Justice Department and \nJanet Reno have used that Department to protect the President's \npolitical friends and to punish the President's political enemies.\n  Today, as a result of this case, there are millions of Federal \nemployees who are on notice that the information contained in their \nconfidential Government personnel records cannot be protected from \npolitically motivated disclosures. They are on notice that the Privacy \nAct can be violated with impunity even when the perpetrators are caught \nredhanded.\n  In an additional outrage, we find that the administration now wants \nthe taxpayers to pay the legal bills for those two individuals during \nthis process.\n  This is a letter we have uncovered, after it had been covered up, \nthat the Office of the General Counsel is writing to Mr. Kaser, U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, requesting that the taxpayers pay the legal fees \nof Kenneth Bacon and Clifford Bernath. I ask unanimous consent that at \nthe conclusion of my remarks this letter be printed in the Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let's quickly recap what happened. In March of 1998, \nabout 8 weeks into the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Pentagon public \naffairs director, Kenneth Bacon, got a phone call from Jane Mayer, who \nJane Mayer was a long-time Clinton supporter and friend of the Clinton \nadministration. She was an old friend of Kenneth Bacon. They worked \ntogether on the Wall Street Journal for years before. And she got a \nletter. She was then working on a story for the New Yorker magazine. \nMayer informed Bacon that she had evidence that a key witness in this \nPresidential scandal, Linda Tripp, had been arrested for larceny as a \nteenager. Tripp was and still is a civilian employee of the Federal \nGovernment at the Pentagon. Mayer wanted to know how Tripp had replied \nto question No. 21 on her security clearance form, asking if she had \never been arrested. If she had answered no, which Linda Tripp did, then \npublic disclosure of this information in conjunction with the new \nevidence that Mayer said she had would have been clearly damaging to \nTripp's credibility and her reputation and would discredit her as \nsomeone who was bringing charges against the President.\n  Soon thereafter, it was discovered that Tripp's teenage arrest was \nthe result of a juvenile prank perpetrated against her. The judge in \nthe case told her in a laughing way that it was a funny trick and her \nrecord would be clear. Nevertheless, Mayer's story was published and \nthe damage to Tripp was done. She was discredited forever.\n  I would characterize that as saying Mr. Bacon had conspired with Ms. \nMayer to implement ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of \nLinda Tripp with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the \nconduct and outcome of pending investigations and prosecutions.'' That \nis exactly what the two of them did to Linda Tripp.\n  The reason I am reading this is because that is the exact language of \n20 years ago when Chuck Colson committed this same crime at the \nbeginning of the Watergate era. The court said Colson implemented ``a \nscheme to defame and destroy the public image of Daniel Ellsberg with \nthe intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome \nof pending investigations and prosecutions.''\n  That is exactly the same thing Kenneth Bacon did. The actions of \nBacon and Bernath immediately became the subject of the Pentagon IG \ninvestigation to determine if they had violated the Privacy Act which \nis designed to prevent the disclosure of confidential information on \nGovernment employees.\n  The IG quickly concluded that, yes, indeed, they did violate the \nPrivacy Act. In July of 1998, the IG made a criminal referral to the \nJustice Department so the case could be prosecuted, but nobody knew it. \nThe fact the IG had concluded the report was covered up by the Justice \nDepartment for 2 years. The Justice Department sat on the case for 2 \nyears doing nothing--a classic foot-dragging, stonewalling Clinton \ncoverup.\n\n  Finally, in March of this year, they quietly announced no one would \nbe prosecuted in this case. And they call it a Department of Justice. \nThe Department said it concluded Bacon and Bernath ``didn't intend to \nbreak the law'' when they made the disclosure of the Tripp information, \nas if that is ever a legitimate excuse for anything.\n  I suggest if the Senator who is occupying the chair were driving down \na Wyoming highway at 100 miles an hour and were pulled over by a \nhighway patrol and he said, ``I didn't intend to break the law,'' that \neverything would be fine.\n  This is how the process works. Once the Justice Department refuses to \nprosecute, even after a criminal referral for prosecution has taken \nplace, the very least that can happen to a person is the boss of the \nindividual who is offending may take some kind of personnel action.\n  It was turned over to the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen. He was\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\ncharged with evaluating the conclusions of the IG report and taking any \naction he deemed appropriate, such as firing both of them. Keep in \nmind, this should not even have happened. This should not have taken \nplace because by this time, there should have been a criminal \nprosecution.\n  This brings us to 2 weeks ago, Thursday, when Cohen announced what he \ndeemed appropriate. He sent Bacon and Bernath personal letters \nexpressing disappointment in their actions, making a clear point they \nwere not letters of reprimand and will not be placed in their personnel \nrecords. It is not even a slap on the wrist. In other words, he did \nnothing. He did not fire anyone. He did not fine anyone. He did not \nsuspend anyone. He took the IG's conclusion that the Privacy Act was \nbroken and walked away without exacting any measure of accountability \nor justice. It is unbelievable.\n  He did, however, publicly release the IG report and related \ndocuments, and these clearly show the inspector general unhesitatingly \nconcluded that Tripp's privacy was compromised, that the Privacy Act \nwas violated, and that the law was broken. This was in the IG report. \nThe IG totally rejected Bacon's and Bernath's contorted arguments to \nthe contrary.\n  In addition, the IG report clearly shows that no serious \ninvestigation was ever conducted into the involvement of other Clinton \nadministration officials or friends outside the Pentagon, such as those \nin the White House who may have been involved in orchestrating this \nsmear of Linda Tripp.\n  I urge my colleagues to read an article that was in the Washington \nTimes on Saturday, May 27, 2000. It lays out clear evidence that Bacon \nand Bernath did not act alone in this matter, as they claim. There is \nevidence the IG did not adequately follow up. Yet it is the kind of \nevidence that, as Clinton friend Dick Morris has said, would lead to a \nconclusion any 6 year old could understand; namely, that Bacon and \nBernath most certainly did not act alone.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article from the Washington Times to \nwhich I just referred be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will chronologically reconstruct what \nhappened in this case. It is important I be redundant so that people \nwill understand and that it will not be forgotten and covered up.\n  On March 12, 1998, New Yorker magazine writer Jane Mayer, a former \nWall Street Journal reporter, called Kenneth Bacon who used to work \nwith Mayer at the Wall Street Journal, asking him about a question on \nLinda Tripp's personnel file for a story she was writing.\n  On March 13, the very next day, Bacon tasks Clifford Bernath, then a \nPentagon public affairs deputy, with answering Mayer's question. \nBernath writes in his journal: ``Ken has made clear it's a priority.''\n  Further, in March of that same year, the New Yorker story claims \nTripp violated the law.\n  In March, Defense Secretary William Cohen calls the disclosure \n``certainly inappropriate, if not illegal.'' Cohen continued: Tripp's \nfile ``was supposed to be protected by the privacy rules.'' The DOD \ninspector general's investigation is initiated.\n  An investigation was initiated in March of 1998.\n  In April of 1998, Cliff Bernath was deposed by Judicial Watch. \nBernath was accompanied by a battery of Government lawyers from the \nJustice Department, the Defense Department, and the White House, in \naddition to one from Williams & Connolly appearing on behalf of the \nFirst Lady who was then a defendant in the FBI file suit.\n  Over the next 6 hours, Bernath proceeded to change his story. He had \npreviously insisted the request was handled in a routine way. In this \ndeposition, he concedes that it was a high-priority issue by Ken Bacon.\n  On May 21, 1998, at a Pentagon press conference, Ken Bacon declined \ncomment--as he has since repeatedly--to the press, including refusing \nto deny whether the White House directed him to release that \ninformation on the grounds that the IG was still investigating.\n  On July 10, 1998, Federal Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the Defense \nDepartment to seize the computer of a Pentagon staffer who admits \nreleasing information on Tripp's security clearance form. Lamberth \nruled that the Department's inspector general should check the computer \nbecause the Pentagon aide, Clifford Bernath, deleted documents, \nalthough Bernath claimed none of the deleted documents concerned Tripp.\n  Jumping forward to February 9, 2000, at a House Armed Services \nCommittee hearing, Secretary Cohen had no answer to the question from \nRepresentative Buyer on where the DOD report was, in what stage it was. \nWe found out the report was concluded almost 2 years before that \nquestion was asked.\n  I have to add a personal note in defense of Bill Cohen. I do not \nbelieve he knew. I think the White House covered that up and the \nJustice Department covered up the fact that the report was concluded \nalmost 2 years before that hearing. I do not believe Cohen actually was \naware of that.\n  On March 6, 2000--this brings the Federal court back in--Federal \nJudge Lamberth signed an order requiring DOD to produce records \nconcerning the release of information in Tripp's DOD files and \ninformation on any attempts to withhold information from the public \nand/or investigators about the details of that release.\n  Then on March 13, 2000, Judge Royce Lamberth stated:\n\n       The Tripp release presents such a clear violation of the \n     Privacy Act.\n\n  Lambert said:\n\n       The court finds it impossible to fathom how an internal \n     investigation into such a simple matter could take so long to \n     conclude.\n\n  In fact, even though that statement was made by the judge in the \ncourt records on March 13, 2000, that internal investigation had been \nconcluded in July 1998, nearly 2 years before.\n  In previous talks on the floor, I have had occasion to compare this \ncrime with a crime that was committed 20 years before. I have done so \nbecause when you talk about what President Clinton and Vice President \nGore have allegedly done in terms of getting foreign contributions, \nwhich are a violation of law, there is nothing really precedented about \nthat that we can go back and compare with someone else who was \nprosecuted.\n  In this case, the crime that was committed by Kenneth Bacon, and \nperhaps more people with him, is a crime exactly like the crime that \nwas committed 20 years before by Chuck Colson.\n  Let's go back and see just what Chuck Colson did. This is what he \nsaid and did, in his own words. This is going back to 1971:\n\n       . . . I got hold of derogatory FBI reports about Ellsberg \n     and leaked them to the press.\n\n  He said further, in 1976:\n\n       I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information \n     compiled from secret personnel files.\n\n  I know, again, this is exactly the same thing that we now have a \nconfession by Kenneth Bacon that he did. He got ahold of derogatory \nreports about Linda Tripp. And then he happily gave them to an \ninquiring reporter--the same thing.\n  So what happened to Colson? Colson was sentenced by U.S. District \nCourt Judge Gerhard Gesell to a prison term. On April 7, 2000, in a \ndeposition, he provided the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer with Tripp \ninformation. In other words, he admitted it. He admitted that. There is \nno question about whether or not he committed this crime. There is no \ndoubt about it, no dispute about it.\n  Bacon said: I am sorry that I did not check with our lawyers or check \nwith Linda Tripp's attorneys about this.\n  Sorry? Sorry really didn't cut it for Chuck Colson. Chuck Colson \nended up in a Federal penitentiary. Colson committed the crime in July \n1971. He admitted his guilt and pleaded on June 3, 1974, and was \nsentenced to the Federal penitentiary on June 21, 1974.\n  Bacon committed his crime in March of 1998. He admitted what he had \ndone in June of 1998. The Pentagon inspector general referred the \nmatter for criminal prosecution in July of 1998. So now 2 years later, \nin April, May, and June of 2000, the Clinton Justice Department says it \nis going to take a pass, hoping nobody will see or hear about this at \nthis late date. After all, 2 full years\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nhad transpired since the report was concluded.\n  So Colson went to jail and served time in prison. If there were \njustice and equal application of the law, Bacon would go to jail and \nserve time in prison.\n  Is this the first time the Clinton administration has been involved \nin lawbreaking and corruption? Not hardly. It has almost become a way \nof life--Travelgate, Filegate, Buddhist Temple fundraisers, illegal \nforeign campaign contributions, the compromise of high-technology \nnuclear secrets to the Chinese, not to mention perjury and obstruction \nof justice. The list goes on and on.\n\n  Why is this important? It is all about a concept. It is as basic to \nAmerica as the concept of going to church on Sunday. That concept is: \nEqual application of the law.\n  Chuck Colson realized he did the wrong thing. Chuck Colson, in a book \nthat he wrote in 1976, called ``Born Again,'' stated:\n\n       I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information \n     about Ellsberg's attorney, compiled from secret FBI dossiers.\n\n  He said:\n\n       . . . I pleaded guilty after being told by Watergate \n     prosecutor Leon Jaworski that my conviction would deter such \n     a thing from [ever] happening again.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  I suggest that it has happened again, and they are hoping no one will \nnotice.\n  I refer to an article that was written on June 12--a current \narticle--in the Weekly Standard by Jay Nordlinger. The question is: \n``Why Didn't Bacon Get Fried?'' That is the name of the article. I will \nquote a few things from it. Jay Nordlinger wrote:\n\n       It's just a small matter, in all the Clinton grossness, but \n     it counts. Linda Tripp was the victim of a dirty, and \n     illegal, trick. It was played on her by her own bosses at the \n     Pentagon. And now those men--Kenneth Bacon and Clifford \n     Bernath--have escaped with the wispiest slaps on the wrist. \n     This is ho-hum for the Clinton administration; but it is a \n     reminder of how unlawful and indecent this administration has \n     been.\n\n  Further in the article he talks about Joseph diGenova, who is a \nformer U.S. attorney with long experience in this area.\n  Quoting from the same article, diGenova is quoted as saying:\n\n       The treatment of Bacon and Bernath suggests that the \n     Privacy Act will be enforceable only in civil lawsuits filed \n     by the victims. If there's no adverse action--not even a \n     letter that goes into somebody's file--there's no deterrence \n     here. None whatsoever.\n\n  The article by Jay Nordlinger further states:\n\n       The president and his men have a bit of history with the \n     Privacy Act. You perhaps remember Passportgate. Toward the \n     end of the 1992 presidential campaign, it was learned that \n     political appointees in the Bush State Department had rifled \n     through candidate Clinton's passport files and those of his \n     mother. Democrats demanded an independent-counsel \n     investigation. They got one--led by diGenova. One of the \n     officials involved, Elizabeth Tamposi, was dismissed. The \n     acting secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, offered to \n     resign over the matter. (President Bush refused). Said \n     Clinton, in his first press conference [after he had been \n     elected President of the United States], ``If I catch anybody \n     doing [what the passport-file offenders did], I will fire \n     them the next day. You won't have to have an inquiry or \n     rigmarole or anything else.''\n       About a year later, Passportgate had something of a \n     reprise, this time featuring appointees in Clinton's own \n     State Department. A few of them got hold of Bush-\n     administration personnel files and leaked them to Al Kamen \n     of the Washington Post.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Finally, I guess it begs the question, What can be done \nnow? I mentioned that the media, the mainstream media, has pretty much \nignored this. They like Kenneth Bacon. He was a member of the media. \nThey are not going to do anything about it, I have decided.\n  Fortunately, the Washington Times has done something about it. \nFortunately, Fox News has done something about it. But there is \nsomething that can be done. When the new administration takes office, \nand a new Attorney General comes in, the Bacon-Bernath lawbreaking \nshould be referred again for criminal prosecution. A professional \nJustice Department, freed from corrupt partisan influences, should \nprosecute this case and uphold the law.\n  Such a referral can easily be added to a list of such referrals on \nother matters which are already being contemplated, as Representative \nDan Burton, who is the chairman of the appropriate House committee, \nmentioned yesterday.\n  For example, these, as mentioned, would include criminal referrals \nrelated to:\n  No. 1, evidence that the President broke campaign finance laws, was \naware of illegal foreign contributions, and changed policies in return \nfor campaign contributions;\n  No. 2, evidence that the Vice President broke the law when he made \nthe illegal fundraising phone calls from the White House;\n  No. 3, evidence that the Vice President committed a felony by lying \nto the FBI investigators about his knowledge of illegal fundraising \nactivities;\n  No. 4, that Janet Reno committed obstruction of justice when she \nrefused to appoint an independent counsel;\n  And now we add this to the list: Evidence that Ken Bacon and Clifford \nBernath broke the law when they violated the Privacy Act in the Linda \nTripp matter.\n  It is obvious if the next President of the United States happens to \nbe Al Gore that very likely we will have the same type of Justice \nDepartment. I don't think our forefathers ever anticipated, when they \nwere constructing these documents, our Constitution and our statutes, \nthat we would have someone in the President's office who would use the \nJustice Department to protect his friends and punish his enemies. I \nhave come to the conclusion that if this had been Frankie Vee who had \ndone this, he would currently be serving time in the Federal \npenitentiary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 1999.\n     Re Request for Representation of Clifford H.

Tripp yesterday said the release of \n     information from her confidential personnel file was ``wrong \n     and illegal,'' and part of a ``smear campaign'' by the White \n     House to damage her reputation.\n       The attorneys said the campaign was engineered by President \n     Clinton and his senior advisers, who ``turned their public \n     relations machine against Mrs. Tripp'' to divert attention \n     from the president's conduct with former White House intern \n     Monica Lewinsky.\n       ``The campaign worked, and Mrs. Tripp was publicly \n     humiliated on numerous occasions,'' attorneys Stephen M. \n     Kohn, David K. Colapinto and Michael D. Kohn said in a \n     statement. ``Her reputation was poisoned, her motives \n     questioned and even her personal appearance became fair game \n     for ridicule.''\n       They said the leak of the Tripp file by Pentagon spokesman \n     Kenneth Bacon to a reporter looking to write a critical story \n     of Mrs. Tripp was part of that scheme, and that the file's \n     disclosure was prohibited under the federal Privacy Act.\n       The Defense Department's Office of Inspector General \n     concluded that Mr. Bacon and his former top deputy, Clifford \n     H. Bernath, violated Mrs. Tripp's privacy rights by providing \n     information from her confidential personnel file to a \n     reporter for the New Yorker magazine.\n       But the two men received only mild reprimands Thursday from \n     Defense Secretary William S. Cohen.\n       Mr. Cohen criticized Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath in letters \n     for what he called a ``serious lapse of judgment,'' although \n     neither letter was made part of the men's personnel files and \n     no further disciplinary action was recommended. The case is \n     closed.\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n       Mr. Clinton, through a spokesman, yesterday said he had \n     ``full confidence'' in the Cohen decision.\n       ``The president has full confidence in the secretary of \n     defense's management of his staff and the Pentagon and \n     supports the judgment of the secretary of defense to take the \n     actions appropriate,'' said P.J. Crowley, chief spokesman for \n     the White House National Security Council, Mr. Crowley \n     formerly worked for Mr. Bacon.\n       Mrs. Tripp is the Pentagon official who blew the whistle on \n     Mr. Clinton's affair with Miss Lewinsky. Both Mrs. Tripp and \n     Miss Lewinsky worked for Mr. Bacon.\n       Mrs. Tripp has since field a lawsuit accusing the White \n     House and the Defense Department of using her confidential \n     file to smear her reputation.\n       In a five-page statement, her attorneys noted that the leak \n     to Jane Mayer, a reporter for the New Yorker, came after Mr. \n     Bacon met privately over dinner with former White House \n     Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes--who ``volunteered'' to \n     help Mr. Clinton in damage control after the Lewinsky \n     accusations surfaced. They said Mr. Ickes also had met with \n     Miss Mayer before the information was released.\n       ``This was simply not an innocent release of information in \n     response to an inquiry by a reporter,'' they said. ``It is \n     well-established that Mr. Bacon and his associate who was \n     involved in the illegal leak knew that the information \n     requested from Mrs. Tripp's security file would be used in a \n     derogatory manner to smear Mrs. Tripp and question her \n     credibility.''\n       They also said Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath had been told the \n     information from the file was covered by the Privacy Act and \n     could not be released without Mrs. Tripp's consent.\n       Mr. Ickes, now coordinating first lady Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton's run for a U.S. Senate seat in New York, did not \n     return calls to his office for comment. He previously denied \n     any wrongdoing, saying that while he met with Mr. Bacon and \n     Miss Mayer before the file was leaked, he denied the \n     discussions were part of a conspiracy.\n       The White House also has denied any involvement in the \n     leak, and Mr. Bacon, in a statement on Thursday, said he did \n     not believe he violated Mrs. Tripp's privacy rights and that \n     ``ultimately my conduct will be found lawful.''\n       Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican who denounced a \n     Justice Department decision last month not to seek an \n     indictment of Mr. Bacon or Mr. Bernath, despite concerns \n     outlined in a July 1998 report by the inspector general, \n     called the Cohen reprimand ``a travesty.''\n       ``At a minimum, Bacon and Bernath should have been fired,'' \n     said Mr. Inhofe. ``This is what happened to the Bush \n     administration official who misused candidate Bill Clinton's \n     passport file in 1992. It is what Bill Clinton said would \n     happen to anyone in his administration found guilty of a \n     similar invasion of privacy.''\n       Mr. Cohen yesterday denied that he whitewashed the release \n     of information from Mrs. Tripp's confidential file, saying \n     there was ``no attempt to injure Miss Tripp's credibility or \n     her reputation.''\n       He told reporters at Morristown Airport after touring \n     nearby Picatinny Arsenal that Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath were \n     seeking to respond to pressure from the media and that there \n     was no attempt to orchestrate any campaign to discredit Mrs. \n     Tripp.\n       ``I don't intend to fire him,'' Mr. Cohen said of Mr. \n     Bacon.\n       In a final report made public yesterday, acting Inspector \n     General Donald Mancuso said the harm to Mrs. Tripp's privacy \n     interests caused by the release of her confidential personnel \n     file outweighed any public benefit.\n       ``Accordingly, the release constituted a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of her privacy,'' the report said. The \n     report said the actions of Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath \n     constituted a violation of the federal Privacy Act.\n       The documents leaked showed that Mrs. Tripp had said she \n     never had been arrested, when in fact she had--in what later \n     was described as a teen-age prank that occurred more than 30 \n     years ago.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 3\n\n             [From the The Weekly Standard, June 12, 2000]\n\n Why Didn't Bacon Get Fried?--The Pentagon's Anti-Tripp Leakers Get a \n       Slap on the Wrist, and the Privacy Act a Slap in the Face\n\n                          (By Jay Nordlinger)\n\n       It's just a small matter, in all the Clinton grossness, but \n     it counts. Linda Tripp was the victim of a dirty, and \n     illegal, trick. It was played on her by her own bosses at the \n     Pentagon. And now those men--Kenneth Bacon and Clifford \n     Bernath--have escaped with the wispiest slaps on the wrist. \n     This is ho-hum for the Clinton administration; but it is a \n     reminder of how unlawful and indecent this administration has \n     been.\n       Before this little affair slides all the way down the \n     memory hole, recall the essential facts: In January 1998, the \n     Lewinsky scandal exploded on Bill Clinton's head. From the \n     point of view of the White House, Linda Tripp was the major \n     villain. It was therefore a matter of urgency to discredit \n     her. In March, Jane Mayer, a Clinton-friendly reporter for \n     the New Yorker, acquired what seemed a valuable piece of \n     information: Tripp, as a teenager, had been arrested for \n     larceny. Mayer put in a call to Ken Bacon, assistant \n     secretary of defense for public affairs. He was an old \n     friend; the two had worked together at the Wall Street \n     Journal. Mayer had an amazingly specific question for him: \n     How had Tripp responded to Question 21, parts a and b, on \n     Form 398? This was a highly sensitive national-security \n     questionnaire, under the eye of the Privacy Act Branch of the \n     Defense Security Service; Question 21 dealt with arrests and \n     detentions.\n       Bacon quickly swung into action. He ordered his deputy, \n     Cliff Bernath, to get Mayer her answer. Hours before the \n     reporter's deadline, Bernath told her not to worry: ``Ken has \n     made clear it's priority.'' Moving heaven and earth, and \n     alarming career officers as he went, Bernath delivered--right \n     on time.\n       It looked like bad news for Tripp: She had not, in fact, \n     disclosed on Form 398 her 1969 arrest. Bernath told the New \n     York Times that Tripp faced the ``very serious charge'' of \n     lying to the government. Defense secretary William Cohen \n     declared on CNN that Tripp was ``guilty of a contradiction of \n     the truth,'' which would be ``looked into.'' It soon emerged, \n     however, that Tripp's arrest had been the result of a \n     juvenile prank, perpetrated against her. The judge had \n     reduced the charge to one count of loitering, telling her, as \n     she recalled it, that her record would be clear. The \n     Pentagon, rather sheepishly, dropped its investigation of \n     Tripp. Instead, Congress demanded that the department \n     investigate Bacon and Bernath--for violating the Privacy Act. \n     In their attempt to help Mayer nail Tripp, the two men seemed \n     to have nailed themselves.\n       The Pentagon's inspector general, Eleanor Hill, duly \n     launched an investigation. The case being clear-cut, it \n     didn't take her long to find that Bacon and Bernath had \n     indeed violated the Privacy Act. In July 1998, she referred \n     the matter to the Justice Department--which then sat on it \n     for almost two full years. This would have been \n     incomprehensible in any other administration. Only in April \n     2000 did Justice announce that it would not prosecute. \n     Incredibly, the department claimed that there was ``no direct \n     evidence upon which to pursue any violation of the Privacy \n     Act.''\n       It was then left to Secretary Cohen to determine a penalty \n     for Bacon and Bernath--if any. What he decided to do was \n     write a letter expressing his ``disappointment'' in the men. \n     Each would receive a copy. In this letter, Cohen said that \n     his subordinates' actions had been ``hasty and ill-\n     considered.'' He noted that, at the time of the incident, \n     they and others at the Pentagon were under instruction not to \n     release anything concerning Tripp without first consulting \n     department lawyers. The strongest language he used was \n     ``serious lapse of judgment.'' But this was balanced against \n     ``the very high quality of the performance that you have \n     otherwise exhibited.'' Amazingly, Cohen told the press that \n     ``there was no attempt to injure Miss Tripp's credibility \n     or her reputation.''\n       Contemplating this, Dick Morris, the former Clinton \n     adviser, had no choice but to remark, ``Generally, it is a \n     good political rule never to say anything that the average 6-\n     year-old knows isn't true.''\n       The most striking thing about the Cohen letter is that it \n     will not even be placed in either Bacon's or Bernath's \n     permanent file. According to the Pentagon, this is not a \n     letter of reprimand. A department spokesman, Craig Quigley, \n     described it as ``a personal letter to both Mr. Bernath and \n     Mr. Bacon.'' Incredulous, a reporter said, ``So, it's not a \n     letter of reprimand?'' ``No,'' said Quigley, ``Well, what \n     would you call it?'' Said Quigley, ``It's an official letter \n     expressing the secretary's disappointment in the judgment'' \n     of the two officials.\n       Quigley, like his boss, Bacon, also persisted in the \n     fiction that the leak to Mayer was no big deal--a matter of \n     routing, just business as usual. ``This information was taken \n     in the normal course of the day.'' It was ``done very clearly \n     and above board.'' You know how it is at the Pentagon: ``A \n     reporter will call with a question or request for data of \n     some sort, and it's provided as best we can.'' Anyone who has \n     ever covered, or tried to cover, the Defense Department will \n     gladly tell you this is rot. Quigley trotted out another line \n     as well, one that is increasingly becoming the Bacon defense: \n     ``You always do a balancing act between the Freedom of \n     Information Act and the Privacy Act.'' This assertion is \n     absurd: Form 398 is strickly a Privacy Act document.\n       After Cohen's non-reprimand, a few Republicans properly \n     cried bloody murder. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma accused \n     the Pentagon of ``a whitewash and a coverup.'' He said that \n     ``the law was broken, and nothing is being done about it.'' \n     The failure to punish the leakers would ``send a signal to \n     millions of federal civilian and military employees that \n     their private government records can be made public for \n     political purposes, and no one will be held accountable.''\n       For their part, Bacon and Bernath are denying any violation \n     of the Privacy Act. At a press conference, Bacon was asked \n     whether he would apologize to Tripp. ``Well,'' he replied, \n     ``I have already issued the apologies that I have to issue.'' \n     (He didn't specify what those were.) ``I don't think that I \n     performed unlawfully,'' he continued. His only regret was \n     that he had not ``checked this with lawyers.'' In an official \n     statement, Bacon said, ``It certainly never occurred to me \n     that the Privacy Act would preclude disclosing how a public \n     figure recorded a public arrest record on a security \n     clearance.'' And here is more, perhaps Bacon's richest \n     utterance to date: ``I obviously knew that this was an issue \n     of considerable public concern and that the public\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\n     had an interest in knowing whether Ms. Tripp had accurately \n     acknowledged her arrest record.''\n       Bernath, the junior partner in the enterprise, following \n     orders, although blindly, was similarly unbowed, saying, ``My \n     actions were not only legal, but also ethical and correct.''\n       Meanwhile, Tripp is suing both the Pentagon and the White \n     House for Privacy Act violations and witness intimidation. \n     This suit may in fact have been on Cohen's mind when he \n     declined to take serious action against his guys. Cohen gave \n     the game away somewhat on Meet the Press, saying of Bacon, \n     ``He is now the subject of a major lawsuit. And so he will \n     continue to be held accountable to the legal process.'' This \n     is exactly the sort of thinking that worries many observers, \n     including Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney with long \n     experience in this area. Says diGenova, ``The treatment of \n     Bacon and Bernath suggests that the Privacy Act will be \n     enforceable only in civil lawsuits filed by the victims. It \n     there's no adverse action--not even a letter that goes into \n     somebody's file--there's no deterrence here. None \n     whatsoever.'' In other words, ``Don't leave it solely to the \n     victim, who has to pay lawyers and so on, to enforce her \n     rights under the Privacy Act. The government should enforce \n     those rights, especially given that it was government people \n     who broke the law.''\n       The president and his men have a bit of a history with the \n     Privacy Act. You perhaps remember Passportgate. Toward the \n     end of the 1992 presidential campaign, it was learned that \n     political appointees in the Bush State Department had rifled \n     through candidate Clinton's passport files and those of his \n     mother. Democrats demanded an independent-counsel \n     investigation. They got one--led by diGenova. One of the \n     officials involved, Elizabeth Tamposi, was dismissed. The \n     acting secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, offered to \n     resign over the matter (President Bush refused). Said \n     Clinton, in his first press conference as president-elect, \n     ``If I catch anybody doing [what the passport-file offenders \n     did], I will fire them the next day. You won't have to have \n     an inquiry or rigmarole or anything else.''\n       About a year later, Passportgage had something of a \n     reprise, this time featuring appointees in Clinton's own \n     State Department. A few of them got hold of Bush-\n     administration personnel files and leaked them to Al Kamen of \n     the Washington Post. Kamen thus had the following story: \n     ``Guess whose working file was empty? That of very \n     controversial longtime Bush employee Jennifer Fitzgerald.'' \n     Kamen, of course, was being coy here: Fitzgerald was the \n     woman rumored to have had an affair with President Bush. \n     Damen was also able to report that Elizabeth Tamposi's file \n     included ``concerns from very senior State Department types \n     that she was not ready for an assistant secretaryship.''\n       Immediately, the State Department's inspector general, \n     Sherman Funk, began an investigation. He found that two \n     employees--Joseph Tarver and Mark Schulhof--were stone-cold \n     guilty. Funk told Congress that the pair had engaged in \n     ``criminal violations of the Privacy Act provable beyond a \n     reasonable doubt.'' The Justice Department (developing a \n     pattern) refused to prosecute. In November 1993, the \n     department secretary, Warren Christopher, fired Tarver and \n     Schulhof. This must have been one of the last acts of \n     Clinton-administration honor. The contrast with the Bacon-\n     Tripp case--in this last respect--is overwhelming.\n       Then, of course, there was Filegate, in which the White \n     House gathered unto its bosom hundreds of Republican FBI \n     files, including Linda Tripp's. And the president himself was \n     prompt to release letters from Kathleen Willey--a woman who \n     had accused him of improper sexual conduct--when it was \n     convenient.\n       If all this didn't begin with Watergate, it was certainly \n     enshrined there. When the Bacon-Tripp story first broke, \n     Charles Colson reminded this magazine that it was to a Bacon-\n     style disclosure that he had pleaded guilty, in 1974. He had \n     released information from Daniel Ellsberg's FBI file to the \n     Copley Press, at a time when Ellsberg was a defendant in the \n     Pentagon Papers case and a thorn in the Nixon \n     administration's side--the parallels to Tripp are neat. \n     Colson went to jail for this. The special prosecutor, Leon \n     Jaworski, rejoiced that Colson's plea had set a precedent: No \n     longer would political appointees so readily smear their foes \n     in this way. Indeed, the Privacy Act was a post-Watergate \n     reform, intended to check Nixonian abuses.\n       Says diGenova, ``The Bacon thing is a facial and obvious \n     violation of the Privacy Act. It is made for it.'' Bear this \n     in mind: ``Linda Tripp was engaged in a very public dispute \n     with the president.'' His presidency hung in the balance; he, \n     like Nixon before him, was on the road to impeachment. ``This \n     is precisely the kind of circumstance that Congress had in \n     mind when it gave us the Privacy Act. And not to punish this \n     conduct is a very serious mistake.''\n       Apart from Tripp's lonely lawsuit, this affair has now \n     reached an end. Yet two questions hang over it. First, Who \n     gave Jane Mayer that promising tidbit from Tripp's past? \n     Mayer says that it was a former wife of Tripp's father. \n     Others--not necessarily full-time conspiracy theorists, \n     either--wonder whether that's the full story. Team Clinton \n     had every reason to dig for dirt on Tripp. The chief \n     recordkeeper in the White House, Terry Good, testified in a \n     deposition that the White House counsel's office had \n     requested ``anything and everything that we might have in our \n     files relating to Linda Tripp.''\n       The second question is, Did Bacon act of his own \n     initiative? Or was he prompted by someone--presumably at the \n     White House--to let fly what appeared to be damaging \n     information? Bacon has steadfastly claimed that he acted \n     entirely on his own, with no order, wink, or nod. But this \n     strikes most people familiar with the workings of the \n     Pentagon--and of the Clinton camp generally--as implausible. \n     A veteran Defense Department hand told us, ``Couldn't happen, \n     didn't happen, no way, no how. Remember: Everyone who comes \n     into public affairs is told Privacy Act rules. You don't \n     release someone's confidential information--to anyone, much \n     less the media. This is Public Affairs 101. And Bacon is \n     perpetrating a shameful lie. Any professional in the building \n     will tell you the same thing.''\n       So, the Clinton administration lurches to a close, its \n     players going this way and that, its loose ends being tied \n     up, however unsatisfactorily. Jane Mayer, the little lady who \n     started this not-so-great war, was recently a guest at a \n     White House state dinner. She was seated in a place of honor: \n     the first lady's table. As for her friend Bacon, he has waxed \n     philosophical about his humble-gate: ``This is an extremely \n     small part of a large and painful national drama.''\n       Yes, but it is significant nonetheless. The rule of law has \n     taken a beating in this administration, not to mention such \n     demands as honesty and trustworthiness. After Cohen flaked \n     out, one of Tripp's lawyers made a somewhat poignant \n     statement: ``Despite Linda Tripp's unpopularity, the law \n     should protect her.'' Such a simple notion. And powerful, \n     even now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, according to the latest estimates put \nforth by the Congressional Budget Office, the United States is \nprojected to achieve an on-budget surplus of $26 billion in fiscal year \n2000, the current fiscal year. What many Americans do not realize is \nthat Medicare Part A, that portion of every person's paycheck that is \ndeducted for hospital insurance, is the largest component of our \nNation's on-budget surplus. It accounts for approximately $22 billion \nof the $26 billion fiscal year 2000 surplus. Of the on-budget surplus \nof $26 billion, $22 billion is actually money that has been paid into \nMedicare that is not being used for Medicare recipients today. It is \noverpayment.\n  Of that $26 billion on-budget surplus, the fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution assumed that $14 billion of that on-budget surplus would be \nused to pay for military operations in Kosovo, natural disaster relief \nin the United States, Colombian drug eradication assistance, and other \nsupplemental spending. Fourteen billion of the $26 billion has been \nspoken for, and for all intents and purposes, it is off the table. It \nis gone.\n  That leaves approximately $12 billion in on-budget surplus dollars \navailable and unallocated--quite a tempting target.\n  If we don't use this $12 billion to pay down the national debt, I am \nconcerned Congress will just spend the money. However, there is another \noption. In the very near future, Senator Allard and I and several of \nour other colleagues will propose an amendment that will direct the \nremaining $12 billion to be used for debt reduction instead of allowing \nit to be squandered on additional spending. We have given a lot of \nlipservice to being in favor of reducing the national debt. We have \nheard it in the House and the Senate. This will be a wonderful \nopportunity for everybody to vote to put $12 billion of the on-budget \nsurplus into debt reduction.\n  In addition, once the CBO releases its revised baseline this summer, \nwe will come back again and propose another amendment that will \nallocate whatever additional fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus dollars \nare achieved towards debt reduction. We know in July we will have new \nnumbers so there will be more money. At that time, we will come back \nand say: Let us use that additional money to pay down the debt.\n  Ever since the Congressional Budget Office first projected we would \nhave a budget surplus back in 1998, Congress and the administration \nhave been falling all over themselves to spend our on-budget surplus \ndollars. Indeed, if we include the supplemental appropriations, fiscal \nyear 2000 discretionary\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nspending will increase $37 billion, or 6.4 percent, over fiscal year \n1999. Again, when we use the $14 billion of the on-budget surplus and \nadd it to what we have already allocated for 2000, we are now talking \nabout a 6.4-percent increase in spending in the year 2000 over 1999. \nThat is tremendous growth in Government spending.\n\n  On another note, we hear that Vice President Gore now supports a \nMedicare lockbox, a lockbox similar to the one we created.\n  As I stated earlier, Medicare Part A is the largest component of our \nNation's on-budget surplus, accounting for approximately $22 billion. \nBecause of our strong economy and high employment, more money has come \ninto the Medicare program via the payroll tax than has been spent in \nbenefits. Again, we are either going to spend those on-budget surplus \ndollars on unrelated Government spending, or we can use it to reduce \nthe national debt.\n  Last November, Senator Ashcroft introduced the Social Security and \nMedicare Safe Deposit Act to wall off both the Social Security and \nMedicare Part A trust fund surpluses; in essence, to put them in a \nlockbox so the only other purpose for which they could be used would be \nto pay down the national debt. That is what we were going to do with \nit. The Senate had a chance this year to vote on a Medicare lockbox on \nApril 7, when Senators Ashcroft, Brownback, Grams, and I offered an \namendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. Unfortunately, \nSenator Ashcroft had only 2 minutes to speak on the subject. I didn't \nget a chance to speak on it at all because no one was very interested \nat that time.\n  I remind my colleagues, the vote on the Medicare lockbox amendment \nwas opposed by 43 Members of this Senate on the opposite side of the \naisle; that is, 43 Democratic Members of the Senate voted ``no'' on the \nMedicare lockbox amendment. I thought the Medicare lockbox was a good \nidea then; I think it is still a good idea. Now, apparently, the Vice \nPresident thinks it is a good idea.\n  We need to lockbox Medicare to make sure that the excess money paid \ninto Medicare Part A goes for debt reduction and is not going to be \nused for more spending or tax cuts. We need to use it for debt \nreduction, period, just as all the experts have said. Alan Greenspan, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Daniel Crippen, head of CBO; \nDavid Walker, head of the GAO--all have said we should take the on-\nbudget surplus and use it to pay down debt. I am pleased the Vice \nPresident is on board with a Medicare lockbox. I hope he will be able \nto convince Senators on the other side of the aisle that we need to \nmake sure the on-budget surplus funds coming into the Treasury, which \nare mostly Medicare Part A dollars, are used to pay down the debt.\n  If my colleagues on the other side agree with the Vice President that \nwe need to lockbox the Medicare surplus, which comprises $22 billion of \nthe on-budget surplus, then they should have no problem supporting \nusing $12 billion to pay down the debt.\n  We are going to have an opportunity twice this year--once perhaps \nthis week on the Defense appropriations bill--to use the remaining on-\nbudget surplus to reduce the national debt or to pay for more spending. \nI think it will be one of the best budget votes my colleagues will have \nall year long. Not only will it keep down spending, it will help bring \ndown our publicly held debt. We have to make sure we make the right \ndecisions in terms of our on-budget surplus.\n  I would like to also take advantage of this opportunity to quote the \nVice President. This quotation was in the Washington Post:\n\n       The temptation has always been to treat Medicare the way \n     Social Security used to be treated--as a source of money for \n     spending or tax cuts. And now that we have succeeded in \n     taking Social Security off budget and using it to pay down \n     the debt, we need to do the same thing with Medicare and put \n     it in a lockbox.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that when the issue of the Social Security \nlockbox came up on the floor of the Senate, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, on six occasions, all 45 of them voted against--\nvoted against--the Social Security lockbox. My feeling is that we will \nfind out this year whether or not the administration is in favor of \nlockboxing Social Security and lockboxing Medicare.\n  I think it is time we level with the American people and let them \nknow that the on-budget surplus we have been talking about is primarily \nmade up of overpayment of Medicare Part A payroll taxes, and that what \nwe have been doing is proposing to use that for more spending or for \nreducing taxes. Let's lock it up. Let's put it in a lockbox. Let's make \nsure that the money that is being paid into Medicare is money for \ninsurance for the elderly and is not used for tax reductions or, in the \nalternative, used to pay for other Federal spending. Now is the time to \nmake that point. Now is the time to be counted.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. VOINOVICH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe we have about 15 minutes left in \nmorning business, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4944-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4944-S4946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DECIDING THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio. I certainly \ncould not agree more that when we have--as we do and will--a surplus, \nwe need to decide where our priorities are in terms of spending those \ndollars. I can tell you, if they are just left here, they will be \nspent. If our priorities do lie in funding what our programs are, in \nensuring that Social Security maintains itself, and that Medicare is \nthere, and when we want to ensure that we keep a balanced budget and \nstart to pay down our debt, then we have to commit ourselves to do \nthose things. I think it is an excellent idea for those dollars, so \nthat they won't be spent for something else. I also think we ought to \npay down the debt, and we hopefully will have some opportunity to get \nsome tax relief. It is tougher, interestingly enough, when you have a \nsurplus to make sure that the money is used as beneficially as when you \nare dealing with a deficit. That is what I wanted to talk about this \nmorning.\n  That is how we might make Government more efficient. You know, we \ntalk about that a lot. Most of us talk about less Federal Government \nand how do we make sure the dollars are spent as efficiently as they \ncan be and, hopefully, how we can arrive at a situation where those \npeople who earn the dollars can keep more of them. That ought to be \npart of our goal.\n\n  I think there are some things that this Congress ought to consider, \nand they seem very important to me--ways in which we intend to ensure \nthat the Government is more efficient, that the Federal Government \nindeed is limited in size, and that we make certain the Federal \nGovernment does those things that are defined in the Constitution and \nnot those other things that are not and should be left to the States \nand the people. That is what the Constitution says. That is what most \nof us want.\n  Particularly, I suppose, when you come from a State such as mine, \nWyoming, where we have a relatively low population, where we have a lot \nof open space and not too many folks, then the way you have programs \nfunction is different than it is in Connecticut and different than it \nis in Pittsburgh. So you really need that flexibility and you need to \nbe doing as much governance as can be done, in my opinion, as close to \npeople as possible so that it fits. That is what we ought to be talking \nabout--less bureaucracy and more responsiveness, and doing what we need \nto do. This budget process that we are going through now is quite \nimportant, not only with respect to spending the money, but we really \ndefine for ourselves what we think the priorities are in terms of the \nneeds of the American people, and what the role of the Federal \nGovernment is to help satisfy those needs. It is difficult.\n  I think it is fair to say that governments have less discipline than \nthe private sector. There is really nothing to force the Government to \nhave to behave in different ways, which is true in the private sector. \nI come from a business background. I tell you, you have\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nto make changes from time to time because the economy makes it \nimperative that you do that, or you go broke. You are forced to change. \nThat is not so with the Government. There is no competition there, so \nyou are not forced to do things. I am not totally critical of the \nGovernment, by any means. I am only saying that there is a difference \nbetween how you run the Government and how you run the private sector. \nI believe there are a number of factors in the private sector that \nwould help make the Federal Government much more effective. You have to \nforce change. Change doesn't come about easily in a bureaucracy. \nGovernments tend to go on as they have in the past. They tend to say \nthat is what we have done before and what we will continue to do. It is \nresistant to change. So seldom are they forced to reorganize. Agencies \nare insulated, to some extent, by the Congress. If we don't do some \nthings to bring about change, then change doesn't come about. I think \nit is our responsibility to do some of those things.\n  There are a number of ideas that I believe will help strengthen the \nsystem--ideas that are adapted from the private sector, to a large \nextent. They have to be initiated by the Congress, and there has to be \na system in which the Congress exercises its responsibility for \noversight to make sure that does not happen. There has to be a way that \nthings are audited, that things are reviewed to see if, in fact, we are \naccomplishing the things that are set out to do.\n  The first would be, of course, to establish goals.\n  I have recently been involved in electric deregulation. We have had \ngreat battles over it. I am not sure what is going to happen or whether \nit will be done this year. We are seeking, however, to make some \nchanges in the electric generating and distribution system. It has been \na regulated utility for years. We want to see if we can't do it a \nlittle better in other ways.\n  Do you know what else we should do, in my opinion? We haven't really \ndefined what we want. We get all wrapped up in what is going on. We are \ngoing to do this, or that, or this, when we haven't really clearly \ndefined what we want the end result to be.\n  It seems to me it would be very productive if this Congress--maybe \nwhen we start to deal with campaign finance--knew what it wanted in the \nend. I think we could do that. If you are not certain where you are \ngoing--remember the old story of Alice in Wonderland. She fell through \nthe hole and talked to all of the different people, and didn't get any \nadvice. Finally, she saw the Cheshire cat up in the tree, and she was \nright at the junction of the road. She said: Cat, which road should I \ntake? The cat said: Where do you want to go? She said: I don't know. \nThe cat said: Then it doesn't make any difference what road you take.\n  That is kind of where we are sometimes. If we don't know what we want \nto accomplish, then how do we get there?\n  I think instead of emphasizing the process, which we often do, we \nthen need to measure results. That is really what it ought to be about. \nThat is where you have the flexibility by saying you worry so much \nabout how you get there but you measure the results at the end. There \nare things we can do.\n  Congress needs to first define where we are going, define how we get \nthere, and then measure the results; give some flexibility so that \nthings can be done differently in different places. The health care \nsystem delivery is much different in Wyoming from what it is in \nCalifornia. You have to have some flexibility to do that.\n  Congressional oversight is something that, unfortunately, we probably \ndon't do as much as we should. That is what committee meetings are for. \nThat is what audits are for. When you pass a law and say here is where \nwe want to go, then you have to say: How are we getting there? We don't \ndo that well.\n  The Republicans and the majority party have been putting emphasis on \noversight. I think that is a great thing to do. That is why I like \nbiennial appropriations--so you don't have to spend 2 years doing \nappropriations. We ought to do them every other year, and spend the \ninterim year seeing if the money we are spending is doing the things we \nintended.\n  The Constitution divides the responsibilities in the Federal \nGovernment for a reason; that is, so that no one segment of Government \ncontrols everything. We have an executive branch; we have a legislative \nbranch; we have a judicial branch. It is for good reason: To divide and \nstrengthen the responsibilities and power so there is balance.\n  We, frankly, find that particularly this administration, as their \ntime expires, is moving far beyond what the legislature has authorized \nand doing many things by regulation without talking at all with the \nCongress or, indeed, to the people. I think we have to really make sure \nthat what the law intends is carried out.\n  Congress passed a bill in 1998, which I authored, which defines the \nvarious activities of Congress: Listing those activities that are \ninherently governmental, listing those that are not, and listing those \nthat could better be done by contract in the private sector. We passed \nthat bill. We have had some progress. There has been a listing, \ngenerally.\n\n  By the way, the Defense Department, in my opinion, does a better job \nof contracting than any other agency. That ought to be the role of an \nagency, to strengthen their ability to manage contracts, but to let \nthose contracts go out to the private sector and people who do that \nprofessionally and more efficiently all of the time. I think that is \nsomething we really ought to be able to do.\n  We also need, of course, to find a way to terminate programs.\n  I mentioned in the beginning that Government tends to perpetuate \nitself. It seems to go on. I understand that. There ought to be a way \nto have some kind of sunset mechanism. After a period of time, \nhopefully, a job is finished. Not in every case, but in some cases the \nwork is completed, and the mission is accomplished. Then we ought to do \naway with that agency or activity that was developed for a particular \njob. Unfortunately, in the political system, as you start a program of \nthat kind, it builds its own constituency and seems never to go away. \nBut we need to have a way to do that. I think the sunset idea is an \ninteresting one.\n  We have been talking about these for some time.\n  I am really delighted to see in the news today what Gov. George Bush \nsuggested. One is opening positions to commercial activities, and \nanother one is result oriented and talking about doing the very things \nwe are talking about here. If we could have an administration that \nagrees with Congress to move that way, we could do it.\n  I close by saying I introduced last week the Congressional Regulatory \nReview Reform Act of 2000. In 1993, a bill was passed that said \nregulations needed to be sent back to Congress for some kind of \noversight. We found increasingly, particularly in this administration, \nthat there was an effort and an agenda to move regulation by Executive \norders that could not get through the legislative process--to sort of \ngo around it. Unfortunately, Congress has allowed this to happen and \nhas delegated much of its legislative responsibility to the bureaucracy \nin terms of the regulations that are written to implement the law.\n  Clearly, Congress can't go into huge detail, nor should it. But the \nimportant thing is that the regulations designed to implement the law \nneed to carry out the intent.\n  In my subcommittee last week we had a meeting on national parks. We \nhave a very good national park bill that was passed in 1998. Now we are \nimplementing that bill. We are having discussions as to how we ensure \nthe regulations that are developed in fact bring about the change \nintended in the legislation and that regulations don't simply keep it \nas it was.\n  The system we passed in 1996 has not worked as well as it should. \nOver 12,000 nonmajor rules and 186 major rules have been submitted to \nCongress--major rules being ones that have more than $100 million in \nimpact on the private sector. Out of 12,000, only 7 resolutions of \ndisapproval have been introduced pertaining to 5 bills. None has passed \neither House. So it isn't working as it should.\n  We are trying to make some changes and say, rather than just going to \nthe Office of Management and Budget, it ought to go to GAO, which is \nthe general auditing organization. Then it should come to Congress so \nCongress\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nhas an opportunity to take a look at it. If indeed it doesn't reflect \nthe intent, Congress should have a chance to change it.\n  Those are some of the things that I think would help implement the \nthings we are doing. It would help to have a smaller and more efficient \nGovernment. It would help us, Mr. President, as you pointed out, to set \naside some of the dollars that ought to be used to pay down the debt \nand go back to the taxpayers. I think we have a great opportunity to do \nthat. I hope we focus on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise to remind Senators that there is \nan order that requires amendments to this bill be filed by 3 p.m. We \nhave been notified there are about 41 amendments that may be offered. \nSenator Inouye and I are prepared to deal with these.\n  If Members have amendments and desire to have a vote sometime \ntomorrow, please take time this afternoon to initiate that debate. \nThere is no time limit on amendments yet, but we do intend to reach a \ntime limit agreement on amendments later this afternoon. If Members \nhave amendments and desire to have a considerable amount of time to \npresent to the Senate, this is a great time to do that.\n  We will be working up a managers' package of amendments that we \nbelieve we can take to conference and work out. Senators may want to \nidentify those amendments and present them. We would be pleased to \nconsider them now and determine if we will put them in the managers' \npackage so we can move the bill forward.\n  It is our hope we will finish this bill tomorrow afternoon. That is \ncomplicated a little bit by the fact we have a full Appropriations \nCommittee meeting tomorrow afternoon to report out the Transportation \nappropriations bill. That may not take very long. It is our intention \nto keep working on the Defense bill, notwithstanding the fact we will \nbe in committee on the Transportation bill. I urge Senators to \nintroduce and possibly present amendments to the Senate so we can \ndetermine whether they should be included in our managers' package, \nwhich will be accepted by unanimous consent.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR PREVENTATIVE \n                   APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES IN DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE AREAS THAT MAY BE USED BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Definition of Pesticide.--In this section, the term \n     `pesticide' has the meaning given the term in section 2 of \n     the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 136).\n       (b) Prohibition Use of Funds.--None of the funds \n     appropriated under this Act may be used for the preventative \n     application of a pesticide containing a known or probable \n     carcinogen or a category I or II acute nerve toxin, or a \n     pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate, or \n     organochlorine class, in any area owned or managed by the \n     Department of Defense that may be used by children, including \n     a park, base housing, a recreation center, a playground, or a \n     daycare facility.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator from Alaska, I am asking for the \nyeas and nays on my amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will agree to that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may be recognized, I ask that it be \nscheduled for sometime tomorrow at a time to be agreed upon between the \nSenator from Hawaii and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to clarify with my friend from Alaska and my \nfriend from Hawaii that we will have an up-or-down vote on this \namendment and not a second degree? We can have a vote up or down.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no problem with agreeing that the amendment not \nbe subject to a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Alaska and my friend from Hawaii \nfor agreeing to my request. I hope we will not have much opposition \nbecause I believe that this amendment is, in fact, consistent with the \nstated policy of the Department of Defense. I will explain what my \namendment does.\n  My amendment would prohibit the routine use of particularly harmful \npesticides on Department of Defense property or grounds where children \nmay be present.\n  I was stunned to learn, about a year after I got to the Senate--so it \nmust have been about 1984--that the way the laws were written and the \nway they applied across the Government was that our environmental laws \nwere set to protect essentially 155-pound men.\n  Now, that is fine, if you are in that category, but what we find out \nis that people of a lesser weight, a different gender, pregnant women, \nthe elderly, people who are ill, and little children, react very \ndifferently to that amount of pollution or pesticide, as the case may \nbe. So I wrote a bill called the Children's Environmental Protection \nAct. I am very much hopeful that we can get it passed as sort of an \nomnibus bill that takes care of all of our laws in every Department to \nmake sure that children, in particular, are protected.\n  So far we have not had much luck moving that bigger package, so what \nI have done is, on every bill that has come before this body, I have \noffered an amendment that would lower the risk for our children. In \nthis particular case, we are saying to the Department of Defense: You \nhave been good about putting the policy forward; we want to codify it \nand make sure that you do not use a pesticide containing a probable \ncarcinogen or a known carcinogen, an acute nerve toxin or other toxins \nthat would in fact harm our children.\n  Why is it important to limit the use of these pesticides around \nchildren? Clearly, by definition, pesticides are meant to kill living \nthings. Exposure to pesticides has been linked to cancer,\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nneurological disorders, and learning disabilities. For example, common \ninsecticides that schools spray on baseboards and floors to kill \ncockroaches and ants include an active ingredient--chlorpyrifos--that \nis classified by the EPA as a nerve toxin. And I compliment Carol \nBrowner over at the EPA because she just held a press conference \nannouncing that this particular ingredient will be banned. However, it \nis important to note it is going to take at least 6 months for that \nban, and we do not want that kind of toxin being sprayed around \nchildren. That is why it is important to include it in this amendment.\n\n  We know that potential chronic effects from exposure to these kinds \nof harmful toxins, we know we see a decrease in neurological \nperformance.\n  Are these risks any different for children in relation to adults? The \nanswer is yes. I would like to refer you to the 1993 National Academy \nof Sciences report, ``Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and \nChildren.'' We know that children are at greater risk to experience the \nharmful effects of pesticides exposure than adults. In other words, \nchildren are not just little adults. They are changing; they are \ngrowing. I often say that I am a little adult but I am not a child; I \nhave grown to my maximum potential. But the fact is, kids at a certain \nage, before they reach maturity, are very susceptible to having adverse \nreactions to the chemicals that I would not have, nor Senator Inouye, \nnor Senator Stevens, nor our Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts; we are \nstronger, although I would say they are much stronger than I am because \nthey are being protected because of a rule that says if you are a 155-\npound male, you will be OK.\n  So it is important to bring this issue to the Senate as often as I \ncan, and I am very pleased with the response I have gotten from \ncolleagues thus far because we have been able to change the rules as \nthey apply to safe drinking water; we recently had some luck on an \neducation bill; and we have had some luck with the Superfund in \ncommittee. We make sure that when the Superfund sites are cleaned up--\nthese are the terrible dumps that include so many harmful toxins--they \nare cleaned up to protect children, not just the 155-pound adults.\n  We know that pound for pound of body weight, children eat more food; \nthey drink more water; and they breathe more air than adults so they \nare vulnerable. They are rapidly growing; their developing systems are \nvulnerable.\n  I want to show you this picture in case you are wondering what all \nthis means because I think it is extremely interesting and it is also \nextremely disturbing.\n  This picture is from a study, ``Showing the Effects of Pesticide \nExposure on Young children.'' One group of children in this study was \nfrom a region where pesticide use was high, both in the home and \noutdoors. The other group in the study was the same as the first group: \nsame age, same ethnicity, except the second group of children was from \nregions where pesticides were not used--the same group of children, \nexcept for pesticide exposure. The two groups of children were asked to \ndraw a person to test their cognitive ability, their ability to learn \nand understand. These are the results, results which show an unsettling \npicture.\n  These are the pictures that were drawn by the kids who were exposed \nto pesticides. You can see you don't even see a resemblance of a \nperson. And clearly where there was very little exposure, you are \ngetting a much more appropriate type of drawing. This isn't something \nthat we are making up. We are seeing this response.\n  The kids who grew up without exposure to pesticide use in significant \nproportions did far better. They had better hand-eye coordination, and \nyou could see it so clearly; they had better memory and their brain \nskills were so much sharper.\n  The study's authors also observed that children from the area with \nlittle pesticide use--and again that is clearly this group shown here--\nengaged in more group play; they were more creative with their \nactivities; they were less aggressive than the children from the area \nwith the high pesticide use. This is a study that is considered one of \nthe first in this particular area.\n  This was done by Professor Elizabeth Guillette who is affiliated with \nthe University of Arizona. This study clearly shows what many of us \nhave suspected for a long time. It is a fact in evidence that our kids \nare damaged when they are exposed to dangerous pesticides and toxins.\n  The point I want to make about the amendment is that while we \nprohibit the routine use of these dangerous pesticides, we certainly do \nnot prohibit the Department of Defense from using common and less toxic \npesticides.\n  Under the amendment, DOD could still use synthetic pyrethroid \ninsecticides to control insects. These insecticides are among the most \ncommon used today.\n  And, DOD could still use copper sulfate, a very common pesticide used \ntoday.\n  DOD also could still use ``biopesticides''--there are some 50 of \nthese type pesticides in use today.\n  DOD could also use pheromone traps and baits--which are used heavily \ntoday to control termites and carpenter ants.\n  Finally, DOD could still use insect growth regulators, which help \ncontrol insects.\n  I was asked when putting this amendment together: Suppose there is an \nabsolute emergency and we have an encephalitis epidemic break out on a \nmilitary base. We make an exception for that in this amendment. We \nagree, if we have to go to these harsher toxins to fight a health \nhazard. Of course. We have an exception in this amendment. By the way, \nthat exception is part of the DOD guidelines.\n  We are only banning as a routine method the known carcinogens, the \nprobable carcinogens, the nerve toxins from regular use.\n  This is a very disturbing study that was done by someone who is \nconsidered a leader in this field of understanding children and their \nbrain development at the University of Arizona. We know for a fact that \nkids are adversely impacted by these toxins. I would be very pleased to \nsee the Senate act to put on the record and put into law the official \nbanning of these very harmful pesticides.\n  I again thank my colleague, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, for \nhis help on this. I ask unanimous consent that Harry Reid be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I particularly thank Senator Stevens for \nhis graciousness in not only allowing me to go forward with this \namendment today but agreeing to have a vote directly on the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the author of the \nmeasure?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Is the Senator satisfied that her amendment does not \nviolate provisions of rule XVI?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, we have been told it is drawn in such a fashion that \nit simply says no funds may be used for these pesticides and toxins on \na regular basis.\n  Mr. INOUYE. It is limited only to the Department of Defense.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. I would love to do much more, I say to \nmy friend, but we are following rule XVI.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to address some \nremarks to the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  I commend the managers of the bill, Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye, for their work on this measure. These two Senators have a vast \nknowledge, and it goes all across the areas of the Defense Department. \nThey have been at this work a long time. Their hearts are in it, and \nthey are highly dedicated to it. Their combined efforts are always \nevident in the annual DOD appropriations bill. This year's bill is\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nno exception--it is a well-balanced and comprehensive measure.\n  In recent years, the committee has had to provide for ever-increasing \ndemands on our military--primarily in peacekeeping activities around \nthe world. Our military personnel are scattered around the world--they \nare skilled and dedicated men and women, ever vigilant in their duty--\ncharged with the responsibility of protecting the security of our \ncountry and its citizens. But they have in more recent times also been \ncharged with the responsibility of acting as peacekeepers in many \ntroubled areas around the globe.\n  Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to craft Defense \nappropriations bills. It has been nearly impossible to determine just \nhow long and to what extent our military personnel might be needed in \nsome of these peacekeeping operations, and what the estimated costs \nthereof might be. That situation exists today, for example, in Bosnia. \nIt exists in southwest Asia, in Kosovo, and even in Haiti.\n  So I take my hat off to our managers for their dedication, not only \nthis year but for many previous years, in working through these \nchallenges to provide the funding necessary to carry out these efforts.\n\n  The bill before us today clearly addresses the most critical needs of \nour military personnel and their families. The 3.7-percent pay raise \nrecommended by the Senate Armed Services Committee is fully funded in \nthis bill. Sufficient resources are also included to improve the health \ncare benefits of our military retirees. And more than $96.7 billion is \nprovided for the readiness of our military forces.\n  It is imperative that Congress provide funding for these important \nprograms to demonstrate to the men and women in uniform who are serving \nour country throughout the world our strong and unwavering support for \nthem.\n  Furthermore, this bill does not neglect our necessary defense \nmodernization requirements. It provides funding for all of the highest \npriority programs identified by our military leaders and requested by \nthe administration.\n  So I congratulate Senator Stevens, chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee--he is also chairman, of course, of the full \nAppropriations Committee--and Senator Inouye for their dedication and \nhard work, and I know that my colleagues will support passage of the \nbill.\n  I also take this opportunity to recognize in a very special way our \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nDaniel Inouye, who will be honored next week, at which time he will \nreceive the Nation's highest military award for valor--the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  How proud it makes all of us feel that we have someone like Daniel \nInouye here as a Senator in our midst as we think of the sacrifices \nthat he made.\n  Senator Inouye was first elected to the Senate in 1963 from our 50th \nState.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that I am one who voted for \nStatehood on behalf of both Alaska and Hawaii. I believe that I am the \nonly Senator left remaining here who voted for statehood for both of \nthese States. I am proud of having done that.\n  He was first elected, as I say, to the Senate in 1963 from Hawaii, \nthe 50th State. I think I am correct in saying that I am only one of \nthree Members of today's Senate who were also here when he joined this \nbody.\n  When I first came to the Senate, there were 96 Members of the Senate. \nUpon my being sworn in, the two new Senators from the new State of \nAlaska were sworn in with me, making a total of 98 Senators. Later in \nthe year, Hawaii, the new State, the 50th State, sent two Senators, two \nnew Senators to the Senate, making a total of 100 Senators to comprise \nthis body.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Danny Inouye on many \noccasions over the years. I have found him to be a man of the utmost \nintegrity, who has worked tirelessly in the Senate on behalf of his \nconstituents and on behalf of the Nation.\n  He was a Senator who was extremely supportive of me when I was the \nmajority leader of this body. He was supportive of me when I was \nminority leader. He was very supportive of me when I was chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee of the Senate. He is certainly a Senator \non whom one can rely for truth, for integrity, for steadfastness, for \nforthrightness, and as one who is extremely and highly dedicated to his \nwork.\n  Like many others in this body, I view Senator Inouye as a national \nhero. I know of his wartime heroics in France and in Italy. I read \nabout how he fought to protect the troops with whom he served without \nregard for his own life. He doesn't talk much about it, but we know \nabout it. He was gravely wounded in serving his country, yet he \ncontinued to fight. I am immensely proud of this outstanding American \nin our midst.\n  For many in Congress, in our hearts we have felt that Danny Inouye \nrichly deserves the special recognition he earned in those bloody \nbattles some 55 years ago. We are deeply moved and so proud that he is \nnow to receive the highest military honor that can be bestowed upon any \nAmerican citizen, the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n     It isn't enough to say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     It isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n\n     If a man does a work that you really admire,\n\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid.\n     In fear to do so might make him vain\n     And cause him to lose his head.\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done.''\n     And see how his gratitude swells.\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  Well done, our friend, our colleague, our hero.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at this moment I find that mere words are \ninadequate to express my deep gratitude. Aloha to the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. May I just simply say I thank him very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I share the feelings of the Senator from \nVirginia concerning the statement of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. Those are wonderful words to say about our colleague, \nand every one of them was well deserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Parliamentarian review the \namendments filed on this bill prior to 3 o'clock and inform the \nminority and majority managers of the bill whether any of those \namendments are subject to rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that second-\ndegree amendments be in order to the filed amendments, and that they be \nrelevant to the first-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers \nof the bill may, with the consent of the sponsor, modify amendments so \nthey could be included in the managers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              health care management demonstration program\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill in a brief colloquy on the issue of the health \ncare management demonstration program recommended by the Armed Services \nCommittee in S. 2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2001.\n  Section 740 of S. 2549 would direct the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct a test of two models to improve health care delivery in the \nDefense Health Program: one model would study alternative delivery \npolicies, processes, organization and technologies; the second would \nstudy long term disease management. This section would also\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\nauthorize $6 million within the total of $11.4 billion authorized for \nthe Defense Health Program in FY2001 to carry out these demonstration \nprograms. The Armed Services Committee believes that these two models \nhave the potential to improve significantly the delivery of health care \nin the military medical system.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished managers of the bill if the \nFY2001 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill currently before the \nSenate includes the resources in the Defense Health Program to conduct \nthe health care management demonstration program directed by section \n740 of S. 2549?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I support the health care demonstration program directed \nby section 740 of S. 2549, and I assure my good friend from Michigan \nthat the FY2001 Department of Defense appropriations bill before the \nSenate includes sufficient funding in the Defense Health Program to \ncarry out this important effort.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I thank the Senator from Michigan for bringing this \nmatter to our attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4950-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor John and Sharon \nRoesser of Encino, California who celebrated their 50th wedding \nanniversary on Saturday, June 20, 2000.\n  After serving in the First Marine Division in the Pacific and near \nthe China/Manchuria border during and immediately after World War II, \nJohn attended Loyola University in Los Angeles. John met Sharon, who \nwas attending Immaculate Heart College, at a dance in the fall of 1948.\n  A year and a half later on a blistering hot day, June 10, 1950, John \nand Sharon were married in the original Saint Mary's Church in El \nCentro, California by the Most Reverend Charles S. Buddy who was the \nfirst Bishop of the San Diego Diocese. Sharon's maid of honor was her \nsister Patricia, and John's best man was Paul Connor. After their \nhoneymoon at the Hotel Del Coronado, John and Sharon lived in Santa \nMonica and then settled in Encino, California where they raised their \nsix children: Regina, John Jr., Allison, Paul, Mary Carol, and Tom. At \nlast count, John and Sharon have 16 grandchildren.\n  Today, I honor John and Sharon's 50 years of marriage and their \ncommitment to raising their children in a loving and caring household. \nSince their marriage, they have always been there for each other and \nfor each of their children through the best of times and the most \ndifficult of times. They are an example of all that is good in America, \nand I wish them all the best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4950-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, breast cancer is second only to lung \ncancer as a cause of cancer-related deaths among American women. This \nyear, an estimated 182,800 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed \nand 40,800 women will die of this terrible disease. In addition, an \nestimated 12,800 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed this \nyear, and 4,600 American women will die of this disease. Many of these \ndeaths could be avoided by making sure that cancer detection and \ntreatment services are readily available to all women at risk.\n  Early detection is currently the best way to combat breast and \ncervical cancer. If women age 50 and over obtain regular screening for \nbreast cancer, up to 30 percent of breast cancer deaths could be \nprevented. Moreover, virtually all cervical cancer deaths could be \nprevented through regular screening.\n  In recognition of the value of screening and early detection, \nCongress passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act \nof 1990, which established the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's (CDC's) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program. This important program has provided over two million \nscreening tests to low-income and underserved women in all 50 States \nsince its inception, and over 6,000 cases of breast cancer and over 500 \ncases of invasive cervical cancer have been diagnosed. In Maine, more \nthan 8,300 women have been screened and 28 cases of breast cancer and \n12 cases of cervical cancer have been detected through this program.\n  As one Maine woman observed:\n\n       This screening program was an answered prayer. I had been \n     concerned about having to skip checkups lately, but there was \n     no way to come up with the money anytime soon. I will gladly \n     tell all of my friends about this and will gladly return for \n     follow-up.\n\n  The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has \nprovided cancer screening services to more than one million low-income \nAmerican women who, like the woman from Maine, otherwise might not have \nbeen able to have these critically important tests. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the program does not currently pay for treatment services for \nwomen with abnormal screening results. Since the National Breast and \nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program is targeted to low-income \nwomen, many do not have health insurance and many more are \nunderinsured. While States participating in the program have been \ndiligent and creative in finding treatment services for these women, a \nstudy done for CDC found that, while treatment was eventually found for \nalmost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at \nall, some refused treatment, and some experienced delay.\n  Screening must be coupled with treatment if it is to save lives. As \nwe approach the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the Breast and \nCervical Cancer Mortality Act, it is time for Congress to complete what \nit started by enacting legislation to ensure that women diagnosed with \nbreast or cervical cancer through the screening program will have \ncoverage for their treatment. That is why I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, \nwhich would give States the option of providing Medicaid coverage for \nthe duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women \nwho were screened and diagnosed through the CDC program. This \nlegislation is not a mandate for States. It simply lets States know \nthat, if they do decide to provide treatment services for these women, \nthe Federal Government will be there to help with an enhanced Federal \nMedicaid match for these services.\n  Mr. President, S. 662 has strong bipartisan support with 66 Senate \ncosponsors. Moreover, last month the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly passed similar legislation. I want to commend the Senate \nFinance Committee chairman and the Senate majority leader for making a \ncommitment to move this legislation this year, and I urge them to \nschedule committee action and Senate floor time soon so that S. 662 can \nbe signed into law this summer. There would be no better way to \ncelebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program in August than by enacting this \nimportant bill to provide the treatment necessary to save the lives of \nthe women who are screened and diagnosed with cancer through this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4950-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4950-S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today, during National \nHomeownership Week, to urge the Senate's commitment to affordable \nhousing. I ask my colleagues to support a Resolution expressing the \nSenate's commitment to the ``House the Senate Built'' project. This \nproposed partnership between the United States Senate and Habitats for \nHumanity will lead to the construction of a simple home with and for a \nlow-income family in all fifty states and the District of Columbia by \nthe end of 2001.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have already made this \na priority. Three years ago, members of the House unanimously passed a \nResolution which expressed its commitment to build an affordable home \nfor a family in need in each of the 435 Congressional districts. Since \nthat time, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, homes have been \nbuilt in nearly every district.\n  Habitat for Humanity's work is respected and admired. In its twenty-\nthree years, Habitat for Humanity has housed nearly 400,000 people in \n79,300 Habitat houses worldwide. Under the continued leadership of \nfounder Millard Fuller, Habitat built 13,682 homes in 1999.\n  Spend some time with Mr. Fuller or at one Habitat's worksites, and \nyou will find that the passion for providing all sleepy children a \ndecent place to lay their heads is contagious. Millard wisely states, \n``We have the know-how in the world to house everyone. We have the \nresources in the world to house everyone. All that's missing is the \nwill to do it.''\n  I suggest that the Senate has the will to make affordable housing for \nall Americans a reality. We can show our commitment by lending our own \nskills and strength to the construction of one Habitat for Humanity \nhome in each State by the end of next year.\n  I encourage you to work with your local Habitat for Humanity \naffiliate--there are over 2,000--to identify a community and family in \nneed of a little extra assistance to make their dream of homeownership \na reality.\n  We all remember our first home--the pride we took in mowing the lawn \nfor the first time, family barbecues, the excitement and nervous \nanticipation of our first dinner party. I believe that every American \ndeserves the opportunity to feel the pride of homeownership.\n  We have the know-how, the resources, and, certainly, the need. Let us \nnow show America that we have the will to give more Americans the \nopportunity to own their own home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4951-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      CONGRATULATIONS, OUTSTANDING STUDENTS FROM ENID HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Carl ``Bobo'' Olson, \nthe legendary world boxing champion born and nurtured in Hawaii, who \nwas inducted yesterday into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in \nCanastota, New York. This is certainly a well-deserved honor for ``The \nHawaiian Swede,'' a distinguished champion whose life and 16-year \nprofessional career represent the grit, tenacity, skill and love of \nsport that have made boxing popular worldwide.\n  Born in 1928, Bobo Olson grew up quickly on the tough streets of \ndowntown Honolulu in the early 1940s, sharpening his boxing skills at \nan early age. Bobo and I grew up in the same community, the Pauoa and \nPunchbowl area in Honolulu--a neighborhood where families of different \nraces, many of Hawaiian or Portuguese heritage--lived side-by-side and \nshared our cultures and traditions. We all closely followed Bobo's rise \nto champion and took pride in a local boy who had reached the top in \nhis sport and handled his success with humility and grace.\n  He began fighting professionally at age 16, and won 19 fights before \nhe reached the age where he could legally box on the mainland circuit. \nAs a professional, Bobo won the World Middleweight Championship by \ndefeating Randy Turpin of England in October 1953 before 18,869 \nspectators in a 15-round fight at New York's Madison Square Garden. \nRing Magazine named him fighter of the year in 1953. He held the title \nfor two years; losing it in 1955 to Sugar Ray Robinson.\n  Olson's career record was 117 fights, 99 wins, 49 by knockout, 16 \nlosses and two draws. Four of those losses were to Ray Robinson, who is \nconsidered by many boxing experts and fans to be the greatest \nmiddleweight ever and among boxing's all-time greats. Bobo Olson held \nthe middleweight title longer than any other boxer in the 1950s and \nfought as a middleweight and light-heavyweight. He never shied away \nfrom a challenge. Bobo was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame \nin 1958, and was also among the first class of athletes, sportsmen and \nsportswomen inducted into the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. After \nretiring from boxing in 1966, Bobo worked as recreational director for \nthe Operating Engineers Local Union in San Francisco and in public \nrelations for the Teamsters. Now happily retired, he and his wife Judy \nreside in Honolulu.\n  Mr. President, I join boxing enthusiasts and the people of Hawaii in \ncongratulating Carl ``Bobo'' Olson on his induction into the \nInternational Boxing Hall of Fame. He remains a soft-spoken champion, \nand his quiet intensity and commitment to excellence offer a lasting \nillustration of good sportsmanship for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4951-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4951-S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MANSFIELD PACIFIC RETREAT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the \nsuccessful completion of the Fourth Annual Mansfield Pacific Retreat. \nThe focus of this retreat centered upon ``Urban Air Quality Issues in \nthe Asia-Pacific Region.''\n  Pacific Rim air quality is very timely and important matter for \ndiscussion. Environmental and public health research in the United \nStates and Asia has increasingly shown that people living in urban \nareas are exposed to high levels of pollutants. This exposure can cause \nmany impacts such as developmental problems in children, asthma, \npneumonia, cancer, and even premature death in the elderly or sensitive \npopulations. The U.S. has removed lead from its fuel supply for several \nof these reasons. Soon, because of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 \nwhich I shepherded through the Congress, EPA will be issuing a \ncomprehensive urban air toxins reduction strategy. I am hopeful that \nthis will be a model for other nations to consider.\n  I applaud the Mansfield Retreats' participants to discuss these \ncritical issues in depth, and I look forward to their recommendations \nabout how to resolve these issues.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  Along, that line, Mr. President, I would like to insert for the \nRecord the Final Retreat Declaration.\n\n              Mansfield Pacific Retreat--Final Declaration\n\n       The Fourth Annual Mansfield Pacific Retreat was held in \n     Kumamoto, Japan from May 29-June 1, hosted by the Maureen and \n     Mike Mansfield Center of the University of Montana and with \n     special support from the Kumamoto Prefectural Government.\n       The theme of the Fourth Annual Retreat was ``Common \n     Issues--Shared Solutions: Environmental Issues and Technology \n     in the Asia-Pacific Region.'' The Retreat participants placed \n     emphasis on urban air equality and discussed solutions to \n     these common problems via new technologies and partnerships.\n       The Retreat featured representation from Japan, South \n     Korea, China and the United States. Delegates were drawn from \n     the sectors of government, academia, non-governmental \n     organizations and private corporations.\n       In discussing the topic of urban air quality, the Retreat \n     participants focused on the following observations. First, \n     there was a clear consensus that environmental problems in \n     the urban context extended across borders and were truly \n     transnational in their nature. Delegates acknowledged that \n     solutions to these problems needed to focus on greater \n     collaboration among affected governments and societies across \n     the Asia-Pacific region for the benefit of our children and \n     planet. At the same time, there was recognition of the \n     important and timely contributions that participants outside \n     the government could provide.\n       Representatives from among the private sector acknowledged \n     their involvement in urban environmental issues and offered \n     insight on the availability of new and appropriate \n     technologies. In addition, the participants confirmed that \n     they would maintain the trust and relationships established \n     through the Retreat in order to address shared problems in \n     local, regional, and international contexts.\n       Retreat members paid tribute to the efforts of Senator and \n     Ambassador Mike Mansfield who has devoted nearly six decades \n     of his life to fostering greater understanding among nations \n     in Asia. The participants expressed their appreciation to \n     representatives from Montana and Minamata who shared their \n     experiences in how communities have responded to local \n     environmental crises. The accounts related to the Clark Fork \n     River cleanup in Montana and Minamata City's transformation \n     into a model environmental city.\n       The Retreat participants offered tribute to the late \n     Governor George Fukushima whose dynamic vision made the \n     Mansfield Pacific Retreat a reality in Kumamoto. At the same \n     time, delegates thanked Governor Shiotani for her support of \n     the Retreat. The tireless efforts of the Kumamoto Prefectural \n     and Mansfield Center staffs in organizing and supporting the \n     Retreat were appreciated.\n       In conclusion, the Retreat delegates noted that the Fifth \n     Retreat will be held in Glacier National Park, Montana in \n     September 2001.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that this declaration is evidence of a \ncommendable venture of which I have had the honor of participating in \nthe past three successful events. Over the years, it has been a \npleasure to work with Madame Li Xiaolin and the China People's \nAssociation for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Dr. Phillip West \nand Ambassador Mark Johnson from the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center \nin Missoula, Montana. Their vision, dedication and cooperation make the \nRetreats a success year after year.\n  I congratulate them and look forward to the fifth annual Mansfield \nPacific Retreat when it will be held in my home state of Montana next \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 8.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environment \nProtection Agency to make grants to the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority \nand other appropriate agencies for the purpose of improving water \nquality throughout the marine ecosystem of the Florida Keys; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             the florida keys water quality improvement act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Florida Keys are a unique \nnatural resource area that we must value and protect. This 158 mile-\nlong string of islands at the southern tip of Florida attracts two and \na half million visitors each year to fish, swim, snorkel, dive, and \notherwise enjoy the beautiful surroundings.\n  One of the most striking characteristics of the Florida Keys is their \npristine marine environment. The Keys support one of the largest sea \ngrass communities in this hemisphere and more than 6000 species of \nplants fish, and invertebrates. The diversity of this reef ecosystem is \nconsidered the underwater equivalent of the tropical rainforests.\n  But that ecosystem--and the economy it supports--is at grave risk. \nThe degradation of water quality in the Florida Keys threatens the \nhealth of the living coral reef, sea grasses, fisheries, and other \nmarine life. This decline threatens to transform the Keys from one of \nFlorida's most treasured resources to one of its most poisoned.\n  Mr. President, the great irony is that we are loving the Florida Keys \nto death. While we are pleased that these islands attract new residents \nand visitors from all over the world, improvements in wastewater \ntreatment and management practices have not kept pace with population \nand tourism growth.\n  Why is this significant? Ongoing research has determined that \nnutrients from wastewater have significantly contributed to the decline \nof water quality in the Florida Keys. It will take a strong partnership \nof federal, state, and local governments working in conjunction with \nenvironmental advocates and other interests to build the better sewage \ntreatment systems needed to improve canal and nearshore water quality.\n  Fortunately for the Florida Keys, such a partnership is already in \nplace and at work. In 1990, Congress established the Florida Keys \nNational Marine Sanctuary to protect the marine habitat while \ncontinuing to allow for its appropriate use. The sanctuary program has \nbrought together representatives of necessary interests to develop a \nplan for challenges like water quality.\n  Central to this effort is the Monroe County government, which has \ndeveloped a Wastewater Master Plan to identify long-term solutions to \nthe water quality problem. The plan estimates that infrastructure \nprojects implemented to improve water quality will incur total capital \ncosts of $346 million--a major undertaking that will require funding at \nevery level.\n  Mr. President, I have long said that any federal assistance for Keys \nwastewater improvements would first require a strong show of local \nsupport. Monroe County has done its fair share. Through a combination \nof revenue bonds, user fees and an infrastructure sales tax, the County \nhas made a commitment of over $150 million over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, it is time for this Congress to hold up its end of the \nbargain. Today, Senator Mack and I are introducing the Florida Keys \nWater Quality Improvements Act of 2000. Similar legislation passed the \nHouse on May 4, 2000 with almost unanimous support.\n  The Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act authorizes the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to make grants for construction of \nwastewater treatment works. These grants are only awarded to projects \nthat already have a significant investment. Successful applicant \nprojects will be those that have completed the planning and design \nphase, demonstrated substantial water quality benefits and proven \ncompliance with the Marine Sanctuary and other master plans for the \narea. And as is appropriate in a partnership, these grants will fund a \nportion of project costs, with an least 25 percent of the cost paid by \nlocal and state entities.\n  Mr. President, the prospect of treating wastewater for an \nincreasingly crowed 158-mile-long string of islands is not a simple \none. But it is vital that we preserve this beautiful area not just for \ncurrent residents and visitors--but also for our children and \ngrandchildren. With this legislation, we can put the federal government \non the side of this worthy goal, and support the investment that has \nbeen made by the residents and protectors of the Florida Keys.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Florida Keys Water Quality \n     Improvements Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FLORIDA KEYS WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       Title I of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 121.

Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague Senator \nGraham to introduce the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act. \nThis bill is identical to legislation that passed the House on May 4, \n2000 by a vote of 411-7, and would provide Federal resources to help \nimprove and maintain one of our Nation's real treasures, the Florida \nKeys National Marine Sanctuary.\n  The Florida Keys are a spectacular natural resource of international \nsignificance. Within the Florida Keys lies the only living coral reef \nbed in the United States and the third largest living coral reef in the \nworld. The reef is home to plants and animals unique to this area and \nthat comprise a rare and sensitive ecosystem at the southern end of the \nEverglades ecosystem. While the spectacular coral reef is the Keys' \nmost popular feature, they are also known for native seagrass beds, \nlush tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove forests, rocky pinelands, the \nendangered key deer, and a wide array of aquatic life.\n  The Florida Keys marine ecosystem is dependent upon clean, clear \nwater with low nutrient levels for its survival. Water quality experts \nhave found that the inadequate wastewater treatment and storm water \nmanagement systems are major contributors of pollution in the nearby \nwaters off the Florida Keys. This increased pollution has had \ndevastating effects on the marine environment, and is threatening the \nreefs on the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Unless decisive \naction is taken to stop the flow of pollution, scientists warn the \necosystem will continue its decline towards total collapse.\n  The source of the problem is clear. The Keys have almost no water \nquality infrastructure. Lacking adequate technology, untreated \nwastewater now travels easily through porous limestone rock into the \nnear-shore waters. Polluted stormwater also flows from developed land \ninto the same near-shore waters.\n  Our bill is a natural extension of the Federal commitment to the \nFlorida Keys made under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary \nProtection Act approved by Congress in 1990. This legislation \nestablished a Federal role in the research and protection of the Keys \nmarine ecosystem. The Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the State of Florida to establish a Water Quality Steering \nCommittee which was charged with developing a comprehensive water \nquality protection program. In fulfilling this directive, the steering \ncommittee worked closely with dedicated citizens, scientists, and \ntechnical experts. In the final analysis, it found that inadequate \nwastewater and stormwater systems are the single largest source of \npollution in the Keys.\n  This bill authorizes Federal assistance to help local officials \nafford the necessary improvements to protect the Florida Keys National \nMarine Sanctuary. It establishes a grant program under the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency for the construction of treatment works \nprojects aimed at improving the water quality of the Florida Keys \nNational Marine Sanctuary. The administrator of EPA, after consultation \nwith State and local officials, would be authorized to fund treatment \nworks projects that comply or are consistent with local growth \nordinances, plans and agreements, as well as current water quality \nstandards. Projects funded under this program would be cost-shared, \nwith local sponsors providing a minimum of 25 percent of the project \ncosts.\n  This bill authorizes $213 million in Federal funding for the \ndeployment of water quality technology throughout the Keys. To make the \nnecessary wastewater improvements, the estimated cost to improve near-\nshore water quality in the Florida Keys is between $184 million and \n$418 million. To make the necessary storm water management \nimprovements, the estimated cost is between $370 million and $680 \nmillion. The Federal government is not going to bear the entire cost, \neven though this is a national resource. The State of Florida is \nobligated to come up with 25 percent cost share.\n  Moneys authorized by this bill will be utilized to replace the dated, \ninefficient system of sludge ponds and septic tanks currently being \nused in the Keys with modern waste and storm water treatment works. By \nensuring that the nutrients associated with such wastes are not \ndischarged or released into the surrounding waters, we can prevent \nfurther damage to the marine environment and achieve dramatic \nimprovement to the water quality in the National Marine Sanctuary.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable \napproach to maintaining an essential national resource. I hope there \nwill be a broad, bipartisan support for this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the New Jersey \nDevils for winning the National Hockey League's 2000 Stanley Cup \nChampionship. On Saturday night, the Devils defeated the Dallas Stars 2 \nto 1 in double overtime to win the finals in six games. This is the \nsecond time in five years that the Devils have hoisted Lord Stanley's \ntrophy above their heads.\n  The Devils are what New Jersey pride is all about. Their heart, \nstamina, and drive have endeared them to millions of fans and have made \nthem a permanent part of New Jersey's culture. Team members, who hail \nfrom all over the globe, also reflect the tremendous diversity of New \nJersey's population. One player--Scott Gomez--is the first Hispanic \nplayer to compete in the NHL and the league's rookie of the year. The \nDevils have turned their cultural differences into a source of strength \nand have proved what is possible when team members work together to \nachieve a sport's highest honor.\n  Mr. President, apart from their contributions to hockey, the New \nJersey\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\nDevils are also outstanding citizens. Defenseman Ken Daneyko, for \nexample, is a leader both on and off the ice. Ken is one of the \noriginal Devil players and was an alternate captain. He has played \n1,071 games in a Devils uniform and has participated in all 109 Devils \nplayoff games. Ken is also a community leader who owns an Italian \nrestaurant in Caldwell and is an active member of New Jersey's chapter \nof the national Children's Miracle Network. Indeed, all the team \nmembers are proud to play for New Jersey and spend much of their free \ntime giving back to the community.\n  The success of any organization starts at the top. And there is no \nquestion that the success the New Jersey Devils have enjoyed would not \nhave been possible without the leadership of two great New Jersey \ncitizens: team chairman John J. McMullen and co-owner John C. \nWhitehead. John McMullen is one of the NHL's most innovative, committed \nowners. A graduate of Montclair High School and the Naval Academy, John \nhas been honored many times for his civic contributions. He and John \nWhitehead, a former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, brought the team to \nNew Jersey as a service to their home state.\n  Mr. President, the players, coaches and staff with the New Jersey \nDevils showed outstanding dedication, teamwork and sportsmanship in \nachieving hockey's highest honor. They are not only the best team in \nthe NHL, they are one of the finest organizations in professional \nsports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4956-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4956-S4969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TORRICELLI AMENDMENT NO. 3282\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (H.R. 4576) making appropriations for the Department of \nDefense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 109, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8126.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The mission of the C-5 aircraft is to transport heavy \n     loads over long distances. In particular, the C-5 aircraft \n     regularly runs missions to and from Europe and the Pacific \n     and the United States. For this reason, compliance with the \n     rules of International Civil Aviation Organization regarding \n     high-density flight areas is important for the entire C-5 \n     aircraft fleet.\n       (2) The C-5 aircraft Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) \n     is necessary for all aircraft that will need to comply with \n     the new Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) standards \n     established by the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n       (3) Compliance with GATM allows aircraft to use more \n     operationally efficient airspace and lowers operational \n     costs.\n       (4) AMP also includes the installation of important safety \n     features such as Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System \n     and an enhanced all weather navigational system, the Terrain \n     Awareness and Warning System.\n       (5) Both the A and B models of the C-5 aircraft are \n     expected to be flown by the Air Force, including the Regular \n     Air Force and the Reserves. None of the aircrews for such \n     aircraft should be subjected to increased risks stemming from \n     the lack of these safety features.\n       (6) Efficient use of aircrew members and crew interfly will \n     be prevented because of the dissimilarities that would exist \n     between the avionics and navigation systems of the A and B \n     models of the C-5 aircraft. This is particularly problematic \n     when additional aircrew members are needed to meet Major \n     Theater War requirements.\n       (7) The Committee on Armed Services of the Senate \n     specifically requested that the Secretary of the Air Force \n     proceed to test AMP upgrades on both A and B models of the C-\n     5 aircraft in Senate Report No. 106-292, the Report to \n     Accompany S.2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2001.\n       (8) The on-going installation of new High Pressure Turbines \n     (HPT) is essential for the entire C-5 aircraft fleet because \n     the current logistics system no longer supports the old \n     turbine assemblies for the fleet.\n       (9) Without HPT replacement, C-5 aircraft will have \n     increased support costs of approximately $700 per flight \n     hour.\n       (10) By attempting to maintain 2 separate engine \n     configurations and 2 separate avionics and navigation systems \n     within the relatively small C-5 aircraft fleet (126 \n     airplanes), additional spares and support equipment will be \n     necessary with increased unit costs.\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Of the amount appropriated \n     under title III under the heading ``Aircraft Procurement, Air \n     Force'' and available for procurement for the C-5 aircraft, \n     in the amount of $95,401,000, the entire amount shall be \n     available for procurement for both the A and B models of the \n     C-5 aircraft.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BIDEN (AND ROTH) AMENDMENT NO. 3371\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Roth) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the bill, H.R. 4576, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 109, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8126. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) There exists a significant shortfall in the Nation's \n     current strategic airlift requirement, even though strategic \n     airlift remains critical to the national security strategy of \n     the United States.\n       (2) This shortfall results from the slow phase-out of C-141 \n     aircraft and their replacement with C-17 aircraft and from \n     lower than optimal reliability rates for the C-5 aircraft.\n       (3) One of the primary causes of these reliability rates \n     for C-5 aircraft, and especially for operational unit \n     aircraft, is the shortage of spare repair parts. Over the \n     past 5 years, this shortage has been particularly evident in \n     the C-5 fleet.\n       (4) NMCS (Not Mission Capable for Supply) rates for C-5 \n     aircraft have increased significantly in the period between \n     1997 and 1999. At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, an average \n     of 7 through 9 C-5 aircraft were not available during that \n     period because of a lack of parts.\n       (5) Average rates of cannibalization of C-5 aircraft per \n     100 sorties of such aircraft have also increased during that \n     period and are well above the Air Mobility Command standard. \n     In any given month, this means devoting additional manhours \n     to cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft. At Dover Air Force Base, \n     an average of 800 to 1,000 additional manhours were required \n     for cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft during that period. \n     Cannibalizations are often required for aircraft that transit \n     through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those \n     that are based there.\n       (6) High cannibalization rates indicate a significant \n     problem in delivering spare parts in a timely manner and \n     systemic problems within the repair and maintenance process, \n     and also demoralize overworked maintenance crews.\n       (7) The C-5 aircraft remains an absolutely critical asset \n     in air mobility and airlifting heavy equipment and personnel \n     to both military contingencies and humanitarian relief \n     efforts around the world.\n       (8) Despite increased funding for spare and repair parts \n     and other efforts by the Air Force to mitigate the parts \n     shortage problem, Congress continues to receive reports of \n     significant cannibalizations to airworthy C-5 aircraft and \n     parts backlogs.\n       (b) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2001, and September \n     30, 2001, the Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the overall \n     status of the spare and repair parts program of the Air Force \n     for the C-5 aircraft. The report shall include the \n     following--\n       (1) a statement the funds currently allocated to parts for \n     the C-5 aircraft and the adequacy of such funds to meet \n     current and future parts and maintenance requirements for \n     that aircraft;\n       (2) a description of current efforts to address shortfalls \n     in parts for such aircraft, including an assessment of \n     potential short-term and long-term effects of such efforts;\n       (3) an assessment of the effects of such shortfalls on \n     readiness and reliability ratings for C-5 aircraft;\n       (4) a description of cannibalization rates for C-5 aircraft \n     and the manhours devoted to cannibalizations of such \n     aircraft; and\n       (5) an assessment of the effects of parts shortfalls and \n     cannibalizations with respect to C-5 aircraft on readiness \n     and retention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    BAUCUS AMENDMENTS NOS. 3372-3373\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 4576, supra; as follows:\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3372\n\n       On page 109 of the substituted original text, between lines \n     11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8126.

Madam President, this afternoon, according to the news \naccounts released earlier today, the Environmental Protection Agency is \ncalling on major oil refiners to meet in Washington, DC, to explain the \nprice hike phenomenon, as it is called. This is not a phenomenon. It is \na pain in the wallet what is happening with respect to the price of \ngasoline.\n  I want to talk a little about that, and talk a little about the \nproblems that may be causing it.\n  It is not lost on the American people that when they drive to the gas \npumps these days they are discovering, once again, another price spike \nin the cost of gasoline.\n  In North Dakota, for example, the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers \nAssociation provided me with current gasoline prices in North Dakota: \nMinot, $1.79 a gallon today; Fargo, $1.64 a gallon; Devil's Lake, \n$1.69; Bismarck, $1.68 a gallon. Interestingly enough, the current \nprice in Bismarck of $1.68 is nearly a 30-cent-per-gallon increase in \njust the last couple of weeks since the previous price spike. Earlier \nthis year, the price of petroleum spiked up and came back down. Now it \nhas spiked up again, a nearly 30-cent-per-gallon increase in a very \nshort period.\n  The EPA is asking for a meeting with the major oil refiners to \nevaluate what is happening with respect to the price of gasoline. Some \nindicate an EPA rule that describes the base fuel that must be used in \ncertain cities in the country with respect to oxygenated fuel or \nethanol as a circumstance where certain base fuels are kind of a narrow \ncommodity and are not readily available and so it is pricing gasoline \nvery high. That may be one case. I don't know the answer to that. I \nassume the EPA and the refiners will have that discussion. It is quite \nclear there are other things at work.\n  No. 1, this country gets a substantial amount of its energy from the \nOPEC countries. In a global economy, the OPEC countries are producing \nan ever-increasing amount of the energy the United States needs. Does \nthis put us at the mercy of the supply coming from the OPEC countries? \nOf course it does. When the OPEC countries cut supply, as they did, and \nthen increase it marginally, but not increase it to the level where \nthey had previously been producing, that is going to have some \ndislocation in this country. The result is an increase in gasoline \nprices.\n  It is probably also the case, from hearings I have been involved \nwith, that the refiners in this country were refining heating fuel for \nmuch longer than they normally would have and probably didn't switch \nover to gasoline quite quickly enough. Therefore, we are going to \ncontinue to see these price spikes. The news reports talk about \nvolatility. Well, volatility is a euphemism for the price spikes that \nare jumping up and around with respect to the price of gasoline when we \ndon't\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nhave sufficient supply of crude stock coming into this country which \nrefiners need to produce and turn into gasoline.\n  What we have are three possibilities. The most obvious is, we are \nseeing an ever-increasing dependence on the OPEC countries. They cut \nback supply, then increased it some, but not nearly enough. The result \nis increased prices for petroleum products in this country.\n  It ought to be a wake-up call for all of us. We are too dependent on \nforeign source energy. We ought to make certain we have a national \nenergy policy that includes incentives for producers here at home, \nincludes additional incentives for renewable energy. There isn't any \nreason we ought not be doing much better with respect to renewable \nenergy in this country. The other possibility, aside from the OPEC \nindustry, as I mentioned, is the potential of EPA recommendations or \nrequirements that have created dislocation in certain markets in terms \nof the base supply that can be used with respect to ethanol.\n  I don't know what the outcome of this meeting will be, but I will be \nvery interested to see what the EPA has done, whether that has caused \nsome dislocation and some price spikes as well.\n  Third, it is not unlikely and certainly wouldn't be without precedent \nto have had the petroleum industry play some of their own games with \nrespect to supply, the movement of supply and the pricing of supply. \nSome would say: Gosh, how could you think that? Well, history would \nbear out how I might be able to think that would be the case. We ought \nto look at all of these issues and evaluate exactly what is causing \nthis price spike and what impact it is having and what we can do about \nit.\n  I come from a State that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts. North \nDakota is a big old State. It takes a lot of driving to get around my \nState; 640,000 people live in a land mass that is equivalent to 10 \ntimes the State of Massachusetts. Our predominant industry is farming. \nIn order to seed a crop in the spring, it takes a lot of fuel. In order \nto get the crop off the fields in the fall, it takes a lot of fuel. \nThose family farmers, with the kind of depressed grain prices we have \nseen in this country, don't need further increases in input costs \nplaced upon them by these increases in gas prices.\n\n  We have to get some answers from the EPA, the petroleum refiners, the \nmajor oil companies, and from those who are supposed to be involved in \nthe development of an energy plan for this country to answer what kind \nof dependence do we have on the OPEC countries and what could the \nconsequences be in the longer term, if those countries decided to have \na much tighter supply of petroleum going to Western nations, including \nthe United States.\n  I was reading a briefing memo this morning about this issue. I \nthought a couple of pieces of information were interesting. OPEC \nofficials contend that prices are only marginally above the stated ban \nand ``the price rise is more due to a tight gasoline market in the \nUnited States where new environmental regulations are reducing \nvolume.'' That is according to OPEC. OPEC is saying: It's not us.\n  The fact is, OPEC cut supply, increased it some but not nearly back \nto where they had originally been producing.\n  The Saudi Arabia oil minister also pegged the recent price movement \non tight oil products markets; that is, oil products markets, not a \nshortage of crude oil itself. One source indicated that the increase in \nprices on certain world oil markets, notably in the U.S., has no \nrelation to the volume of international crude output. That is an \ninteresting theory. That would stand all logic on its head. Prices in \nthe United States with respect to crude oil have no relationship to \ninternational crude oil production. I think that is not likely to be \nsomething that would be believed by anyone who is thinking.\n  The point is this: This is a significant and important issue to many \nareas of our country. We need to understand the consequences of it, \nwhat is causing it, and what we can do about it. I hope all of us \nworking together can rely on not only the Energy Department, the EPA, \nbut the Congress itself to evaluate all three of the suggestions I have \njust made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4970-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4970-S4971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SANCTIONS ON FOOD AND MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to talk about the issue of \nsanctions on food and medicine shipments to other countries in the \nworld. I know I have talked about this on the floor many times. At the \nrisk of being repetitive, which I think is important in this body, I \nsay again, it is immoral for this country to have a policy of imposing \nsanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to any other country in \nthe world.\n  We have decided to impose economic sanctions on countries whose \nbehavior we don't like. We have decided that economic sanctions is the \nway to punish certain countries. We don't like what Saddam Hussein in \nIraq has been doing. He is an international outlaw, according to our \ncountry's view. Therefore, we want to punish him. So we impose economic \nsanctions.\n  We don't like Fidel Castro in Cuba, according to our public policy. \nSo we want to impose an embargo that, by the way, has been existing for \n40 years. We have sanctions against Iran, against North Korea. When we \nimpose these sanctions, it is also included in those sanctions that we \nwill not allow shipments of food and medicine to these same countries.\n  As I said, I think it is fundamentally immoral for our country to \ndecide what they will withhold and prohibit the shipment of food and \nmedicine to any country in the world. It doesn't make any sense.\n  I come at this from more than one standpoint. One, I represent a farm \nState. Yes, it bothers me that 11 percent of the international wheat \nmarket is off limits to our family farmers. We have folks that stand up \nhere in the Senate and say: Well, we support the Freedom to Farm bill \nfor family farmers. What about the freedom to sell bill? Why shouldn't \nfarmers be free to sell into the marketplace where people are hungry \nand need food? What on Earth would persuade this country to have \nsanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine anywhere in \nthe world? If my proposition is these sanctions are fundamentally wrong \nwith respect to food and medicine sanctions, then let's change it.\n  We have tried to change it. Last year, we had a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate. Seventy Senators voted to get rid of sanctions on food and \nmedicine shipments everywhere in the world. Seventy Senators said: \nLet's get rid of them. We got the bill to conference and it got \nhijacked because some people want to continue sanctions, especially on \nthe country of Cuba.\n  This year in the Senate Appropriations Committee on the Agriculture \nbill, I included an amendment that says: Get rid of all sanctions on \nfood and medicine; get rid of them all with respect to Cuba and Iraq \nand North Korea. Get rid of all sanctions on food and medicine. That \npassed. It is in the Appropriations Committee. It will come to the \nfloor on the Agriculture appropriations bill. Already we have some \npeople in the Congress who are saying we are going to dump that. That \nis not going to become law. We are not going to get rid of sanctions on \nthe shipment of food and medicine from this country to Cuba.\n  As I have said before, I intend to push this issue very hard this \nyear.\n  It does not make sense to continue sanctions on the shipment of food \nand medicine to anywhere in the world. I want to read a couple of \neditorials that I think describe it as well. This is from the Seattle \nPost Intelligencer of May 28. This is an op-ed piece:\n\n       Economic sanctions against nations are long overdue for a \n     critical appraisal. They make an appealing weapon. They are a \n     way to hurt people without shooting at them. Done in the \n     extreme, they inflict sickness and death. Sanctions have been \n     used for many years--more than 40 years against Cuba and 10 \n     years against Iraq. Lesser sanctions have been set against \n     Libya, Iran and Burma. Threats of sanctions are annually \n     made, but not acted upon, against China. In any case, \n     economic sanctions have never removed a tyrant and they will \n     never remove, for example, Saddam Hussein. In all likelihood, \n     he will be in power until he dies. What sanctions have done \n     is to further impoverish the Iraqi people.\n\n  Here is an excerpt from the Washington Times, an op-ed written by \nSteve Chapman:\n\n       Things have changed a lot since 1990. The Soviet Union no \n     longer exists. The Federal\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\n     budget deficit has vanished. But two things remain the same. \n     Iraq is under international economics sanctions, and the \n     sanctions are a failure.\n\n  I don't have any great truck for Iraq or Saddam Hussein. I think he \nis an international outlaw. He operates well beyond the norms of \ninternational behavior. But it is also true that economic sanctions \nthat include food and medicine represent an attempt to take aim at a \ndictator and hit hungry people, sick people, and poor people. It \nhappens all the time when we impose food and medicine as part of \neconomic sanctions.\n  This is from the Charleston Gazette, June 1, 2000:\n\n       Let's see if we've got this straight. Free trade with China \n     will help export American values, paving the path for the end \n     of communism in that nation. That is according to Republican \n     House Whip Tom DeLay from Texas. However, free trade with \n     Cuba can't be allowed because that would be rewarding a \n     Communist regime. That is also according to DeLay, who \n     simultaneously pushed for normalizing trade relations with \n     China, while trying to stop a bill that would allow the sale \n     of food and medicine to Cuba.\n\n  A piece in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, penned by my colleague on \nthe House side, Congressman Nethercutt, who, incidentally, offered the \nsame amendment in the House Appropriations Committee that I offered in \nthe Senate. He was successful, and they are going to try to dump that \nprovision in the House of Representatives before we get to conference. \nHe says:\n\n       This week, Trent Lott, Majority Leader, defended the \n     position. He said, ``It is very easy to see the distinction \n     between China and Cuba. If you can't see it, maybe you are \n     just blind to it.''\n\n  Well, I am not blind and I can't see it. I have been to Cuba. I was \nin Cuba last year. All I see in Cuba are people living in conditions of \npoverty. I see a country 90 miles to the north that has decided as a \nmatter of public policy, because we don't like Fidel Castro, that we \ncannot move food and medicine to Cuba. Why? Because we have an embargo \nthat includes the shipment of food and medicine. That is not fair to \nour farmers or to the poor people in Cuba.\n  I visited a hospital in Cuba one day. I was in the intensive care \nward. I was there for a few days. In the hospital there was a little \nboy lying in a coma. He was about 12 years old. There was no equipment. \nThis was an intensive care ward with no equipment at all. There wasn't \na beeping sound because there was nothing to beep. There were no cords \nhooked up because they didn't have equipment. He was lying in this room \nwith his mother holding his hand, lying in a coma. I asked the doctor: \nYou have no basic equipment here? He said: No, we don't have any \nequipment. The doctor said: We are out of 250 different kinds of \nmedicines.\n  I asked the question again when I came back to this country: Why is \nit that we have prohibitions against being able to send medicine to \nCuba? Is sending medicine and food, or being able to sell medicine and \nfood to Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, and Iran going to make this a less \nstable world? I don't think so.\n  Let me end where I started. This is an immoral policy. Yes, I come at \nit from a selfish perspective. I represent farmers who ask a question \nthat cannot be answered: Why, if we raise food in such abundant \nquantity, are we told that those who need it so badly can't have it \nbecause this country wants to punish their rulers and leaders? I can't \nanswer farmers when they ask that question. It doesn't make sense. It \nis a policy that is bankrupt. We ought to change it. We have 70 votes \nin the Senate to change it, and they won't allow a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. If they did, they would have 70 percent voting in \nfavor to change it.\n  So we are going to see in the coming weeks whether, once again, for a \nsecond year in a row, we have just a handful of people trying to hijack \nthis effort to eliminate food and medicine from sanctions we impose on \nother countries around the world. When the roll is called, I think 70 \nSenators will vote, as they did previously, to say food and medicine \nsanctions anywhere in the world are not good public policy. They are \nnot the best of America. Let's eliminate them. Let's abolish that \nmentality. You can punish foreign leaders whose behavior we don't like \nwithout hurting poor and hungry people. The only conceivable reason \nthis gets held up--and it got held up last year--is a few people \ndecided that because Fidel Castro sticks his finger in America's eye \nfrom time to time, they want to continue this 40-year-old embargo. And \nthey darn well want to insist on keeping food and medicine as part of \nthe sanction because if they don't, they will be considered weak on \nCuba. Well, being considered weak because they pursue a public policy \nthat is wrongheaded is not, in my judgment, a model of consistency.\n  Let us, in this session of the Congress, decide that at least on this \nmarginal step forward, we will decide we will never again use food and \nmedicine as part of economic sanctions, both in our interest and in the \ninterest of poor, hungry, and sick people all around the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/12/senate-section/article/S4971-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4971-S4972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE NEW JERSEY DEVILS FOR WINNING THE NHL STANLEY CUP \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.
