Mr. President, I notice the distinguished minority whip is \nhere. If he has any comments, I certainly defer to him.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the minority is ready to proceed on this \nlegislation. We have Senators who are ready to speak on this as soon as \nthe acting leader completes his remarks, and we hope to complete this \nlegislation when all the amendments are debated. We have structured \ntime to complete this bill, and we look forward to full debate on all \nthe issues.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we have finally reached an agreement \nto complete floor consideration of the bankruptcy reform legislation. \nIt was my intention that we finish consideration and pass this bill \ntonight, but we cannot get it done so we will do it next Tuesday. To \nthat end, I hope any Member who intends to offer an amendment under the \nagreement comes down and begins debating it as soon as possible.\n  First, I commend everyone who has worked hard to make this agreement \na reality. It took a lot of effort and cooperation to come together and \nget to where we are today. My staff, the majority and minority \nleadership and floor staffs, Senator Leahy's and Senator Reid's staffs, \nSenator Grassley's staff, and Senator Gramm's staff all worked \nliterally the whole day yesterday to craft the agreement we are \noperating under. We have a lot of work still ahead of us. We not only \nhave the 13 amendments we must consider today, but we have a number of \nmajor issues to resolve in conference. This bill is far from becoming \nlaw at this point, but I am optimistic that we can work together as we \nhave done in the past to have a fair and balanced reform bill that the \nPresident can sign.\n  Mr. President, I have stood here on the Senate floor many times and \nprofessed the need for reforming our bankruptcy system. I stand before \nyou again today and say that the Senate has enjoyed a lengthy \ndeliberative process. Along with my Senate colleagues, I have debated \nthe legislation and many of its amendments at great length over the \npast several years. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, chaired by my good friend \nSenator Grassley, has held numerous hearings on the issue of bankruptcy \nreform, gaining insights from literally dozens of witnesses.\n  I am optimistic that we will restore fairness and integrity to our \nbankruptcy system. I am encouraged by what has transpired in the House \nof Representatives with respect to bankruptcy reform: the House bill is \nmore stringent in terms of reform than the bill we are considering here \nin the Senate, and it nonetheless passed by an overwhelming, veto-proof \nmargin of 313 to 108.\n  Not long ago in our Nation's past, there was an expectation that \npeople should repay what they have borrowed. Hand in hand with this \nexpectation was a stigma that attached to those who filed bankruptcy. \nThe bankruptcy system, as it was originally envisioned, was truly a \nlast resort. It was intended to give those who needed it--those in \nserious financial difficulty, with no way out of their hard times--a \nfresh start. As our bankruptcy system has evolved over the years, this \noriginal mission has become lost.\n  Our current system, I am sorry to say, allows some people who are \nable to repay their debts to avoid doing so. It does this by treating \nincome as irrelevant, and by allowing people to exploit various \nloopholes. When I talk with the hardworking folks both from my state of \nUtah, and more recently all across this great Nation, I simply cannot \ndefend the current system. I cannot find an adequate explanation for \nwhy our current laws let people who have the capacity to repay their \ndebts use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. I cannot justify the \nmore than $400 hidden tax our current bankruptcy system imposes on \nevery American family every year.\n  It is no mystery that when someone borrows money or buys something on \ncredit, and then files a bankruptcy of convenience, someone does not \nget paid back. This is true whether the creditor is a large lending \ncompany in which a retiree's pension funds may be invested, or a small \nfamily business. Under the current system, when bankruptcies of \nconvenience are filed, everyone loses except for the unscrupulous \nperson who games the system. Studies have been conducted that show that \nbetween 6 and 15 percent of filers are using bankruptcy as a financial \nplanning tool, running up debts and erasing them without any noticeable \nimpact on their lifestyle. When we look at the daunting number of \nbankruptcy filings we have seen in recent years, these abuses are a \nmajor problem. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans filed for \nbankruptcy. As I have pointed out before, more Americans filed \nbankruptcy than graduated from college, were on active military duty, \nor worked in the post office. During these days of great economic \nprosperity, these record filings are outrageous.\n  We must put an end to the system that allows people to live high on \nthe hog.\n  The bill also puts the brakes on an abuse known as ``loading up,'' \nwhen debtors take out large cash advances on their credit cards and buy \nluxury goods on the eve of their filing for bankruptcy.\n  The bill is also designed to enhance consumer protections by imposing \npenalties on creditors who overreach. Penalties are imposed on \ncreditors who refuse to negotiate in good faith with debtors prior to \ndeclaring bankruptcy, who willfully fail to properly credit payments \nmade by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan, and who threaten to file \nmotions in order to coerce a reaffirmation without justification. The \nbill also contains provisions designed to eliminate abusive \nreaffirmation practices.\n  The bill protects debtors by imposing requirements on lawyers who \nrepresent debtors in bankruptcy. These provisions are intended to \ntarget the practices of so-called bankruptcy mills, which aggressively \npromote bankruptcy to people with financial problems when bankruptcy \nmay not be in their best interests.\n  I am particularly proud of the advancements this bill makes in \nhelping people to avoid bankruptcy and avoid repeating financial \nproblems. The bill provides for education for debtors with respect to \ntheir alternatives to bankruptcy, along with financial management \neducation and credit counseling.\n  This bill also protects our children. Anyone who knows my record in \nthe Senate knows I have been a strong advocate for children for many \nyears. It is not surprising that this is a particularly important \naspect of the bill. From the time this bill was being drafted and \nthrough the process of committee markup and floor consideration, I made \nit a top priority to ensure that the bill included provisions to \nprevent deadbeat parents from using bankruptcy to get out of paying \nchild support and alimony. Under my provisions, the obligation to pay \nchild support and alimony is moved to a first-priority status, as \nopposed to its current place at seventh in line, behind attorney's fees \nand other special interests. If you really want to know the truth, my \nmeasures make improvements over current law in this area that are too \nnumerous to mention here at this time, but they work to facilitate the \ncollection of child support and alimony and effectively prevent \ndeadbeats from getting their obligations discharged.\n  I am also proud that one of my provisions on S. 625, which is \nsupported by\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\nAARP and many other important organizations, ensures that retirement \nsavings will be treated equally in bankruptcy so that schoolteachers \nand church workers will no longer be at a disadvantage relative to \npeople with retirement savings that happen to fall into other \ncategories.\n  I also made sure that education was protected in this bill. Under my \neducation savings amendment, already accepted as part of S. 625, which \nI developed with the help of Senators Gregg, Dodd, and others, \ncontributions made for educational expenses to education IRAs and \nqualified State tuition savings programs will be protected in \nbankruptcy. I believe protecting these savings accounts is important \nbecause college savings accounts encourage families to save for college \nand increase access to higher education. My amendment ensures that the \nability to use dedicated funds to pay the educational costs of children \nand grandchildren will not be jeopardized by the bankruptcy of a parent \nor a grandparent. At the same time, I have included conditions on the \nprotection of these accounts to prevent fraud and abuse.\n\n  In effect, this bill tightens up the bankruptcy laws to ferret out \nabuses on all sides, from the unscrupulous debtor to the overreaching \ncreditor to the dishonest lawyer. At the same time, it works to stop \nthe cycle of indebtedness through education. It makes sure that \nchildren, our retirement savings, and access to education are all \nprotected.\n  It is wrong for this country to have a system that makes honest, \nhard-working, bill-paying citizens foot the bill for those who have the \nability to pay but who choose not to. A recent study shows that 76 \npercent of all Americans believe individuals should not be allowed to \nerase all of their debts in bankruptcy if they are able to repay a \nportion of what they owe. I am pleased to say that that is precisely \nwhat S. 625 would accomplish. This study is heartening to me because it \nindicates that this country hasn't lost sight of the principle that \nindividuals should take responsibility for their own actions.\n  We are enjoying a wonderful period of economic prosperity. To the \npeople who, despite their high levels of income, choose a bankruptcy of \nconvenience, I say the game is over. No longer will the hard-working \npeople of my State of Utah and in the rest of the country foot the bill \nfor the people who are abusers of the system. The American people \ndeserve better. With passage of the bankruptcy reform bill, the \nbankruptcy system will again return to the last resort for those who \ntruly need it.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to urge colleagues to come down here \nsooner rather than later to debate amendments, or let us know if they \ndon't intend to offer them. It is my and the leader's intention, and I \nbelieve the intention of Senators Leahy and Daschle, that we debate \nthese amendments in a timely manner today and vote on final passage \nnext Tuesday. I hope we can get through all these amendments today, and \nnext Tuesday we will have a full day of voting.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2651, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2651, as modified.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . PROPERTY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO REDEMPTION.\n\n       [(a)] Section 541(b) of title 11 of the United States Code \n     is amended by adding at the end the following--\n       ``(6) any interest of the debtor in property where the \n     debtor pledged or sold tangible personal property [or other \n     valuable things] (other than securities or written or printed \n     evidences of indebtedness or title) as collateral for a loan \n     or advance of money, where--\n       ``(a) the tangible personal property is in the possession \n     of the pledgee or transferee;\n       ``(b) [(i)] the debtor has no obligation to repay the \n     money, redeem the collateral, or buy back the property at a \n     stipulated price, and\n       ``(c) [(ii)] neither the debtor nor the trustee have \n     exercised any right to redeem provided under the contract or \n     state law in a timely manner as provided under state[,] law \n     and Section 108(b) of this title.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, following Senator Craig's amendment No. \n2651, as modified, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murray be \nrecognized for 10 minutes to speak, and I ask that Senator Sessions be \ngiven 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee wants to come and speak on this at some time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Whenever the ranking member wants to speak, we will, at a \nconvenient time, interrupt and allow him to do so.\n  Finally, we will go to Senator Wellstone's amendment after Senator \nSessions speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that my amendment, as \nmodified, has been accepted on that side.\n  I guess I am at risk, as we are anytime a Senator comes to the floor \nand says, ``This is a simple amendment'' But in fact that is exactly \nwhat this amendment is. It corrects a very small but very real problem. \nWe are talking about property that is pawned by a debtor.\n  This amendment deals with the question of when that pawned property \nis legally out of the reach of a debtor's bankruptcy estate.\n  This amendment would allow pawned tangible personal property to be \nexcluded from the bankruptcy estate, so long as the debtor has no legal \nobligation to repay the money or redeem or buy back the property and \nthe contract or statutory redemption period has expired on the pawned \nproperty. And, of course, it is that expiration date that is clear and \nimportant as it relates to the period of redemption, and that is where \nthe courts have found themselves in the last several years.\n  This amendment incorporates the general position of the courts that \npawnbrokers should be allowed to have complete and clear title to the \npawned personal property of a person in bankruptcy once the redemption \nperiod has expired and the debtor or trustee has not exercised the \nright of redemption.\n  This amendment allows the pawnbroker to sell the pawned property \nwithout burdening the courts with unnecessary actions seeking relief \nfrom the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code.\n  Courts have found that unredeemed, pawned, tangible personal property \ncannot be treated as property of the bankruptcy estate because once the \nstatutory redemption period has run, and the pawned goods have not been \nredeemed, the debtor forfeits all rights and title to the pawned \nproperty. The cutoff date for inclusion of the bankruptcy estate is the \nend of the redemption period. I am referencing Dunlap, a 1993 case in \nMaryland and Tennessee, 158 BR 724.\n  In the circumstances outlined by this amendment, the property doesn't \nbelong to the debtor anymore. Once that redemption period has run out \nand they have not exercised it, it is out of his possession and out of \nhis right to control. It is only common sense that when it is no longer \nhis property, it cannot be pulled into the bankruptcy estate. That is \nwhat the courts have said, and that is what this amendment says.\n  All too often, however, pawnbrokers are pulled in and ultimately they \nhave to go through the expense of hiring attorneys and doing all of \nthose kinds of things even though it is very clear that the property \nredemption period has expired and the courts ultimately ruled in favor \nof the pawnbroker.\n  So we are clarifying that with this amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will accept it and be consistent in this law with what the \ncourts have been saying now over the last period of years.\n  Mr. President, I relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my good friend, the Senator from Idaho. This amendment is needed to \nclarify that if an individual has pledged\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nhis property for money and is not obligated to redeem it, and indeed \ndoes not redeem the property within the time he or she agreed to redeem \nit, then the bankruptcy laws are not abused to attempt to get that \nproperty back.\n  What this amendment does is basically recognize and respect the right \nof individuals and businesses to be able to pledge property for money \nfor an agreed period of time. Essentially, those businesses engaged in \nthis type of transaction, namely pawnbrokers, provide cash loans to \npeople in exchange for a pledge of personal property. The pawnbroker \ncharges interest on the loan, but the customer is under no obligation \nto redeem the pledged property. When the individual does not redeem the \npawned item within the contractual period, the property becomes part of \nthe pawnbroker's inventory for sale. It does not continue to be the \nproperty of the individual.\n  Some debtors have attempted to subject their pawn transactions to the \noperation of the bankruptcy code's automatic stay, after the time under \nthe contract for redeeming the property has expired. Most courts that \nhave considered the matter have held that if the debtor or the trustee \ndoes not redeem the property within a typical period of 60 days from \nthe date of filing for bankruptcy, then full title to the property \nvests with the pawnbroker. This is the sensible result, because the \ndebtor has no obligation to redeem the property.\n  This is a sensible clarification amendment, without which, certain \nindividuals could abuse the system to the detriment of other consumers \nwho use and need the pawnbroker's services. Let's close this loophole \nand support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of the \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S52-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S52-S57]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is great to be back in session this \nmorning and see my chairman, Senator Hatch. I know today he made a big \nannouncement. He has given his heart over the last several months and \noffered himself to the American people as our next President. He did so \nwith integrity. Throughout the year, he chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee. We never slacked in our committee hearings. He was here and \nmissed hardly any votes. So many of our candidates seem to give up \ntheir responsibilities in the House or the Senate, but he did not do \nso. He regularly cast his votes day after day. This is the first real \nbusiness of the Senate, a day in which he made an announcement. I know \nit was very important to him that he would not continue his seeking of \nthe Presidency, and he is introducing and leading the fight for a very \nimportant and historic bankruptcy reform bill that is long overdue.\n  Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley have worked exceedingly hard to \nmake this bill a reality. We are on the verge of it becoming a reality. \nIt has been frustrating. The last time we passed this bill in the last \nhours of the last Congress, it had over 95 votes and only 1 or 2 \nopposing votes. It came out of committee last year 16-2, with almost \nthat many votes this time in Judiciary Committee.\n  It is a bill whose time has come. I am glad we are bringing it up. I \nthank the majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, for saying we need to \nbring this to a conclusion and calling it up for debate at the \nbeginning.\n  There has been some suggestion and some comments recently about a \ndecline in bankruptcy filings this past year. One full-page ad--I \nsuppose designed to influence this body--was in one of the local \nWashington papers. The headline was, ``The Incredible Disappearing \nBankruptcy Problem.''\n  Let's talk about the numbers. Chairman Hatch mentioned those earlier. \nIn 1980, when we had an economy that was weaker than it is today, there \nwere only 287,000 bankruptcy filings. In 1998, less than 20 years \nlater, with the economy one of the strongest we have ever had, the \nnumber of personal bankruptcy filings has skyrocketed to 1,398,000--a \n386-percent increase. That is a stunning fact.\n  In 1999 when the economy was even stronger--we had an even stronger \neconomy last year than in 1998--we had a modest 7-percent reduction in \nbankruptcy filings. Some are saying we don't need to have any \nbankruptcy reform, that it is a disappearing problem. I hardly think \nanybody can believe that a 7-percent reduction, after a 386-percent \nincrease, suggests in any way that we don't continue to have a \nbankruptcy problem.\n  The Consumer Federation of America, which is really hard left in my \nview, issued a press release saying the crisis is over. That certainly \nis not the fact. In 1997, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, \nwith Federal judges and bankruptcy experts on it, issued a report that \nstated the most visible and disturbing fact about consumer bankruptcy \nhas been the extraordinary increase in filings in the last two decades. \nSince 1980, the rate of consumer bankruptcies has risen nearly \nthreefold. These are the words of the official report of the \nCommission. Certainly nothing has happened since that report was issued \nin 1997 to indicate we have had any significant permanent reduction.\n  In 1996, the number of consumer bankruptcy filings was 1.1 million. \nIn 1999, the estimated number of filings is 1.3 million. Thus, since \nthe Bankruptcy Review Commission complained about the alarming number \nof filings, the filings have increased 16 percent. So since the \nofficial report's conclusion criticizing and complaining and expressing \nconcern about the large number of filings, it has increased 16 percent \nsince then.\n\n  I believe we do have a problem. We have a deep problem of abusive and \nrepeat filers, people whose lawyers tell them clever ways to beat their \nlegitimate debts. There are a lot of abuses in this system. So while we \nare happy we have had a modest decrease in filings, we have not dealt \nwith the fundamental problem. The reason we have a bankruptcy reform \nbill is not because there are a large number of filings. The reason we \nhave this bankruptcy reform bill is that the system is not working \nfairly. Too many people with high incomes--$70,000, $80,000, $90,000--\nare filing bankruptcy and are not paying their debts when they could \neasily do so. The moral question arises because the person they owe may \nhave far less income than they do--maybe it is their neighborhood \ngarage mechanic who worked on their car. They may have greater income \nthan the people they owe, who they are not repaying.\n  So we want to make sure the historic principle of bankruptcy is alive \nand well: That a person can wipe out his debts and start over again and \nnot be burdened with unpayable debts. But when a person can reasonably \npay a substantial part of those debts, we believe he ought to do so. \nThat is what we will be talking about today.\n  The purpose of bankruptcy reform is--hopefully, we will have some \nreduction in filings. I do not expect we will have much of a reduction \nas a result of this reform, but our basic goal in bankruptcy reform is \nto have a system that works better to reduce litigation, to reduce the \ncost. We make it so you do not have to have a lawyer to represent \nyourself on a matter in bankruptcy court. We required that persons be \nat least knowledgeable of and have an opportunity to talk with a credit \ncounseling agency. They are in every locality in America. They help \npeople deal with their financial crises, short of declaring bankruptcy \non many occasions. Sometimes they will tell them, ``You cannot handle \nit, you have to go to bankruptcy.'' Or they may say they need to have a \nbudget and get the family in and deal with the fundamental problems, \nwhere they are in debt, and start first paying the debts off with the \nhighest interest rates.\n  Our goal is not primarily to reduce bankruptcy filings. Our goal \nprimarily is to end abuses and problems that have made themselves clear \nover the past 30 years since we last reviewed bankruptcy. The lawyers \nhave learned how to work the system well. We need to create a legal \nsystem that has integrity and efficiency and that everyone can respect.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \nkind remarks about me. I want to mention what a great service he has \ndone\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\non the Judiciary Committee helping with this bill. He is one of the \ntruly knowledgeable people in this area. I express my regard for him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't think I mentioned about Senator \nHatch, when he came to Alabama, and there were 2,000 delegates there at \na State convention voting for President, he came within a few votes of \nbeing the winner. He had a great showing in our home State of Alabama.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. I did not do the same in New \nHampshire and Iowa. I appreciate his kind remarks and appreciate his \nstrong efforts on this bill. He has done a great job and deserves a lot \nof credit on this bill.\n  With that, I relinquish the floor to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I go on in this debate on this \nbankruptcy bill, since I have a very different position on this piece \nof legislation than my colleague, Senator Hatch from Utah, I say to him \nI think all of us in the Senate, even when we do not agree with him, \nlike to see him on the floor. He is a Senator with a tremendous amount \nof dignity. He is a very, very fine Senator. So we welcome him back.\n\n  Mr. President, I will start out talking about a couple of amendments. \nThe first amendment I want to make reference to--then I want to talk \nabout this bill to give some context for these amendments--is an \namendment which would curb a form of predatory lending which targets \nlow- and moderate-income families.\n  One of my criticisms of this bill is it is very one sided and does \nnot deal with these kinds of unscrupulous lending practices. This \namendment, which is called the payday loan amendment, would prevent \nclaims at bankruptcy on high-cost transactions in which the annual \ninterest rate exceeds 100 percent such as payday loans and car title \npawns.\n  I say to my colleague from Utah and other colleagues in the Senate, \nthis is an outrageous practice. As long as we are talking about \nbankruptcy reform, we ought to make it clear this kind of predatory \nlending practice means these folks cannot have claims in bankruptcy. \nLet me give some examples, and I will go into this more next week.\n  First, on payday loans, what we are talking about is the situation of \na family where maybe the car breaks down. These are people who do not \nhave a lot of money. Maybe it is an illness, a medical bill. It is \ncalled a payday loan. They seek a 2-week loan; maybe it is $200, maybe \nit is $100. What happens is the lenders, these credit companies that \nare involved in these payday loans, will say we will make the loan to \nyou and you write out a check to us, and also here is going to be the \nfee we are going to charge, which equals high interest, then 2 weeks \nfrom now you pay us back. It turns out quite often people cannot pay \nback the loan because these people are under the gun, in which case \nthey roll it over again and again and again, which is exactly what the \npayday lenders want, to the point where, for example, a $15 fee on a 2-\nweek loan of $100 equals an annual interest rate of 391 percent. There \nare some instances where the actual interest rate is 2,000 percent.\n  I think a lot of people in the lending industry are not happy with \nthis practice at all--I want to give some credit where credit is due, \nno pun intended. Additionally, what these pay day lenders do is use a \ncoercive practice where they say to very hard-pressed families: We have \nthe check you made out to us and if you don't pay us back, we are going \nto go ahead and bounce the check and then you will be subject to \ncriminal prosecution. They use that as a threat. They don't follow \nthrough, but they intimidate people.\n  Let me go on to talk about car title pawns. This is unbelievable, \nAmerican people. It is hard to get people's attention on this \nbankruptcy bill. I think people ought to know some of the practices \nthat go on in the country.\n  In this particular case, you have a double whammy. People are hard \npressed. If they were not hard pressed and had nowhere to go, if they \nwere big customers with big banks, they would have no problem. We are \ntalking about hard-working, poor people, low-income people in Arkansas, \nMinnesota, Utah, desperate for money. What are they going to do?\n  In this particular case with the car title pawns, they get a $100 \nloan and the creditor puts a lien on the car and says you have to pay \nus back with the fee, high interest. If you don't pay them back--\nliterally quite often they require the key to the car as part of the \ncondition for granting the loan--they take the car. They sell the car \nand in some states they don't even have to give back to the original \nowner the additional money they make beyond what the loan was. They \nkeep all the money. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? This is \nexactly what goes on.\n  One of my amendments, that I am going to spell this out in greater \ndetail next week, will say that there is some predatory lending which \nclearly targets hard-pressed low- and moderate-income families, which \nwe find obscene. We intend to have some kind of ground rules here, some \nkind of accountability. Basically what we are saying is--this is the \nproposition--we are not going to let you make a bankruptcy claim where \nyou have had a credit transaction in which the annual interest rate \nexceeds 100 percent. If we are going to talk about bankruptcy reform, I \nam hoping to see my colleagues out here with a good, strong affirmative \nvote.\n  I will briefly talk about the second amendment because I will have \nmore time to lay this out later. I will cooperate with the manager. I \nwill begin to lay out my case. This is an important consumer amendment \nwhich will require big banks with more than $200 million in assets to \noffer low-cost, basic banking services to their customers if, again, \nthey wish to make claims against debtors in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  We have talked about the responsibility of the consumers--hard-\npressed people. What about the responsibility of banks and lending \ninstitutions to offer inexpensive means to conduct financial \ntransactions and to save money? What happens is, they say you have to \nhave a minimum balance of $1,000 in your account. If you do not, you \nhave to pay an exorbitant fee, which could result in hundreds of \ndollars a year. These low-income people cannot afford it. There are \nsome 12 million Americans who do not have the same kind of service that \nwe have. As a result, then, they end up having to deal with \nunscrupulous kinds of dealers, like the payday lenders that I just \ndescribed.\n  Our community banks in Arkansas and Minnesota went out of their way \nwith low- and moderate-income people who live within their communities \nto make sure they were able to access low cost accounts. But now, with \nthis consolidation and these mergers, a lot of these big branch banks \ndo not see it the same way. So what we are simply saying is, we want \nthese consumers to be able to have an affordable checking account, one \nthat does not require a large minimum balance or costly access fees. \nThat is what is going on. This amendment will speak to that.\n  But context for this. Again, I say to my colleagues, believe me, I am \njust absolutely amazed, when I look at some of the practices that take \nplace in this country, that we are not, in this piece of legislation, \ndealing with it. But let me give some context for these amendments. I \nam a little bit surprised, frankly.\n  I say to my colleagues, since we are in disagreement on this, as I \nhave already said to Senator Hatch, how good it is to see him here, and \nwhat a fine Senator he is. I think everybody in the Senate agrees with \nthat.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I express my gratitude to my \ngood friend for the kind comments he has made. I really appreciate \nthem.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I would not say it if it were not true. That is the way the Senator \nis.\n  But this piece of legislation is fundamentally flawed. It contains \nnumerous provisions which are harshly punitive to those citizens who \nare the most vulnerable in our country. It addresses a crisis that no \nlonger exists and that appears to be self-correcting. It rewards \npredatory and reckless lending by banks and credit card companies, \nwhich fed the crisis in the first place, and does nothing to actually \nprevent bankruptcy or to promote economic security for working \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\n  I do not see anything in this legislation that deals with the crisis \nof medical costs, that deals with what happens to people when they \ncannot get a job at a decent wage. I do not see anything in this bill \nthat deals with housing costs. But what I see is a fundamentally flawed \npiece of legislation.\n\n  I am amazed that it has sailed through the way it has. I am amazed \nthere is not more opposition, which is punitive toward those people who \nare the most vulnerable in our society. This purports to address a \ncrisis which does not even exist.\n  Professor Lawrence Ausubel of the University of Maryland notes that \nthe peak increase in bankruptcy filings came and went in 1996. In fact, \nthe filings in 1998 were barely an increase over 1997. We know now that \nthere were 112,000 fewer bankruptcies in 1999 than there were in 1998--\na nearly 10-percent decline.\n  Perhaps most startling, given what some of my colleagues have stated, \nis that credit card lenders have seen their chargeoffs--loans which are \nuncollectible--decline over the past 2 years.\n  So I ask my colleagues, is this a crisis? Despite the decrease in \nfilings, there are still too many bankruptcies in America. I agree with \nthat. However, this bill does not do anything to reverse this. It is \ngoing to make matters worse. The nonexistent crisis is being used to \njustify harsh restrictions on bankruptcy relief, which will harm those \ncitizens who are most in need of its protection.\n  Colleagues, let me quote from the September 30, 1999, issue of The \nAmerican Banker magazine. The title of the article is ``Bankruptcies \nDown; Enthusiasm for Reform Wanes.'' I quote from the article:\n\n       A retreat in bankruptcy filings from their record highs is \n     causing precious little jubilation in the lending community. \n     Lenders, who persistently point to the high rate of filings \n     as one of their top business problems, may be concerned that \n     a turnaround will undercut their effort to reform bankruptcy \n     laws and make it easier to collect on poor credits.\n\n  Bankruptcy does not occur in a vacuum. We know, in the vast majority \nof cases, it is a drastic step taken by families in desperate financial \ncircumstances and overburdened by debt. The main income earner--he or \nshe--they have lost their job. There is a sudden illness. There is a \nterrible accident. All of us know that could happen to us. The \nbankruptcy system is supposed to allow a person or a family to climb \nback up after they have hit bottom, to have a fresh start.\n  There is no point in continuing to push a person and a family once \ntheir resources are overmatched by debt. That is what we are doing in \nthis legislation.\n  The bankruptcy system simply allows families to regroup, to focus \nresources on essentials, such as home, transportation, and meeting the \nneeds of their dependents. Sometimes the only way this can occur is to \nallow the debtor to be forgiven of some debt. In most cases, this debt \nwould never be repaid because of the debtor's financial circumstances.\n  In fact, in over 95 percent of bankruptcy cases, creditors receive no \ndistributions from the filer's assets, not because these folks are able \nto beat the system but because in the vast majority of the cases the \ndebtor does not have any assets left.\n  The sponsors of this measure--the megabanks and the credit card \ncompanies--they do not like to focus on these situations. They talk \nabout all of the abuses. But let me just cite some evidence here. A \nstudy by the American Bankruptcy Institute found that only 3 percent of \ndebtors who file under chapter 7--which is what we are talking about--\nwould actually have been able to pay more of their debt than they are \nrequired to under chapter 7. Three percent does not sound, to me, like \na percentage of a lot of abuse. Even the Justice Department says the \nabuse of claims was only between 3 and 13 percent.\n  But what this legislation is going to do is, it is going to channel \nmany more debtors into chapter 13 bankruptcy, where the debtor enters a \n3- to 5-year repayment plan where very little debt is forgiven. As a \nmatter of fact, under current law, 67 percent of the debtors in chapter \n13 cannot fulfill or cannot live up to their repayment plan, often \nbecause they do not get enough relief.\n  So what are we doing?\n  Why is this so punitive and why is it so one sided? Why aren't we \nalso addressing the predatory practices of these credit companies, of \nthese lenders? This is apparently not obvious to many of my colleagues, \nbut with all due respect, debt involves both the borrower and the \nlender.\n  I gave examples of some egregious practices with which I will deal in \nmy amendments. As high-cost debt, credit cards, retail charge cards, \nand financing plans for consumer goods have skyrocketed in recent \nyears--and so have many bankruptcy filings; we all know that--and are \npumped on our children, our neighbors, as the consumer credit card \nindustry has begun to aggressively court the poor and vulnerable, \nbankruptcies have risen. There is no question about it. Credit card \ncompanies brazenly dangle literally billions of dollars of credit card \noffers to high debt families every year. With this legislation, we are \ngiving them a blank check to do even more. They encourage credit card \nholders to make low payments toward their credit card balances, \nguaranteeing that a few $100 in clothing or food will take years to pay \noff. The lengths to which these companies go to keep their customers in \ndebt is ridiculous.\n  I already gave an example, when I was talking about what happens with \nthese car title pawn companies and these payday loan companies. It is \nabsolutely unbelievable. People get charged anywhere from 100 percent \nup to 2000 percent in interest by these unscrupulous dealers. All you \nhave to do to enter into this is to have no conscience. People are \ndesperate. You give them a $100, $200 loan. You basically roll it over \nwhen they can't pay it. Pretty soon they have to pay 300-percent \ninterest on an annual basis. You take title to their car. They can't \npay back $100. These are poor people; they are desperate. They had to \ncome to you for that reason. Then you repossess their car, and you keep \nthe money beyond anything they owed you. There is no accountability.\n  Yet in this bankruptcy reform bill, I don't see any discussion or any \nkind of rules or any kind of accountability or any kind of protection \nfor consumers when it comes to these unscrupulous practices. I am \namazed this piece of legislation has been sailing through. I think the \nPresident should veto this.\n  I will take some time to give context to this. A March 31, 1990, \nedition of the Detroit Free Press reported on a woman who sent a check \nto her credit card company to pay her entire credit card balance of \n$4,000. I know the Presiding Officer would say that is the way it \nshould be done. She had the money. She could do it. A few days later, \nshe got a call from the company offering her a lower interest rate for \n6 months if she would let the credit card company rip up her check and \nkeep the $4,000 balance on her card. Fortunately for her, this woman \nmade the right decision and refused this insane offer. But if credit \ncard companies are using these tactics to keep folks in debt, do they \nhave any right to preach about financial responsibility?\n  Why is this piece of legislation so one sided? Why are we not talking \nabout their unscrupulous practices and how to also make sure they live \nup to some kind of standard of responsibility?\n  I will quote a few lines from an L.A. Times feature called the Money \nSavvy Weekend. It is a column about money management. I would like my \ncolleagues to hear how the author of the piece advises credit card \nholders to deal with card companies.\n  She starts out by saying:\n\n       Your credit card issuer is not your friend, or even your \n     most trusted business partner, so if you've been thinking \n     along these lines, stop now.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, if people think their credit card company is \ntheir friend now, they will know differently when this bill passes, \nwhen they see how their right to a fresh start has been eroded. This \nbill just gives these credit card companies everything they want, \nprovides no protection for poor people, provides no protection for \nsingle parents, no protection for senior citizens. What in the world \nhas happened to the Senate? What has happened to Democrats? Why are we \nletting this bill go by without amendments? Why aren't we standing up \nand taking on this piece of legislation?\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\n  Continuing on from the L.A. Times feature, the author goes on to say:\n\n       Instead, start thinking of your credit card issuer as a \n     slightly sleazy and overbearing salesman who controls one \n     product you want, but who wants to trick you into buying the \n     store. That salesman does not have your best interests at \n     heart. . . .\n\n  Then in the same column:\n\n       Last week, a San Francisco law firm filed a law suit \n     against Providian Financial Corp., alleging that the firm \n     delayed postings (of payments), hid terms of its card \n     agreements, and made it seem like a fairly useless $12.95-\n     per-month credit protection plan was a requirement when it \n     wasn't. The city's prosecutors are investigating the firm.\n\n  I could go on but here is the question. I talked about payday loans. \nI talked about repossessing cars. When we read S. 625, it is a clear \nindication of who has clout in the Nation's capital. There is not one \nprovision in this bill that holds the consumer credit industry \nresponsible for their lending habits. There is not one provision in \nthis bill that holds the consumer credit industry responsible for their \nlending habits. I have spent time on two deplorable practices on which \nI will have amendments. We will have votes on it next week. But there \nis nothing in this piece of legislation that has a word to say about \nany of this. With all due respect, it is not all that surprising why.\n  Who do you think the people are who have to rely on payday loans? Who \ndo you think the people are who have to rely on these car pawn loans? \nWho do you think the people are who by and large file chapter 7? You \nwill come up with some abusive examples, but I have given you study \nafter study that shows there is very little abuse. Most of the people \nwho do this are hard-pressed people, poor people. You lose your job. \nYou don't have a family you can go to who can help you out. Your car \nbreaks down. You have an illness. You had no health insurance in the \nfirst place. Now we have this punitive piece of legislation that \ntargets these citizens, the most vulnerable citizens, but gives the \ncredit card industry all they want.\n  I think this is a sad reflection of who gets to the table and who \ndoesn't and whose voice is heard and whose voice is not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment \nwithout yielding his right to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota has been \none of the hardest working Members on this whole bankruptcy issue, one \nof the most passionate and articulate. I hate to interrupt. I wonder if \nhe would allow me a few minutes, without losing his right to the floor, \nin my capacity as ranking member to say a few comments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be pleased, if my colleague \nneeds more time. I would like to make sure that I have the floor after \nthe Senator speaks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of my remarks \nthat the floor revert to the Senator from Minnesota and his original \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, could I ask how much longer \nthe distinguished Senator will hold forth?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will need some additional time. I was \nintending to try to finish before 12:30 because that is when we go into \nconference. My idea would be that I would then come back with these \namendments, finish up right before we vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Craig \namendment be laid aside so the two amendments of the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota can be put forward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Chair warns Senators that we have to deal with the \nunanimous consent request the Senator from Vermont put forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will withhold that for a moment, if the Senator from \nUtah wishes to make another request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, has the \ndistinguished Senator laid down his two amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What I am intending to do is call up my amendments. My \nunderstanding, originally, was we were going to perhaps vote today. We \nare not going to vote. Therefore, I was trying to accommodate my \ncolleagues. I said I wanted some time to talk about the context of \nthese amendments and that I would come out here today. I would lay out \nmy case. Then, when we come back next week and vote, I want a final \nhour for the two amendments. Then we would vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the distinguished Senator a favor, that he do his \ndebate today on his amendments, because we are going to move to table, \nand then we will have at least 10 minutes equally divided for each \namendment on Tuesday. We have to get rid of these amendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Utah, I \nwould have to respectfully decline. Originally, I had not agreed to any \ntime agreement on these amendments. I said I would not agree. Then I \nwas told that if I would come out today, try to speak before \nconference, and then reserve the final hour, agree to a time agreement \nnext week for a final hour on two amendments, I would have an hour and \nwhatever time I need. I said I would do that. I have given up on \nlimited time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not objecting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as presented \nby the Senator from Vermont? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I should say to all Senators, both sides of \nthe aisle and the two leaders who have worked on this, that I am \npleased we reached a reasonable unanimous consent agreement to proceed \nto debate and vote on the few remaining amendments of the Bankruptcy \nReform Act. We worked very hard on this before we broke for the \nChristmas recess.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as long as Senator Leahy is speaking, I \nask unanimous consent, because I do want to finish up and accommodate \neveryone, that when we come back, I do have a final hour to speak on my \ntwo amendments on Monday or Tuesday.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we want to be able to finish next Tuesday. \nWe want to resolve this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Minnesota and I can work together during the break and see \nif we can reach an area of agreement.\n  During the last few days of the session, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah and I, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, worked very \nhard to whittle down the numbers. The distinguished Senator from \nNevada, the Assistant Democratic Leader, was his usual indefatigable \nself in working, cajoling, pleading, and, when all else failed, \nthreatening to break arms to get rid of amendments. I knew we were \nsuccessful when I saw so many Members going down to see the orthopedic \nsurgeon in the Capitol physician's office after having a meeting with \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  I am also pleased to see my friend from Utah, the distinguished \nsenior Senator, Orrin Hatch, back on the Senate floor. The Senator is \nnot only one of the most gifted legislators in Congress but one of the \nbest known. More important, to me, though, he is one of the closest \nfriends I have had in my 25 years in the Senate. He is such a good \nfriend that while he was campaigning in Iowa, I offered to go out and \neither speak for or against him, whichever would help the most. Trust \nme, Mr. President, I have plenty of material either way on that.\n  I say to Chairman Orrin Hatch, it is good to have you back here.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the reasons I am so happy to have \nhim back is that the Senator from Utah and I, even though we bring \ndifferent political philosophies to so many issues, know that on so \nmany issues before the Judiciary Committee we have a responsibility to \ntry to bring both sides of the aisle together and to span a wide \nphilosophical gap among the 100 Senators. When we work together, as we \nhave on many issues, we find that those issues pass the Senate \noverwhelmingly. That is why, I might say, as we start this new action \nin this new millennium, how much better it is, instead of having a \ncloture vote, that we are letting\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nthe Senate process work--something both he and I have seen for a couple \nof decades here work the way it should.\n  Last year, the Democrats entered into a unanimous consent agreement \nto limit our rights to offer only three nonrelevant amendments and to \nfile relevant amendments by November 5. We entered into this agreement \nto work in a bipartisan manner to improve the bill. We made bipartisan \nprogress. I don't know how many Senators realize it, but we adopted 37 \namendments to the underlying bill--amendments of both Democrats and \nRepublicans. We worked that out on a consent basis. We cleared \namendments. We set up rollcall votes. In fact, from a total of 320 \namendments filed by Senators on both sides of the aisle on November 5, \n1999, Senator Torricelli and I, working with the Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Reid, narrowed down the remaining Democratic amendments on this \nbill to a handful. The remaining amendments from our list are all \nrelevant. We are ready to debate and work on them.\n  I am proud to cosponsor Senator Schumer's amendment on debts incurred \nthrough the commission of violence to health service clinics. The \namendment makes sense. Under our unanimous consent agreement, we will \nhave an up-or-down vote on it. Under our unanimous consent agreement, \nSenator Levin from Michigan will also have an up-or-down vote on his \namendment on firearm-related debts. He is willing to limit the time on \nhis amendment to 2 hours. Senator Schumer will have 40 minutes on his \namendment. These are reasonable time limits.\n  There is another important amendment by Senators Sarbanes and Durbin \nto clarify the credit industry reforms in the bill. Millions of credit \ncard solicitations made to consumers have caused, in part, the rise in \nconsumer bankruptcy filings. The credit card industry should bear more \nof the responsibility. So the Sarbanes-Durbin amendment improves the \nTruth in Lending Act by requiring more disclosure of credit information \nso consumers may better manage debts and avoid bankruptcy altogether.\n\n  In the last Congress, the Senate bankruptcy reform bill was fair and \nbalanced because it included credit industry reforms. We passed that \nbill by 97-1 vote in 1998. The 1998 Senate-passed bill should be a \nmodel here in the year 2000.\n  Many Democratic Senators have offered short time agreements of a half \nhour or less on their amendments. The Democrats are prepared to debate \nand vote on these amendments. That is the way the Senate works best. I \ncommend my colleagues for working to get this agreement. I look forward \nto a fair and full debate.\n  Mr. President, I am actually delighted to be back. It is nice for \npeople in Washington to provide weather that looks like we have in \nVermont--with one notable exception: With this little bit of snow on \nthe ground, our government offices in Vermont would all be open.\n  In fact, all other offices would be open. I note that because we had \na couple of calls from incredulous Vermonters who couldn't believe that \nthe Federal Government had been closed down 2 days in a row for the \nkind of snow we might get in a morning. I want to assure them that the \noffice of the senior Senator from Vermont is open. I suspect the \noffices of the other two Members of the Vermont delegation are open. I \nguess the one nice thing about it is there is no traffic going in and \nout. There is not much snow on the road either.\n  I wish all those employees who are having 2 days of vacation because \nof a little bit of snow have a good time. I hope they spend time with \ntheir children, read a good book, shovel their walks, and just be glad \nthey are not living in an area where you would still go to work with an \nawful lot more snow.\n  I close again by saying it is good to see my good friend, the \nchairman of this committee. I look forward to starting the millennium \nand working well with him.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont. He is a \ndear friend and the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. We work \nwell together. His comments are very deeply felt by me. When both he \nand Senator Kennedy offered to come to Iowa and New Hampshire to speak \nagainst me, I think I made a big mistake by not asking them to do it. I \nthink I would have done much better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone call up \nhis two amendments today and that we reserve 1 hour between 9:30 and \n10:30 next Tuesday morning for the debate on both of those amendments, \nincluding up until 12:30 today.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I don't \nthink I will--I ask for an hour to make my case. It is not an hour \nequally divided; it is an hour that I have divided for my two \namendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that would be the time for the \nSenator to talk about his two amendments, and he has the rest of the \ntime until 12:30 today. Then we will set aside his amendments after he \ncalls them up so we can call up amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2537 and 2538\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks about the \noverall bill, but let me call up my amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Wellstone) proposes \n     amendments numbered 2537 and 2538.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2537\n\n       At appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, there are a few of the truly onerous \nprovisions of this bill affecting hard-pressed, working families.\n  Section 105--someone needs to focus on this--imposes mandatory credit \ncounseling on debtors before they can seek bankruptcy relief, at the \ndebtor's expense. This is regardless of whether the bankruptcy would be \nthe result of simple overspending or something unavoidable such as a \nserious illness in your family and a medical expense.\n  Forty-four million people in our country do not have health \ninsurance.\n  There is no waiver of this requirement if the debtor needs to make an \nemergency bankruptcy filing to stave off eviction or a utility shutoff. \nIt is amazing. I can't believe this.\n  Again, you have a situation--I used to do a lot of work organizing \nwith poor people--with a family, and these people are denied. They have \nto go through mandatory credit card counseling before they can seek \nbankruptcy relief, even when it is clear it isn't because they just \noverspent, that it is because something happened to them that was \nbeyond their control, such as an illness in their family. And there \nisn't even a waiver of this requirement when the family has to get the \nemergency bankruptcy filing in order to stave off an eviction or a \nutilities shutoff.\n  It is cold outside today in Washington, DC. Do you know what a \nutility shutoff would mean to family?\n  Section 311 would end the practice under current law of stopping \neviction proceedings against tenants who are behind on rent who file \nfor bankruptcy. What we are saying is if a tenant is filing for \nbankruptcy right now, they have at least some protection. Section 311 \nwill basically end this protection. You can go on with the eviction \nproceedings.\n  Section 312 will make a person ineligible to file for chapter 13 \nbankruptcy if he or she has successfully emerged from bankruptcy within \nthe past 5 years, even if it was a successful chapter 13 reorganization \nwhere the debtor paid off all the creditors. If they have been through \nit successfully before and paid off all of the creditors, and there is \nan emergency medical bill or whatever happened--they lost their job--\nthey are ineligible.\n  This is called reform?\n  I started out saying before the Chair came that you have this \nunbelievable practice right now that I am trying to go after with one \namendment--these title car pawn loans and payday loans--car title pawn \nloans, again, where somebody needs $100, or $200, and basically they \nget the loan. The unscrupulous creditor says: We give you the loan. You \npay us the high interest. In addition, we want the key to your car. We \nhave a loan on your car.\n  If they do not pay it back at the end of the week, or after 2 weeks, \nthey take the car key and sell it. Whatever money they make, they can \nkeep, even if it is above and beyond what they owe the debtor. It is \nunbelievable. We ought to do something about that. This is a ludicrous \nbusiness. These are hard-pressed people and this is the only place they \ncan go right now.\n  I talked about these payday loans. In all due respect, again, these \nfolks who do this ought not be covered by this bankruptcy. They ought \nnot be able to collect these payday loans. It is unbelievable. It is \nthe same thing. You need a loan of $100 for a week or two. You are \ncharged 15 percent interest. They roll over again and again. It can be \nas high as 300 or 400. There have been some cases where it has been as \nhigh as 2,000 percent interest.\n  We ought to say, in all due respect, if you folks want to be allowed \nto claim, we ought to put a limit, and if the limit is going to be at \n100-percent interest, it seems to me that is pretty high--100 percent \ninterest payments? Maybe we want to say then we prohibit the recovery \nof loans.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry to say to my colleague that I have been \nyielding over and over again. I will try to finish by 12:30. Let me \nfinish, and then I will yield.\n  Mr. President, on this piece of legislation, I started out citing \nthat there are three or four national studies--three or four \nindependent national studies, credible national studies. That is a \nmatter of fact. What is supposed to be a crisis no longer exists, and \nthe trend is that there are going to be fewer bankruptcies.\n  I then went on to say there are still too many. But the irony is that \nthe reason a lot of people have to file for bankruptcy is because we \nhaven't done a darned thing when people do not have health insurance. \nWe haven't done a darned thing to make sure people find a job with \ndescent wages. We haven't done a darned thing about affordable child \ncare. We are doing nothing about the crisis in affordable housing, \nincluding in rural areas. All of this impinges on these families, but \ninstead we have this piece of legislation.\n  I then went on to argue, and I cited a number of provisions which are \ndraconian, this piece of legislation targets low-income people. The \npeople who are going to be most harshly treated by this are poor \npeople, senior citizens, women, and single parents.\n  I then went on, and I gave many instances to say that it does nothing \nabout the unscrupulous creditors--nothing at all. There is no \naccountability there. There was not a call for responsibility on their \npart.\n  I will be back next week with two amendments. I will have an hour to \nargue my case. I hope at least on these two amendments I can receive \nmajority support. I have tried to take some time this morning and I \nwill take more time next week to at least get people in the country, \npeople who watch this debate or people who write about this debate, to \nunderstand there are a lot of punitive provisions in this piece of \nlegislation. It hardly can be called ``reform.''\n  There are many organizations--consumer organizations, senior \norganizations, children's organizations, labor organizations--that have \nraised important questions about this. I think rather than a step \nforward, this is a very harsh step backward.\n  I am pleased to yield for a question or comment from my colleague \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator aware we are under a previous \norder to got to recess at 12:30?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to debate this subject with my colleague \nnext week.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had a question about the amendment but I don't think \nit is necessary to pursue it today at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S57-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S57]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. This legislation is urgently needed to \naddress abuses of our bankruptcy laws and help make sure bankruptcy is \nreserved for those who truly need it.\n  We have had Federal bankruptcy laws for 100 years, and no one \ndisputes that some people must file for bankruptcy. Some people fall on \nhard times and have financial problems that dwarf their financial \nmeans. They need to have the debts that they cannot pay forgiven, and \nthey need a fresh start.\n  However, other people who file for bankruptcy have assets or have the \nability to repay their debts over time. These people should reorganize \ntheir debts. Bankruptcy should not be an avenue for people to avoid \npaying their debts when they have the ability to do so. People should \npay what they can.\n  The problem is becoming more serious because more and more people are \nfiling for bankruptcy every year. The number of consumer bankruptcy \nfilings has more than quadrupled in the last 20 years. More Americans \nfiled for bankruptcy last year than ever before.\n  S. 625 addresses the issue by making it easier for judges to transfer \ncases\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\nfrom Chapter 7 discharge to Chapter 13 reorganization, based on the \nincome of the debtor and other factors. The bill permits creditors to \nbe involved if they believe the debtor has the ability to repay. \nHowever, if a creditor abuses that power and brings such motions \nwithout substantial justification, the creditor is penalized. Also, the \nlegislation places more responsibility on attorneys to steer \nindividuals toward paying what they can.\n  The bill makes reforms without jeopardizing the truly needy. For \nexample, the bill has special provisions to protect mothers who depend \non child support by making these payments the top priority for payment \nin bankruptcy.\n  It is too easy to file for bankruptcy. It is too easy to get the \nslate wiped clean. We recognize that some people need a fresh start. \nBut a fresh start should not mean a free ride. We must stop this type \nof abuse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important reform measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nspeak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S58-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S58-S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE BENEFITS AND POLITICS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, as we move into this next century, we face \na great opportunity and great challenge. We need only to look backward \nto help contemplate the immense change and innovation that is in front \nof us. While positive change is to the long-term benefit of all, it \ntypically results in short-term difficulties, anxiety, and fear for \nsome. How we cope with those difficulties defines our vision and tests \nour courage. In the last century we saw the industrial age and the \ncomputer age. We experienced fits of fear regarding everything from \naviation, penicillin, industrialization, computerization and most \nrecently, the non-calamity, fortunately, known as Y2K.\n  Remarkably, plant technology in this half-century has helped make it \npossible for the U.S. farmer, who in 1940 fed 19 people, to fee 129 \ntoday.\n  Meanwhile, worldwide population grows and farmland shrinks, \nPolicymakers, farmers, doctors, business leaders, scientists, and \nothers look ahead and search for critical tools to meet the increasing \ndemands of a growing and changing world.\n  Nobel prizewinning chemist Robert F. Curl of Rice University said \nthat ``it is clear that the 21st will be the century of biology.''\n  Scientists, medical doctors, Government officials, farmers, and \nothers have testified before the Congress and elsewhere to the benefits \nof this new generation of technology, which may offer the sustainable \nproduction of safer amd more abundant food sources, new vaccines and \nmedicines, as well as biodegradable plastics and cleaner energy \nalternatives.\n  Senator Mack hosted a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee in \nSeptember entitled ``Putting a Human Face on Biotechnology'' where Tour \nde France winner Lance Armstrong testified about his personal \nexperience using biotechnology and will to overcome cancer. Senators \nLugar and Harkin held 2 days of hearings in October with a diverse \nnumber of distinguished witnesses to discuss the science and regulation \nof biotechnology.\n  Bipartisan members including Senators Kerry, Durbin, Hagel, Craig, \nFrist, Conrad, Lugar, Gorton, Grassley, Ashcroft, Robb, Burns, Grams, \nGordon Smith, Baucus, Helms, Hutchison, Roberts, Bayh, Brownback, \nCrapo, and Coverdell have joined me in expressing to the President our \nbipartisan commitment to biotechnology.\n  We urge the administration and the State Department to be firm in \ntheir negotiations in Montreal, to say that the phyto sanitary \nagreements are adequate in all we need to regulate biotechnology.\n  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which funds \npublic research activities at the National Science Foundation, I have \nworked with my partner, Senator Mikulski, to win congressional approval \nof $150 million in the last 3 years for the Plant Genome Initiative at \nthe National Science Foundation to study the structure, organization, \nand function of genomes of significant plants important to improving \nhuman health and the environment.\n  Recently, I received a letter signed by over 500 scientists revealing \nthe exceptionally strong scientific consensus endorsing biotechnology. \nThese are public- and private-sector scientists, the majority of whom \nare from academic institutions representing nearly every State, a \nnumber of foreign countries, the National Academy of Sciences, private \nfoundations, Federal research agencies, and our National Labs. Here is \nsome of what they told me about biotechnology:\n\n       The ultimate beneficiaries of technological innovation have \n     always been consumers, both in the United States and abroad. \n     In developing countries, biotechnological advances will \n     provide means to overcome vitamin deficiencies, to supply \n     vaccines for killer diseases like cholera and malaria, to \n     increase production and protect fragile natural resources, \n     and to grow crops under normally unfavorable conditions.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       We recognize that no technology is without risks. At the \n     same time, we have confidence in the current U.S. regulatory \n     system provided by the USDA, EPA, and FDA. The U.S. system \n     has worked well and continues to evolve as scientific \n     advancements are achieved.\n\n  They strongly endorse the U.S. regulatory multiagency approval \nsystem, which they say works well.\n  The American Medical Association is supportive also. In policy H-\n480.985, ``Biotechnology and the American Agricultural Industry'' they \nsay the following:\n\n       It is the policy of the AMA to (1) endorse or implement \n     programs that will convince the public and government \n     officials that genetic manipulation is not inherently \n     hazardous and that the health and economic benefits of \n     recombinant DNA technology greatly exceed any risk posed to \n     society; (2) where necessary, urge Congress and federal \n     regulatory agencies to develop appropriate guidelines which \n     will not impede the progress of agricultural biotechnology, \n     yet will ensure that adequate safety precautions are \n     enforced; (3) encourage and assist state medical societies to \n     coordinate programs which will educate physicians in \n     recombinant DNA technology as it applies to public health, \n     such that the physician may respond to patient query and \n     concern; (4) encourage physicians, through their state \n     medical societies, to be public spokespersons for those \n     agricultural biotechnologies that will benefit public health; \n     and (5) actively participate in the development of national \n     programs to educate the public about the benefits of \n     agricultural biotechnology.\n\n  Remarkably, however, we find ourselves at a crossroads as a strange \nmixture of forces endeavor not to ensure that biotechnology is safe--\nwhich is and should be our collective purpose--but to discredit and \neliminate biotechnology. Opposition has been motivated variously by \nprotectionist sentiment, by political intimidation, by competing \nbusiness, and by scientifically unsubstantiated fear of technology. \nActivists and protectionists in Europe have conspired with a level of \nsuccess that is stunning. Their goal is to stroke fear and use \nintimidation to frustrate and undermine biotechnology.\n  Just this week, it was reported by the Detroit News that:\n\n       A visiting Michigan State University associate professor \n     whose office was the target of a fire set by radical \n     environmentalists on New Year's Eve said Sunday that she \n     heads a project aimed at increasing food production and \n     making food more nutritious.\n\n  The purpose of her work was to ensure that we use agricultural \nknowledge and tools to address those problems.\n  Catherine Ives, director of the Agricultural Biotechnology for \nSustainable Productivity, which is based at Michigan State University, \nsaid, ``The whole point of the project is to make land more productive \nso we don't have to damage the environment.'' The paper reported, ``The \ngoal of the project is to develop long-term solutions for food security \nin the developing world, where undernourishment is an epidemic.'' ``We \nknow that there are 840 million people in the world who don't have \nenough to eat,'' Ives said. ``The use of agricultural knowledge and \ntools will help in addressing that problem.''\n  Dr. Martina McGlaughlin, Director of Biotechnology at the University \nof California at Davis, in a November 1, 1999, column in the Los \nAngeles Times reinforced the dilemma of population growth coupled with \nthe finite quantity of arable land:\n\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n\n       [u]nless we will accept starvation or placing parks and the \n     Amazon Basin under the plow, there really is no alternative \n     to applying biotechnology to agriculture.\n\n  Dr. McGlaughlin continued:\n\n       The most cost-effective and environmentally sound general \n     method for controlling pests and disease is the use of DNA.\n       This approach has led to a reduction in the use of sprayed \n     chemical insecticides. According to the National Agricultural \n     Statistics Service, 2 million fewer pounds of insecticide \n     were used in 1998 to control bollworm than were used in 1995, \n     before ``Bt'' cotton was introduced. And the Bt gene--\n     introduced into the crop plant, not sprayed into the \n     atmosphere--is present in minute amounts and spares \n     beneficial insects.\n\n  She concluded:\n\n       Millions of people have eaten the products of genetic \n     engineering and no adverse effects have been demonstrated. \n     The proper balance of safety testing between companies and \n     the government is a legitimate area for further debate. So \n     are environmental safeguards. But the purpose of such debate \n     should be to improve biotech research and enhance its \n     benefits to society, not stop it in its tracks.\n\n  It should be mentioned that her students at Cal Davis were also \nvictimized by law-breakers who vandalized their research testing plots. \nClearly, if the radicals were as interested in understanding as they \nare in intimidation, eliminating research is the last thing they would \nconsider.\n  In an Op-Ed in the New York Times entitled ``Who's Afraid of Genetic \nEngineers?'' former President Jimmy Carter outlined the sad irony. He \nsaid:\n\n       Imagine a country placing such rigid restrictions on \n     imports that people would not get vaccines and insulin. And \n     imagine those same restrictions being placed on food products \n     as well as on laundry detergent and paper. As far-fetched as \n     it sounds, many developing countries and some industrialized \n     on may do just that.\n\n  He concluded:\n\n       If imports . . . are regulated unnecessarily, the real \n     losers will be the developing nations. Instead of reaping the \n     benefits of decades of discovery and research, people from \n     Africa and Southeast Asia will remain prisoners of outdated \n     technology. Their countries could suffer greatly for years to \n     come. It is crucial that they reject the propaganda of \n     extremists groups before it is too late.\n\n  Renowned scientists have dedicated their lives to understanding \nbiotechnology and using it to the benefit of mankind to solve problems \nof hunger, disease and environmental degradation.\n  These problems are considerable now, but will grow in magnitudes in \nthe years ahead. In the tabloid press, however, a teenager dressed up \nas a corn cob will get as much attention and is attributed the same \ncredibility as leading scientists, whose work is subjected to rigorous \npeer review.\n  We need to be clear about several issues. First, our Government and \nits citizens are second to none in our collective commitment to food \nsafety. We have a rigorous multi-agency approval process that has stood \nthe test of time since 1938. It is based not on politics but on \nscientific consensus. It is supported by bipartisan Members of each \nbody who have the strongest commitment to food safety and environmental \nprotection. None of us are advocates for unfettered technology. As with \nany technology, there are limits that will be and must be subjected to \nlaw, not to mention common sense.\n  Second, we need to realize that there are strong elements in the \nEuropean Union who are more than happy to exploit fears--fears that \nthey helped create--to provide short-term protection to their farmers \nfrom imports. In a sentence, fear and hysteria, without scientific \nbasis, is being used by some to limit the productivity of foreign \nfarmers--period. Meanwhile, opportunistic food companies such as ADM \nand Novartis are knowingly undermining our scientists and trade \nnegotiators to placate the Luddites and protectionists.\n  Finally, let me emphasize this critical point. The issue of risk is \nnot one-dimensional. Yes, we must understand and evaluate the relative \nrisk to a Monarch Butterfly larvae. Additional research has answered \nalready many of those questions. But there is another risk. That risk \nis that naysayers and the protectionists succeed in their goals to kill \nbiotechnology and condemn the world's children to unnecessary \nblindness, malnutrition, sickness and environmental degradation.\n  Dr. C.S. Prakash directs the Center for Plant Biotechnology Research \nat Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Ala, said the following in a column \nfor the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\n       Anti-technology activists accuse corporations of ``playing \n     God'' by genetically improving crops, but it is these so-\n     called environmentalists who are really playing God, not with \n     genes but with the lives of poor and hungry people.\n       While activist organizations spend hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars to promote fear through anti-science newspaper ads, \n     1.3 billion people, who live on less than $1 a day, care only \n     about findings their next day's meal. Biotechnology is one of \n     the best hopes for solving their food needs today, when we \n     have 6 billion people, and certainly in the next 30 to 50 \n     years, when there will be 9 billion on the globe.\n       Those people, who battle weather, pests and plant disease \n     to try to raise enough for their families, can benefit \n     tremendously from biotechnology, and not just from products \n     created by big corporations. Public-sector institutions are \n     conducting work on high-yield rice, virus-resistant sweet \n     potato and more healthful strains for cassava, crops that are \n     staples in developing countries.\n       The development of local and regional agriculture is the \n     key to addressing both hunger and low income. Genetically \n     improved food is ``scale neutral,'' in that a poor rice \n     farmer with one acre in Bangladesh can benefit as much as a \n     larger farmer in California. And he doesn't have to learn a \n     sophisticated new system; he only has to plant a seed. New \n     rice strains being developed through biotechnology can \n     increase yields by 30 to 40 percent. Another rice strain has \n     the potential to prevent blindness in millions of children \n     whose diets are deficient in Vitamin A.\n       Edible vaccines, delivered in locally grown crops, could do \n     more to eliminate disease than the Red Cross, missionaries \n     and U.N. task forces combined, at a fraction of the cost. But \n     none of these benefits will be realized if Western-generated \n     fears about biotechnology halt research funding and close \n     borders to exported products.\n       For the well-fed to spreadhead fear-based campaigns and \n     suppress research for ideological and pseudo-science reasons \n     is irresponsible and immoral.\n\n  Dr. Prakash just released a petition signed by more than 600 \nscientists declaring support of agricultural biotechnology. In his \npress release he noted, ``We in the scientific community felt it \nnecessary to counteract the baseless attacks so often being made on \nbiotechnology and genetically modified foods. Biotechnology is a potent \nand valuable tool that can help make foods more productive and \nnutritious. And, contrary to anti-biotech activists, they can even \nadvance environmental goals such as biodiversity.''\n  Not content to live with their own brand of ludditism, European \nactivists have shifted the battleground and they are now looking to \nexport--not answers or solutions or constructive proposals--but fear, \nhysteria and unworkable restrictions to Asia, South America and even \nthe United States. Many have stayed out of this debate thinking the \ncontroversy will blow over as it does with most regulated technologies. \nMany, particularly those who understand the science of the issue, had \nbeen silent, thinking, possibly that people would understand and that \nthe technology would sell itself.\n  I have said from the beginning that we could not take it for granted \nthat people would embrace the technology because it is complex. I have \nsaid from the beginning that American consumers would want information. \nConsumers who know the facts--who know the benefits this technology \nwill provide--will endorse it. American consumers demand food safety, \nbut they also embrace technology and progress. They are not satisfied \nto say what we are doing is good enough. And finally, they want to base \ntheir decisions on science not fiction and it is the open discussion of \nfacts that the vandals, the protectionists, and the luddites fear the \nmost.\n  President Clinton outlined what is at stake last week in proclaiming \nJanuary 2000 as National Biotechnology Month:\n\n       Today, a third of all new medicines in development are \n     based on biotechnology. Designed to attack the underlying \n     cause of an illness, not just its symptoms, these medicines \n     have tremendous potential to provide not only more effective \n     treatments, but also cures. With improved understanding of \n     cellular and genetic processes, scientists have opened \n     exciting new avenues of research into treatments for \n     devastating diseases--like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, \n     diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, and cancer--that affect \n     millions of Americans. Biotechnology has also given us \n     several new vaccines, including one for rotavirus, now being \n     tested clinically, that could eradicate an illness \n     responsible for the deaths of more than 800,000 infants and \n     children each year.\n       The impact of biotechnology is far-reaching. Bio-\n     remediation technologies are cleaning our environment by \n     removing toxic substances from contaminated soils and ground\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\n     water. Agricultural biotechnology reduces our dependence on \n     pesticides. Manufacturing processes based on biotechnology \n     make it possible to produce paper and chemicals with less \n     energy, less pollution, and less waste. Forensic technologies \n     based on our growing knowledge of DNA help us exonerate the \n     innocent and bring criminals to justice.\n  A question is whether we want to continue with a fixed number of \nagricultural uses or if we want to expand them to provide farmers and \nconsumers new options and new opportunities. A question for some is \nwhether we want to be more pro-environment and pro-health and nutrition \nthan we are anti-corporate.\n  Like many of my colleagues here in the Senate, I have consulted \nscores of scientists in the academic world, in the public sector and in \nthe private sector. I have consulted medical professionals, and farmers \nfor their practical experience regarding biotechnology. But let me \nfinish by reading you a quote from a December 25, 1999, interview in \n``New Scientist'' and you consider for yourself who might be the \nsource:\n\n       I believe we are entering an era now where pagan beliefs \n     and junk science are influencing public policy. GM foods and \n     forestry are both good examples where policy is being \n     influenced by arguments that have no basis in fact or logic.\n\n  The source is not a corporate leader, a Senator, or a university \nscientist. It is an ecologist with a Ph.D.\n  That ecologist is Patrick Moore, one of the founding members of \nGreenpeace and a veteran of the frontline against everything from \nwhaling to nuclear waste since the 1970s.\n  The scientific consensus amongst government and academic scientists \nin the U.S. is extraordinary. The scientific community in Europe, some \nof whom I have met with agree, but have been intimidated and silenced. \nPlease give the scientific and medical communities the opportunity to \nspeak to these complex issues before you are swayed by the tabloids in \nEurope, those who may have their head burried in the flat earth, and \nthe vandals and extremists who have been condemned even by some of \ntheir very own.\n  We have a system in the U.S. to identify and evaluate relative risk, \nand, if necessary, mitigate those risks. The focus of international \nleaders should be on working constructively to identify and evaluate \nrelative risk so that our people may have safely the options of \nbiotechnology available to them. The development of this technology is \nnot recreational. It is to solve real world problems and the \npossibilities are truly breathtaking. There is too much at stake for \nthose who know better to remain passive.\n  In 1921, Missouri's renowned plant scientist, George Washington \nCarver said: ``I wanted to know the name of every stone and flower and \ninsect and bird and beast. I wanted to know where it got its color, \nwhere it got its life--but there was no one to tell me.'' He added \nthat: ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out \nof it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for \nhaving passed through it.'' This issue will be a test of our collective \nvision, discipline, and courage.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record materials from President Clinton, \nPresident Carter, Drs. Prakash and McGlaughlin, New Scientist, and the \n500 scientists' letter.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Jan. 20, 2000]\n\n                   National Biotechnology Month, 2000\n\n   (By the President of the United States of America--A Proclamation)\n\n       As we stand at the dawn of a new century, we recognize the \n     enormous potential that biotechnology holds for improving the \n     quality of life here in the United States and around the \n     world. These technologies, which draw on our understanding of \n     the life sciences to develop products and solve problems, are \n     progressing at an exponential rate and promise to make \n     unprecedented contributions to public health and safety, a \n     cleaner environment, and prosperity.\n       Today, a third of all new medicines in development are \n     based on biotechnology. Designed to attack the underlying \n     cause of an illness, not just its symptoms, these medicines \n     have tremendous potential to provide not only more effective \n     treatments, but also cures.

Bioremediation \n     technologies are cleaning our environment by removing toxic \n     substances from contaminated soils and ground water. \n     Agricultural biotechnology reduces our dependence on \n     pesticides. Manufacturing processes based on biotechnology \n     make it possible to produce paper and chemical with less \n     energy, less pollution, and less waste. Forensic technologies \n     based on our growing knowledge of DNA help us exonerate the \n     innocent and bring criminals to justice.\n       The biotechnology industry is also improving lives through \n     its substantial economic impact. Biotechnology has stimulated \n     the creation and growth of small businesses, generated new \n     jobs, and encouraged agricultural and industrial innovation. \n     The industry currently employs more than 150,000 people and \n     invests nearly $10 billion a year on research and \n     development.\n       Recognizing the extraordinary promise and benefits of this \n     enterprise, my Administration has pursued policies to foster \n     biotechnology innovations as expeditiously and prudently as \n     possible. We have supported steady increases in funding for \n     basic scientific research at the National Institutes of \n     Health and other science agencies; accelerated the process \n     for approving new medicines to make them available as quickly \n     and safely as possible; encouraged private-sector research \n     investment and small business development through tax \n     incentives and the Small Business Innovation Research \n     program; promoted intellectual property protection and open \n     international markets for biotechnology inventions and \n     products; and developed public databases that enable \n     scientists to coordinate their efforts in an enterprise that \n     has become one of the world's finest examples of partnership \n     among university-based researchers, government, and private \n     industry.\n       Remarkable as its achievements have been, the biotechnology \n     enterprise is still in its infancy. We will reap even greater \n     benefits as long as we sustain the intellectual partnership \n     and public confidence that have moved biotechnology forward \n     thus far. We must strengthen our efforts to improve science \n     education for all Americans and preserve and promote the \n     freedom of scientific inquiry. We must protect patients from \n     the misuse or abuse of sensitive medical information and \n     provide Federal regulatory agencies with sufficient resources \n     to maintain sound, science-based review and regulation of \n     biotechnology products. And we must strive to ensure that \n     science-based regulatory program worldwide promote public \n     safety, earn public confidence, and guarantee fair and open \n     international markets.\n       Now, therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the \n     United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested \n     in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do \n     hereby proclaim January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month. \n     I call upon the people of the United States to observe this \n     month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n       In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this \n     nineteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two \n     thousand, and of the Independence of the United States of \n     America the two hundred and twenty-fourth.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 26, 1998]\n\n                  Who's Afraid of Genetic Engineering?\n\n                           (By Jimmy Carter)\n\n       Imagine a country placing such rigid restrictions on \n     imports that people could not get vaccines and insulin. And \n     imagine those same restrictions being placed on food products \n     as well as on laundry detergent and paper.\n       As far-fetched as it sounds, many developing countries and \n     some industrialized ones may do just that early next year. \n     They are being misled into thinking that genetically modified \n     organisms, everything from seeds to livestock, and products \n     made from them are potential threats to the public health and \n     the environment.\n       The new import proposals are being drafted under the \n     auspices of the biodiversity treaty, an agreement signed by \n     168 nations at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The \n     treaty's main goal is to protect plants and animals from \n     extinction.\n       In 1996, nations ratifying the treaty asked an ad hoc team \n     to determine whether genetically modified organisms could \n     threaten biodiversity. Under pressure from environmentalists, \n     and with no supporting data, the team decided that any such \n     organism could potentially eliminate native plants and \n     animals.\n       The team, whose members mainly come from environmental \n     agencies in more than 100 different governments, should \n     complete its work within six months and present its final \n     recommendation to all the nations (the United States is not \n     among them) that ratified the treaty. If approved, these \n     regulations would be included in a binding international \n     agreement early next year.\n       But the team has exceeded its mandate. Instead of limiting \n     the agreement to genetic modifications that might threaten \n     biodiversity, the members are also pushing to regulate \n     shipments of all genetically modified organisms and the \n     products made from them.\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n       This means that grain, fresh produce, vaccines, medicines, \n     breakfast cereals, wine, vitamins--the list is endless--would \n     require written approval by the importing nation before they \n     could leave the dock. This approval could take months. \n     Meanwhile, barge costs would mount and vaccines and food \n     would spoil.\n       How could regulations intended to protect species and \n     conserve their genes have gotten so far off track? The main \n     cause is anti-biotechnology environmental groups that \n     exaggerate the risks of genetically modified organisms and \n     ignore their benefits.\n       Anti-biotechnology activists argue that genetic engineering \n     is so new that its effects on the environment can't be \n     predicted. This is misleading. In fact, for hundreds of years \n     virtually all food has been improved genetically by plant \n     breeders. Genetically altered antibiotics, vaccines and \n     vitamins have improved our health, while enzyme-containing \n     detergents and oil-eating bacteria have helped to protect the \n     environment.\n       In the past 40 years, farmers worldwide have genetically \n     modified crops to be more nutritious as well as resistant to \n     insects, diseases and herbicides. Scientific techniques \n     developed in the 1980's and commonly referred to as genetic \n     engineering allow us to give plants additional useful genes. \n     Genetically engineered cotton, corn and soybean seeds became \n     available in the United States in 1996, including those \n     planted on my family farm. This growing season, more than \n     one-third of American soybeans and one-fourth of our corn \n     will be genetically modified. The number of acres devoted to \n     genetically engineered crops in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and \n     Australia increased tenfold from 1996 to 1997.\n       The risks of modern genetic engineering have been studied \n     by technical experts at the National Academy of Sciences and \n     World Bank. They concluded that we can predict the \n     environmental effects by reviewing past experiences with \n     those plants and animals produced through selective breeding. \n     None of these products of selective breeding have harmed \n     either the environment or biodiversity.\n       And their benefits are legion. By increasing crop yields, \n     genetically modified organisms reduce the constant need to \n     clear more land for growing food. Seeds designed to resist \n     drought and pests are especially useful in tropical \n     countries, where crop losses are often severe. Already, \n     scientists in industrialized nations are working with \n     individuals by developing countries to increase yields of \n     staple crops, to improve the quality of current exports and \n     to diversify economies by creating exports like genetically \n     improved palm oil, which may someday replace gasoline.\n       Other genetically modified organisms covered by the \n     proposed regulations are essential research tools in medical, \n     agricultural and environmental science.\n       If imports like these are regulated unnecessarily, the real \n     losers will be the developing nations. Instead of reaping the \n     benefits of decades of discovery and research, people from \n     Africa and Southeast Asia will remain prisoners of outdated \n     technology. Their countries could suffer greatly for years to \n     come. It is crucial that they reject the propaganda of \n     extremist groups before it is too late.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dec. 5, 1999]\n\n      Genetic Research: Foes of Biotechnology Ignore Global Hunger\n\n                           (By C.S. Prakash)\n\n       Anti-technology activists accuse corporations of ``playing \n     God'' by genetically improving crops, but it is these so-\n     called environmentalists who are really playing God, not with \n     genes but with the lives of poor and hungry people.\n       While activist organizations spend hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars to promote fear through anti-science newspaper ads, \n     1.3 billion people, who live on less than $1 a day, care only \n     about finding their next day's meal.

Public perception is \n     being manipulated by fringe groups opposed to progress and \n     taken advantage of by politicians favoring trade \n     protectionism.\n       There is no safety reason for this. Foods produced through \n     biotechnology are just as safe, if not safer, than \n     conventionally produced foods because they are rigorously \n     tested. David Aaron of the U.S. Commerce Department recently \n     told the Senate Finance Committee that ``13 years of U.S. \n     experience with biotech products have produced no evidence of \n     food safety risks; not one rash, not one cough, not one sore \n     throat, not one headache.''\n       More recently, a panel of entomology experts has questioned \n     the only seemingly legitimate environmental issue raised to \n     date--the alleged threat to Monarch butterflies.\n       Yet activists continue to look for a new cause, a new evil \n     in this technology. While these well-fed folks jet around the \n     world plotting ways to disrupt the technology, they cannot or \n     will not see the conditions of millions who are at grave risk \n     of starvation. Activists resist development of longer-lasting \n     fruits and vegetables, at the expense of Third World people \n     who have no refrigeration to preserve their foods.\n       Critics of biotechnology invoke the trite argument that the \n     shortage of food is caused by unequal distribution. There's \n     plenty of food, they declare, we just need to distribute it \n     evenly. That's like saying there is plenty of money in the \n     world so let's just solve the problem of poverty in Ethiopia \n     by redistributing the wealth of Switzerland (or maybe the \n     United Kingdom, where the heir to the throne is particularly \n     opposed to companies ``playing God'' with biotechnology).\n       The development of local and regional agriculture is the \n     key to addressing both hunger and low income. Genetically \n     improved food is ``scale neutral,'' in that a poor rice \n     farmer with one acre in Bangladesh can benefit as much as a \n     large farmer in California. And he doesn't have to learn a \n     sophisticated new system; he only has to plant a seed. New \n     rice strains being developed through biotechnology can \n     increase yields by 30 to 40 percent. Another rice strain has \n     the potential to prevent blindness in millions of children \n     whose diets are deficient in Vitamin A.\n       Edible vaccines, delivered in locally grown crops, could do \n     more to eliminate disease than the Red Cross, missionaries \n     and U.N. task forces combined, at a fraction of the cost.\n       These are some of the benefits that the Church of England \n     saw when church leaders recently issued a position statement \n     on ``playing God'' through biotechnology: ``Human discovery \n     and invention can be thought of as resulting from the \n     exercise of God-given powers of mind and reason; in this \n     respect, genetic engineering does not seem very different \n     from other forms of scientific advance.''\n       More recently, the Vatican director on bioethics, Bishop \n     Elio Sgreccia, criticized the ``catastrophic sensationalism \n     with which the press reports on biotechnology'' and he \n     rejected the ``idea of conceiving scientific progress as \n     something that should be feared.''\n       So, if scientists who are developing biotechnology are not \n     ``playing God'' in the eyes of these religious leaders, what \n     are we to think of self-appointed guardians who would deny \n     its benefits to those who need it most? We have the means to \n     end hunger on this planet and to feed the world's 6 billion--\n     or even 9 billion--people. For the well-fed to spearhead \n     fear-based campaigns and suppress research for ideological \n     and pseudo-science reasons is irresponsible and immoral.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 1, 1999]\n\n                        (By Martina McGloughlin)\n\n Commentary; Without Biotechnology, We'll Starve; Agriculture: Genetic \nEngineering Is Subject to More Safeguards Than Many Unaltered Foods We \n                                  Eat\n\n       I agree with Greenpeace that we need to feed and clothe the \n     world's people while minimizing the impact of agriculture on \n     the environment. But the human population continues to grow, \n     while arable land is a finite quantity. So unless we will \n     accept starvation or placing parks and the Amazon Basin under \n     the plow, there really is no alternative to applying \n     biotechnology to agriculture.\n       Today's biotechnology differs significantly from previous \n     agriculture technologies. Using genetic engineering, \n     scientists can enhance the nutritional content, vitamins, \n     minerals, antioxidants, texture, color, flavor, growing \n     season, yield, disease resistance and other properties of \n     production crops. Engineered microbes and enzymes produced \n     using recombinant DNA methods are used in many aspects of \n     food production. The cheese and bread you eat and the \n     detergent you use to clean your clothes all have used \n     engineered enzymes since the early part of this decade.\n       By reducing dependency on chemicals and tillage through the \n     development of natural fertilizers and of pest-resistant \n     plants, biotechnology has the potential to conserve natural \n     resources, prevent soil erosion and improve environmental \n     quality. Strains of microorganisms could increase the \n     efficiency, capacity and variety of waste treatment. \n     Bioprocessing using engineered microbes offers new ways to \n     use renewable resources for materials and fuel.\n       Biotechnology is, in fact, the low-risk alternative to \n     current practices. Take pest control. The economic and \n     environmental costs of using existing methods are well known. \n     But many of us are not aware of the potential costs of not \n     controlling pests. Not controlling fungal disease in plants, \n     for example, allows them to generate deadly toxins such as \n     aflatoxin and fumonisin, which have been found, among other \n     things, to cause brain tumors in horses and liver cancer in \n     children.\n       The most cost-effective and environmentally sound general \n     method for controlling pests and disease is the use of DNA. \n     This approach already has led to a reduction in the use of \n     sprayed chemical insecticides. According to the National \n     Agricultural Statistics Service, 2 million fewer pounds of \n     insecticide were used in 1998 to control bollworm\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\n     and budworm than were used in 1995, before ``Bt'' cotton was \n     introduced. And the Bt gene--introduced into the crop plant, \n     not sprayed into the atmosphere--is present in minute amounts \n     and spares beneficial insects.\n       There is no evidence that recombinant DNA techniques or \n     rDNA-modified organisms pose any unique or unforeseen \n     environmental or health hazards. In fact, a National Research \n     Council study found that ``as the molecular methods are more \n     specific, users of these methods will be more certain about \n     the traits they introduce into plants.'' Greater certainty \n     means greater precision and safety. The subtly altered \n     products on our plates have been put through more thorough \n     testing than any conventional food ever has been subjected \n     to. Many of our daily staples would be banned if subjected to \n     the same rigorous standards. Potatoes and tomatoes contain \n     toxic glycoalkaloids, which have been linked to spina bifida. \n     Kidney beans contain phytohaemagglutinin and are poisonous if \n     undercooked. Dozens of people die each year from cynaogenic \n     glycosides from peach seeds. Yet none of those are labled as \n     potentially dangerous.\n       Million of people have eaten the products of genetic \n     engineering and no adverse effects have been demonstrated. \n     The proper balance of safety testing between companies and \n     the government is a legitimate area for further debate. So \n     are environmental safeguards. But the purpose of such debate \n     should be to improve biotech research and enhance its \n     benefits to society, not stop it in its tracks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New Scientist, Dec. 25, 1999]\n\n                                Dr Truth\n\n                           (By Michael Bond)\n\n       You come from a family of loggers. How did they take to you \n     becoming an environmentalist?\n       My dad was one of our biggest supporters when we started \n     Greenpeace in the early 1970s. With the US nuclear tests in \n     Alaska there was a possibility that the hydrogen bombs would \n     trigger an earthquake that would, in turn, trigger a tsunami. \n     A very serious one during the Alaska earthquake of 1964 \n     severely affected by father's business. Environmentalism then \n     did not involve bashing loggers. We were concerned about all-\n     out nuclear war and it blows my mind sometimes to see the \n     movement behaving the same way about forestry that it did \n     about nuclear war. I think they've got their priorities a bit \n     mixed up.\n       What were those early days of Greenpeace like?\n       They were heady--there was huge camaraderie. We used to \n     sing all the time. We always had a couple of people with a \n     guitar. We were together for weeks on end on many of those \n     expeditions into the Pacific and out to Newfoundland. We \n     always had songs, such as: ``If mankind was created a step \n     below the angels, the whales I'm sure were somewhere in \n     between.'' They were wonderful songs. We really had a \n     wonderful time. We always thought that a revolution should be \n     a celebration. We tried to avoid the hair-shirt mentality \n     that tends to creep in with self-righteousness, dogmatism and \n     that short of thing.\n       As an ecologist with a PhD in the subject, were you a rare \n     breed in the organization?\n       I was somewhat rare and had to live with the fact \n     throughout my time in Greenpeace that there was a lot of \n     disrespect for my science. That is why they called me Dr \n     Truth. It was kind of a put-down.\n       As Greenpeace became bigger, richer and more famous did its \n     priorities or principles change?\n       The best thing is that Greenpeace has remained faithful to \n     the peaceful civil disobedience theme. In other words, the \n     ``peace'' in Greenpeace is still the main principle. I think \n     that's excellent. I do think though that they have \n     diversified into so many issues, many of which are \n     questionable in terms of priorities and some of which are \n     just plain wrong-headed. A case in point is GM foods. If they \n     are really so worried about human health, why don't they \n     tackle tobacco?\n       Few scientists become radical environmental activists. What \n     lit the spark with you?\n       It was partly my professors. The most important was \n     Vladimir Krajina, a Czech forest ecologist. I used to think \n     that science was just about technology. But after studying \n     with Krajina, the light suddenly went on and I realized that \n     the mystery of nature could be approached through science and \n     ecology. The political part came while I was writing my \n     thesis on pollution control in 1972. A very large copper-\n     mining project was applying to dump its tailings into the \n     sea. It was very close to my boyhood home at Winter Harbour \n     in Vancouver Island, Canada. I chose to study not just the \n     environmental impact of the tailings disposal, but the system \n     that granted permits for the process. I soon learned that \n     this was immune to truth.\n       Why after 15 years of activism did you start to become \n     disenchanted with the environmental movement?\n       Partly it was the fact that foot soldiers often become \n     diplomats. I don't think anybody should be required to be in \n     confrontational environmental politics for their whole lives, \n     especially when they start a family. But it was partly the \n     movement's refusal to evolve. I'm in favour of civil \n     disobedience in order to bring about justice where something \n     really bad is going on such as nuclear testing or toxic \n     dumping. But I'm a Gandhian through and through--I believe \n     that peaceful civil disobedience and passive resistance \n     movements are great shapers of social change. But when \n     industry and government agree that the environment needs to \n     be taken into account in policy making, and when there are \n     ministries and vice-presidents of the environment, it seems \n     to me it would be a good idea to work with them. When a \n     majority of people decide to agree with you, it is time to \n     stop hitting them over the head.\n       How has the environmental movement got it so wrong?\n       The environmental movement abandoned science and logic \n     somewhere in the mid-1980s, just as mainstream society was \n     adopting all the more reasonable items on the environmental \n     agenda. This was because many environmentalists couldn't make \n     the transition from confrontation to consensus, and could not \n     get out of adversarial politics. This particularly applies to \n     political activists who were using environmental rhetoric to \n     cover up agendas that had more to do with class warfare and \n     anti-corporatism than they did with the actual science of the \n     environment. To stay in an adversarial role, those people had \n     to adopt ever more extreme positions because all the \n     reasonable ones were being accepted.\n       But hasn't environmentalism always been about opposing the \n     establishment?\n       Environmentalism was always anti-establishment, but in the \n     early days of Greenpeace we did not characterize ourselves as \n     left wing. That happened after the fall of the Berlin wall \n     when a whole bunch of left wing activists, who no longer had \n     any role in the peace, women's or labour movements, joined \n     us. I would go to the Greenpeace Toronto office and there \n     would be an awful lot of young people wearing army fatigues \n     and red berets in there.\n       Environmentalists recoil with horror when they hear you say \n     that harvesting trees for paper or fuel benefits plants and \n     wildlife. What's your evidence?\n       The environmental movement is essentially anti-forestry. \n     Young people are being convinced to stop using trees to make \n     paper and use environmentally appropriate alternative fibres, \n     such as hemp and cotton. Now where are you going to grow \n     those exotic farm crops? You are going to grow them where you \n     have been growing trees for 20 years, where an environment \n     exists for bugs, birds, squirrels and other wildlife. That \n     environment will be destroyed if you clear a forest to grow a \n     farm crop.\n       Does this mean that even clear-cutting is not as damaging \n     as we've been led to believe?\n       Forests are resilient. They can grow back from total \n     volcanic destruction, ice ages, fires, storms, whatever. You \n     can take heavy equipment and bulldoze the soil right down to \n     bedrock over a huge area, and if you go away and come back \n     100 years later you will have a new forest starting to grow \n     back. Just logging the trees is not going to irreversibly \n     destroy the ecosystem. In addition, I believe it is possible \n     to sustain the biodiversity of a forest while removing large \n     quantities of timber.\n       Surely you're not saying that logging has no impact on \n     biodiversity?\n       Logging is never going to have zero impact. But its aim \n     should be to maintain viable populations of all those species \n     that were on that site to begin with. So you plan your \n     forestry in such a way to ensure that there is a suitable \n     habitat for every one of those species somewhere all of the \n     time. For example, when you clear-cut an area, you are going \n     to remove a lot of the shrubs, with means that shrub-nesting \n     birds not do well there for a while. But as long as you have \n     a place that was logged ten years ago somewhere hereby where \n     the shrub layer has been able to replace itself, the birds \n     will not mind if there are no trees.\n       Green groups ware that logging is threatening some animals \n     with extinction. Are you telling me they're wrong?\n       In 1996 the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that \n     50,000 species are going extinct each year due to human \n     activity. And the main cause, they said, is commercial \n     logging. The story was carried around the world, and hundreds \n     of millions of people cam to believe that forestry is the \n     main cause of species extinction. During the past three years \n     I've asked the WWF on many occasions to provide me with a \n     list of some of the species that have supposedly become \n     extinct due to logging. They have not offered up a single \n     example as evidence. In fact, to the best of our scientific \n     knowledge, no species has become extinct in North America due \n     to forestry.\n       You may disagree with the green groups, but would you still \n     describe yourself as an environmentalist?\n       James Lovelock is my hero and I believe in the Gaia \n     hypothesis that all life is one living breathing being, I \n     don't see any reason to damage it more than necessary. I \n     believe in gardening the Earth, but there should be lots of \n     places left wild. The ``hands off'' attitude doesn't work \n     with 6 billion humans needing things from Earth every day.\n       Why do you oppose the campaign against genetically modified \n     crops?\n       I believe we are entering an era now where pagan beliefs \n     and junk science are influencing public policy. GM foods and \n     forestry are both good examples where policy is being \n     influenced by arguments that have no basis in fact or logic. \n     Certainly, biotechnology needs to be done very carefully. But \n     GM crops are in the same category as oestrogen-mimicking \n     compounds and pesticide residues. They are seen as an \n     invisible force that will kill us all in our sleep or turn us \n     all into\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n     mutants. It is preying on people's fear of the unknown.\n       What does the future hold for the environmental movement?\n       We need to get out of the adversarial approach. People who \n     base their opinion on science and reason and who are \n     politically centrist need to take the movement back from the \n     extremists who have hijacked it, often to further agendas \n     that have nothing to do with ecology. It is important to \n     remember that the environmental movement is only 30 years \n     old. All movements to go through some mucky periods. But \n     environmentalism has become codified to such an extent that \n     if you disagree with a single word, then you are apparently \n     not an environmentalist. Rational discord is being \n     discouraged. It has too many of the hallmarks of the Hitler \n     youth, or the religious right.\n                                  ____\n\n       Crops modified by molecular and cellular methods should \n     pose risks no different from those modified by classical \n     genetic methods for similar traits. As the molecular methods \n     are more specific, users of these methods will be more \n     certain about the traits they introduce into plants.--\n     National Research Council.\n       America leads the world in agricultural products developed \n     with biotechnology.

We also \n     strongly advocate the use of sound science as the basis for \n     regulatory and political decisions pertaining to \n     biotechnology.\n       Biotechnology for agriculture and the food industry is \n     offering remarkable innovations--providing new tools for \n     growth and development. Biotechnology has a long history of \n     development. Its early applications produced better quality \n     medicines and improved industrial products. Recently, \n     products have been developed that allow farmers to reduce \n     their input costs and increase yields while providing \n     environmental benefits. In the near future, an ever-\n     increasing number and variety of crops with traits beneficial \n     to consumers will reach the market. Such traits will include \n     improved nutritional values, healthier oils, increased \n     vitamin content, better flavor, and longer shelf life.\n       The ultimate beneficiaries of technological innovation have \n     always been consumers, both in the United States and aboard. \n     In developing countries, biotechnological advances will \n     provide means to overcome vitamin deficiencies, to supply \n     vaccines for killer diseases like cholera and malaria, to \n     increase production and protect fragile natural resources, \n     and to grow crops under normally unfavorable conditions.\n       We recognize that no technology is without risks. At the \n     same time, we have confidence in the current U.S. regulatory \n     system provided by the USDA, EPA, and FDA. The U.S. system \n     has worked well and continues to evolve as scientific \n     advancements are achieved.\n       Considering the tremendous potential of this technology, we \n     urge policy makers to base their decisions on sound \n     scientific evidence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S63-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S63]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2651 and 2517, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will comment briefly about two trips \nI made over the recess.\n  On December 17, 18, and 19, I traveled to Key West, FL, to observe \nCoast Guard operations and drug interdiction, and then on to Panama to \nsee the immediate impact of the turnover of the canal to the Panamanian \nGovernment, and then on to Colombia, where I had an opportunity to \nvisit with\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\nPresident Pastrana. President Pastrana, coincidentally, was in \nWashington today and met with members of the Appropriations Committee. \nThe text that I will submit contains a number of comments about the \ntrip to both Key West and Panama.\n  I did want to make a comment or two about the pending request by the \nGovernment of Colombia for funding in excess of $1 billion to fight the \nnarcotics dealers in Colombia. I am sympathetic with their problems and \nwith the grave difficulties they have encountered. I have seen these \ndifficulties firsthand on three visits to Colombia, the first back in \n1988.\n  I have substantial reservations about a U.S. expenditure in excess of \n$1 billion to reduce the supply of narcotics into the United States. I \nfiled a resolution years ago calling for the use of the military in \ndrug curtailment and narcotic interdiction--but as successful as we \nhave been in interdicting narcotics from Latin America and as \nsuccessful as we have been in having hectares in Peru, Colombia or \nBolivia replaced with other crops, the great demand in the United \nStates and worldwide continues, and thus the supply comes back.\n  The U.S. Government spends approximately $18 billion a year on drug \ncontrol. Two-thirds of that, or about $12 billion, is directed to \nactivities such as interdiction and to fighting street crime in the \nUnited States. I do believe that our effort against drug selling on the \nstreets of American cities and America's farms and rural areas has to \ncontinue, as I did when I was district attorney of Philadelphia. But \nthe regrettable fact is that as long as the demand for drugs exists, \nthe supply will continue, and if not from Colombia, from somewhere \nelse. Even as many drug dealers are put in jail, as long as it is \nprofitable, more drug dealers come to the street corners to sell drugs. \nSo I make this cautionary comment about additional heavy investments in \ntrying to stop the supply of drugs until we spend more money on \neducation and more money on rehabilitation.\n  From January 4 until January 13, in the company of six other \nSenators, I traveled to Morocco, and then on to Naples, and then to \nKosovo, and five Senators continued on to Tunisia and then on to \nIsrael. That trip was very significant in finding very strong support \nand allies from the Governments of Morocco and Tunisia and seeing the \noperation of the NATO Southern Command and our strong 6th Fleet. In \nKosovo, we saw the superb performance of our American military, where \nthey have moved into a land and have constructed a military base \novernight and are doing so much to try to maintain the peace in that \nvery troubled country. My floor statement will recite in detail the \nfindings in Kosovo, Morocco, Tunisia, and Italy.\n  A word or two about our trip to Israel where we visited the Golan \nHeights. We had an opportunity to visit with Israeli officials--with \nPrime Minister Barak, and with Ariel Sharon who leads the Likud and the \nopposition.\n  I compliment both the Israelis and the Syrians for moving ahead on \nthe peace process. It is my hope the process will reach fruition.\n  My own view, after having visited Syria on a number of occasions \nsince 1984, and having seen a decisive shift in the attitude of the \nleadership of the Government of Syria in the intervening 15-16 years, \nthe prospects for an agreement are reasonably good. We heard a great \ndeal of talk about very substantial funding by the United States. I \nthink it is important where an agreement is reached, which is a costly \nagreement, that the expenses be shared by the western European nations, \nby Japan, and by the oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf, and that \nthe astronomical figures not be cited broadly, which makes it more \ncomplex when the matters reach the Congress for consideration of these \nimportant funding matters.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment further about a recent visit I \nmade to Key West, FL, Panama, and Colombia from December 17-19, 1999, \nin order to gain a firsthand view on matters of concern to both my \nconstituents in Pennsylvania and all citizens of the United States.\n  I departed Andrews Air Force Base on the morning of December 17, \n1999, and arrived at Key West Naval Air Station where I proceeded to \nthe Coast Guard Group Key West. I was met by Captain Rudolph, the \ncommanding officer of Group Key West and was given an operations \nbriefing from Lieutenant Commander Woodring. The briefing detailed the \nmission of Group Key West in such activities as drug interdiction, \nmigrant operations, and search and rescue. Following the briefing, I \nboarded the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter (USCGS) Monhegan where the \nCommanding Officer, Lieutenant Benjamin A. Cooper, and his crew, gave \nme a briefing of their mission. They discussed how their ability to \napprehend drug smugglers could be enhanced by virtue of the Coast \nGuard's new use of armed helicopters, which the Coast Guard considers \nto be their most potent aid in capturing drug traffickers.\n  I informed the crew of the Monhegan that I had been one of the \noriginal cosponsors of S. 2728 in 1990, a measure which clarified and \nexpanded the authority of the armed forces to provide support for \ncivilian law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, this legislation \nauthorized the use of military aircraft for transportation of, and \nflight training for, civilian law enforcement personnel and for aerial \nsurveillance. According to the crew, the speed of the drug traffickers \nboats, known as ``go fast boats,'' has hampered their ability to get \nnear the smugglers. The armed helicopters are one of their best weapons \nin chasing ``go-fast boats,'' in their drug interdiction mission. \nFollowing my review of the Monhegan, I was given a tour of the USCG \nCutter Thetis by Commander Finch. I found Commander Finch to be an \nimpressive officer who was forthright in this opinions of the military \nand its various functions. The role of the USCG Cutter Thetis is \nmaritime law enforcement and search and rescue that uses electronic \nsensors and computerized command and control systems. The crew of the \ncutter Thetis was warm and friendly and we engaged in conversation over \nsuch issues as the role of gays in the Coast Guard, integrated gender \ntraining, and women's service aboard ships. I was pleased by the open \nexchange among the crew, and I was gratified to find that several of \nthem were Pennsylvanians.\n  Upon leaving the cutter Thetis, I proceeded to the Joint Interagency \nTask Force (JIATF)-East which was formed as the umbrella organization \nto coordinate interdiction of illicit drugs in the Caribbean Basin. I \nwas met by Rear Admiral Edward J. Barrett, Director of JIATF-East, who \ngave me a tour and introduced me to his staff who provided me a \nclassified briefing on the threats faced by JIATF-East. Following the \nbriefing, I was accompanied by Admiral Barrett and Captain Frank Klein, \nDirector of Operations, on a tour of the classified Joint Operations \nCommand Center (JOCC).\n  The following day, December 18, 1999, I traveled to Colombia. I \narrived in Bogota in the early afternoon and was met by the Deputy \nChief of Mission, Barbara Moore and immediately proceeded to the United \nStates Embassy in Bogota for a classified country team briefing on the \ncurrent political situation in the country. The briefing focused on \nnarcotics trafficking, violence among the FARC and ELN and the current \ndiscussions between the Colombian Government and the guerrilla groups. \nWe also discussed Colombia's extradition of narcotic traffickers and \nthe resulting violence from such action. I asked the group about \nthe cultivation of cocoa and poppy crops and the forcible eradication \nof the supply of narcotics. I was informed that the decreased \npercentages in cultivation of narcotic crops in Bolivia and Peru were \noffset by an increase in Colombia. I was told that Bolivia had \ndecreased 28 percent in narcotic crop production and Peru had seen an \naverage decrease of 50 percent in cultivation. I inquired about the \ncurrent Colombian economy and was told that the economy was at rock \nbottom and that Colombia was currently enduring the highest \nunemployment rate in Latin America. However, those present felt that \nthe current policies of President Pastrana were good and sound. I then \ninquired about the Colombian military and its need for United States \nassistance. The group felt that the lack of a military dictator in \nColombia, unlike other Latin American countries, has a positive effect \non the military, which currently consist of 120,000 soldiers. \nFurthermore, I\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\nasked about the United States involvement in training of the Colombian \nmilitary and I was assured that United States soldiers were not \ninvolved in any level of combat between the Colombian guerrilla groups.\n\n  Following this briefing, I proceeded with Deputy Chief Moore to the \nPresidential Palace to meet with President Pastrana. I was welcomed \ninto the President's private office. He had just arrived at the palace \nfrom his son's 17th birthday party. President Pastrana is an impressive \nindividual with an initial career as a journalist and his service as \nthe mayor of Bogota. He was elected president in March 1998. I informed \nthe President that I had watched his interview on the television show \n``60 Minutes'' with Mike Wallace and was impressed with the way he \nhandled himself. I informed him that Mike Wallace had done a ``60 \nMinutes'' report on prisons in the city of Philadelphia while I served \nas the city's district attorney. He mentioned that his interview with \nMike Wallace was broadcast over C-SPAN and was seen by 60 million \npeople. I commented on how far Mike Wallace and ``60 Minutes'' had come \nsince then. We discussed his statements on his ``60 Minutes'' interview \nabout the U.S. demand for drugs, which I agreed with. President \nPastrana stated that while the supply of narcotics from Colombia may \ndecrease the total supply from elsewhere will remain the same if the \nUnited States demand remains the same. He felt that the United States \nhas not done enough to decrease the demand for illicit drugs and I \nagreed with him. I assured him that I was committed to searching for \nways through legislation to curb the demand for drugs in the United \nStates.\n  Our conversation moved on to the peace process between the Colombian \nGovernment and the guerilla group known as the Fuerzas Armadas \nRevolucionarias de Colombian (FARC). According to President Pastrana, \nhe recently introduced the idea of a peace process as a form of \ndialogue between both the government and the FARC because he firmly \nbelieves that people of Colombia want peace. President Pastrana assured \nme that both he and the FARC were committed to peace in Colombia but it \nwill take time and compromise. I also inquired about the Colombian \nJudiciary system and the bombing of the Colombian Supreme Court. \nPresident Pastrana explained the problems associated with a judiciary \nthat fears violence after extraditing a drug lord. However, the \nPresident explained that he has conveyed to his people and the \nguerrilla groups that he will continue to extradite convicted drug \nlords regardless of the threats of violence.\n  President Pastrana and I discussed the situation regarding the ``New \nTribes Mission''. He explained that while the government has \naggressively searched and investigated this kidnaping, he has been \nunable to locate the missionaries. The only lead in the case was from a \nsource who told the investigators that he knew that the Americans had \nbeen killed, who did it, and that he knew where they were buried. I \nexplained to President Pastrana the great importance of this case, not \nonly to myself, but to the people of Pennsylvania and of course to the \nfamilies of those kidnaped. President Pastrana assured me that he would \ndo everything in his power to bring these criminals to justice and to \nbring a conclusion to this case.\n\n  After the meeting I departed for the Bogota air terminal where I was \nmet by Agent Jose Rodriguez and Manuel ``Cookie'' Aponte, both FBI \nSpecial Agents stationed in Colombia. The Special Agents are both \ncurrently working on the New Tribes Mission cases and they explained \nthat the source that had been referred to by President Pastrana had \nindeed come forward in October of this year and was considered to be a \nFARC defector. Special agent Rodriguez explained that the source had \nstated that he knew where the Americans were buried and could identify \nthe exact location. When the source was taken by investigators to the \narea that he had earlier identified, he informed them it was the wrong \nlocation. However, he was able to lead the team to another location \ndown river. When the investigative team located the place he described, \nno bodies were recovered, Special Agent Rodriguez explained that the \nbodies could have been washed away because of the proximity to the \nriver. I asked the Special Agents what was currently being done and how \nclose they felt they were to a resolution to this case. Special Agent \nRodriguez said that they needed to give a polygraph to the source in \norder to ascertain if he knows who kidnaped the Americans, if they were \nalive or have been killed, and if so, who is responsible. According to \nthe agents, they were waiting for a response from the source and they \nwill continue to work to bring about a resolution to this case.\n  When I arrived in Panama in the evening of the December 18, 1999, I \nwas met by Mr. Robert J. Bolhm and Mr. Frederick A. Becker, the \nMinister Consejero for the United States Embassy to Panama. I then \nattend a country team meeting with representatives of the Department of \nDefense. I asked this group several questions in regard to the \ntransition of the Panama Canal and national security. I expressed my \nconcern, and that of my constituents in Pennsylvania, about the use of \nports along the Panama Canal that are operated by a Chinese owned \ncompany, Hutchison Whampoa. I was informed that the operation of a port \narea by one of its companies does not present a national security risk, \nand assured me that our national security interests were fully \nprotected. I then inquired about the drug issue and asked if there was \nany light at the end of the tunnel. Representatives from DEA shared my \nconcerns about drug trafficking and agreed with my previous statements \nabout the need to stem the U.S. demand for narcotics. Finally, I asked \nthe group about the structure of the Panama Canal Authority, Panama \nCanal Commission, The Maritime Authority, and the Port Authority and \ntheir effects on the United States. Mr. Becker felt that the two \nbiggest problems facing the management structure of the canal were \npossible corruption within the leadership and general maintenance of \nthe canal.\n  On the morning of December 19, 1999, I visited the Panama Canal and \nwas met by Joseph W. Cornelison, the Deputy Administrator of the Panama \nCanal Commission. I was given a briefing and posed several questions to \nhim. I first asked about the involvement of the Chinese company of \nHutchison International Port Holdings, which operates two ports in the \nregion, I relayed the concerns that my constituents in Pennsylvania \nhave about U.S. national security and was assured by the Deputy \nAdministrator that these ports operate similarly to warehouses and are \nmerely for loading and unloading cargo. Furthermore, he explained that \nof the six ports which existed along the canal, only two were operated \nby Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong based company. I then asked the \nDeputy Administrator what guidelines are being used in regards to U.S. \ninvolvement in the protection of the canal. He explained that under the \nscope of the neutrality treaty, there would be joint U.S. and \nPanamanian involvement in order to allow the United States to protect \nits national security interests. I then asked if there were ever talks \nin the 1970's of the United States selling the Panama Canal to Panama. \nThe Deputy Administrator said that he was not aware of any such \ndiscussions. I also inquired about the structure of the canal and its \ngoverning body. The Deputy Administrator confirmed that there were 11 \nmembers of the Panama Canal Commission and that they served in \nstaggered terms. However, the Panama Canal Authority replaced the \nCommission on January 1, 2000; its members were appointed by the \nPresident of Panama and confirmed by the legislature. My questions then \nmoved to that of finances and economic competition for the canal. The \nDeputy Administrator explained that the canal was profit driven from \nfees that are charged for usage based on weight of cargo. The Deputy \nAdministrator explained that in FY99 the canal broke even financially. \nFinally, I was given a tour of the Panama Canal and shown some of the \nlock systems. The Deputy Administrator showed me examples of the older \nfunctioning system and their newer system. He further explained that \nthe canal would use $200 million in maintenance and modernization in \nthe future.\n\n  Mr. President this concludes the summary of my trip to Key West \nFlorida, Colombia, and Panama.\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n  Mr. President, over the recess, from January 4 through January 13, I \naccompanied Senator Stevens and several other of my colleagues on an \noverseas trip with our primary focus on matters relating to \nappropriations.\n  Our first stop was Rabat, Morocco. Morocco is one of the United \nStates' oldest allies, first recognizing our fledgling nation in 1787 \nby entering into a treaty of friendship. Initially we received a \ncountry team briefing from our very capable Ambassador Ed Gabriel and \nhis staff. Ambassador Gabriel showed us a copy of a letter he has in \nhis office from George Washington, thanking the King of Morocco for his \nsupport of our nascent American nation. President Washington's letter \nstated that although the United States was still struggling and had \nlittle to offer to the great Kingdom of Morocco, he hoped that in the \nfuture America would grow and prosper so that some day the United \nStates could assist Morocco. Following the country team briefing, we \nmet with Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa.\n  Prior to his appointment as Foreign Minister, Mr. Benaissa was posted \nin Washington, DC, as the Moroccan Ambassador. The Foreign Minister \nstated that the only problem with United States-Moroccan relations was \nthat there was no problem. The Foreign Minister was enthusiastic about \nthe Eizenstat Initiative named for Undersecretary of State Stuart \nEizenstat. This initiative, proposed in 1998, is intended to support \nsustainable economic growth and development in North Africa by \nencouraging investment and trade with the United States and by reducing \ninternal barriers to trade in the region.\n  The primary internal obstacle Morocco must address before the country \ncan make any serious economic progress is illiteracy. It was reported \nthat roughly 50 percent of Moroccans  are illiterate. My colleague, \nSenator Hollings, stated that when he visited Morocco in 1972 with \nSenator Mansfield he was quoted the same statistic by the government. \nMr. President, it has been said that ``knowledge is power.'' Since a \nlarge segment of the Moroccan population cannot read they subsequently \ncannot access any basic, let alone, advanced, education or training. In \na world that is increasingly shrinking because of the advent of \nelectronic commerce and the Internet, Moroccan's must improve on one of \nthe most basic of skills--the ability to read--before they are further \neclipsed by others in the fast paced global economy.\n\n  After our meeting with the Foreign Minister, we visited the mausoleum \nof Mohamed V and Hassan II and honored the memory of those kings by \nplacing a wreath at their tombs. Later that evening we dined at the \nAmbassador's home with the Foreign Minister, as well as Mr. Jalal \nEssaid, President of the Chamber of Councilors, the upper body of the \nMoroccan Parliament and Mr. Abdelwahad Radi, President of the Chamber \nof Representatives, the lower body in the Parliament.\n  The next day we visited with Morocco's King Mohamed VI who ascended \nto the throne recently with the passing of his father Hassan II. Over \nthe course of his life, King Hassan II had established himself as a \nmoderate leader who was willing to work for peace in the region. King \nHassan II played a key role in fostering the Egyptian-Israel contacts \nthat led to President Answar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977. In \n1993, after the signing of the Declaration of Principles between Israel \nand the Palestinians here in Washington, King Hassan hosted Prime \nMinister Rabin in Morocco as a demonstration of support for the \nagreement.\n  The next morning we traveled from Morocco to Naples, Italy. NATO is \ndivided into two commands and our initial stop was at one of those \ncommands, NATO's AFSOUTH Headquarters, where we received a current \noperations overview. We were hosted at AFSOUTH by Lieutenant General \nEfthymios Petinis of the Greek Army, Deputy Commander-in-Chief for NATO \nSouthern Command, by Lieutenant General Carlo Cabigiosu of the Italian \nArmy, Chief of Staff NATO Southern Command, and Lieutenant General Mike \nShort of the United States Air Force, Commander Air Forces for NATO \nSouthern Command. General Short's briefing was of specific interest to \nour group as he reviewed with us the decreased level of U.S. air assets \ncommitted to NATO which are engaged in the ongoing situation in Kosovo. \nGeneral Short informed us that during the height of the air war in \nKosovo hundreds of U.S. aircraft were on station flying missions, and \nnow only 6 U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters, which were permanently \nstationed in Italy, were supporting the current NATO mission over \nKosovo.\n  For our next meeting we traveled by helicopter to Gaeta, home of the \nU.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet. We were met by Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander \nU.S. Sixth Fleet who gave us a brief tour of the naval facilities at \nGaeta and then provided a demonstration of a Tomahawk Land Attack \nMissile (T-LAM) target work-up and strike. Admiral Murphy briefed us on \nthe wide range of missions the 16 ships and 7,200 sailors and marines \nare called upon to undertake in the region from a Tomahawk strike in \nKosovo to an Ambassadorial evacuation and Embassy protection in Albania \nand Macedonia. We discussed the situation regarding Vieques Island with \nAdmiral Murphy. He told our group that the lack of training was having \na deleterious affect on combat readiness and that the current battle \ngroup deployed in the Mediterranean had to get under way without the \ntraditional combined arms live fire exercises and gunnery. We discussed \npossible alternatives to Vieques. However, Admiral Murphy stated that \nnone of the current options satisfy the Navy's critical need to live \nfire and conduct operations like the Vieques range does. Admiral Murphy \nalso discussed the proposed International Criminal Court and the impact \nit would have on the Sailors and Marines under his charge. Both Admiral \nMurphy and his aide, Captain Jan Colin, responded negatively. Admiral \nMurphy recounted a recent situation which such a body might be called \nto act upon. He explained that after ordering a carefully planned and \nexecuted Tomahawk strike of the Serbian MUP police headquarters, the \ninitial reconnaissance photographs pictures burning civilian homes and \nstores around the MUP building but no damage to the MUP building \nitself. Admiral Murphy stated that at that point, despite meticulous \ntarget planning and diligent execution to insure no collateral damage, \nhe believed something had gone awry. He stated that he feared the \nmissile somehow missed the target and that he would now have to answer \nfor the errant missile despite everyone's best efforts to minimize \ncollateral damage. A short time later however, additional \nreconnaissance photographs became available which showed the MUP police \nthemselves actually setting fire to the civilian buildings around their \nheadquarters. Subsequent photos then confirmed that the MUP building \nhad been destroyed by the Tomahawk.\n\n  Captain Jan Colin, a Navy pilot, recounted his experience flying a \nbombing mission into Libya in 1986 to strike suspected international \nterrorist training camps. Captain Colin said that the Chief of Naval \nOperations at the time, Admiral Kelso, had subsequently been indicted \nfor war crimes by the Libyan government for ordering the strike. The \nhandful of military officers assembled for our briefing said that in \ntheir opinions the United States, as the only remaining military \nsuperpower operating in the world, was resented around the globe. They \nsaid that even if the resentment was not overt, it was lurking just \nbelow the surface. They felt that the International Criminal Court \nwould be too willing to participate in second guessing American \nmilitary decisions abroad and the rest of the world might too readily \naccept charges of American wrongdoing, justified or not, as a result of \nthe perceived American arrogance.\n  The next morning we departed for Skopje, Macedonia. We were met at \nthe Skopje airport by General Montgomery Meigs, Commanding General, \nU.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army and Brigadier General Ricardo \nSanchez, Commander U.S. Task Force Falcon headquartered at Camp \nBondsteel, Kosovo. We were scheduled to travel by helicopter to camp \nBondsteel however, because of the snow and fog, we could not fly and \ninstead traveled by vehicle for roughly two hours to reach our \ndestination. I had previously visited Camp Bondsteel this past August \nand the physical transformation was impressive. Hundreds of tents had \nbeen replaced by buildings and the soldiers\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\nnow had barracks, a mess hall, a phone center and physical fitness \nfacility.\n  General Sanchez presented our group with an operational overview of \nthe responsibilities of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division \n(Mechanized) in the Multinational Brigade East area of operations, \nwhich is roughly 19 miles wide by 50 miles long. General Sanchez told \nus that his unit's mission was to provide and maintain a safe and \nsecure environment and to assist in the responsible transition to \nappropriate civil organizations enabling KFOR forces to withdraw from \nKosovo. He told us that soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division perform \nroughly 1700 security patrols in the area during a typical week, staff \n48 checkpoints and guard 62 key facilities 24 hours a day 7 days a \nweek. Approximately 5,430 soldiers of the 8,240 total KFOR soldiers in \nKosovo are Americans, and many of those outstanding young men and woman \nare from Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, on December 16, 1999, a few weeks \nbefore our arrival, one of those young soldiers from Pennsylvania made \nthe ultimate sacrifice giving his life in the line of duty.\n  Staff Sergeant Joe Suponcic of Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania, one of \nAmerica's famous Green Beret's, was stationed at Camp Bondsteel. \nSergeant Suponcic was on a reconnaissance patrol in the Russian sector \nof Kosovo when his HUMVEE struck a land mine resulting in his death. I \nspoke with his Commander, Major Jim McAllister, a fellow Green Beret \nwho asked me to share with you what kind of soldier Sergeant Suponcic \nwas. Major McAllister told me that Sergeant Suponcic was a great young \nAmerican, who was ``motivated, he loved life, his family and the \nArmy.'' His fellow soldiers called him ``Super'', not just as an \nabbreviated version of his name Suponcic, but because he was a \n``Super'' soldier who was ``ecstatic'' to be a Sergeant in the elite \nspecial forces. Major McAllister told me the local villagers in and \naround Kamonica and Kololec, the area in which Sergeant Suponcic \nworked, loved him and had nick-named him ``Joey Blue Eyes.'' When they \nheard of his death, they brought flowers, gifts and condolences to the \ncamp. After we returned to America, I spoke with his mother to give my \ncondolences to the Suponcics personally and to share with them what I \nhad learned in Kosovo. Mrs. Suponcic was gracious and told me of her \nson's burial at Arlington National Cemetery on December 29, 1999. \nAmerica owes the Suponcics a great debt. His Mother Patricia and Father \nEdmund, his brother Brian and his sister Andrea should be proud of \ntheir son and brother. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln's words to a widow \nwho was believed to have lost five sons in the Civil War: How weak and \nfruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile the \nSuponcics from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot \nrefrain from tendering to them the consolation that may be found in the \nthanks of the Republic.\n  During my visit to Camp Bondsteel I also had the opportunity to have \nlunch and visit with some of the troops from Pennsylvania who currently \ncall Kosovo home: Second Lieutenant Amanda Belfron from Philadelphia; \nSergeant Glen Fryer of Jersey Shore, who was a high school classmate of \nStaff Sergeant Suponcic; Warrant Officer Christopher Frey of \nPittsburgh; Sergeant Keith Faust of Nazbrath; Warrant Officer Andrea \nCarlesi Ellonsburg of Ford City; Major McGinley of Conshohocken; \nLieutenant Colonel Duane Gapinski of Bernsville; and Lieutenant Colonel \nKevin Stramara of Schulykill Haven. All of those soldiers impressed me \nwith their dedication to duty and positive outlook on the tough mission \nthey perform. It is refreshing to be reminded of the high caliber of \nindividuals serving on the vanguard of freedom in our Armed Forces and \nI salute their service to our nation.\n  We departed Camp Bondsteel and headed to the former Serb town of \nUrosevac where we were met by Lieutenant Colonel Mike Ellerbe, the \nBattalion Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division's, 3rd Battalion, \n504th Parachute Infantry Regiment--The Blue Devils. Colonel Ellerbe's \nunit was assigned to provide security for the remaining Serbian \npopulation in this now Albanian dominated town. Prior to the conflict, \nUrosevac, a town of some 60,000, had a Serbian population of roughly \n6,000. Now there are 24 Serbians living in 9 homes being protected 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week by roughly 1,000 Paratroopers from the 82nd \nAirborne Division. Our stated objective in the town, I am told, is to \ninsure the safety of the few remaining Serbs and protect their property \nso that other former Serbian villagers will return. They are provided \nan armed escort by U.S. soldiers to the Serbian border so that they can \nshop and, upon completion, are escorted back home. Their homes are \nprotected around the clock by U.S. soldiers from being set ablaze by \nlocal Albanians. While there are many issues that can be debated \nregarding our presence in Kosovo, I do not believe anyone would argue \nwith me if I say that based upon what I saw in Kosovo the United States \nwill not be leaving anytime soon.\n\n  The next day we traveled to Tunisia which, like Morocco, is a long \nstanding ally of the United States signing it's first treaty in 1789. \nOur first stop in Tunisia was the U.S. North African Cemetery and \nMemorial in Carthage. The American military forces led by then-General \nEisenhower played a critical role in Operation Torch, the campaign that \nsucceeded in evicting General Rommel from Tunisia in May of 1943 and \nending the German occupation of North Africa. At the Cemetery there is \na very large mosaic map of the region depicting the major battles that \ntook place in North Africa. Senators Fritz Hollings and Ted Stevens, \nboth World War II veterans of North Africa, used the map to share with \nour group their stories of service in uniform on the continent. The \nCemetery is the final resting place for 2,841 of our country's military \ndead. At the Cemetery there is also a beautiful memorial commemorating \nthe 3,724 soldiers, sailors and airmen who gave their lives in Africa \nduring World War II but whose remains were never recovered. My \ncolleagues and I placed a wreath at the cemetery in honor of all those \nmemorialized there. The inscription at the cemetery entrance eloquently \nechoes my feelings on my visit that morning: ``Here we and all who \nshall hereafter live in freedom will be reminded that to these men and \ntheir comrades we owe a debt to be paid with grateful remembrance of \ntheir sacrifice and with the high resolve that the cause for which they \ndied shall live.''\n  After paying our respects at the cemetery, we had a working lunch and \ncountry team brief where we discussed the current economic, educational \nand political state in Tunisia. Ambassador Robin Raphael and I \ndiscussed the political situation in Libya. It was the Ambassador's \nimpression that U.S. policy regarding the Khadafi Regime was in fact \nworking, albeit slowly, and that she believed that if things continued \nto progress, Libya may well again join the community of nations. Later \nthat evening Ambassador Raphael hosted a reception at her home where we \nmet with various representatives from Tunisian business and government.\n  Our second day in Tunisia started by meeting with the Minister of \nForeign Affairs Habib Ben Yahia who is the former Tunisian Ambassador \nto the United States. The Foreign Minister, a very capable \nrepresentative of the Tunisian Government, discussed with us Tunisia's \nupcoming assignment on the United Nations Security Council. The Foreign \nMinister shared with us his recent discussion with Saddam Hussein where \nhe encouraged Saddam to cooperate more fully with the United Nations \nand it's weapons inspections program. The Foreign Minister recounted \nthat Saddam's future cooperation was doubtful as Saddam was convinced \nthat the West, via the U.N., was determined to destabilize and \n``Balkanize'' the nation of Iraq.\n  Following our meeting with the Foreign Minister we boarded Tunisian \nAir Force helicopters and were transported to the Tunisian air base of \nSidi Ahmed at Bizerte where we received briefings and demonstrations of \nthe operational capabilities of the 15th Air Groups F-5's. Following \nthe visit to the air base we moved to the nearby naval base where we \ntoured and were briefed aboard a naval oceanographic vessel that had \nbeen transferred by the U.S. to the Tunisian Navy. The military \npersonnel at both the air and naval facilities we visited demonstrated \na high degree of professionalism and competence. At the conclusion of \nour visit\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nto Bizerte, we once again boarded Tunisian Air Force helicopters and \nreturned to Tunis to meet with the Minister of Defense. Mr. Mohamed \nJegham, the Minister of Defense, told us that while Tunisia had good \nrelations with the other countries in the region, the continuing \nregional problems in Algeria and the Western Sahara were cause for some \nconcern. The Defense Minister told us that Libya was not a problem for \nTunisia because of Tunisias' long relationship with the country and \nwith Colonel Khadafi.\n\n  Following our meeting at the Defense Ministry we met with Tunisian \nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The President told us how he would \nlike to attract more investors and business from the United States. As \nin Morocco, the Eizenstat Initiative was a point for discussion and \nbecause of his country's stability, security and educational \nachievements, the President contended that Tunisia was the perfect \nlocation for foreign businesses looking to locate in Africa. On the \ntopic of Middle East peace, President Ben Ali concluded it was his \nsense that all parties to the negotiations were hopeful. President Ben \nAli, who has close ties to PLO Chairman Arafat because of Arafat's \nresidence in Tunis for 12 years, was of the opinion that the peace \nprocess needed to conclude soon as the aging Arafat and Syrian \nPresident Assad were perhaps the primary forces uniting and solidifying \nboth their peoples resolve in this matter. Following our meeting with \nthe President we met with Tunisian Parliamentarians at the Chamber of \nDeputies after which, the Minister of Foreign Affairs hosted us for a \nworking dinner.\n  The next morning we departed for Incirlik Air Base, Turkey to discuss \nthe situation in Turkey and to review to U.S. participation in \nOperation Northern Watch. Incirlik is home to the U.S. Air Force's 39th \nWing, which is comprised of roughly 1400 U.S. Air Force personnel. We \nwere met at the airfield by Brigadier General Bob Dulaney, U.S. Air \nForce Commander of the Combined Air Forces at Incirlik. General Dulaney \nand his staff provided us with an overview of the types of missions \nthat our outstanding pilots and aircrews were flying during Operation \nNorthern Watch. We were able to get a close look at the British Jaguar, \na tactical reconnaissance aircraft, as well as an American EA-6B, an \nelectronic warefare aircraft and an American F-16, an aircraft used in \nan air-to-air and air-ground combat role.\n  The allied pilots of Operation Northern Watch fly in the no-fly zone \nwhich was created in 1991 after the Gulf War to protect Iraqi Kurds. \nIraq has never accepted the validity of either the Northern no-fly zone \nor of the Southern no-fly zone, which was designed to protect Shiite \nMuslims in the South. Allied jets patrolled the zones virtually \nunmolested by Iraqi defenses for more than seven years. However, that \nsoon ended after the four day air offensive of Operation Desert Fox in \nDecember 1998, which was designed to punish the Iraqi government for \nrefusing to allow continued U.N. inspections of the Iraqi nuclear, \nbiological and chemical weapons programs. Iraq thereafter declared the \nflights of Northern and Southern Watch as violations of its sovereign \nair space. Now, virtually every patrol flown by allied pilots is \nchallenged by Iraqi anti aircraft artillery or surface-to-air missile \nfire.\n  Our next stop after Incirlik was Israel. When we left the U.S., Prime \nMinister Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister were in Shepardstown, West \nVirginia, discussing possible peace in the region. Upon our arrival in \nJerusalem we attended a working dinner hosted by Mr. Dan Meridor, a \nmember of the Knesset and the Chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs \nand Defense Committee. The next morning we had a working breakfast with \nAaron Miller, deputy to Ambassador Dennis Ross, who provided us with an \nupdate on the discussions in Shepardstown between Israel and Syria. \nAfter breakfast we boarded an Israeli Air Force helicopter at the \nKnesset and flew to Palmachim Air Base to review the progress of the \nIsraeli Arrow Missile Project which is designed to combat theater \nballistic missiles, such as the Scuds fired at Israel by Iraq during \nOperation Desert Storm.\n  We were joined by Major General Uzi Dayan, the Israeli Defense Force \nDeputy Chief of Staff and cousin of late Moshe Dayan, and once again \nboarded the helicopter for a flight to the Ben Tal overlook in the \nGolan Heights. At the Ben Tal overlook, General Dayan pointed out the \nplaces and towns in the valleys below where he fought the Syrians in \n1973 and explained to us the obvious strategic importance of the Golan. \nOur second stop in the Golan found us at Nimrod's Castle, where we were \nable to get a better view of the Jordan, Ammund, Wabadai and Haman \nRivers the four tributaries which flow into the Sea of Galilee and \nsupply Israel with 40% of it's water. Our final stop in the Golan was \nCarlucci Point named for former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. We \nwere met and briefed by the Commander of the Northern Command, Major \nGeneral Gaby Ashkenazi. From our vantage point General Ashkenzai \npointed out Southern Lebanon and a nearby Israeli town, which, because \nit's large size and close proximity to the Lebanese border, is the \nfrequent target of Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks.\n\n  We departed the Golan via helicopter and headed back to Jerusalem for \na meeting with Prime Minister Barak. The Prime Minister was in good \nspirits. He had just returned from Washington and the negotiations with \nthe Syrians only the night before. Prime Minister Barak reported that \nthe negotiations with the Syrians were progressing slowly. The primary \nconcerns of Israel during these talks, he explained, were security, \nearly warning, normalization of relations with Syria and water. Prime \nMinister Barak shared that the United States had prepared a document \nwhich outlined the concerns of both Syria and Israel. He told us the \ndocument was a useful tool as it put the otherwise abstract \nnegotiations in concrete terms. The Prime Minister thought that while \nthere was some movement in certain areas of the Syrian position, as \nnothing was final until the whole process was final, the movement may \nhave been simply a negotiating tactic. Prime Minister Barak was hopeful \nthat there would soon be peace discussions with Lebanon. He felt that \nsuch talks would encourage the people of Israel concerning Syria's \nposition and allow them to hope for a comprehensive regional peace.\n  As members of the Appropriations Committee, we discussed the cost of \npeace with Syria with the Prime Minister. My colleagues and I cautioned \nhim that the media was questioning us regarding the reports that the \nprice for such peace was going to be in the $10-60 billion range. We \ndiscussed the difficulty of finding consensus in Congress to fund the \nWye River Agreement and advised the Prime Minister to keep the Congress \ninformed as the process progressed. Prime Minister Barak told our group \nthat it was his hope that other countries, such as Japan and various \nother G-7 nations, would contribute to whatever sum eventually emerged. \nThe Prime Minister said that the Camp David Accord laid the cornerstone \nfor peace in the region, the Wye River Agreements built upon that \nfoundation, and he was now hopeful that the discussions with Syria \nwould produce the keystone which could be put in place to allow the \nfull weight of regional peace to come to rest.\n  Discussing other security issues in the region, the Prime Minister \ntold us that he is ``deeply disturbed'' by both Iran and Iraq's drive \nto acquire nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Barak told us that he \nbelieved that unless UNSCOM inspections begin again, Iraq would have \nnuclear weapons within 5-7 years and that Iran was similarly \npositioned.\n  The next morning our delegation had a working breakfast with Mr. \nAvraham Shohat, the Minister of Finance. Our discussion once again \nfocused on the cost of any peace with Syria. The Finance Minister, like \nPrime Minister Barak, was hopeful that other countries would contribute \nin addition to the United States. We departed later that morning from \nIsrael and returned to Andrews Air Force Base later that evening after \nnine long, but informative days abroad.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleague from Iowa for \nyielding the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n                      VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senators for \ntheir indulgence in permitting me to make this statement. I feel very \nstrongly about what I am about to say, and I wish to share some views \nwith my colleagues.\n  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to participate in a historic \nmission to the United Nations. It embraced a series of events, led by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nOn Friday, I was privileged to join the chairman and, the distinguished \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and other members of \nthe committee for this historic occasion. I appreciated very much the \nopportunity to join the Foreign Relations Committee. For it was the \nfirst time in history that the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee \nconducted a hearing out of Washington, DC. I think it was most \nappropriate that the hearing was conducted under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations. Our distinguished Ambassador to the United Nations, \nAmbassador Holbrooke, facilitated these series of meetings. I commend \nhim highly for his participation.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee events at the United Nations began on \nThursday afternoon when Chairman Helms became the first Member--very \ninteresting, Madam President--the first Member of the Congress of the \nUnited States to address the U.N. Security Council.\n  The chairman's statement to the Security Council was tough, but those \nof us who have known Senator Helms and who have had the privilege of \nworking with him through these many years know him to be a very tough \nand resolute and forthright man. He spoke with candor, but, in my view, \nhis statement was carefully measured. His objectives were constructive. \nIn my view, he accurately portrayed the concerns of many Americans with \nregard to the United Nations--an important organization.\n  As I said last Friday, to the Secretary General at lunch--I spoke \nagain to a large group of Ambassadors--and then in the course of the \nhearing, the world is dependent upon the existence of the United \nNations to bring member nations together, and to try to work on a \nvariety of problems throughout the world.\n  One of those problems of great concern to me is peacekeeping, which \nis becoming a greater and greater challenge. I do not in any way \ndisparage the U.N. We came as a group to constructively give our \nviewpoints and to indicate the willingness of those of us who came and \nothers to try to make the U.N. work more efficiently in the cause of \nworld peace and to lessen human suffering throughout the globe. But \nthat organization is in need of reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms' statement to the U.N. \nSecurity Council be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, as well as a brief description of the events at the United \nNations that the committee attended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a \nlook at this statement of the distinguished chairman. I will address \nmomentarily some troublesome criticism directed at Senator Helms. I put \nhis statement in the Record so all Americans can read it. Make up your \nmind for yourself with regard to the contents of his statement and the \nstatements of others at that historic meeting, because I think we have \nto join together to try to help the U.N. become a more efficient, \nconstructive organization.\n\n  I would like to also call the attention of my colleagues to the \nstatement made on Monday by the Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright. I \nquote that statement because I find it very troubling, and it prompts \nme to come to the floor today.\n  Secretary Albright said:\n\n       Let me be clear. Only the President and the executive \n     branch can speak for the United States.\n\n  I say to the Secretary, for whom I have a high, professional regard, \nand out of respect for the very important office which she holds: Madam \nSecretary, you are mistaken.\n  I will not deliver a speech on the formation of our Government, but \nit is so basic that the Founding Fathers created three independent \nbranches of government, coequal--I repeat: coequal--in authority. The \nPresident does not have sole authority in the area of foreign affairs.\n  I could go into detail regarding the checks and balances in the \nConstitution and specific reference to the responsibility of the \nCongress and those of the President, but clearly Congress, through its \nadvice and consent role, deals with treaties. A treaty cannot go \nforward without the advice and consent of the Senate. We have seen this \nmost recently with the comprehensive test ban treaty, a highly \ncontroversial treaty. No Ambassador can go forth from this land to \nrepresent this Nation without the advice and consent of the Senate, and \nno program initiated by a President requiring funding of taxpayer \ndollars can be implemented without the authorization of those funds by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  Madam Secretary, I say to you most respectfully: Reconsider that \nstatement. I urge you to revise, as we say in the Congress, that \nstatement in the context of the exact authority given by the \nConstitution to the Congress, and out of respect for the Members of the \nCongress who, Madam Secretary Albright, have respect for you and want \nto work with you, but not in the face of such a defiant proclamation as \nthat.\n  My primary purpose in attending the hearing at the United Nations \nlast Friday was to give my views on what I view as the tragic situation \ndeveloping in Bosnia and Kosovo. Together with my senior staff on the \ncommittee, Colonel Brownlee, Mrs. Ansley, and in the company of General \nClark, commander in chief of our forces in NATO, commander in chief of \nU.S. forces in Europe, and his deputy, Admiral Abbot, I toured both \nKosovo, Bosnia, and, indeed, spent time in Macedonia.\n  I am gravely concerned. I have had a long association, as have many \nMembers of this Chamber, with the conflicts in that troubled region. I \nwas the first Senator to go to Bosnia, in September of 1992, in the \nmiddle of the war, arriving in the historic city of Sarajevo and seeing \nfor myself the tragedy of war unfolding right before my eyes in the \nshelling of that city and the killing of innocent civilians. It was a \nvery dramatic experience for me.\n  It motivated me to dedicate much of my time since then to that \nconflict and to try to do what I could, together with others, to \nalleviate the human suffering. I am concerned that not enough is being \ndone in either Bosnia or Kosovo.\n  Let's look at a little history. Since NATO troops were first deployed \nto Bosnia in December of 1995, the United States has spent almost $10 \nbillion to support our military commitment of troops to that nation. We \nare but one of many nations committing troops and funds to Bosnia. In \naddition, we have spent an additional $5 billion in Kosovo for the air \ncampaign and the deployment of United States KFOR troops. Again, we are \none nation, with more than 30 other nations, contributing military \nforces. The price tag for these military commitments of U.S. troops is \nroughly $1.5 billion each year for Bosnia and $2 billion a year \nprojected for Kosovo. Those are very significant sums of money.\n  Apart from the significant sums of money is my concern for the safety \nand the welfare of the young men and women of the United States Armed \nForces and, indeed, those of other nations who every single day march \nthrough the frozen streets of Bosnia and Kosovo, subjecting themselves \nto risk. The fighting still goes on in small, largely ethnic, \nconflict--particularly in Kosovo. Our military personnel could be \ncaught in the crossfire tomorrow.\n  We experienced a tragic loss in Somalia--again, when the world had \ntaken its attention away from Somalia. We had the best of intentions \nwhen we went in to relieve the human suffering in that nation. Then we \ndrifted into nation building, and tragedy befell our Armed Forces in \nSomalia. A comparable tragedy could befall the Armed Forces of our \ncountry and those of other nations in either Bosnia or Kosovo tomorrow.\n  Why are our troops still in Bosnia over four years after they were \nfirst deployed? Why is no end in sight in Kosovo? The reason for that \nis that the\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nUnited Nations, together with other international organizations, are \nnot doing their job.\n  We went into these military operations in both Bosnia and Kosovo with \na clear understanding that if the troops performed their mission, which \nthey have done in both countries, then the United Nations and other \norganizations would take the necessary steps to rebuild Bosnia and \nKosovo--which is still not a sovereign nation, with no plans to make it \na sovereign nation at this time; it is part of Serbia. Nevertheless, \nthey would restore law and order and enable the people to live their \nlives in peace. The military has done their mission. The United Nations \nis failing.\n  In the course of the hearing we had in New York City, Ambassador \nHolbrooke, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, recounted how the \nUnited Nations had failed in its peacekeeping operations in Somalia, in \nRwanda, and other areas. He said we cannot fail again. The Presiding \nOfficer in the Chamber at this time was present during that hearing. He \nwill remember I said that the United Nations is on the brink of failure \nin both Bosnia and Kosovo unless the U.N. steps up the pace of the \nfulfillment of its obligations, together with organizations that \nlikewise have a commitment to provide an infrastructure of government \nand a rebuilding of the economy.\n  There have been positive actions; for instance, the recent elections \nin Croatia. Still, we are so far behind in the fulfillment of \ncommitments to rebuild civilian administrations in both Bosnia and \nKosovo. We have to move with swiftness. Otherwise, we are guilty of \nletting the men and women of our Armed Forces and other armed forces \ntake on jobs for which they were never trained but which they are \ncarrying out--jobs of being policemen, jobs of trying to bring some \ncivil structure of life to these little villages, all kinds of jobs for \nwhich they are not trained as military people, but to their credit they \nare carrying out well.\n  We have to keep the pressure on the U.N. and the other organizations \nto do their job. There has been much discussion that the U.N. should \ntake on enlarged obligations in Africa. We all recognize Africa is \ncrying out for help. It has a measure of human suffering almost beyond \ncomprehension. It has a measure of disease--primarily AIDS--beyond \nhuman comprehension. However, the problem is that until the U.N. can \nfirst fulfill its missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, I caution them not to \ntake on additional peacekeeping actions of the magnitude of those \ncontemplated for Africa. We have all been taught: Finish what you start \nbefore you take on a new task. I made those remarks, and I stand by \nthem.\n  In consultation with the members of the Armed Services Committee, I \nwill initiate a series of hearings to provide this Senate and others \nwith an up-to-date report on the situations in Bosnia and Kosovo. \nProudly, the first part of that report is that the military has done \nits job--the militaries of our Nation and other nations. Sadly, our \nreport will show that the United Nations is falling behind daily in \nfulfilling its commitments, together with other international \norganizations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n  Address by Senator Jesse Helms, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations, before the United Nations Security Council, January \n                                20, 2000\n\n       Mr. President, Distinguished Ambassadors, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen.\n       Thank you for your welcome this morning. It is an honor to \n     be here today, and to meet with you here in the Security \n     Council.\n       I understand that you have interpreters who translate the \n     proceedings of this body into a half dozen different \n     languages. It may be that they have an interesting challenge \n     today. As some of you may have detected, I don't have a \n     Yankee accent. I hope you have a translator here who can \n     speak Southern, someone who can translate words like \n     ``y'all'' and ``I do declare.''\n       It may be that one other language barrier will need to be \n     overcome this morning. I am not a diplomat, and as such, I am \n     not fully conversant with the elegant and rarefied language \n     of the diplomatic trade. I am an elected official, with \n     something of a reputation for saying what I mean and meaning \n     what I say. So I trust you will forgive me if I come across \n     as a bit more blunt than those you are accustomed to hearing \n     in this chamber.\n       I am told that this is the first time that a United States \n     Senator has addressed the United Nations Security Council. I \n     sincerely hope it will not be the last. It is important that \n     this body have greater contact with the elected \n     representatives of the American people, and that we have \n     greater contact with you.\n       In this spirit, tomorrow I will be joined here at the U.N. \n     by several other members of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee. Together, we will meet with U.N. officials and \n     representatives of some of your governments, and will hold a \n     Committee ``Field Hearing'' to discuss U.N. reform and the \n     prospects for improved U.S.-U.N. relations.\n       This will mark another first. Never before has the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee ventured as a group from \n     Washington to visit an international institution. I hope it \n     will be an enlightening experience for all of us, and that \n     you will accept this visit as a sign of our desire for a new \n     beginning in the U.S.-U.N. relationship.\n       I hope--I intend--that my presence here today will presage \n     future visits by designated spokesmen of the Security \n     Council, who will come to Washington as official guests of \n     the United States Senate and the Senate's Foreign Relations \n     Committee which I chair. I trust that your representatives \n     will feel free to be as candid in Washington as I will try to \n     be here today so that there will be hands of friendship \n     extended in an atmosphere of understanding.\n       If we are to have such a new beginning, we must endeavor to \n     understand each other better. And that is why I will share \n     with you some of what I am hearing from the American people \n     about the United Nations.\n       Now I am confident you have seen the public opinion polls, \n     commissioned by U.N. supporters, suggesting that the U.N. \n     enjoys the support of the American public. I would caution \n     that you not put so much confidence in those polls. Since I \n     was first elected to the Senate in 1972, I have run for \n     reelection four times. Each time, the pollsters have \n     confidently predicted my defeat. Each time, I am happy to \n     confide, they have been wrong. I am pleased that, thus far, I \n     have never won a poll or lost an election.\n       So, as those of you who represent democratic nations well \n     know, public opinion polls can be constructed to tell you \n     anything the poll takers want you to hear. Let me share with \n     you what the American people tell me. Since I became chairman \n     of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have received literally \n     thousands of letters from Americans all across the country \n     expressing their deep frustration with this institution.\n       They know instinctively that the U.N. lives and breathes on \n     the hard-earned money of the American taxpayers. And yet they \n     have heard comments here in New York constantly calling the \n     United States a ``deadbeat.'' They have heard U.N. officials \n     declaring absurdly that countries like Fiji and Bangladesh \n     are carrying America's burden in peacekeeping.\n       They see the majority of the U.N. members routinely voting \n     against America in the General Assembly. They have read the \n     reports of the raucous cheering of the U.N. delegates in \n     Rome, when U.S. efforts to amend the International Criminal \n     Court treaty to protect American soldiers were defeated. They \n     read in the newspapers that, despite all the human rights \n     abuses taking place in dictatorships across the globe, a U.N. \n     ``Special Rapporteur'' decided his most pressing task was to \n     investigate human rights violations in the U.S.--and found \n     our human rights record wanting.\n       The American people hear all this; they resent it, and they \n     have grown increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a \n     lack of gratitude.\n       Now I won't delve into every point of frustration, but \n     let's touch for just a moment on one--the ``deadbeat'' \n     charge. Before coming here, I asked the United States General \n     Accounting Office to assess just how much the American \n     taxpayers contributed to the United Nations in 1999. Here is \n     what the GAO reported to me:\n       Last year, the American people contributed a total of more \n     than $2.5 billion dollars to the U.N. system in assessments \n     and voluntary contributions. That's pretty generous, but it's \n     only the tip of the iceberg. The American taxpayers also \n     spent an additional eight billion, seven hundred and seventy \n     nine million dollars from the United States' military budget \n     to support various U.N. resolutions and peacekeeping \n     operations around the world. Let me repeat that figure: eight \n     billion, seven hundred and seventy nine million dollars.\n       That means that last year (1999) alone the American people \n     have furnished precisely eleven billion, two hundred and \n     seventy nine million dollars to support the work of the \n     United Nations. No other nation on earth comes even close to \n     matching that singular investment.\n       So you can see why many Americans reject the suggestion \n     that theirs is a ``deadbeat'' nation.\n       Now, I grant you, the money we spend on the U.N. is not \n     charity. To the contrary, it is an investment--an investment \n     from which the American people rightly expect a return. They \n     expect a reformed U.N. that works more efficiently, and which \n     respects the sovereignty of the United States.\n       That is why in the 1980s, Congress began withholding a \n     fraction of our arrears as pressure for reform. And \n     Congressional pressure resulted in some worthwhile reforms, \n     such as the creation of an independent U.N. Inspector General \n     and the adoption of consensus budgeting practices. But still, \n     the arrears accumulated as the U.N. resisted more \n     comprehensive reforms.\n       When the distinguished Secretary General, Kofi Annan, was \n     elected, some of us in the\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     Senate decided to try to establish a working relationship. \n     The result is the Helms-Biden law, which President Clinton \n     finally signed into law this past November. The product of \n     three years of arduous negotiations and hard-fought \n     compromises, it was approved by the U.S. Senate by an \n     overwhelming 98-1 margin. You should read that vote as a \n     virtually unanimous mandate for a new relationship with a \n     reformed United Nations.\n       Now I am aware that this law does not sit well with some \n     here at the U.N. Some do not like to have reforms dictated by \n     the U.S. Congress. Some have even suggested that the U.N. \n     should reject these reforms. But let me suggest a few things \n     to consider: First, as the figures I have cited clearly \n     demonstrate, the United States is the single largest investor \n     in the United Nations. Under the U.S. Constitution, we in \n     Congress are the sole guardians of the American taxpayers' \n     money. (It is our solemn duty to see that it is wisely \n     invested.) So as the representatives of the U.N.'s largest \n     investors--the American people--we have not only a right, but \n     a responsibility, to insist on specific reforms in exchange \n     for their investment.\n       Second, I ask you to consider the alternative. The \n     alternative would have been to continue to let the U.S.-U.N. \n     relationship spiral out of control. You would have taken \n     retaliatory measures, such as revoking America's vote in the \n     General Assembly. Congress would likely have responded with \n     retaliatory measures against the U.N. And the end result, I \n     believe, would have been a breach in U.S.-U.N. relations that \n     would have served the interests of no one.\n       Now some here may contend that the Clinton Administration \n     should have fought to pay the arrears without conditions. I \n     assure you, had they done so, they would have lost. Eighty \n     years ago, Woodrow Wilson failed to secure Congressional \n     support for U.S. entry into the League of Nations. This \n     administration obviously learned from President Wilson's \n     mistakes. Wilson probably could have achieved ratification of \n     the League of Nations if he had worked with Congress. One of \n     my predecessors as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, Henry Cabot Lodge, asked for 14 conditions to the \n     treaty establishing the League of Nations, few of which would \n     have raised an eyebrow today. These included language to \n     insure that the United States remain the sole judge of its \n     own internal affairs; that the League not restrict any \n     individual rights of U.S. citizens; that the Congress retain \n     sole authority for the deployment of U.S. forces through the \n     league, and so on.\n       But President Wilson indignantly refused to compromise with \n     Senator Lodge. He shouted, ``Never, never!'', adding, ``I'll \n     never consent to adopting any policy with which that \n     impossible man is so prominently identified!'' What happened? \n     President Wilson lost. The final vote in the Senate was 38 to \n     53, and League of Nations withered on the vine.\n       Ambassador Holbrooke and Secretary of State Albright \n     understood from the beginning that the United Nations could \n     not long survive without the support of the American people--\n     and their elected representatives in Congress. Thanks to the \n     efforts of leaders like Ambassador Holbrooke and Secretary \n     Albright, the present Administration in Washington did not \n     repeat President Wilson's fatal mistakes.\n       In any event, Congress has written a check to the United \n     Nations for $926 million, payable upon the implementation of \n     previously agreed-upon common-sense reforms. Now the choice \n     is up to the U.N. I suggest that if the U.N. were to reject \n     this compromise, it would mark the beginning of the end of \n     U.S. support for the United Nations.\n       I don't want that to happen. I want the American people to \n     value a United Nations that recognizes and respects their \n     interests, and for the United Nations to value the \n     significant contributions of the American people.\n       Let's be crystal clear and totally honest with each other: \n     all of us want a more effective United Nations. But if the \n     United Nations is to be ``effective'' it must be an \n     institution that is needed by the great democratic powers of \n     the world.\n       Most Americans do not regard the United Nations as an end \n     in and of itself--they see it as just one tool in America's \n     diplomatic arsenal. To the extent that the U.N. is an \n     effective tool, the American people will support it. To the \n     extent that it becomes an ineffective tool--or worse, a \n     burden--the American people will cast it aside.\n       The American people want the U.N. to serve the purpose for \n     which it was designed: they want it to help sovereign states \n     coordinate collective action by ``coalitions of the \n     willing,'' (where the political will for such action exists); \n     they want it to provide a forum where diplomats can meet and \n     keep open channels of communication in times of crisis; they \n     want it to provide to the peoples of the world important \n     services, such as peacekeeping, weapons inspections and \n     humanitarian relief.\n       This is important work. It is the core of what the U.N. can \n     offer to the United States and the world. If, in the coming \n     century, the U.N. focuses on doing these core tasks well, it \n     can thrive and will earn and deserve the support of the \n     American people. But if the U.N. seeks to move beyond these \n     core tasks, if it seeks to impose the U.N.'s power and \n     authority over nation-states, I guarantee that the United \n     Nations will meet stiff resistance from the American people.\n       As matters now stand, many Americans sense that the U.N. \n     has greater ambitions than simply being an efficient \n     deliverer of humanitarian aid, a more effective peacekeeper, \n     a better weapons inspector, and a more effective tool of \n     great power diplomacy. They see the U.N. aspiring to \n     establish itself as the central authority of a new \n     international order of goblal laws and global governance. \n     This is an international order the American people will not \n     countenance.\n       The U.N. must respect national sovereignty. The U.N. serves \n     nation-states, not the other way around. This principle is \n     central to the legitimacy and ultimate survival of the United \n     Nations, and it is a principle that must be protected. The \n     Secretary General recently delivered an address on \n     sovereignty to the General Assembly, in which he declared \n     that ``the last right of states cannot and must not be the \n     right to enslave, persecute or torture their own citizens.'' \n     The peoples of the world, he said, have ``rights beyond \n     borders.'' I wholeheartedly agree.\n       What the Secretary General calls ``rights beyond borders,'' \n     we in America we call ``inalienable rights.'' We are endowed \n     with those ``inalienable rights,'' as Thomas Jefferson \n     proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence, not by kings \n     or despots, but by our Creator.\n       The sovereignty of nations must be respected. But nations \n     derive their sovereignty--their legitimacy--from the consent \n     of the governed. Thus, it follows, that nations can lose \n     their legitimacy when they rule without the consent of the \n     governed; they deservedly discard their sovereignty by \n     brutally oppressing their people.\n       Slobodan Milosevic cannot claim sovereignty over Kosovo \n     when he has murdered Kosovars and piled their bodies into \n     mass graves. Neither can Fidel Castro claim that it is his \n     sovereign right to oppress his people. Nor can Saddam Hussein \n     defend his oppression of the Iraqi people by hiding behind \n     phony claims of sovereignty.\n       And when the oppressed peoples of the world cry out for \n     help, the free peoples of the world have a fundamental right \n     to respond.\n       As we watch the U.N. struggle with this question at the \n     turn of the millennium, many Americans are left exceedingly \n     puzzled. Intervening in cases of widespread oppression and \n     massive human rights abuses is not a new concept for the \n     United States. The American people have a long history of \n     coming to the aid of those struggling for freedom. In the \n     United States, during the 1980s, we called this policy the \n     ``Reagan Doctrine.\n       In some cases, America has assisted freedom fighters around \n     the world who were seeking to overthrow corrupt regimes. We \n     have provided weaponry, training, and intelligence. In other \n     cases, the United States has intervened directly. In still \n     other cases, such as in Central and Eastern Europe, we \n     supported peaceful opposition movements with moral, financial \n     and covert forms of support. In each case, however, it was \n     America's clear intention to help bring down Communist \n     regimes that were oppressing their peoples,--and thereby \n     replace dictators with democratic governments.\n       The dramatic expansion of freedom in the last decade of the \n     20th century is a direct result of these policies. In none of \n     these cases, however, did the United States ask for, or \n     receive, the approval of the United Nations to ``legitimize'' \n     its actions. It is a fanciful notion that free peoples need \n     to seek the approval of an international body (many of whose \n     members are totalitarian dictatorships) to lend support to \n     nations struggling to break the chains of tyranny and claim \n     their inalienable, God-given rights.\n       The United Nations has no power to grant or decline \n     legitimacy to such actions. They are inherently legitimate. \n     What the United Nations can do is help. The Security Council \n     can, where appropriate, be an instrument to facilitate action \n     by ``coalitions of the willing,'' implement sanctions \n     regimes, and provide logistical support to states undertaking \n     collective action.\n       But complete candor is imperative: The Security Council has \n     an exceedingly mixed record in being such a facilitator. In \n     the case of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait in the early \n     1990s, it performed admirably; in the more recent case of \n     Kosovo, it was paralyzed. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in \n     Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to protect the Bosnian \n     people from Serb genocide is well documented in a recent U.N. \n     report.\n       And, despite its initial success in repelling Iraqi \n     aggression, in the years since the Gulf War, the Security \n     Council has utterly failed to stop Saddam Hussein's drive to \n     build instruments of mass murder. It has allowed him to play \n     a repeated game of expelling UNSCOM inspection teams which \n     included Americans, and has left Saddam completely free for \n     the past year to fashion nuclear and chemical weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       I am here to plead that from now on we all must work \n     together, to learn from past mistakes, and to make the \n     Security Council a more efficient and effective tool for \n     international peace and security. But candor compels that I \n     reiterate this warning: the American people will never accept \n     the claims of the United Nations to be the ``sole source of \n     legitimacy on the use of force'' in the world.\n       But, some may respond, the U.S. Senate ratified the U.N. \n     Charter fifty years ago. Yes, but in doing so we did not cede \n     one syllable of American sovereignty to the United Nations. \n     Under our system, when\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n     international treaties are ratified they simply become \n     domestic U.S. law. As such, they carry no greater or less \n     weight than any other domestic U.S. law. Treaty obligations \n     can be superceded by a simple act of Congress. This was the \n     intentional design of our founding fathers, who cautioned \n     against entering into ``entangling alliances.''\n       Thus, when the United States joins a treaty organization, \n     it holds no legal authority over us. We abide by our treaty \n     obligations because they are the domestic law of our land, \n     and because our elected leaders have judged that the \n     agreement serves our national interest. But no treaty or law \n     can ever supercede the one document that all Americans hold \n     sacred: The U.S. Constitution.\n       The American people do not want the United Nations to \n     become a ``entangling alliance.'' That is why Americans look \n     with alarm at U.N. claims to a monopoly on international \n     moral legitimacy. They see this as a threat to the God-given \n     freedoms of the American people, a claim of political \n     authority over America and its elected leaders without their \n     consent.\n       The effort to establish a United Nations International \n     Criminal Court is a case-in-point. Consider: the Rome Treaty \n     purports to hold American citizens under its jurisdiction--\n     even when the United States has neither signed nor ratified \n     the treaty. In other words, it claims sovereign authority \n     over American citizens without their consent. How can the \n     nations of the world imagine for one instant that Americans \n     will stand by and allow such a power-grab to take place?\n       The Court's supporters argue that Americans should be \n     willing to sacrifice some of their sovereignty for the noble \n     cause of international justice. International law did not \n     defeat Hitler, nor did it win the Cold War. What stopped the \n     Nazi march across Europe, and the Communist march across the \n     world, was the principled projection of power by the world's \n     great democracies. And that principled projection of force is \n     the only thing that will ensure the peace and security of the \n     world in the future.\n       More often than not, ``international law'' has been used as \n     a make-believe justification for hindering the march of \n     freedom. When Ronald Reagan sent American servicemen into \n     harm's way to liberate Grenada from the hands of communist \n     dictatorship, the U.N. General Assembly responded by voting \n     to condemn the action of the elected President of the United \n     States as a violation of international law--and, I am obliged \n     to add, they did so by a larger majority than when Soviet \n     invasion of Afghanistan was condemned by the same General \n     Assembly!\n       Similarly, the U.S. effort to overthrow Nicaragua's \n     Communist dictatorship (by supporting Nicaragua's freedom \n     fighters and mining Nicaragua's harbors) was declared by the \n     World Court as a violation of international law.\n       Most recently, we learn that the chief prosecutor of the \n     Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal has compiled a report on \n     possible NATO war crimes during the Kosovo campaign. At \n     first, the prosecutor declared that it is fully within the \n     scope of her authority to indict NATO pilots and commanders. \n     When news of her report leaked, she backpedaled.\n       She realized, I am sure, that any attempt to indict NATO \n     commanders would be the death knell for the International \n     Criminal Court. But the very fact that she explored this \n     possibility at all brings to light all that is wrong with \n     this brave new world of global justice, which proposes a \n     system in which independent prosecutors and judges, \n     answerable to no state or institution, have unfettered power \n     to sit in judgment of the foreign policy decisions of Western \n     democracies.\n       No U.N. institution--not the Security Council, not the \n     Yugoslav tribunal, not a future ICC--is competent to judge \n     the foreign policy and national security decisions of the \n     United States. American courts routinely refuse cases where \n     they are asked to sit in judgment of our government's \n     national security decisions, stating that they are not \n     competent to judge such decisions. If we do not submit our \n     national security decisions to the judgment of a Court of the \n     United States, why would Americans submit them to the \n     judgment of an International Criminal Court, a continent \n     away, comprised of mostly foreign judges elected by an \n     international body made up the membership of the U.N. General \n     Assembly?\n       Americans distrust concepts like the International Criminal \n     Court, and claims by the U.N. to be the sole source of \n     legitimacy'' for the use of force, because Americans have a \n     profound distrust of accumulated power. Our founding fathers \n     created a government founded on a system of checks and \n     balances, and dispersal of power.\n       In his 1962 classic, Capitalism and Freedom, the Nobel-\n     prize winning economist Milton Friedman rightly declared: \n     ``[G]overnment power must be dispersed. If government is to \n     exercise power, better in the county than in the state, \n     better in the state than in Washington. [Because] if I do not \n     like what my local community does, I can move to another \n     local community . . . [and] if I do not like what my state \n     does, I can move to another. [But] if I do not like what \n     Washington imposes, I have few alternatives in this world of \n     jealous nations.''\n       Forty years later, as the U.N. seeks to impose its utopian \n     vision of ``international law'' on Americans, we can add this \n     question: Where do we go when we don't like the ``laws'' of \n     the world? Today, while our friends in Europe concede more \n     and more power upwards to supra-national institutions like \n     the European Union, Americans are heading in precisely the \n     opposite direction. America is in a process of reducing \n     centralized power by taking more and more authority that had \n     been amassed by the Federal government in Washington and \n     referring it to the individual states where it rightly \n     belongs.\n       This is why Americans reject the idea of a sovereign United \n     Nations that presumes to be the source of legitimacy for the \n     United States Government's policies, foreign or domestic. \n     There is only one source of legitimacy of the American \n     government's policies--and that is the consent of the \n     American people.\n       If the United Nations is to survive into the 21st century, \n     it must recognize its limitations. The demands of the United \n     States have not changed much since Henry Cabot Lodge laid out \n     his conditions for joining the League of Nations 80 years \n     ago: Americans want to ensure that the United States of \n     America remains the sole judge of its own internal affairs, \n     that the United Nations is not allowed to restrict the \n     individual rights of U.S. citizens, and that the United \n     States retains sole authority over the deployment of United \n     States forces around the world.\n       This is what Americans ask of the United Nations; it is \n     what Americans expect of the United Nations. A United Nations \n     that focuses on helping sovereign states work together is \n     worth keeping; a United Nations that insists on trying to \n     impose a utopian vision on America and the world will \n     collapse under its own weight.\n       If the United Nations respects the sovereign rights of the \n     American people, and serves them as an effective tool of \n     diplomacy, it will earn and deserve their respect and \n     support. But a United Nations that seeks to impose its \n     presumed authority on the American people without their \n     consent begs for confrontation and, I want to be candid, \n     eventual U.S. withdrawal.\n       Thank you very much.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Foreign Relations Committee Events at the United Nations\n\n       Senator Helms scheduled two days of events at the United \n     Nations in New York. On Thursday, January 20, 2000, Senator \n     Helms met with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the United \n     States' Permanent Representative to the United Nations. This \n     meeting was followed by a private discussion with United \n     Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. At the conclusion of \n     the Kofi Annan meeting Senator Helms proceeded to the chamber \n     of the United Nations Security Council where he delivered a \n     speech to the members of the Security Council. In addition to \n     the fifteen members of the Security Council, the speech was \n     attended by representatives of most countries in the United \n     Nations. Senator Helms was later the guest of honor at a \n     luncheon hosted by Ambassador Holbrooke at which Senator \n     Helms and several U.N. ambassadors continued the discussion \n     on United Nations reform and the future of U.S.-U.N. \n     relations.\n       On Friday, January 21, Senator Helms was joined by four \n     other Senate Foreign Relations Committee members (Senators \n     Biden, Hagel, Grams, and Feingold) and Chairman of the Armed \n     Services Committee, Senator John Warner, for another full day \n     of meetings on U.S.-U.N. relations. The schedule started with \n     a meeting between the Senators and Ambassador Holbrooke. This \n     was followed by a meeting with the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations. The Secretary General was joined by his top \n     deputies responsible for U.N. management and peacekeeping. At \n     the conclusion of the meeting, the Senators attended a \n     luncheon at the United Nations hosted by Ambassador \n     Holbrooke. Representatives of nearly every one of the 188 \n     nations represented at the United Nations were invited, and \n     it appeared that most showed up. The day concluded with an \n     afternoon hearing at which three panels of witnesses spoke on \n     a wide range of issues related to the United Nations \n     including the state of reforms, peacekeeping in the Balkans \n     and Africa, efforts to inspect WMD programs in Iraq, and the \n     U.S.-U.N. relationship.\n       On Friday evening, a dinner hosted by Mr. Erwin Belk, a \n     U.S. Public Delegate to the United Nations, was held in honor \n     of the U.S. Presidency of the U.N. Security Council during \n     the month of January. The dinner was attended by Senators and \n     many United Nations representatives.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

As everyone knows, we have started with the new \nCongress what we hope will be the final 2 days of the bankruptcy bill \nthat we started sometime during the last 2 weeks of the session last \nyear. We hope to finish by next Tuesday or Wednesday. We have the \nnumber of amendments down to about nine, with limits on debate on most \nof those amendments. It looks as if we can see the end of the debate \nand what I hope will be final passage. I think I can predict final \npassage because we did pass this legislation with only one or two \ndissenting votes during\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nthe year of 1998. At that particular time, it was too late in the \nsession to get the bill back to the House before final adjournment, so \nobviously in 1999 we had to start over again. That is concluding now \nwith the House passing the bill in the middle of last year by a veto-\nproof margin.\n  At this point, I will say a few words about how we have thought of \nthe proper role of bankruptcy over the course of our Nation's history. \nCongress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation derives from the \nbody of the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 4, authorizes \nCongress to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy \nthroughout the United States.''\n  Until the year 1898, we did not have permanent bankruptcy laws; they \nwere temporary. They were temporary reactions to particular economic \nproblems. With each successive bankruptcy act and each major reform of \nour Nation's bankruptcy laws, we have refined our concept of how \nbankruptcy should promote the important social goal of giving honest \nbut unfortunate Americans a fresh start while at the same time we guard \nagainst the moral hazard of making bankruptcy too lax. Quite frankly, \nsince 1978 that is exactly what has happened. In the last 6 or 7 years, \nwe have seen an explosion of the number of bankruptcies, from about \n700,000 to about 1.4 million.\n  We do not have solid statistics on this, but hopefully that 100-\npercent rise in bankruptcies over the last 6 years has leveled off now. \nWe think it has. If it has leveled off, hopefully it will start to \ndecline. Some of that is attributable to our working on this \nlegislation and sending a signal not only to people who are unfortunate \nand are considering bankruptcy, but to our entire society that Congress \nis taking a look at this 1978 legislation. The point of that \nlegislation may not have been to make it easier to go into bankruptcy, \nbut that has been the final product of that 1978 legislation. Hence, \nour reconsideration of that 1978 legislation with the amendments that \nare in this bill will send a signal to the people of this country that \nthose who have the ability to pay should not be in bankruptcy in the \nfirst place. But if they decide to go into bankruptcy, they are not \ngoing to get off scot-free. That still retains our social practice, \nwhich has been that if they deserve a fresh start, they will still get \nit.\n  The bill before us proposes fundamental reforms which are a logical \noutgrowth and an extension of our prior bankruptcy reform efforts. I am \ntalking about certain reforms that have taken place over the last 102 \nyears. From 1898, which is the start of our permanent bankruptcy \nlegislation, until 1938, consumers had only one way to declare \nbankruptcy. It was called straight bankruptcy, or chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nUnder chapter 7, which is still in existence, bankrupts surrender some \nof their assets to the bankruptcy court. The court sells these assets \nand uses the proceeds to pay creditors. Any deficiency, then, is wiped \nout, hence the term ``a fresh start.''\n  In 1932, the President recommended changes to the bankruptcy laws \nwhich would push wage earners into repayment plans. Later in the \n1930s--and the exact date is 1938--Congress created, then, as a result \nof this suggestion 8 years before, chapter 13, which permits but does \nnot require a debtor to repay a portion of his or her debts in exchange \nfor limited debt cancellation and protection from debt collection \nefforts. Chapter 13 is still on the books to this very day, although it \nhas been modified several times, most notably that modification in \n1978.\n  Under current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is \nentirely voluntary. Since it is entirely voluntary, that is the cause \nof part of the problems we have now. People who have the ability to \nrepay, who might use chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code as part of their \nfinancial planning, try to get into 7 and do not have to go into 13. As \na result of not going into 13, they can get off scot-free.\n  Senators, decades before this Senator, saw a weakness in this. In the \nlate 1960s, there was a distinguished Senator from Tennessee by the \nname of Albert Gore, Sr. He introduced legislation to push people into \nrepayment plans. This proposal was reported to the Senate as part of a \nbankruptcy tax bill passed by the Finance Committee, but the Gore \namendment ultimately died in the Senate.\n  Later, in the mid-1980s, Senator Dole and a Congressman from Oklahoma \nby the name of Mike Synar tried to steer higher income bankrupts--those \nwho could repay some of their debt, those who were going into \nbankruptcy chapter 7 to get off scot-free--to steer those people to \nchapter 13. That was a good idea by Senator Dole and Congressman Mike \nSynar. The efforts of Senator Dole and the Congressman, though, \nultimately resulted in the creation of section 707(b). This section \ngives bankruptcy judges the power to dismiss the bankruptcy case of \nsomeone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy if that case is--and \nthese are the words from the law--if that case is a ``substantial \nabuse'' of the bankruptcy code.\n\n  This idea sounds very good and probably was quite a step forward by \nSenator Dole and Congressman Synar, but it has not worked so well in \nthe real world. First, the term ``substantial abuse'' has not been \nclearly defined, and its actual meaning is very unclear. Why? Not \nbecause of the intent of the authors, but because we have had so many \nconflicting court cases. The decisions have brought conflicts in this \narea of the law from different parts of the country, so people are not \nsure what the rules are.\n  There is a second reason. Creditors and private trustees are actually \nforbidden from bringing evidence of abuse to the attention of the \nbankruptcy judge. I want to think that this was an oversight by Senator \nDole and Congressman Synar. Or it may have been part of a necessary \ncompromise at the time to take a small step forward. But it is \nunreasonable, if you believe there has been a substantial abuse of the \nbankruptcy code, and going into chapter 7 and, according to the \nlanguage of the statute, there has been ``substantial abuse,'' that \nsomehow knowledge of that cannot be brought to the attention of a \nbankruptcy judge by creditors and private trustees.\n  The bill before our body corrects these two shortcomings. Under this \nbill, 707(b) now permits creditors and private trustees to file motions \nand actually bring evidence of chapter 7 abuses to the attention of the \nbankruptcy judge. This change is very important since creditors have \nthe most to lose from bankruptcy abuse, and, of course, the private \ntrustees are often in the best position to know which cases are abusive \nin nature. In certain types of cases where the probability of abuse is \nhigh, the Department of Justice is also required to bring evidence of \nabuse to the attention of bankruptcy judges.\n  Additionally, the bill requires judges to dismiss or convert chapter \n7 cases where the debtor has a clear ability to repay his or her debts. \nUnder this bill, if someone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy can \nrepay 25 percent or more of his or her general unsecured debts, or a \ntotal of $15,000 over a 5-year period, then a legal presumption arises \nthat this case should be dismissed or converted to a repayment plan \nunder another chapter.\n  Taken together, these changes will bring the bankruptcy system back \ninto balance. I am sure it is a balance that Senator Dole and \nCongressman Synar sought in the first instance. Importantly, these \nchanges preserve an element of flexibility so each and every debtor can \nhave his or her special circumstances considered. That is important, as \nwell, as we give some leeway, some flexibility, to the bankruptcy judge \nwhen this sort of evidence is brought. This will not put any group of \nbankrupts in a straitjacket. All of this means then that their unique \nsituation will be taken into account.\n  As we proceed to consider this bill, I hope my colleagues will keep \nin mind the balance of this legislation, the fair nature of this \nlegislation, as well as its deep historical roots, not going back, I \nsuppose, to the beginning of our country but, as far as a uniform \npermanent bankruptcy code, to 1898.\n  I also think this is a tribute--as the Senator from Vermont spoke \nabout earlier--that we have been working very closely between \nRepublicans and Democrats on crafting a bipartisan measure.\n  That reminds me again that, as with last fall when we first started \nconsideration of this bill--we are continuing it now because we did not \nfinish it last year--a great deal of credit goes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr.\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nTorricelli, for his outstanding cooperation with me on this \nlegislation, in addition to Senator Leahy because as chairman of the \nsubcommittee that handles this legislation, I had to work very closely, \nand enjoyed working very closely, with Senator Torricelli. We \nintroduced the bill together. We got it out of subcommittee together. \nWe got it out of the full committee together. This enjoyed a great deal \nof bipartisan support in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Lastly, I just ask my colleagues to come to the floor. We were told \nthat a couple of the authors of these amendments would be prepared to \ncome to the floor this afternoon to debate these amendments and, except \nfor votes, to take care of some of these amendments. I hope my \ncolleagues will come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to point out a concern I \nhave with a seemingly innocuous, seemingly beneficial, provision \ncontained in the Domenici amendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform \nAct of 1999--``Section __68. MODIFICATION OF EXCLUSION FOR EMPLOYER \nPROVIDED TRANSIT PASSES.'' The goal of the provision--to expand the use \nof the Federal transit benefit, a ``qualified transportation fringe'' \nin the vernacular--is admirable, but I fear that the way in which the \nprovision pursues that goal may, in fact, unintentionally undermine the \ntransit benefit.\n  The employer-provided Federal transit benefit has evolved since its \ncreation within the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 as a $15 per month \n``de minimis'' benefit. After fourteen years of gradual change, 1998's \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) codified the \nbenefit as a ``pre-tax'' benefit of up to $65 per month. The cap will \nincrease to $100 in 2002. The ``pre-tax'' aspect was a major reform \nbecause it provided an economic incentive--payroll tax savings--for \nemployers to offer the program. Companies would save money by offering \na benefit of great utility to their workers while simultaneously \nremoving automobiles from our choked and congested urban streets and \nhighways. It is effective public policy. (As an aside, I should note \nthat a similar pre-tax benefit of $175 per month exists for parking, \nand so despite all we know about air pollution and the intractable \nproblems of automobile congestion, Congress continues to encourage \npeople to drive. Discouraging perhaps, but we're closing the gap. If \none doesn't have thirty years to devote to social policy, one should \nnot get involved!)\n  Quite consciously, and conscientiously, Congress established a bias \nin the statute toward the use of vouchers--which employers can \ndistribute to employees--over bona fide cash reimbursement \narrangements. We permitted employers to use cash reimbursement \narrangements only when a voucher program was not ``readily available.'' \nWe reasoned that because the vouchers could only be used for transit, \nwe would eliminate the need for employees to prove that they were using \nthe tax benefit for the intended purpose. Furthermore, by stipulating \nthat voucher programs are the clear preference of Congress, we are \ncompelling transit authorities to offer better services--monthly \nfarecards, unlimited ride passes, smartcards, et al.--to the multitudes \nof working Americans who must presently endure all manner of \nfrustrations and indignities during their daily work commute.\n  While the new law has only been in effect for less than two years, \nthe program is catching on in our large metropolitan areas and should \ncontinue to expand. We have been alerted, however, to a legitimate \nconcern of large multistate employers. Several of these companies have \nnoted that establishing voucher programs can be arduous and unwieldy \nwhen the companies must craft separate programs in multiple \njurisdictions with different transportation authorities. These \ndifficulties, coupled with an expertise in administering cash \nreimbursement programs, have convinced the companies that bona fide \ncash reimbursement programs are more practical. Fair enough.\n  We should, therefore, make it easier for such companies to offer the \nbenefit through cash reimbursement arrangements. While I am committed \nto that end, I have serious reservations about the repeal of the \nvoucher preference contained in the Domenici amendment.\n  My main objection is that the U.S. Treasury is currently developing \nsubstantiation regulations for the administration of this benefit \nthrough cash reimbursement arrangements. These regulations will provide \ncompanies with a clear understanding of their obligations in the \nverification of their employees' transit usage, an understanding which \ndoes not exist today. Until these regulations are promulgated, voucher \nprograms offer the only true mechanism of verification--vouchers, \nunlike cash, are useless unless enjoyed for their intended purpose. The \nCongress should not take an action that might rapidly increase the use \nof a tax benefit without the existence of accompanying safeguards to \nensue the program's integrity.\n  I will work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, with my \nrevered Chairman, and any Senator interested in this issue, to improve \nthe ease with which companies can offer this important benefit to their \nemployees. It is, after all, in our national interest. But I must \nstrongly oppose efforts to repeal the voucher preference until the \nTreasury establishes a regulatory framework for cash reimbursement. We \nhave been told to expect proposed regulations from the Treasury within \nthe week. We anxiously await their arrival.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S74-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S74-S76]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            METHAMPHETAMINE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that is \ntearing rural communities apart--methamphetamine.\n  Last week, our Nation's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, and his \ndeputy, Dr. Don Vereen, came to Montana to focus on methamphetamine. We \nmet with law enforcement officers, health care professionals, and \nconcerned citizens.\n  As many of you know, methamphetamine is a powerful and addictive \ndrug. It is considered by many youths to be a casual, soft-core drug \nwith few lasting effects. But, in fact, meth can actually cause more \nlong-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack.\n  Methamphetamine users are often irritable and aggressive. They have \ntremors and convulsions, their hearts working overtime to keep up with \nthe frenetic pace set by the drug. Methamphetamine can stop their \nhearts. It can kill.\n  The psychological effects of meth use are also severe: Paranoia and \nhallucinations; memory loss and panic; loss of concentration and \ndepression.\n  We have all heard these symptoms manifested around the country, \nparticularly in rural America.\n  Time magazine reported just 2 years ago, in June 1998, on the meth \nproblem faced in Billings, MT. Time found that until 5 years ago, in \nBillings--Montana's largest city--marijuana and cocaine were the most \noften used illegal substance of choice. Today, as reported in Time \nmagazine, it is methamphetamine.\n  In 1998, the number of juveniles charged with drug-related or violent \ncrimes in the Yellowstone County Youth Court rose by 30 percent.\n  In Lame Deer--that is the community of the Northern Cheyenne Indian \nReservation--kids as young as 8 years old have been seen for meth \naddiction.\n  Last November in our State, a meth lab blew up in Great Falls, \nleading to a half dozen arrests.\n  Sounds like awful stuff, doesn't it? But if it is bad, why is \nmethamphetamine the fastest growing drug in Montana, and particularly \nover rural America in the last 5 years? Why did meth use among high \nschool seniors more than double from 1990 to 1996?\n  The short answer is that methamphetamine provides a temporary high, a \nshort-term euphoria; it feels good; in addition, increases alertness. \nAlthough the use of the drug later leads to a dulling of the body and \nmind, its short-term lure is one of enhanced physical and mental \nprowess.\n  Workers may use the drug to get through an extra shift, particularly \na night shift; it gives them a real high. Young women often use meth to \nlose weight. It is interesting, but in our State over half of \nmethamphetamine\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\nusers are women, single moms, stressed out, working. She needs a break. \nShe takes the drug. It helps her get through the day or week. Athletes \nalso use it to improve performance. People think it helps. It helps \nthem get through the day, helps them to do what they are doing. They do \nnot realize how much it hurts.\n  Therein lies the danger of methamphetamine. Folks think they can use \nit for a short time with no long-term ill effects--sort of like \nstraying from their New Year's diet and eating a couple of pieces of \ncheesecake--but they can't do it, can't get away with it.\n  Consider this: Dr. Bill Melega is a doctor at UCLA. He researched the \neffects of methamphetamine on monkeys, giving them meth for 10 days. He \nfound that not only did methamphetamine physically alter the brain, but \nthese monkeys' brains remained altered 3 years after methamphetamine \nwas administered. Again, 3 years after taking the drug, the brain still \nhad not recovered.\n  Brain scans show that, whether it is postron or other forms of \ntechnology we have that scan the brain, when an individual is taking \nmethamphetamine, the brain is significantly changed. As I said, in the \ncase of monkeys--we do not have test results yet on human beings--it is \npermanently changed.\n  So meth is a problem. But is it reasonable to believe we can mobilize \na community-wide effort against it? Is it possible to remove meth from \nMontana and all our communities? I say we can, but it is going to take \na lot of work.\n  A few years ago, for example, in Billings, MT, a group of skinheads \nthreatened Billings and its Jewish community with bodily harm. They \nthrew bricks through windows of Jewish homes. They threatened violence \non others and caused a huge problem in my State, particularly in \nBillings.\n  But what happened? The people of Billings mobilized. They mobilized \nto defend against that mindless hatred. They banded together, and they \norganized the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever in my State. \nBillings people, in addition to the police, law enforcement officers, \nand others--basically, the people--the community rose to the challenge \nand ousted the skinheads from Billings, MT.\n  Just a few days after yet another Martin Luther King celebration, we \nare given the chance all across our country to try again, with \ncommunity efforts, to solve community problems, whether it is racial \nhatred, whatever it is--in this case, among others, this \nmethamphetamine. We all have a part to play.\n  Kids, you should know that meth will hurt you. It might even kill \nyou. Our communities need you to serve as examples of how to live a \npositive, drug-free life. You are doing it already through \norganizations such as SADD--the Students Against Destructive \nDecisions--Big Brothers and Sisters, Smart Moves, Smart Leaders. There \nare lots of organizations.\n  One encouraging sign in the fight against meth is the incredible \npeople who have been working on this problem.\n  In my State of Montana, for example, there is a lady named Virginia \nGross who for over a decade has been in the ``treatment trenches'' \nserving the most serious cases of meth addiction in Billings, MT. A \nBillings native herself, she got her start in the treatment area, \nworking generally with emotionally disturbed kids. She saw that almost \ninvariably these emotionally disturbed kids had a drug abuse problem \ntied with them. In doing intakes at a treatment center called the \nRimrock Foundation, she treated her first meth addict 13 years ago.\n  There is virtually no literature on the subject, particularly on meth \ntreatment, so she, on her own--working with this and that--developed \nher own treatment techniques--testing this, trying that--and she \ngradually learned what it takes to treat a meth patient effectively.\n  In the hundreds of patients she has treated since 1987, she points to \none as her greatest success. This fellow, strung out since age 14 on \ndrugs for more of his life than not, came to Virginia with a \ndetermination to try anything. He told her he would do whatever it took \nto beat his addiction. He knew he wanted to be clean, and clean he \nbecame. Three years after starting treatment, this former high school \ndropout got his GED, started college. He has gotten straight A's and \naspires to be a forest ranger. He is a symbol of Virginia's and his own \nsuccess and particularly a symbol of what young people can do who are \non drugs and who want to get off.\n  Success can be achieved. Meth can be defeated. We all have a part to \nplay. Parents, teachers, you must know the symptoms of meth use; \nrecognize them. More importantly, you need to talk to your children. It \nis true that teens whose parents talk to them about drugs are half as \nlikely to use drugs as those whose parents don't. If you talk to your \nkids, the chances your kids will take drugs is 50 percent less than if \nyou don't talk to them about drugs. It is a proven fact. It is a \nstatistic that is very amply demonstrated.\n  Finally, law enforcement, you have a critical part to play, too. Last \nweek, again, the news in Billings reported that the crime rate has \nfallen significantly in the last 2 years, 10 percent this year alone. \nThat is good news. But the bad news is, it is also true that Billings' \nviolent crime rate has increased over that same time. I believe much of \nthat is attributable to drug use. Until we get a handle on the drug \nproblem, controlling crime is going to be a very steep uphill battle.\n  To that end, Montana must be a member of the Rocky Mountain High-\nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA. It is a collaboration \nbetween State, Federal, and local law enforcement agencies. Then there \nis S. 486, the Meth Act, which passed the Senate last session and waits \nfor action in the House. It provides longer prison terms for drug \ncriminals, more money for law enforcement, education, prevention, and a \nwider ban on meth paraphernalia. All told, the bill increases Federal \nfunding for law enforcement and education by over $50 million.\n  We are proud in our State to call Montana the last best place. We \nlove our way of life. But in the past several years, we have found that \neven the last best place is not immune to the scourge of \nmethamphetamine and all the trouble that comes with it. We have gangs. \nWe have thugs. We have crime. We have drugs. We have a problem.\n  Today a report was released underscoring the fact that rural \nteenagers are much more likely to smoke, to drink, and to use illegal \ndrugs than their urban counterparts. The report was commissioned by the \nDrug Enforcement Administration and funded by the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse, focusing primarily on 13- and 14-year-olds. It showed that \neighth graders in rural America are 83 percent more likely to use crack \ncocaine than their urban counterparts. They are 50 percent more likely \nto use cocaine, 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana, 29 percent \nmore likely to drink alcohol. Even more shocking, the report showed \nthat rural eighth graders were 104 percent more likely to use \namphetamines, including methamphetamine. That is double the rate of \nurban eighth graders.\n  We also have confidence in our State, as I know people do in other \ncommunities, that we can solve this, particularly in the face of such \nadversity. And this battle must be won. Meth use in Montana and in \nother communities is much too important a battle to lose. So, kids, \nplease understand what meth does to you. Serve as examples to your \npeers and what it means to lead a drug-free life. We need you. Parents, \nteachers, recognize the symptoms; talk to your kids. Law enforcement, \nyour efforts are bearing fruit. You need more support and all of us, of \ncourse, will continue to help you, particularly here in the Congress, \nto get it. You need the help of the communities because community \nproblems require community solutions.\n\n  One final note. Let me emphasize that last one: Community effort. \nThis is only going to be solved in all communities across our country \nif it is a total community effort. Doctors have to get more involved. \nThey have to not only get involved with the glamorous cases of heart \ntransplants and hip replacements but also meth use, addiction. Doctors \nhave to get much more involved. Pediatricians have to talk much more to \nparents of the kids when the kids come into the office. Our faith \ncommunity can do still more, much more throughout our country in \ncracking down on meth, working hard to\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nwork together with other communities, parents, obviously teachers and \nschools, treatment centers.\n  In addition, treatment is so important. So many people are arrested \nfor meth use or for peddling meth. They are addicted. They are put in \nprison. What happens? After they are out of prison, they are back on \nmeth. There is virtually no treatment or there is very little treatment \nof incarcerated persons in prison because of meth. There has to be \ntreatment. Treatment is tough. Treatment takes a long time. It takes \nmore than 30 days. It takes more than 60 days. It takes more than 90 \ndays. Treatment usually takes up to 1 to 2 years. Halfway houses, you \nhave to stick with it. You have to stick with it if we are going to \nsolve it.\n  Look at it this way: If we leave meth users alone in the community, \nit is going to cost the community, estimates are, $38,000, $39,000, \n$40,000 a year. That is the cost of that meth-addicted user to \ncommunities, whether it is in crimes, stealing to support the habit, \nall the ways that addicted meth users are destructive to a community. \nTo put that same person in prison, it is going to be very costly; that \nis, prison without treatment. It is going to cost maybe up to $30,000. \nIncarceration today costs about $30,000 a person a year. Treatment \nalone is about $6,000 to $8,000. Treatment in prison is going to be \nless than letting the person free out on the street in the community. \nIt pays.\n  Taxpayers, rise up. Recognize your tax dollars are spent much more \nefficiently with treatment, treatment of addicted meth users in prison, \nthan without the treatment, working with law enforcement officials, \ncoordinating all your efforts.\n  Again, I emphasize that final point. Methamphetamine is a national \nproblem. It is a State problem, but it is more a community solution, \nall the peoples of the communities working together, certainly with \nStates and certainly with Uncle Sam, but you have to do it together as \na well-knit effort. That is how we will solve this scourge in this \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Montana for \nhis eloquent remarks on methamphetamine and the destruction it is \nwreaking not only on Western States such as Montana and Utah but \nthroughout the country. We passed a methamphetamine bill out of the \nSenate. We have to get it through the House. I ask my dear friend from \nMontana to help us work with House Members to get that through. If we \nget that through, it will immediately start taking effect.\n  What these kids don't realize, and their parents, is once they are \nhooked on meth, it is almost impossible to get them off. I had a \nsituation where a very strong friend of mine had a son, a good kid, but \nhe was picked up and put in jail once for meth. He promised to be OK. \nHe had quite a bit of time to get OK, came outside, he had perfect \nintentions, wanted to be everything he possibly could be. Then, all of \na sudden, he started making meth in his apartment, got picked up again. \nThe father called me and said: I know he has to go to jail. I hope you \ncan get the help for him.\n  I called the top people and they said they will try and get him into \na Federal rehabilitation center, but it would take at least 3 years \njust to get him to be able to handle it, not ever get rid of the \ndesire, but just to handle it.\n  So you parents out there, if you don't realize how important what \nSenator Baucus has been talking about is, then you better start \nthinking. If your kids get hooked on meth, it is going to be a long, \nhard road to get them off. Their lives may be gone.\n  We have to pass that bill. I appreciate the distinguished Senator's \nremarks for the most part. I thank him for being here. I hope we will \nall work together to get that bill through Congress so we can solve \nthis terrible scourge.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I hope not only for the most part but for the whole part, \nMr. President. The Senator from Utah is exactly correct. I must \nconfess, I learned a lot about the scourge this past week when Gen. \nBarry McCaffrey was in Billings for a whole day and half the next day \nwith his people, meeting with treatment people the whole time, various \naspects of the people who deal with this. It is one big problem, as the \nSenator from Utah said. It is really vicious stuff. Once you are on it, \nit is worse than cocaine or heroin. It is harder to withdraw. The \ntreatment is longer. I mean, this is wicked stuff.\n\n  I might add, one fact I learned is that in our State--and I hope it \nis not true in Utah--we have a high percentage of users who shoot it \nwith needles, or IV. Therefore, if we don't stamp it out, we are going \nto face a high incidence of hepatitis C and HIV. Dr. Green, an expert \non the subject in Billings, was shocked last week when he came to \nunderstand the high rate of users who inject meth instead of taking it \norally or smoking it.\n  All I say is that I hope parents and communities will rally and knock \nthis thing out. It is really bad stuff.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. It is a real problem, and we have to \ndo something about it. I appreciate his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S76-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S76]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to correct an \ninadvertent but significant error in the Congressional Record of \nNovember 19, 1999, the last day of the first session of this Congress. \nIt concerns a statement submitted for the Record by Senator Lott (145 \nCongressional Record S15048) regarding the Superfund Recycling Equity \nAct, which was passed as part of the Intellectual Property and \nCommunications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. The statement erroneously \nwas attributed to both Senator Lott and me. In fact, the statement did \nnot then and does not now reflect my understanding of the Superfund \nrecycling amendments.\n  I make this clarification at the earliest opportunity, in order to \nminimize the possibility of any mistaken reliance on the statement as \nthe consensus view of two original cosponsors, particularly with \nrespect to the availability of relief in pending cases. It is not.\n  The recycling amendments were passed as part of the end of year \nappropriations process and did not have the benefit of hearings, \ndebates, or substantive committee consideration during the 106th \nlegislative session. Thus, there is no conference report, and there are \nno committee reports or hearing transcripts, to guide interpretation of \nthe bill.\n  However, much, though not all, of the language in the recycling \namendments originated in the 103d Congress. At that time, key \nstakeholders, including EPA, members of the environmental community and \nthe recycling industry, agreed on recycling provisions as part of \nefforts to pass a comprehensive Superfund reform bill. Although \nSuperfund reform legislation did not reach the floor in the 103d \nCongress, it was reported by the major Committees of jurisdiction in \nboth the Senate (S. 1834) and the House with bi-partisan support. In \nreporting these bills in the 103d Congress, the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and \nthe House Public Works and Transportation Committee each produced \nreports that include discussions of the recycling provisions.\n  Since the recycling provisions of S. 1834 were identical in most \nrespects to the Superfund Recycling Equity Act of 1999, and the meaning \nof key provisions of that bill were actively considered and discussed, \nthe Senate Committee Report contains probably the best description of \nthe consensus on the meaning of those provisions.\n  To the extent the Committee Report does not address a particular \nprovision of the recycling amendments, the Committee may very well have \nchosen to be silent on the point. With respect to such provisions, the \n``plain language'' of the statute must be our guide.\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n  I am proud of our accomplishment in finally passing the Superfund \nRecycling Equity Act with broad bi-partisan support. This could not \nhave happened without the hard work and cooperation of Senator Lott. \nAnd the significance of this accomplishment is by no means compromised \nby the absence of agreement on any legislative history. As usual, it \nwill be for the courts to resolve questions of interpretation on a \ncase-by-case basis, applying the bill to a wide range of potential \nfactual situations.\n  I again thank the distinguished majority leader for his work on this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S77-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S77-S78]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THE FIRST SESSION OF THE 106th CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes at the \nbeginning of the second session of the 106th Congress to comment on \nseveral legislative initiatives I authored in the first session, and \nwhich I am pleased to say either passed or were substantially \nincorporated into other bills that were approved and signed into law by \nthe President last year.\n  One of the most important issues for my state of Utah is the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) Amendments of 1999, S. 1515, \nwhich I introduced last year. I am delighted that the Senate passed \nthis important legislation in November.\n  This bill will guarantee that our government provides fair \ncompensation to the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the \nmining of uranium and from fallout during the testing of nuclear \nweapons in the early post-war years.\n  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell; the distinguished Senate Minority \nLeader, Senator Tom Daschle; Senator Jeff Bingaman; and Senator Peter \nDomenici all joined me in introducing this legislation.\n  In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) was \nenacted in law. RECA, which I was proud to sponsor, required the \nfederal government to compensate those who were harmed by the \nradioactive fallout from atomic testing. Administered through the \nDepartment of Justice, RECA has been responsible for compensating \napproximately 6,000 individuals for their injuries. Since the passage \nof the 1990 law, I have been continuously monitoring the implementation \nof the RECA program.\n  Quite candidly, I have been disturbed over numerous reports from my \nUtah constituents about the difficulty they have encountered when they \nhave attempted to file claims with the Department of Justice. I \nintroduced S. 1515 in response to their concerns.\n  This bill honors our nation's commitment to the thousands of \nindividuals who were victims of radiation exposure while supporting our \ncountry's national defense. I believe we have an obligation to care for \nthose who were injured, especially since, at the time, they were not \nadequately warned about the potential health hazards involved with \ntheir work.\n  Another issue which many of my constituents contacted me about over \nthe past year was the Medicare provisions contained in the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act (BBA) and the impact of these provisions on health \ncare providers and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I am extremely pleased that the House and Senate approved the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Adjustment Act of 1999 and that President \nClinton signed the measure into law.\n  This important bill will help to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries \ncan continue to receive high-quality, accessible health care.\n  Overall, the bill increases payments for nursing homes, hospitals, \nhome health agencies, managed care plans, and other Medicare providers. \nIt will also increase payments for rehabilitative therapy services, and \nlonger coverage of immunosuppressive drugs.\n  Over $17 billion in legislative restorations are contained in this \npackage for the next 10 years.\n  Clearly we now know that there were unintended consequences as a \nresult of the reimbursement provisions contained in the BBA. Many of \nthe changes provided for in the BBA resulted in far more severe \nreductions in spending that we projected in 1997.\n  As a result, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and \nhospitals have been particularly hard hit from these changes in the \nMedicare law.\n  In 1997, Medicare was in a serious financial condition and was \nprojected to go bankrupt in the year 2001. The changes we made in 1997 \nsaved Medicare from financial insolvency and have resulted in extending \nthe program's solvency until 2015.\n  Nevertheless, the reductions we enacted in 1997 created a serious \nsituation for many health care providers who simply are not being \nadequately reimbursed for the level and quality of care they were \nproviding.\n  This situation is particularly evident in the nursing home industry.\n  Many skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, are now facing bankruptcy \nbecause the current prospective payment system, which was enacted as \npart of the BBA, does not adequately compensate for the costs of care \nto medically complex patients.\n  As a result, I introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality \nNursing Home Care Act of 1999, S. 1500, which was designed to provide \nimmediate financial relief to nursing homes who care for medically \ncomplex patients.\n  The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, was the \nprincipal cosponsor of this important legislation. And I would like to \ntake this opportunity now to thank him for the extraordinary effort he \nmade in helping to have major provisions of our bill incorporated into \nthe final conference agreement on the BBA refinement bill.\n  Moreover, I want to thank the other 44 Senators who cosponsored S. \n1500 and who lent their support in helping to move this issue to \nconference.\n  This is an important victory for Medicare beneficiaries who depend on \nnursing home care.\n  As we have seen over the past several years, those beneficiaries with \nmedically complex conditions were having difficulty in gaining access \nto nursing home facilities, or SNFs, because many SNFs simply did not \nwant to accept these patients due to the low reimbursement levels paid \nby Medicare.\n  The current prospective payment system is flawed. It does not \naccurately account for the costs of these patients with complex \nconditions.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has acknowledged that \nthe system needs to be corrected.\n  Under the provisions of the BBA Restoration bill we are passing \ntoday, reimbursement rates are increased by 20% for 15 payment \ncategories, or the Resource Utilization Groups--RUGs--beginning in \nApril 2000. These increases are temporary until HCFA has fine-tuned the \nPPS and made adjustments to reflect a more accurate cost for these \npayment categories.\n  Moreover, after the temporary increases have expired, all payment \ncategories will be increased by 4% in fiscal year 2001 and 2002.\n  These provisions will provide immediate increases of $1.4 billion to \nnursing home facilities to care for these high-cost patients.\n  In addition, the bill also gives nursing homes the option to elect to \nbe paid at the full federal rate for SNF PPS which will provide an \nadditional $700 million to the nursing community.\n  I would also add that I am pleased the conference report includes a \nprovision to provide a two-year moratorium on the physical/speech \ntherapy and occupational therapy caps that were enacted as part of the \nBBA.\n  As we all well know, these arbitrary caps have resulted in \nconsiderable pain and difficulty for thousands of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who have met and exceeded the therapy caps.\n  I joined my colleague and good friend, Senator Grassley, as a \ncosponsor of this important legislation and I want to commend him for \nhis leadership in getting this bill incorporated into the final BBA \nrefinement conference report.\n  There are many other important features of this bill that are \nincluded in the conference report agreement and, clearly, these \nprovisions will do a great deal to help restore needed Medicare funding \nto providers.\n  The bottomline is all of this is ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to quality health care. We need to keep that promise and I \nbelieve we have done that through the passage of this legislation.\n  Overall, $2.7 billion is restored to SNFs under this legislation.\n  With respect to other providers, I would briefly add that the bill \ncontains funding for home health agencies as well. The bill will ease \nthe administrative requirements on home health agencies as well as \ndelay the 15 percent reduction in reimbursement rate for one year. This \nreduction was to have taken effect on October 2000 but will now be \ndelayed for one year until October 1, 2001.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n  I have worked very closely with my home health agencies in my state \nwho were extremely concerned over the impact of the 15% reduction next \nyear. I am pleased to tell them that we have addressed their concerns \nby delaying this reduction for another year. I think this time will \ngive us an opportunity to focus on this provision to determine what \nother adjustments, if any, may be required in the future.\n  Overall, the bill adds $1.3 billion back into the home health care \ncomponent of Medicare.\n  So I believe we have taken some significant steps to ensure that home \nhealth care agencies will be able to operate without the threat of \nincreased Medicare reductions on their bottomline.\n  We have also taken steps to help hospitals and teaching hospitals \nwith over $7 billion in Medicare restorations. These increases will \nhelp to smooth the transition to the PPS for outpatient services--an \nissue that was brought to my attention by practically every hospital \nadministrator in my state.\n  On the separate, but equally important issue of children's graduate \nmedical education funding, I am especially pleased that the House \npassed legislation that will authorize, for the first time, a new \nprogram to provide children's hospitals with direct and indirect \ngraduate medical education funding.\n  Indepednet children's hospitals, including Primary Children's \nHospital in Salt Lake City, receive very little Medicare graduate \nmedical education funding (GME). This is because they treat very few \nMedicare patients, only children with end stage renal disease, and thus \ndo not  benefit from federal GME support through Medicare.\n\n  I cosponsored legislation to provide greater GME funding for \nchildren's hospitals. The bill passed the Senate and House, and was \nsigned into law by the President.\n  Moreover, $40 million is contained in the omnibus FY 2000 \nappropriation's bill that will serve as an excellent foundation on \nwhich to provide assistance to children's hospitals.\n  I am also pleased that provisions from S. 1626, the Medicare Patient \nAccess to Technology Act, were included in the BBA refinement bill.\n  These important provisions guarantee senior citizens access to the \nbest medical technology and pharmaceuticals. Currently, Medicare \nbeneficiaries do not always have access to the most innovative \ntreatments because Medicare reimbursement rates are inadequate. And I \njust don't think that it's fair to older Americans. My provisions \ncontained in the conference report change this by allowing more \nreasonable Medicare reimbursements for these therapies.\n  Take John Rapp, my constituent from Salt Lake City.\n  Mr. Rapp, who is 71 years old, was diagnosed with prostate cancer \nlast May. He was presented with a series of treatment options and \ndecided to have BRACHY therapy because it was minimally invasive, he \ncould receive it as an outpatient and it had fewer complications than \nradical surgery.\n  This new innovative therapy implants radioactive seeds in the \nprostate gland in order to kill cancer cells. The success rate of this \ntherapy has been overwhelming.\n  So, what's the problem? Without my legislation, services such as \nBRACHY therapy would not be available in the hospital outpatient \nsetting to future Medicare patients due to the way the outpatient \nprospective payment system is being designed.\n  Life saving services such as BRACHY therapy would be reimbursed at \nsignificantly lower-reimbursement rates, from approximately $10,000 to \n$1,500, and, therefore, it would not be cost-effective for hospitals to \noffer this service. Fortunately, the provisions included in the \nconference report change all of that--innovative treatments, such as \nBRACHY therapy, will now be available to future prostate cancer \npatients.\n  We must get the newest technology, to seniors as quickly as possible. \nGovernment bureaucracy should not stand in the way of seniors receiving \nthe best care available.\n  We must put Medicare patients first, not government bureaucracy. That \nis why my legislation is necessary and I am so pleased that it was \nincluded in the Medicare package of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous other provisions in this BBA \nrefinement package that I will not take the time to comment on now, but \nthey are equally important and I want to commend the leadership in the \nSenate and House for working to put together this important measure \nthat will clearly help millions of Medicare beneficiaries throughout \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S78-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S78]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TARGETED GUN DEALER ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Brady law has been very successful. The \nfederal law that requires background checks on deals conducted by \nfederally licensed firearms dealers has prevented more than 470,000 \nprohibited persons from purchasing firearms. Unfortunately, the Brady \nlaw is not the only law enforcement tool needed to prevent felons from \npurchasing firearms.\n  Straw purchases are probably the best-known way around the Brady law. \nStraw purchases occur when a buyer with a clean record is hired to \npurchase a gun for someone who is prohibited by law from buying the gun \nor does not want to be traced. Often times, this is how gun trafficking \nis facilitated. Firearms are bought in the legal marketplace, and then \ntransferred directly to the secondary market, where there are virtually \nno restrictions.\n  A new report issued by Senator Schumer shows that most guns used in \ncrimes are purchased in this secondary market. According to the report, \nwhich analyzed data compiled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms, in 13 percent of crimes, the crime gun could be traced to the \noriginal buyer and in 87 percent of the crimes, the gun had transferred \nhands.\n  Many of the time, these crime guns can be traced back to a small \npercentage of high volume dealers, who are willing to sell a single \nperson a large quantity of firearms. Guns bought in these large \nquantities are often characterized by a short ``time to crime,'' or a \nshort period between the sale and time they are used in criminal acts. \nIn another report issued by Senator Schumer, a small percentage of \nlicensed dealers are responsible for a disproportionate number of crime \nguns. Specifically, in 1998, 137 dealers, or 1.1 percent of all gun \ndealers, were responsible for selling 13,000 crime guns.\n  Mr. President, I am the cosponsor of a bill that would give ATF the \nauthority it needs to put an end to these practices. The Targeted Gun \nDealer Enforcement Act of 1999 focuses in on a specific group of \nbusinesses, who have an abysmal record of having their products used \nfor illegal activities. It would outlaw all straw purchasing and give \nATF additional law enforcement tools to suspend the licenses of high-\nvolume crime gun dealers. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and \nhelp put an end to these unscrupulous practices, which keep violent \npersons armed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S78-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S78]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S78-3", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S78-S81]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6926.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to lifetime \n     health care for military retirees; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 183\n\n       Whereas, The men and women who have devoted themselves to \n     military service on behalf of their fellow citizens are \n     entitled to receive the benefits promised them when they \n     began their patriotic service. When these people signed up \n     for the difficult and dangerous work of protecting our \n     country and way of life, they were assured that the country \n     would provide lifetime health care benefits; and\n       Whereas, This implied contract is not being fulfilled. Upon \n     reaching the age of sixty-five, military retirees lose a \n     significant portion of promised health care due to Medicare \n     eligibility. This situation is made more severe by the fact \n     that many military retirees do not live near military \n     treatment facilities; and\n       Whereas, Military retirees have significantly less access \n     to health care than other retired federal employees covered \n     under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. This is \n     especially true in light of inequities between coverages for \n     pharmaceuticals; and\n       Whereas, There are proposals under consideration in \n     Congress to rectify this problem and extend to military \n     retirees the benefits they have earned and deserve. In \n     addition, there are pilot projects operating that address the \n     problem by allowing Medicare-eligible retirees to enroll in a \n     program through the Department of Defense. Clearly, there are \n     options available to provide military retirees the care to \n     which they are entitled; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress and the President of the United \n     States to maintain or improve our nation's commitment to \n     military retirees to provide lifetime health care; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-374. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to compensation \n     for members of the military reserve and national guard when \n     called to active duty; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 213\n\n       Whereas, the members of the military reserves and National \n     Guard represent a vital\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\n     component of our national defense. From the birth of our \n     country, civilian soldiers have made the swift transition to \n     take up arms in our country's times of need. Since the end of \n     the Cold War, our reservists have shouldered a heavier burden \n     as the active military has been reduced; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, with mobilizations in the Middle \n     East and the Balkan Peninsula, for example, reservists and \n     National Guard units called to active duty have proven \n     invaluable in all facets of military operations. This recent \n     experience has also made it clear that the men and women \n     serving in this role often do so at significant personal \n     costs. This cost includes not only the financial strains on \n     families, but also the burden facing the families and the \n     small business operations that lose the contributions of the \n     person who has donned a military uniform. In situations where \n     the reservist or guard member is a medical professional, for \n     example, several people can be deprived of their livelihoods \n     for an indefinite period of time. This hardship becomes even \n     more severe and long lasting if a business is lost; and\n       Whereas, some members of Congress, military leadership, and \n     other observers have expressed concern for this future \n     strength of our military as fewer young people pursue \n     military service. In light of these factors, it seems logical \n     to respond appropriately to the genuine needs of those who \n     are already committed to the service of our country through \n     the military. It is important that serious efforts be made to \n     address this of those who are already committed to the \n     service of our country through the military. It is important \n     that serious efforts be made to address this situation \n     swiftly: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide \n     proper compensation and protection to members of the military \n     reserves and National Guard when called to active duty to \n     safeguard against financial and professional hardships; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-375. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to disability \n     compensation for military retirees; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 214\n\n       Whereas, The men and women who devote themselves to our \n     nation's defense through careers in the military provide \n     their fellow citizens with a quality of life and freedom \n     unsurpassed anywhere on earth. This service routinely puts \n     our military personnel at risk for injuries far more \n     threatening than dangers inherent in most civilian \n     professions; and\n       Whereas, Those pursuing military careers are promised a \n     full retirement upon twenty or more years of active service. \n     In addition to this service, the men and women who have \n     served in the armed forces are sometimes called back into \n     duty during mobilizations; and\n       Whereas, Currently, a person who becomes eligible for \n     disability compensation as a result of a service-related \n     injury sees retirement benefits reduced by the amount of \n     compensation being paid for the injury. This situation has \n     long been a source of discouragement and frustration for \n     career military personnel. Their unique services and exposure \n     to hardships should be recognized in the law as an indication \n     of the appreciation of our citizens for the risks of military \n     service; and\n       Whereas, There are measures before Congress to provide that \n     disability payments and retirement benefits can be made \n     concurrently, without deduction from either. This legislation \n     needs to be enacted to keep faith with those to whom our \n     nation has made promises that are an obligation of honor with \n     people who preserve our cherished way of life. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation permitting military retirees to receive \n     disability compensation for service injuries without any \n     reduction in retirement pay; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-376. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to quality of \n     and access to health care for veterans; to the Committee on \n     Veterans Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 205\n\n       Whereas, With the move to a balanced federal budget, many \n     people are concerned over the impact of increasingly limited \n     funds for vitally important services. An area of special \n     concern is the health care provided to our veterans, \n     especially through the facilities and programs of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, For those who served our country with sacrifice \n     and valor in the Armed Forces, the VA health programs \n     represent a fulfillment of a promise. The programs and \n     facilities are literally a lifeline for many. This promise on \n     the part of our nation--to care for our veterans in their \n     times of need--cannot be forgotten or abandoned. The move to \n     bring austerity and fiscal responsibility to government \n     spending cannot override the needs of the veterans who now \n     rely on us as we relied on them in our nation's times of \n     need; and\n       Whereas, Funding to care for veterans who have suffered \n     grave injuries must not be jeopardized. Veterans bedridden by \n     injuries and dependent on VA health services have every right \n     to the same level of dedication they gave to America in \n     battles to preserve our way of life. To decrease our \n     financial and emotional commitment to these patriots through \n     inadequate care is wrong. Continuing cutbacks in funding and \n     reductions in service and personal care represent a flawed \n     approach to caring for men and women who have earned our \n     lasting gratitude: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to assure that \n     quality and access to health care for veterans are maintained \n     or improved; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-377.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan relative to the quality of and \n     access to health care for veterans; to the Committee on \n     Veterans Affairs.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, With the move to a balanced federal budget, many \n     people are concerned over the impact of increasingly limited \n     funds for vitally important services. An area of special \n     concern is the health care provided to our\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n     veterans, especially through the facilities and programs of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs; and\n       Whereas, For those who served our country with sacrifice \n     and valor in the Armed Forces, the VA health programs \n     represent a fulfillment of a promise. The programs and \n     facilities are literally a lifeline for many. This promise on \n     the part of our nation--to care for our veterans in their \n     times of need--cannot be forgotten or abandoned. The move to \n     bring austerity and fiscal responsibility to government \n     spending cannot override the needs of the veterans who now \n     rely on us as we relied on them in our nation's times of \n     need; and\n       Whereas, Funding to care for veterans who have suffered \n     grave injuries must not be jeopardized. Veterans bedridden by \n     injuries and dependent on VA health services have every right \n     to the same level of dedication they gave to America in \n     battles to preserve our way of life. To decrease our \n     financial and emotional commitment to these patriots through \n     inadequate care is wrong. Continuing cutbacks in funding and \n     reductions in service and personal care represent a flawed \n     approach to caring for men and women who have earned our \n     lasting gratitude; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to assure that quality and access to health care for \n     veterans are maintained; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-395. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     the Federalism Act of 1999; to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 233\n\n       Whereas, Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States \n     Constitution, if a Federal law or regulation adopted \n     appropriately pursuant to one of the Federal Government's \n     powers conflicts with state law, then Federal law preempts \n     state law; and\n       Whereas, This is as it should be and is as the Framers of \n     the Constitution intended; and\n       Whereas, The problem is that the frequency and pace of \n     Federal preemption of state law has, in recent years, \n     increased dramatically; and\n       Whereas, Today state and local governments find it \n     increasingly difficult to play their traditional role within \n     our system of constitutional federalism; and\n       Whereas, The increasing reliance upon Federal preemption \n     means that the policy jurisdiction of state legislatures and \n     of city and county councils has been lost; and\n       Whereas, When states and localities cannot legislate in \n     response to their citizen's needs because the Federal \n     Government has preempted the policy field, then the capacity \n     for regional and local self-government is lost; and\n       Whereas, The advantages of federalism are that laws will be \n     adapted to local needs and conditions and will reflect \n     regional and community values and that it allows greater \n     responsiveness and innovation through local self-government; \n     and\n       Whereas, The proposed Federalism Act addresses the \n     increasing problem of the preemption of state and local laws \n     by providing Congress with more information about the \n     preemptive impact of legislative proposals, providing a rule \n     of construction urging the courts to limit findings that \n     preemption is implied where in fact there is neither a direct \n     conflict between state and Federal law nor a clear expression \n     by Congress of its intent to preempt and providing for notice \n     and consultation procedures in the Federal administrative \n     process to encourage Federal agencies to take federalism and \n     preemption issues more fully into account in the course of \n     rulemaking; and\n       Whereas, Preemption must be limited if we are to enjoy the \n     advantages of federalism which foster policymaking respecting \n     America's diversity and a policymaking process which \n     encourages innovation and responsiveness; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President of the \n     United States and the Congress to support and approve The \n     Federalism Act of 1999; H.R. 2245 (1999), which \n     comprehensively addresses the Federal preemption of state law \n     with ``one-size-fits-all'' national policy; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-396. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 227\n\n       Whereas, The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (Public Law 91-230, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.) was first \n     enacted in 1970 as the Education of the Handicapped Act \n     (Public Law 91-230, 84 Stat. 175); and\n       Whereas, The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     protects the rights of children with disabilities to be \n     educated in the least restrictive environment through a \n     continuum of appropriate services and placements; and\n       Whereas, Beginning in 1996, educators and lawmakers saw \n     congressional reauthorization as an opportunity to make \n     changes, particularly in the area of giving local school \n     districts more flexibility to reduce costs and to discipline \n     disabled students whose misconduct jeopardizes school safety \n     or unreasonably disrupts classroom learning; and\n       Whereas, Despite the omnibus changes made during the 1997 \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act reauthorization, \n     superintendents and local school boards of directors are \n     gravely concerned about potential cost increases related to \n     conforming to the new law and its implementing regulations; \n     and\n       Whereas, Added procedural requirements and timelines and \n     operational difficulties may be encountered by school \n     entities in complying with the new law, particularly its very \n     complex and detailed implementing regulations; and\n       Whereas, Assuring that appropriate procedural safeguards \n     remain in place for the disabled children is expected to \n     further exacerbate the already high per pupil costs for \n     special education; and\n       Whereas, When the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act was created, the Congress of the United States promised \n     to provide 40% of its funding, but the $4 billion \n     appropriated in fiscal year 1997-1998 paid for less than 9% \n     of the program; and\n       Whereas, The lack of an adequate and appropriate Federal \n     fiscal commitment leaves State and local taxpayers bearing a \n     disproportionate share of the costs to comply with these \n     Federal mandates; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives memorialize \n     Congress to fully fund its obligations under the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-397.

A bill to amend title 49 of the United States Code to expand \nState authority with respect to pipeline safety, to establish new \nFederal requirements to improve pipeline safety, to authorize \nappropriations under chapter 601 of that title for fiscal years 2001 \nthrough 2005, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      pipeline safety act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at the start of this session, I've come \nto the floor to introduce a bill that will improve the safety of all \nAmericans by raising the safety standards on the oil and gas pipelines \nthat run through our communities.\n  Today, I'm introducing the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000.\n  Until recently, like many Americans, I wasn't aware of the potential \nsafety hazards that pipelines can pose. These pipelines stretch across \nAmerica--running under our homes and near our schools and offices. \nNationwide, the Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 157,000 \nmiles of underground pipeline which transport hazardous liquids and \nmore than 2.2 million miles of pipeline which transport natural gas. \nThey perform a vital service--bringing oil and essential products to \nour homes and businesses. I rarely heard about them, so I assumed they \nwere safe.\n  But last year, there was a deadly pipeline accident in my home state \nof Washington. And the more I learned about how pipelines are regulated \nin the United States--the more concerned I became.\n  Today, seven months after that disaster in Bellingham, I am here on \nthe Senate floor with a bill that takes the lessons of pipeline \ndisasters and turns them into law--so that these tragedies won't happen \nagain.\n  Mr. President, on June 10th, in Bellingham, Washington, a gas \npipeline ruptured--releasing more than a quarter of a million gallons \nof gasoline into Whatcom Creek. The gas ignited--sending a huge \nfireball racing down the creek--destroying everything in its path for \nmore than a mile. The dramatic explosion killed three young people who \nhappened to be playing by the creek. It created a plume of smoke which \nrose more than twenty-thousand feet into the air. This photo behind me \nwas taken just moments after the explosion. One minute, a quiet \nresidential area; the next moment, a disaster.\n\n  Besides the tragic loss of these three young lives, this explosion \ncaused horrendous environmental damage. In fact, I was scheduled to be \nat this exact site just a few weeks later to designate a newly restored \nsalmon spawning ground. When I saw the damage a short time after the \nexplosion, frankly, I was shocked.\n  Take a look at these pictures. This was before the explosion where we \nwere going to dedicate a salmon creek spawning ground. This is \nafterwards. As you can see, this explosion destroyed all of the plant \nand animal life in the creek, and it was once a lush and diverse \nhabitat. In moments, it was destroyed and gone.\n  The explosion also had an impact on the entire community. Neighbors \ncould not sleep at night, and young children--still to this day--panic \nduring lightning storms. And, of course, three\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nfamilies--who lost their children--will never be the same.\n  Mr. President, as I researched this issue, I learned that what \nhappened in my state was not unique--in fact--it wasn't even rare. \nAccording to the Office of Pipeline Safety, since 1986, there have been \nmore than 5,500 incidents, resulting in 310 deaths and 1,500 injuries. \nThose 5,500 incidents also caused nearly a billion dollars in property \ndamage. On average, our nation suffers one pipeline accident every day.\n  Clearly, this is a national problem--requiring a national solution. \nThis chart shows some of the major pipeline accidents since 1981. This \nchart only shows the accidents investigated by the National \nTransportation Safety Board--not all 5,500.\n  As you can see, these disasters can occur anywhere--in anyone's \nneighborhood, in anyone's community, close to anybody's school, near \nanybody's place of work. And they have devastating results.\n  While the pipeline industry--by and large--does a good job of safely \ndelivering the fuel we need to heat our homes and drive our cars, there \nare some examples where they failed to protect the public.\n  According to a New York Times article from January 14th of this year:\n\n       One of the nation's largest pipeline operators quit \n     inspecting its lines for much of the 1990's and instead found \n     flaws by waiting for the pipes to break. Koch Industries \n     agreed to pay a fine of $30 million--the largest civil \n     environmental penalty to date.\n\n  That company's behavior resulted in leaks of three million gallons of \ncrude oil, gasoline, and other products in 300 separate incidents in \nthe last nine years.\n  We can't just rely on the industry to police itself. As this example \nshowed, one company decided it was cheaper to wait for accidents to \nhappen, than to take steps to prevent them. The time has come to raise \nthe standards for pipeline safety.\n  Too often the public is left in the dark. Neighbors don't know they \nlive near pipelines. Schools and communities aren't told when there are \nproblems with a pipeline. The time has come to expand the public's \nright to know about the pipelines that run near their homes.\n  Too often pipelines operators don't have the training or experience \nthey need to handle emergencies. Sometimes their actions cause \naccidents, and many times they make these disasters even worse. We \nshould certify pipeline inspectors so we will know they have the \ntraining they need. In fact, in 1992 Congress passed a law requiring \ncertification of pipeline operators. But a few years later, that \nrequirement was repealed. That's a mistake we need to correct, and \ntoday, the need for qualified, certified operators is even greater.\n  Too often there aren't enough resources to oversee the industry or to \ncarry out vital safety programs. The time has come to put the resources \nbehind these new standards.\n  The time has come to reduce the risks pipeline pose. And the bill I'm \nintroducing today does just that.\n  Here are the key provisions of my bill:\n  First, my bill will expand state authority to give states more \ncontrol over pipeline safety standards. It's time to make states equal \npartners when it comes to pipeline safety. States should be able to use \ntheir knowledge of local conditions and circumstances to increase \nsafety. States should be able to set up even more stringent standards \nthan the federal government in areas like:\n  Requiring additional training and education of inspectors and \noperators;\n  Allowing states to require additional leak detection devices;\n  Allowing states to certify procedures and responses to accidents; and\n  Allowing states to enforce regulations.\n  While some new state authority gives the Secretary of Transportation \nthe discretion to allow states to regulate, it is my intent that the \nSecretary work aggressively at accomplishing these partnerships in the \nway I outline in my bill.\n  I also strongly support efforts to better equip states as they \nrespond to accidents. This involves better coordination between state \nand federal agencies so that police, fire, and emergency medical \npersonnel will be better able to respond to pipeline disasters. The \nfederal government should also encourage states to work more closely \nwith pipeline companies on prevention.\n  Second, my bill will improve inspection practices.\n  We must develop guidelines and requirements for the internal and \nexternal inspection of pipelines. Current law only requires that \npipelines be inspected internally when they are new and being used for \nthe first time.\n  My bill requires pipeline companies to periodically inspect their \npipelines internally and externally and report their findings to \nfederal and state authorities, as well as the public. My bill also \nrequires pipeline companies to take action if those findings uncover \nproblems.\n  Third, my bill will strengthen the public's ``right to know.''\n  Currently the public does not have the right to know about spills and \nproblems with pipelines. My bill would require pipeline companies to \ndisclose problems with the pipeline and what the company is doing to \nfix them. It will require pipeline companies to report to the public \nany spill and also to report the results of the periodic testing I am \nproposing.\n  Fourth, my bill will improve the quality of pipeline operators.\n  Current law allows companies to determine if their own operator is \n``qualified'' to work on a pipeline. My bill would place the government \nin the position of determining whether the companies' assessment is \naccurate. We wouldn't want an airline pilot flying a plane unless the \nFAA determined he was qualified. Similarly, we should require the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety to review and certify the qualifications of \npipeline operators.\n  Finally, my bill will increase funding to improve safety.\n  We should increase funding for research that will help improve the \ndevices that inspect pipelines and detect leads. We should also \nincrease grant programs to state agencies that regulate and monitor \npipelines. This should be a partnership that recognizes both the state \nand federal responsibility in making pipelines safer.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill today because I know \nit's the right thing to do. This has been a long process, and I've \nreceived a lot of cooperation. Specifically, I would like to thank U.S. \nSecretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, the Office of Pipeline \nSafety, the National Transportation Safety Board, the City of \nBellingham, my colleagues in the Senate, Gov. Locke, other federal and \nstate agencies, and industry representatives. Senator Gorton, my \ncolleague from Washington State, is well aware of the importance of \nthis issue and I look forward to his continued input.\n  I'm also looking forward to working with my colleagues in the House--\nspecifically Representatives Inslee, Metcalf, and Baird--who have \nexpressed interest in this issue.\n  This bill will raise safety standards so that every family that lives \nnear a pipeline can sleep soundly at night. This accident should not \nhappen again. The time has come to take the lessons of this tragedy and \nput them into law--so we can reduce the odds of another disaster. We \nhave a responsibility to do it, this bill gives us the tools to do it, \nand I hope you will support me in this effort.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be interested in the Senator's \npipeline safety bill. That is a matter that is important. The pipelines \nare so much safer than trucks and other forms of distribution of fossil \nfuel. We are moving toward the use of natural gas, which burns so much \ncleaner than coal, fossil fuel, and other fuels. I think we will be \nhaving more pipelines around the country. I think it will be essential. \nIt will be a positive environmental step to move forward with it.\n  I have been somewhat discouraged that the Vice President has \nindicated he opposes drilling for natural gas off the gulf coast where \nit can be done so much more safely than drilling for liquid gas. We \nhave had very few problems of any kind drilling off the coast. In fact, \nit produces the cleanest burning fuel we have. We have the Vice \nPresident opposing nuclear power, and now we are shutting off our \ncapacity to reach natural gas which we are now using to generate \nelectricity at a fraction of the environmental pollutants that other \nforms of energy generate. We are reaching a point of boxing ourselves \nin. We are supposed to reach\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\ncleaner air goals under the Kyoto agreement. The President and Vice \nPresident say we should go forward, but we are boxing ourselves in.\n  We need to maintain an efficient gas pipeline system in America to \ngenerate the energy for the needs we have while continuing to reduce \npollutants in the atmosphere. It has to be safe, too. I am willing to \nlook at that. I certainly don't favor additional regulations, but if it \npromotes safety, I think it is something we ought to talk about.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Grams, \n        and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2005. A bill to repeal the modification of the installment method; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            repeal of a tax on the sale of small businesses\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will repeal a \nlittle-noticed, yet extremely detrimental, installment tax provision on \nsmall businesses.\n  This provisions, enacted at the end of last year's congressional \nsession as part of the conference report of H.R. 1180, the Ticket to \nWork and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 was placed into effect \non December 17 when President Clinton signed the bill.\n  According to this provision, many small-business owners who sell \ntheir businesses will now have to immediately pay in one lump sum all \ncapital gains taxes resulting from the sale, even if the sale's \npayments are spread out in installments over a period of several years. \nUnder previous treatment, the capital gain tax payment could be spread \nover the life of the installment note.\n  An unintended consequence of this provision has been to adversely \naffect the sale of small businesses. Most sales of these businesses use \nthe installment sales method. Larger publicly traded corporations are \nnot impacted as they tend to use other financing methods involving cash \nor stock transactions.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), \nit is possible that most of the 200,000 small business sales which \noccur each year will be adversely affected by this provision. Some \nestimates show that, depending upon the circumstances, this provision \ncould reduce the sale price of a business by 5, 10, 20 percent or more.\n  My legislation will repeal the elimination of this provision giving \nsmall business owners the opportunity to defer over the period of \npayments the capital gains tax on the sale of their business.\n  Mr. President, the American public is aware of this tax. I have seen \npress releases, newspaper articles and even a story on a national news \nnetwork. This will effect not only the liquidity and price a seller is \nrequired to accept for a business.\n  We're not talking about major corporations--rather, we are talking \nabout small businesses--a local hamburger joint, a laundromat, a car \nwash, the businesses that support a community.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the small business owner by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2006. A bill for the relief of Yongyi Song; read the first time.\n\n\n                       Private Relief Legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. The thrust of the private relief bill and the concurrent \nresolution is that they seek relief for Mr. Yongyi Song, who is a \nlibrarian at Dickinson College of Carlisle, PA. Mr. Song was detained \nin Beijing, China, on August 7 of this year and on Christmas Eve was \ncharged with ``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to \nforeign institutions.''\n  Two days ago, the People's Republic of China announced that Yongyi \nSong had confessed, which I believe is a representation having \nabsolutely no credibility because Mr. Song has been held in detention \nfor months. Any statements made in that context are inherently \ncoercive, intimidating, and really of no validity at all.\n  The facts are that Yongyi Song is a distinguished and noted scholar \nwho has published extensive works about the Cultural Revolution in \nChina and that he had made a trip to the People's Republic of China \nearlier this year in order to further his academic research. Then he \nwas taken into custody without cause.\n  The resolution that has been filed calls for the People's Republic of \nChina to release Yongyi Song promptly. It calls for the fair treatment \nof lawyers in the People's Republic of China so they may practice in a \ndecent manner within their judicial system, and it calls for the \nPeople's Republic of China to put into practice the reforms in the \njudicial system which they have, in fact, adopted on paper but are not \nputting into effect as a matter of practice.\n  The relationship between the United States Government and the \nPeople's Republic of China is a complex one. We have seen repeated \nincidents by China of flagrant disregard for human rights, and this is \nanother instance. By taking Yongyi Song into custody and holding him in \ndetention without charges, and months later--from August 7 until \nChristmas Eve--finally filing charges, and then the representation of a \nconfession, which legal experts interpret to mean that they have no \ncase and are doing their best to try to fashion some make-way situation \nis perhaps the lowest ebb of disregard for human rights and for \nacademic freedom.\n  The resolution will be taken up concurrently in the House of \nRepresentatives as well. The bill for naturalization will enable the \nGovernment of the United States to take stronger action on behalf of \nMr. Song. It will enable our State Department officials, for example, \nto visit with Yongyi Song, may be instrumental in obtaining the right \nto counsel, and may be instrumental in obtaining the right to observe \nany trial which is in process.\n  There has been a marked and serious determination in the activities \nof the People's Republic of China in their criminal justice system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks the full \ntext of an article from the New York Times, dated January 6 of this \nyear, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. It concerns lawyer Liu Jian who represented the \ndefendant in a criminal case. He found that none of the 37 witnesses he \nhad lined up appeared to testify because of intimidation from the \nGovernment. He found himself, a lawyer, in police custody charged with \n``illegally obtaining evidence.'' While in custody, he was subjected to \nbeatings and day-long interrogations without food or rest, and he later \nfound his ability to practice law and his license to practice law in \njeopardy.\n  It is obviously impossible to have a judicial system that functions \nwithout lawyers. The activities of the People's Republic of China have \nbeen absolutely reprehensible in this regard. Our resolution calls for \nrelief for Yongyi Song and also calls for an improvement in the \njudicial system and the treatment of lawyers by the People's Republic \nof China.\n  Mr. President, this vital legislation would grant Mr. Yongyi Song \nU.S. citizenship. Mr. Song has been a resident of the United States for \nthe past ten years, has passed his United States citizenship tests, and \nhad been scheduled to be sworn in as a United States citizen in \nSeptember 1999. However, Mr. Song, a respected researcher and librarian \nat Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, was detained on August 7, 1999, \nin Beijing, China while collecting historical documents on the Chinese \ncultural revolution of the 1960's. After 5 months of detention, Mr. \nSong was formally ``arrested'' on Christmas Eve in China, on charges of \n``the purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreign \ninstitutions.''\n  The People's Republic of China claims Mr. Song violated Chinese \ncriminal law by collecting historical documents. However, the documents \nin Mr. Song's possession have reportedly been previously published in \nnewspapers, books, and other ``open'' sources. The historical material \nMr. Song was gathering in no way threatens the security of the Chinese \nGovernment or people. The case of Yongyi Song is an affront to basic \nhuman rights, an affront to academic freedom and affront to people \naround the world.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would waive the oath of \nallegiance and grant Mr. Song immediate citizenship, as Mr. Song passed \nthe INS naturalization test on June 7, 1999. I believe it is vital that \nCongress become involved in this case: if Mr. Song were a U.S. citizen, \nthe State Department would be in\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\na stronger position to insist on being able to see him while he is \nbeing detained, insist on monitoring any trial that may occur, and \ninsist on Mr. Song's right to counsel. Further, U.S. citizenship would \nafford Mr. Song a better chance of being expelled by the Chinese \ngovernment after the trial, rather than being forced to serve a prison \nsentence should the Chinese Government convict him in Chinese court.\n  Mr. Song was a young man in China during the Cultural Revolution and \nnow, at age 50, he is languishing in a Chinese jail as a result of \ntrying to study it. Considering the extremely high conviction rate in \nthe Chinese judicial system, it is very probable that Mr. Song will be \nconvicted despite my commitment to an all-out fight for his freedom and \ninnocence.\n  This case presents an international challenge to academic freedom and \nthe pursuit of truth. While private relief legislation is a last resort \nthat should be used sparingly by the Congress, the urgency and the \ncompelling nature of this situation is one that demands immediate and \ndefinitive action. I urge my colleagues to support me in this fight for \njustice.\n\n\n                       the yongyi song resolution\n\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce \nlegislation that will bring attention to a situation which is occurring \nin the People's Republic of China. On August 7, 1999, Mr. Yongyi Song, \na resident of Carlisle, PA, was detained in Beijing, China while \ncollecting historical documents on the Chinese cultural revolution of \nthe 1966-76.\n  Mr. Song works as a researcher and librarian at Dickinson College in \nCarlisle, PA. He is a noted scholar of Chinese cultural history and has \nauthored two books and several articles on the subject. On Christmas \neve Mr. Song was formally arrested on charges of ``the purchase and \nillegal provision of intelligence to foreign institutions.'' Yet, the \ndocuments in Mr. Song's possession have reportedly been previously \npublished in newspapers, books and other ``open'' sources.\n  His case is complicated because although Mr. Song has lived in the \nUnited States for the past ten years and has passed his citizenship \ntests, he has not been sworn in as a U.S. citizen. He was scheduled to \ntake the oath of allegiance on September 23, 1999, but was detained by \nthe PRC before he could return home.\n  The case of Yongyi Song is an affront to basic human rights, an \naffront to academic freedom and an affront to people around the world. \nThe People's Republic of China claims that Mr. Song violated Chinese \ncriminal law by collecting historical documents, yet the documents in \nMr. Song's possession have reportedly been previously published in \nnewspapers, books and other ``open'' sources. At a time when the \nChinese Government is looking for legitimacy, trying to get into the \nWorld Trade Organization and talking about improving its criminal \njustice system, this is a sharp about face.\n  This legislation I am about to introduce, a Concurrent Resolution, \nwill express the Sense of the Congress that the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) should immediately release from prison \nand drop all criminal charges against Yongyi Song. Further, it will \nencourage the PRC to make reforms to their legal system so that \ncriminal defense lawyers are guaranteed fair and professional treatment \nand encourage the PRC to conduct fair and open court proceedings.\n  In working with Mr. Song's defense team, I have learned about several \nproblems within the Chinese legal system. First, the difficulties \ncriminal defense lawyers face in representing their clients in the \nPeople's Republic of China. Over the past several years China has \nattempted to reform its legal system yet it has not been successful. \nPolice often refuse to let lawyers meet with their clients and lawyers \nare often not provided with legally guaranteed information they require \nto competently represent clients. Many times trials are not open to the \npublic or defendants families so that fair treatment of both lawyer and \nclient cannot be accurately ascertained or proven. Additionally, \ndefense lawyers are subject to harassment and interference and at times \neven arrest and imprisonment by Chinese authorities while defending \nclients. For example, in July, 1998 Liu Jian, a criminal defense lawyer \nfrom Nanjing, China was imprisoned, subjected to beatings and \n``marathon'' interrogations after he represented a local official \naccused of taking bribes.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a sharp message to the People's Republic \nof China that they immediately release Yongyi Song from prison and drop \nall charges against him. Further, we should encourage the PRC to \nprovide fair and professional treatment to criminal defense lawyers and \nwork to ensure that more court proceedings are open to the public.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 6, 2000]\n\n         In China's Legal Evolution, the Lawyers Are Handcuffed\n\n                        (By Elisabeth Rosenthal)\n\n       Nanjing, China.--Liu Jian was an idealistic new lawyer when \n     his Nanjing firm sent him to a rural town 200 miles away to \n     represent a local official accused of taking bribes.\n       Stationed in the town, Binhai, he worked round-the-clock \n     doing what defense lawyers do to prepare for trial: \n     interviewing witnesses, examining documents and--when the \n     police would allow--brainstorming with his client.\n       But when the court convened on July 13, 1998, almost none \n     of the 37 witnesses he had lined up appeared to testify. The \n     prosecutor swore and ranted at Mr. Liu, calling him a \n     criminal. And at trial's end, outside Binhai's courthouse, \n     Mr. Liu found himself in police custody, charged with \n     ``illegally obtaining evidence.''\n       Although legal experts around the country declared his \n     innocence, Mr. Liu spent a nightmarish five months in \n     detention, subjected at times to beatings and daylong \n     interrogations without food or rest.\n       ``I was released on Dec. 11, and I've tried not to have any \n     contact with the criminal law since,'' said Mr. Liu, a thin, \n     serious man with a downtrodden air, whose son was born and \n     whose mother had a heart attack while he was in jail. ``I've \n     really lost confidence in the system.''\n       Over the past decade, China has tried to overhaul its legal \n     system, training thousands of new lawyers and passing laws \n     that greatly expand their role in criminal cases--for \n     example, for the first time giving defendants in detention \n     the right to a lawyer and allowing lawyers to conduct \n     pretrial investigations.\n       But results have been mixed, especially in the country's \n     vast rural areas, where the police, prosecutors and judges \n     often chafe under the new rules. And China's young lawyers \n     have been at once a tremendous force for change and also \n     frequent victims: byproducts of a new legal system that is \n     far better established on paper than in practice.\n       ``The law has made great advances, but sometimes thinking \n     has not,'' said Li Baoyue, a criminal lawyer who also teaches \n     at Beijing's University of Politics and Law. ``It is going to \n     be a very difficult road ahead to get these new regulations \n     implemented.''\n       Although it is rare for criminal lawyers to end up in \n     prison, defense lawyers say, it is common for them to suffer \n     a barrage of problems, insults and lesser slights like these:\n       The police often refuse to let lawyers meet their clients \n     in private or in a timely manner, despite a law giving them \n     access within 48 hours.\n       Lawyers are often not provided with legally guaranteed \n     access to court material, like transcripts of confessions, \n     medical examinations and witness lists.\n       Intimidation of witnesses by the local police and \n     prosecutors often leaves lawyers with few people willing to \n     testify.\n       ``Because of these problems, it's sometimes hard to find a \n     lawyer for criminal cases,'' Professor Li said, adding that \n     the work can be dangerous. ``Many lawyers are scared they \n     could become implicated in the case and lose their \n     livelihood.'' Business law is much more lucrative, and safer\n       Gu Yongzhong, a former criminal law specialist in Beijing \n     who now takes on criminal cases only occasionally said: ``For \n     the amount of time it takes to prepare the case, it doesn't \n     pay. And it's very hard to get a not-guilty verdict.''\n       Lawyers agree that the obstacles are far greater in the \n     rural areas, where the legal training of judges and the \n     police is often poorest. But some problems are more wide-\n     spread, like the difficulty in meting defendants, lawyers \n     said.\n       Defendants in cases that are politically sensitive are \n     rarely granted their legally guaranteed rights.\n       One lawyer said that he had recently spent two weeks trying \n     to met a client detained by the Beijing Public Security \n     Bureau, which repeatedly deflected requests and turned him \n     away at the gates of the detention center before finally \n     allowing the meeting.\n       ``It usually takes some time to get to see your clients,'' \n     Mr. Gu said. ``The law enforcement agencies are not willing \n     at the start because they are worried it will interfere with \n     their investigation. Although it seems to be getting somewhat \n     better lately.''\n       Unfortunately, experts say, those first days of detention \n     are when some of the worst police abuses occur--when \n     defendants are subjected to aggressive and sometimes brutal \n     interrogation to obtain confessions. Although Chinese law \n     forbids torture, and confessions obtained by torture cannot \n     be used\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n     in court, Chinese officials acknowledge that the practice is \n     still relatively common.\n       The use of ``confession by torture remains unchecked,'' \n     said a recent commentary in the official China Youth Daily. \n     ``It is commonplace for citizens to be arbitrarily summoned, \n     forcibly seized, detained and even detained beyond legal \n     time limits, and for citizens whose freedom has been \n     restricted to be treated inhumanely.''\n       Transcripts of police interrogations with recalcitrant \n     suspects often show breaks in the questioning marked by the \n     words ``Education takes place,'' defense lawyers say. And \n     when the session resumes--voila!--a confession.\n       ``The use of torture to obtain a confession is something \n     defendants often raise, but it puts us in a very delicate \n     situation since we need facts and evidence to back up these \n     claims,'' said Sun Guoxiang, a prominent defense lawyer in \n     Nanjing who helped defend Mr. Liu. ``But it is very hard to \n     gather evidence because it is almost impossible to get access \n     to clients at these times.''\n       In Mr. Liu's case, the cultures of law and law enforcement \n     repeatedly clashed, as Mr. Liu reminded his captors of his \n     legal rights.\n       Just a high school graduate, Mr. Liu became a lawyer \n     through an arduous self-study law program affiliated with \n     Nanjing University, while working full time designing \n     furniture. The first professional from a poor rural family, \n     Mr. Liu regarded the law with a touch of awe.\n       ``I thought it was a career where I could help people, that \n     had meaning,'' he said.\n       He was admitted to the bar in 1994, when officials in \n     Beijing were writing the new Criminal Procedure Code, which \n     took effect in October 1997. That code allows lawyers to \n     formulate a defense by conducting independent investigations \n     during what prosecutors call the ``investigative period,'' a \n     stage that can last weeks if not months, when a suspect is in \n     detention but has not yet been formally charged.\n       But the police in Binhai had other ideas. On his first trip \n     to Binhai, Mr. Liu said, he and a colleague from his firm \n     were never allowed to see their client, whose wife had \n     retained the firm. When a meeting was finally permitted on a \n     subsequent visit, they were given time only to ``exchange a \n     few words''--and these with the head of the county \n     anticorruption bureau listening.\n       But a week before the trial, a longer meeting took place--\n     and Mr. Liu discovered huge discrepancies between the bribery \n     charges brought by the prosecutors and the story told by the \n     defendant, who said he had been tortured into confessing.\n       For the next week, Mr. Liu frantically--and aggressively--\n     sought out witnesses, many of whom contradicted the police \n     and some of whom said they had been threatened by local \n     officials.\n       ``Our impression wasn't that our client was totally \n     innocent,'' Mr. Liu said, ``but we felt that the prosecution \n     needed to provide better evidence to make the charges \n     stand.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  It's the Lawyers Who Are Handcuffed\n\n       Although the realist in him ``kind of expected'' a guilty \n     verdict because ``the prosecutor had a lot riding on the \n     corruption case,'' his lawyer side thought he might have a \n     chance.\n       That hope quickly dissipated once his witnesses failed to \n     appear--except the defendant's wife and one nervous man who \n     repeatedly contradicted himself--and the court struck down \n     each point he raised.\n       Still, during closing arguments, Mr. Liu was ``shocked'' to \n     hear the prosecutor attacking not the defendant, but the \n     defense team. The prosecutor charged that Mr. Liu had broken \n     the law: that he had ``deliberately induced witnesses to give \n     false evidence'' and then ``presented testimony that he knew \n     to be false to the court''--charges that Chinese legal \n     experts have loudly protested.\n       Professor Li of the University of Politics and Law said, \n     ``In certain cases, when law enforcement bodies don't have a \n     highly developed legal mentality, they assume lawyers doing \n     their professional work are doing the bidding of villains.''\n       He added that there was often tension between the rural \n     police, few of whom have gone beyond high school, and the \n     better-educated, relatively high-earning lawyers who enter \n     their turf.\n       After Mr. Liu was detained, he refused to eat for a day, to \n     protest a jailing he regarded as illegal. He repeatedly \n     reminded the police about the legal time limit on detention \n     and his right to see a lawyer, with little effect.\n       For the first 10 days he was not even allowed to contact \n     his own law firm, he said. For the entire five months in \n     custody he was not permitted to speak to his wife. He learned \n     about the birth of his son from a prosecutor.\n       In marathon interrogations, the police first urged him to \n     confess, then, when he demurred, ``reminded'' him that he had \n     ``forced witnesses'' to change their testimony. Mr. Liu said \n     they made him stand for hours or beat him until his mouth \n     filled with blood when he refused to confirm their version of \n     events. He said they wrote out a confession for him, which he \n     eventually read to a camera.\n       Legal experts from Nanjing and Beijing rallied to his \n     defense, sending lawyers to defend him at his trial, set for \n     October 1998, and preparing statements declaring his \n     innocence.\n       He was grateful for their support, but ultimately dared not \n     test the system, deciding to plead guilty in exchange for a \n     light sentence, consisting of time served.\n       ``Because of the mental pressure I was under, I was forced \n     to admit to their charges,'' he said. ``I thought, `I'm not \n     going to receive justice here.' I wanted to get out a soon as \n     possible and thought then I could set about clearing my \n     name.''\n       Mr. Liu is now appealing the judgment, although lawyers say \n     that with a videotaped confession he will have a hard time \n     officially clearing his name. Meantime, his criminal record \n     bars him from working as a lawyer.\n       It is a frustrating limbo for a man, now only 28, whom the \n     country's top defense lawyers have declared innocent. Late \n     last year, a panel of 12 legal experts concluded that while \n     Mr. Liu's actions were ``somewhat irregular'' they ``did not \n     possess the conditions for a crime.''\n       Among Mr. Liu's ``minor breaches'' were posing questions in \n     a leading manner and interviewing witnesses alone, said Sun \n     Guoxiang, his principal defense lawyer, noting that these \n     were mostly a result of his inexperience. It is standard \n     practice in China for two lawyers to be present at \n     questioning, although Mr. Liu often worked solo because his \n     firm did not want to station two lawyers in such a remote \n     area.\n       And though the case has been devastating for Liu Jian, Mr. \n     Sun says it demonstrates both the incipient power of the \n     legal profession and how far it has to go.\n       ``On the one hand I think he was freed as early as he was \n     because lawyers are gaining more respect and playing a bigger \n     role,'' he said. ``On the other, lawyers continue to face \n     difficulties, which are closely related to the quality of the \n     law enforcement and judicial services.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2007. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nprocedures relating to the scheduling of appointments for certain non-\nemergency medical services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                 specialized medical care for veterans\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, during the recent congressional \nadjournment, I had many opportunities to meet with veterans across \nNorth Dakota and medical care professionals within the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center in Fargo regarding issues relating to \nveterans medical care and the VA budget.\n  One concern raised repeatedly by veterans and VA health care \nprofessionals related to the lengthy waiting periods for service-\nconnected, non-emergency speciality medical care. In many cases, the \nwaiting period for a veteran between the initial consultation by a VA \nhealth care professional, and the scheduled appointment with a medical \nspecialist was 6 to 10 months, and in some instances up to a year.\n  Last year, Mr. President, the Independent Budget For Fiscal Year 2000 \nprepared by the Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign \nWars and Paralyzed Veterans of America, called attention to the \nspecialized care concerns, particularly the impact of funding \nshortfalls on staffing to provide specialized medical services. The \nIndependent Budget emphasized the need to provide adequate resources \nfor veterans with speciality needs. More recently, surveys of VA \nmedical facilities by the Disabled Veterans of America confirmed no \nsignificant improvement in waiting periods for medical care at VA \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, veterans requesting speciality care at a DVA medical \nfacility are entitled to speciality care within a reasonable period of \ntime. They should not be required to wait months and months for this \nessential medical care. In response to these speciality care concerns, \nand the recommendations in the Fiscal Year 2000 Independent Budget, I \nam introducing legislation to make certain that service-connected \nveterans requesting speciality care at VA facilities receive that care \nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n  Under this legislation, the VA would be required to automatically \nreview a service-connected veteran's request for non-emergency \nspeciality care if scheduling the appointment exceeds a three week \nperiod beyond the initial VA consultation. If an appointment for \nspecialty care could not be provided at a veteran's VA facility in the \nlocal area, the VA would be required to provide the service-connected \nveteran with an appointment for care at another VA facility, or offer \nthe veteran the opportunity for speciality care through a private \nphysician in the veteran's home community.\n  Additionally, the VA would be required to report to Congress annually\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\non the waiting periods for various types of non-emergency speciality \nmedical care for service-connected veterans, especially on any critical \nproblems and staffing shortages that contribute to these waiting \nperiods. The report also requires the VA to include recommendations for \naddressing waiting periods, any staffing shortages, including special \npay adjustments, or any other modifications in pay authority that might \nbe necessary to retain and recruit speciality medical personnel.\n\n  Mr. President, I know that DVA officials and medical center personnel \nare very concerned about the waiting periods that veterans experience \nfor certain speciality medical care. D.A. personnel are also acutely \naware of speciality care staffing shortages. As reported in the \nIndependent Budget for Fiscal Year 2000, it's critical that Congress \nprovide the essential funding resources to ensure that these speciality \ncare services are met promptly. I urge the Senate Committee on Veterans \nAffairs to conduct hearings on VA speciality care and to incorporate \nthe recommendations in my legislation in appropriate veterans medical \ncare legislation that will be considered by the Senate in FY 2001.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a rural education development \ninitiative, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    rural education development initiative for the 21st century act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we spend less than a quarter of our \nnation's education dollars to educate approximately half of our \nnation's students. You don't have to be a math whiz to know that the \nnumbers just don't add up.\n  Thousands of rural and small schools across our nation face the \ndaunting mission of educating almost half of America's children. \nIncreasingly, these schools find that they are underfunded, \noverwhelmed, and overlooked. While half of the nation's students are \neducated in rural and small public schools, they only receive 23% of \nFederal education dollars; 25% of State education dollars; and 19% of \nLocal education dollars.\n  We all grew up thinking that the three R's were Reading, Writing, and \nArithmetic. Unfortunately for our rural school children, the three R's \nare too often run-down classrooms, insufficient resources, and really \nover-worked teachers.\n  Increasingly, Mr. President, rural and small schools are plagued by \ndisparities connected to their geographic location and limited \nenrollment. To top it off, rural and small schools face shrinking local \ntax bases, higher transportation costs associated with the greater \ndistance students must travel to school, and crumbling school buildings \nthat may not have air conditioning, hot water, or roofs that do not \nleak.\n  Rural school districts and schools also find it more difficult to \nattract and retain qualified administrators and certified teachers. \nConsequently, teachers in rural schools are almost twice as likely to \nprovide instruction in two or more subjects than their urban \ncounterparts. Rural teachers also tend to be younger, less experienced, \nand receive less pay than their urban and suburban counterparts. Worse \nyet, rural school teachers are less likely to have the high quality \nprofessional development opportunities that current research strongly \nsuggests all teachers desperately need.\n  Limited resources also mean fewer course offerings for students in \nrural and small schools. Consequently, courses are designed for the \nkids in the middle. So, students at either end of the academic spectrum \nmiss out. Additionally, fewer rural students who dropout ever return to \ncomplete high school, and fewer rural higher school graduates go on to \ncollege.\n  On another note, recent research on brain development clearly shows \nthe critical nature of early childhood education, yet rural schools are \nless likely to offer even kindergarten classes, let alone earlier \neducational opportunities. Limited resources also mean less support for \nteacher training, technical assistance, educational technologies, and \nschool libraries.\n  To make matters worse, many of our rural areas are also plagued by \npersistent poverty, and, as we know, high-poverty schools have a much \ntougher time preparing their students to reach high standards of \nperformance on state and national assessments. Data from the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress consistently show large gaps between \nthe achievement of students in high-poverty schools and students in \nlow-poverty schools.\n  Our bill would provide funding to approximately 3,400 rural and small \nschool districts that serve 4.6 million students--a short-term infusion \nof funds that will allow these schools and their students to take \nsubstantial strides forward.\n  Local education agencies would be eligible for REDI funding if they \nare either ``rural'' (serve a non-metropolitan area) and have a school-\nage population (ages 5-17) with 20 percent or more of whom are from \nfamilies with incomes below the poverty line; or ``small'' (student \npopulation of 800 or less) and a student population (ages 5-17) with 20 \npercent or more of whom are from families with incomes below the \npoverty line.\n  Like the Education Flexibility Act of 1999 (Ed-flex) I authored with \nSenator Bill Frist earlier this Congress, REDI is voluntary--states and \nschool districts could choose to participate in the program. Both Ed-\nflex and REDI are designed to provide states and districts with the \nflexibility they need in order to use funding to deal with their local \npriorities.\n  I've heard it said that this would be the Education Congress, but we \nhave much to do before we earn that title. Ed-flex was a good start, \nbut it was a start, not a finish. It's time to show\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nthat we when it comes to education, we won't leave anyone behind, and \nREDI will give poor, rural children a real chance. We can't afford to \nstop now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas Yongyi Song, a researcher and librarian at \n     Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was detained on \n     August 7, 1999 in Beijing, China while collecting historical \n     documents on the Chinese cultural revolution of the 1966-76;\n       Whereas Mr. Song has lived in the United States for the \n     past ten years, has passed his United States citizenship \n     tests, and was scheduled to be sworn in as a United States \n     citizen in September of 1999;\n       Whereas after five months of detention, Mr. Song was \n     formally ``arrested'' on Christmas Eve in China on charges of \n     ``the purchase and illegal provisions of intelligence to \n     foreign institutions'';\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China claims that Mr. Song \n     violated Chinese criminal law by collecting historical \n     documents, yet the documents in Mr. Song's possession have \n     reportedly been previously published in newspapers, books and \n     other ``open'' sources;\n       Whereas the historical material Mr. Song was gathering in \n     no way threatens the security of the Chinese government or \n     people;\n       Whereas steps that China has taken to institute true legal \n     representation for criminal defendants are important \n     developments in China's internal modernization and in its \n     integration into the world community;\n       Whereas despite these developments, criminal defense \n     lawyers in China, are subject to harassment and interference \n     and at times even arrest and imprisonment by Chinese \n     authorities while defending clients;\n       Whereas criminal defense lawyers in China are often subject \n     to harassment from police, prosecutors and judges;\n       Whereas in July, 1998 Liu Jian, a criminal defense lawyer \n     from Nanjing, China was imprisoned, subjected to beatings and \n     ``marathon'' interrogations after he represented a local \n     official accused of taking bribes;\n       Whereas the legal system in the People's Republic of China \n     was greatly reformed in 1997, yet Chinese officials often \n     disregard the new laws; and\n       Whereas in many cases judicial proceedings are closed to \n     public: Now, therefore be it:\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress calls on the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China to--\n       (1) immediately release Yongyi Song from imprisonment and \n     drop all charges against him;\n       (2) guarantee in the legal system in the People's Republic \n     of China fair and professional treatment for criminal defense \n     lawyers; and\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n       (3) open more criminal proceedings in the People's Republic \n     of China to the public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S93-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S93]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 79--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  ELIAN GONZALEZ SHOULD BE REUNITED WITH HIS FATHER, JUAN GONZALEZ OF \n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, and \nMr. Leahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 79\n\n       Whereas Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year citizen of Cuba, lost his \n     mother in a tragic boat accident and floating alone for days \n     in treacherous conditions off the coast of Florida;\n       Whereas Elian Gonzalez was found November 25, 1999, alive \n     but physically and emotionally drained, brought ashore and \n     examined at a hospital, and released temporarily by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) into the care of \n     his great-uncle and cousins in the Miami area while it \n     evaluated his case;\n       Whereas the natural father and sole surviving parent of \n     Elian Gonzalez. Juan Gonzalez of Cuba, has repeatedly \n     requested that the United States Government return his son to \n     him immediately;\n       Whereas the President rightly determined that the fate of \n     Elian Gonzalez should be determined by United States statutes \n     and regulations related to immigration cases involving \n     children;\n       Whereas the INS, after interviewing Juan Gonzalez twice in \n     Cuba and carefully reviewing all relevant laws, rules, and \n     evidence, correctly determined on January 5, 2000, that Juan \n     Gonzalez is a caring and involved father, that Elian Gonzalez \n     faces no credible threat of political persecution if returned \n     to his father, and as a result, that Juan Gonzalez possesses \n     the sole authority of speaking for Elian Gonzalez regarding \n     his son's immigration status in the United States under \n     Federal immigration law and universally accepted legal norms;\n       Whereas the INS resolved to return Elian to Cuba by January \n     14, 2000, to live with his father Juan Gonzalez, in \n     accordance with his father's request;\n       Whereas on January 12, 2000, the Attorney General fully \n     supported the INS ruling, reaffirmed INS jurisdiction over \n     the matter, and said that a decision by a Florida State court \n     judge granting temporary custody of Elian Gonzalez to his \n     relatives in Miami, establishing a March 6, 2000, date for a \n     hearing on permanent custody, and calling for the father's \n     presence at that hearing had no force and effect;\n       Whereas only the Federal courts have the jurisdiction to \n     review the Attorney General's decision;\n       Whereas what Elian Gonzalez needs most at this time is to \n     be with the father and both sets of grandparents who raised \n     him so that he can begin the process of grieving for his \n     mother, in peace;\n       Whereas despite the existence of important political \n     disagreements between the Governments of the United States \n     and Cuba, these differences should not interfere with the \n     right to privacy of a 6-year-old child or his sacred bond \n     with his father; and\n       Whereas any unusual or inappropriate changes to immigration \n     law made by Congress to naturalize a minor without the \n     parents' consent would have the effect of encouraging parents \n     in other nations to risk the lives of their children under \n     the false hope that they might receive special treatment \n     outside standard channels for legal immigration: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Congress should not interfere with normal immigration \n     proceedings by taking any unusual or inappropriate \n     legislative measures designed to delay the reunification of \n     Elian and Juan Gonzalez; and\n       (2) the Immigration and Naturalization Service should \n     proceed with its original decision to return Elian Gonzalez \n     to his father, Juan Gonzalez, in Cuba and take all necessary \n     steps to reunify Elian Gonzalez with his father as soon as \n     possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S93-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S93]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 245--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF DR.

Res. 247\n\n       Commemorating and acknowledging the dedication and \n     sacrifice made by the men and women who have lost their lives \n     while serving as law enforcement officers.\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of this country is \n     preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     in their capacity as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are the front line in preserving our \n     children's right to receive an education in a crime-free \n     environment, which is all too often threatened by the \n     insidious fear caused by violence in schools;\n       Whereas 134 peace officers lost their lives in the \n     performance of their duty in 1999, and a total of nearly \n     15,000 men and women have now made that supreme sacrifice;\n       Whereas every year 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 \n     officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the \n     line of duty; and\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2000, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in our Nation's Capital to join with \n     the families of their recently fallen comrades to honor them \n     and all others before them: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2000, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by 28 of my colleagues \nin submitting this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all \nAmericans, the sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who lost \ntheir lives while serving as law enforcement officers. Specifically, \nthis resolution would designate May 15, 2000, as National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this \nnation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few \ncommunities in this country that have not been impacted by the \nsenseless death of a police officer.\n  In 1999, approximately 135 federal, state and local law enforcement \nofficers have given their lives in the line of duty and nearly 15,000 \nmen and women have made that supreme sacrifice during the past century. \nWe can be heartened by knowing that fewer police officers died in 1999 \nthan in any year since 1965.\n  According to National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund Chairman \nCraig W.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: I am writing on behalf of the \n     members of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) in \n     support of your efforts to secure Congressional designation \n     of May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day. PERF, an \n     association of police executives primarily from the larger \n     police agencies in the United States, believes that this is a \n     fitting and appropriate tribute that honors not only those \n     officers for their sacrifice, but their brave families, the \n     law enforcement agencies they represented, and the grieving \n     communities for whom they died serving. As we all work to \n     improve American policing and the criminal justice system, it \n     is important to remember the individual American police \n     officers who have for nearly two centuries served our \n     communities and all too often made the ultimate sacrifice.\n       Thank you for your efforts and the efforts of your \n     colleagues in introducing this measure to honor America's law \n     enforcement officers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chuck Wexler,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                           of Police Officers,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The International Brotherhood of \n     Police Officers (IBPO) is an affiliate of the Service \n     Employees International Union. The IBPO is the largest police \n     union in the AFL-CIO.\n       On behalf of the over 50,000 members of the IBPO, I wish to \n     thank you for introducing legislation to designate May 15, \n     2000 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. This \n     legislation is a tribute to the more than 700,000 men and \n     women who protect our citizens.\n       Your legislation serves as a solemn reminder of the \n     sacrifice and commitment to safety that peace officers make \n     on our behalf. In 1999 over 130 peace officers lost their \n     lives while in the performance of their job.\n       As a former law enforcement official, you know firsthand \n     the dangers these peace officers face. Your legislation not \n     only honors the peace officers fallen in the line of duty but \n     to their surviving families.\n       Once again, thank you for all your help honoring America's \n     peace officers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth T.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washinton, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing \n     4,000 unions and associations and 250,000 sworn law \n     enforcement officers, I want to express our wholehearted \n     support for a Senate Resolution to recognize the brave men \n     and women of law enforcement, who have paid the ultimate \n     sacrifice.\n       Every year, for one week during the month of May, the law \n     enforcement community pays tribute and honors the fallen \n     heroes who have died in the line of duty at the National Law \n     Enforcement Officers Memorial. Serving on the Board of \n     Directors at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \n     Fund and as a former Detroit Police officer for twenty-five \n     years, I truly appreciate a day for all Americans to \n     recognize and commemorate, with surviving family members, \n     those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n       Every day law enforcement officers put their lives on the \n     line to serve and protect our communities. Over the past few \n     years, we have experienced a steady decrease in violent crime \n     throughout our neighborhoods and cities. However, this does \n     not come at a small price. In 1999, approximately 135 of our \n     Nation's finest lost their lives protecting the citizens of \n     this country. We need to honor and remember these outstanding \n     men and woman every year.\n       Thank you for your dedication in advancing the interests of \n     the law enforcement community. I look forward to working with \n     you in the 106th Congress.

Mr. President, shortly before the first session of \nthe 106th Congress adjourned, I introduced, and the Senate passed, a \nresolution designating January 2000 as ``National Biotechnology \nMonth.'' I rise today to formally recognize National Biotechnology \nMonth here in the Senate.\n  While back in Minnesota, I had the opportunity to meet with some of \nmy constituents who are in the biotechnology industry. Whether it's \nagricultural, medical, or environmental applications of biotechnology, \nMinnesota is a leader in the field.\n  Here are some characteristics of the biotechnology industry \nnationally:\n  Over 200 million people worldwide have been helped by the more than \n80 biotechnology drug products and vaccines approved by the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA).\n  There are more than 350 biotechnology drug products and vaccines \ncurrently in human clinical trials and hundreds more in early \ndevelopment in the United States. These medicines are designed to treat \nvarious cancers, Alzheimer's, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, \nobesity and other conditions.\n  Biotechnology will help us feed the world by developing new and \nbetter agriculture commodities that are disease and pest resistant and \noffer higher yields as well.\n  Environmental biotechnology products make it possible to more \nefficiently clean up hazardous waste without the use of caustic \nchemicals.\n  Industrial biotechnology applications have led to cleaner processes \nwith lower production of wastes and lower energy consumption, in such \nindustrial sectors as chemicals, pulp and paper, textiles, food and \nfuels, metals and minerals and energy. For example, much of the denim \nproduced in the United States is finished using biotechnology enzymes.\n  DNA fingerprinting, a biotech process, has dramatically improved \ncriminal investigation and forensic medicine, as well as afforded \nsignificant advances in anthropology and wildlife management.\n  There are 1,283 biotechnology companies in the United States-many in \nMinnesota.\n  Market capitalization, the amount of money invested in the O.S. \nbiotechnology industry, increased 4 percent in 1998, from $93 billion \nto (97 billion.\n  Approximately one-third of biotech companies employ fewer than 50 \nemployees. More than two-thirds employ fewer than 135 people.\n  The U.S. biotechnology industry currently employs more than 153,000 \npeople in high-wage, high-value jobs.\n  Biotechnology is one of the most research-intensive industries in the \nworld. The U.S. biotech industry spent $9.9 billion in research and \ndevelopment in 1998. The top five biotech companies spent an average of \n$121,400 per employee on R\n  Mr. President, biotechnology plays an extremely important part in my \nlife because a little over a year ago I had an artificial valve \nimplanted in my heart to correct a condition I had for years. Without \nthe research and commitment of this industry, I might not have had that \noption available to me.\n  I have always been a believer in biomedical and basic scientific \nresearch and the advances we will see in the future will be testimony \nto the importance and foresight of the investment we make today--and I \nhave no doubt the future holds great promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S95-3", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ELIZABETH GLASER PEDIATRIC AIDS FOUNDATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I have spoken in this Chamber \nbefore about the exemplary life of Elizabeth Glaser and the work of the \nPediatric AIDS Foundation, which bears her name. I rise today to again \nspeak about Elizabeth and her remarkable work and life.\n  In 1986, Elizabeth and her husband, Paul, discovered that she and her \ntwo children were infected with HIV as a result of a blood transfusion \nfollowing a difficult childbirth. In 1988, following the death of their \ndaughter, Ariel, to AIDS she founded a foundation to raise money for \nscientific research for pediatric AIDS. At the time there was little \ncoordinated research focused on the effect of this disease on children \nor pharmaceutical testing of protocols for pediatric AIDS.\n  In 1994, Elizabeth succumbed to this terrible disease after a long \nand courageous battle.\n  Today, eleven years after its founding, the Elizabeth Glaser \nPediatric AIDS Foundation has raised more than $85 million in support \nof AIDS research. This has lead to a new and greater understanding of \nHIV/AIDS and its effects on children.\n  Among the more exciting and promising breakthroughs this research has \nprovided is the drug Nevirapine. Last year, a study in Uganda showed \nthat Nevirapine could prevent almost half of HIV transmissions from \nmothers to infants--and at a fraction of the cost of other, less \neffective, treatments.\n  Mr. President, some 1,800 children are infected with HIV each day. \nThe United Nations reports that 33.6 million people are infected with \nHIV or have developed AIDS; more than two-thirds of these people live \nin Sub-Saharan Africa. As the nature and emographis of HIV/AIDS \nevolves, the work of groups like the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS \nFoundation is a pioneer in its field, richly deserving of the support \nand attention it receives.\n  Elizabeth Glaser remans a source of strength and inspiration to all \nof us. And her good works continue to reap benefits for countless \nthousands of people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S95-4", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S95-S96]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. BOB EDDLEMAN\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to salute \nthe outstanding public service of a conservationist and member of the \nagriculture community in the state of Indiana.\n  After 42 years of service, Bob Eddleman, Indiana State \nConservationist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural \nResources Conservation Service, retired at the end of December. In his \nrole as public servant, Bob set an example for everyone with his \nsteadfast concern for conservation and dedication to the preservation \nof natural resources of his home state.\n  Mr. Eddleman was born and raised on a farm in Crawford County, \nIndiana. He was an active member of 4-H and Future Farmers of America \nand took an interest in activities relating to the conservation of soil \nand water resources. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in \nAgriculture at Purdue University and a Master of Public Administration \nfrom the University of Oklahoma.\n  His career of federal service began in 1957 as a student trainee for \nthe USDA Soil Conservation Service in English, Indiana. After serving \nas a soil conservationist, a district conservationist and an area \nconservationist in Indiana, his career path took him to New York as \nassistant state conservationist and then back to the Midwest as deputy \nstate conservationist in Illinois. In 1980 Bob returned to the Hoosier \nstate as state conservationist.\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\n  In his role as state conservationist with the Natural Resources \nConservation Service, Mr. Eddleman has demonstrated an exceptional \ncommitment to conserving Indiana's soil and water resources and has \ndevoted himself to building a strong federal, state, and local \npartnership to provide services to Indiana citizens. He is also a \nleading advocate for Indiana's soil and water conservation districts. \nThe individual accomplishments of Mr. Eddleman are many, but his years \nof service reflect his dedication to building working partnerships. As \nthe result of his guidance and leadership, Indiana's Conservation \nPartnership is recognized as a model for other states to use to \nincrease soil and water conservation practices on the land.\n  Mr. Eddleman served on many state-wide natural resource work groups \nthat have directed conservation actions in Indiana including: the \nIndiana Lakes Management Group; the Great Lakes Watershed Management \nGroup; the Maumee River Basin Study; the Indiana Water Committee; and \nthe Indiana Natural Resources Land Use work group. Bob has been a 4-H \nleader for 27 years, has served on the Marion County Extension Board \nfor 9 years, was recognized as a fellow of the Soil and Water \nConservation Society (SWCS), and currently serves on the SWCS Board of \nDirectors. In 1995 he received the Distinguished Agricultural Alumni \nAward from Purdue University in recognition of his professional \nachievements and dedicated service to agriculture and society.\n  Finally, Bob Eddleman served as a mentor and role model to others in \nfederal service. There are a great number of leaders within the USDA \nNatural Resources Conservation Service who have gained skills in \nleadership and partnership building by working for and with Bob.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the State of Indiana and all \nconservationists will be losing Bob Eddleman. With special thanks, I \nsalute him for his service and wish him well as he embarks upon new \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S96-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S96]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM SUMAS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nWilliam Sumas, a New Jersey resident and distinguished member of the \nbusiness community, who will be inducted as Chairman of the New Jersey \nFood Council on January 27, 2000.\n  Bill is a native of New Jersey, having grown up in South Orange. \nAfter attending Columbia High School, he continued his education at \nFairleigh Dickinson University.\n  Bill Sumas currently serves as a Vice President of the International \nAssociation of Corporate Real Estate Executives New Jersey Chapter, and \nas an Executive Vice President of Village Supermarkets, the 49th \nlargest corporation in the State of New Jersey. Village Supermarkets \nwas founded in 1937 by Bill's father and uncle, Perry and Nicholas \nSumas. Since then, the company has grown to become one of New Jersey's \nmost important food retailers.\n  The New Jersey Food Council (NJFC) was formed to promote, foster, \naid, advance and protect the mutual interests of the food retailers and \ntheir suppliers. The council represents the multi-billion dollar food \nindustry, including over 1,200 retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, \nand service companies involved in every aspect of the industry. The \nNJFC is recognized nationally for its effective leadership and \nachievements in all aspects of public affairs, and has always \nmaintained a reputation of excellence and integrity.\n  It is my firm belief that William Sumas will continue this fine \ntradition, and serve with distinction as an advocate on behalf of the \nNJFC's members. He will clearly promote the short and long term goals \nof the food industry in a timely and prescient manner, and will enhance \nthe image and standing in the community of the entire industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating \nWilliam Sumas on his induction as Chairman of the New Jersey Food \nCouncil. Under his leadership I am confident that the industry will \ncontinue to grow, and I look forward to its successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S96-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S96]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HAROLD VARMUS, M.D.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for 6 years I had the pleasure of \nworking closely with Dr. Harold Varmus, the distinguished Director of \nthe National Institutes of Health. During his tenure as Director, great \nstrides were made in medical research--the continued mapping of the \nhuman genome; new generations of AIDS drugs' gene therapy; the \nremarkable growth of information technology in health research; a \nstrong effort to combat the global spread of infectious diseases; and \nexciting new scientific opportunities, such as stem cell research, that \nmay one day lead to cures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, \nand diabetes.\n  When I first met Dr. Varmus, I recall being impressed by the force \nand eloquence with which he advanced the cause of medical research. \nWhen he informed me of his intention to leave his post as Director, I \ncould not help but think that NIH would lose one of its most valuable \nassets. His commitment to raise the level of scientific achievement at \nthe NIH, and the enthusiasm and vigor that he brought to the job will \ncertainly be missed.\n  I have no doubt that in his new position as head of the Memorial \nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, Dr. Varmus will \nstimulate the same high level of excitement and energy as he did at \nNIH. And while Sloan-Kettering will benefit from his vast knowledge of \nthe biology of cancer, cancer patients there will feel the warmth of \nhis deep compassion.\n  During his tenure as NIH Director, the agency has seen unprecedented \nfunding increases. In 1993, when he assumed the position of Director \nfunding for NIH was $8.9 billion. Under his leadership, the NIH budget \nhas more than doubled to the $17.9 billion.\n  Dr. Varmus was the first Nobel Laureate to serve as NIH Director. He \nwas awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1989 for his \nwork in demonstrating that cancer genes can arise from normal cellular \ngenes. He is an international authority on retro-viruses and the \ngenetic basis for cancer. Prior to coming to NIH, Dr. Varmus was a \nProfessor at the University of California at San Francisco.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Varmus on his new \nposition and to salute his contribution to the Nation and the cause of \nmedical research. His wise counsel and responsible leadership helped \nlay the foundation for a research agenda that will have a lasting \neffect on the lives of millions of people throughout the United States \nand the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S96-3", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S96-S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO ANDY MORAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, no matter what our party \naffiliation, no matter what our beliefs, no matter whether we are \nMembers or staff, we are all here for one purpose--that is, we believe \nin the nobility of public service. And while the enormity of the issues \nbefore this body bring it, and us, much notoriety, it is to the many \nthousands of dedicated public servants at the State and local level \nthat we owe a debt of gratitude.\n  San Francisco has been fortunate for the last 25 years to have had \nthe services of a public servant of great ability and dedication, Andy \nMoran. Andy's talents first came to my attention when I was Mayor. He \nhas risen through the ranks of municipal government and has, for the \nlast six years, served as the General Manager of the San Francisco \nPublic Utilities Commission. For those who do not know, our PUC \nincludes the Hetch Hetchy Water and Power Division, the Water \nDepartment and San Francisco's Clean Water Program.\n  As one might imagine, the challenges of this job are many, and they \nare varied. Andy has met those challenges with practice, intelligence, \ngood humor, and a sense of fairness. His accomplishments are too \nnumerous to mention here, but I would be remiss if I don't pay special \ntribute to his expertise on the all-important issue of California \nwater. Water is our lifeblood in California, and the demands on our \nwater supply and our water supply system have increased dramatically in \nthe last generation.\n  Andy has been a part of that evolution. He has an institutional \nmemory and an understanding of those issues which are born of first \nhand experience. He has played pivotal roles in such landmark \nagreements as the Bay-Delta\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\naccord and the settlement of Tuolumne River water rights with Turlock \nand Modesto Irrigation Districts. His accomplishments have been widely \nrecognized by his peers, and he has served on numerous California water \ncommittees, including a term as Chair of the Association of California \nUrban Water Agencies.\n  Mr. President, we do not know what the future holds for Andy Moran, \nbut we do know that his future will be met with continued success. He \nhas been a mainstay of San Francisco's municipal government and will be \ngreatly missed. We owe Andy a tremendous debt of gratitude, and we wish \nhim the very best in his life ahead. Andy Moran is a true public \nservant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S97-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       A 50TH BIRTHDAY SALUTE TO THE REVEREND ALPHONSE STEPHENSON\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nimportant event which occurred yesterday, January 25th--the 50th \nbirthday of The Reverend Alphonse Stephenson. Father Stephenson was \nrecently feted by over a hundred family members and friends and his \n50th birthday warrants a few moments of the Senate's attention.\n  Father Alphonse is a native son of New Jersey, but he has shared his \nvaried talents with people of New York City. Priest at the Catholic \nActor's Chapel in New York City, musical conductor of ``A Chorus Line'' \non Broadway, and founder and conductor of St. Peter's Orchestra by the \nSea, are just a few of the ``hats'' worn by Father Alphonse.\n  But Father Alphonse also assists in providing for those less \nfortunate. The Orchestra of St. Peter's by the Sea, under the baton of \nFather Alphonse, has raised over two million dollars for various \nhospitals, such as our own St. Vincent's in New York City; educational \nfacilities, such as Mount Saint Michael in the Bronx; and churches that \nassist the homeless, such as St. John's near Pennsylvania Station. \nAdditionally, and perhaps most importantly, he has created the Cecilia \nFoundation which allows young school children to experience the \nclassics and even get a chance to conduct. The Cecilia Foundation \nprovides musical instruments to children who would not get such an \nopportunity without the generosity of Father Alphonse.\n  Somehow, Father Alphonse has also found time to create the ``Festival \nof the Atlantic,'' a series of free concerts at Point Pleasant Beach \nand the largest outdoor musical endeavor in the State of New Jersey. \nCrowds of 10,000 and more are not uncommon.\n  He is also a Major and the Chief Chaplain of the 108th Refueling Wing \nat McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey with another change in rank \nsoon to occur!\n  An amazing list of accomplishments for one so young. As the Senate \nbegins the 2nd Session of the 106th Congress, I join family and friends \nin wishing Father Alphonse a healthy and happy 50th Birthday--one \nwonders what the next 50 years will bring!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S97-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEATH OF FLOYD M.

Mr. President, we just received word that Floyd M. \nRiddick, the Parliamentarian Emeritus of the Senate, passed away \nyesterday. As many of our colleagues may recall, Floyd M. Riddick was \nthe Senate Parliamentarian from 1964 to 1974.\n  He was a parliamentarian of extraordinary depth and value. In 1954, \nunder the supervision of then-Parliamentarian Charles L. Watkins, he \nbegan working on the first edition of ``Senate Procedure.'' The Senate \nprocedure book that came as a result of his work now bears his name.\n  I think that says everything about the impact and the remarkable \ncontribution Floyd Riddick has made to the Senate, to the way we \ncontinue to legislate, and certainly to the contribution he made in his \ntime in public life.\n  Floyd Riddick received a Ph.D. from Duke University in 1941. His \ndissertation was on congressional procedure, and he began work for the \nSenate in 1947, being the very first to publish a Daily Digest, which \nwe all use every day from the back of the Congressional Record.\n  Doc Riddick, as he was often referred to, was born in Trotville, NC, \non July 13, 1908. As Senator Byrd has noted in his foreword to the \ncurrent edition of ``Senate Procedure,'' he was truly a unique scholar.\n  His contributions to the Senate will be utilized, as they have been \nutilized and valued, by future generations of Senators and staff who \nhave not yet even been born.\n  Floyd Riddick made his mark on the Senate, on Congress, and on \nhistory for the publication of ``Riddick's Senate Procedure.''\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues and all of our staff in \nexpressing heartfelt condolences to his wife Margo, to his friends, and \nhis family.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 246, submitted \nearlier by Senators Lott, Daschle, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 246) relative to the death of Carl \n     Curtis, former U.S. Senator for the State of Nebraska.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at the \ndeath of Senator Carl T. Curtis.\n  Senator Curtis was a lifelong public servant best known for his \nuntiring work on behalf of the people of Nebraska. He began his public \ncareer in 1930 when he was elected Kearney County Attorney. After \nfailing to be re-elected as county attorney--the only political defeat \nhe would ever face--he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nin 1938. The people of Nebraska returned Carl Curtis to the House of \nRepresentatives for an additional seven terms.\n  In 1954, he chose to leave the House and to return to private life. \nBut when then-Senator Dwight Griswold died in office, Carl Curtis was \ncoaxed into further public service. He was overwhelmingly elected to \nthe United States Senate and served as a distinguished member of this \nbody until his retirement from public office in 1979.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Curtis brought to the Senate the plain-spoken \ncommon sense of rural Nebraska. He understood his roots and he cared \ndeeply for the people he represented. While his style did not lend \nitself to self-promotion and banner headlines, his influence in \nCongress was felt on a number of important issues. He was instrumental \nin shaping tax and agricultural policy, he was a staunch advocate of \nbudgetary discipline, and he was a fervent defender of his political \nparty. Yet, Senator Curtis was most well known for his dedication to \nthe people of Nebraska. As many have noted, Senator Curtis set the \nstandard for constituent service. He often dedicated hours of his \npersonal time to helping individuals and his office was always open to \nNebraskans visiting the nation's capital.\n  As the longest serving Member of Congress in Nebraska history, \nSenator Curtis established a legacy of service unlikely to be matched. \nAfter retiring from Congress, Senator Curtis returned to the practice \nof law and always remained an active participant in Nebraska politics.\n  While Nebraska has lost a statesman, the Curtis family has lost a \nhusband, a father, a grandfather, and a great grandfather. I know my \ncolleagues will join with me in expressing our sincerest condolences to \nthe family of Senator Carl T. Curtis.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, to my regret, my good friend, \nSenator Bob Kerrey, announced that he will be leaving this Senate at \nthe end of this year to return to private life. I'm sure my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will agree that his decision is a loss not \nonly to Nebraskans, and to the Democratic party, but to the entire \nSenate.\n  Over the years, Senator Kerrey has made us all laugh. More \nimportantly, he has made us all think. He has challenged us to face the \nbig questions of our time and to reach across party lines to find \nsolutions.\n  It has been said that some people seek public office to be someone; \nothers seek office to do something. Clearly, Bob Kerrey is of the ``do \nsomething'' school.\n  Before he ever came to the Senate, he had achieved more than almost \nanyone I know. A pharmacist by training, he has also been a Navy SEAL, \na decorated war hero, a successful entrepreneur, and a popular \ngovernor--all by the time he was 44 years old.\n  Perhaps even more impressive than his professional accomplishments, \nhowever, are his personal achievements.\n  As we all know much of the story. Bob Kerrey was nearly killed 30 \nyears ago in Vietnam. On a moonless night, while he was leading a \nsurprise attack on North Vietnamese snipers, an enemy grenade exploded \non the ground beside him, shattering his right leg, badly wounding his \nright hand, and piercing much of his body with shrapnel. Days later, \ndoctors were focused to amputate his injured leg just below the knee.\n  For his sacrifice, Lieutenant Kerrey was awarded the Bronze Star, the \nPurple Heart, and the highest award our nation bestows for bravery, the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  He returned from Vietnam angry and disillusioned. What he endured in \nVietnam, and what he saw later at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital, \nwhere he spent nine months learning how to walk again, shook his \nfaith--both in the war, and in the government that had sent him to it. \nIt forced him to re-\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nexamine everything he had ever believed about his country. But slowly, \nout of his pain and anger and doubt, he began to acquire a new faith in \nthis nation.\n  Years ago, when he was Governor of Nebraska, he described that faith \nto a reporter. He said, ``There are . . . people who like to say, `You \nknow all these subsidy programs we've got? They make people lazy.' And \nI like to jump right in their face and say, that is an absolute lie.'' \nGovernment help ``didn't make me lazy. It made me grateful.''\n  It was the United States Government, he said, that fitted him with a \nprosthesis and taught him to walk again. It was the government that \npaid for the countless operations he needed.\n  Later, it was the government that helped him open his first \nrestaurant with his brother-in-law. And when that restaurant was \ndestroyed in a tornado, it was the government--the people of the United \nStates--that loaned them the money to rebuild.\n  For 4 years as Nebraska's Governor, and for the last 11 years as a \nMember of this Senate, Bob Kerrey has fought to make sure the people of \nthe United States, through their government, work for all Americans.\n  He has fought to make health care more affordable and accessible. He \nhas fought to give entrepreneurs the chance to turn their good ideas \ninto profitable businesses. He has fought to make sure this Nation \nkeeps its promises to veterans.\n  He has fought tirelessly to preserve family farms and rural \ncommunities. As someone, like Senator Kerrey, who comes from a state \nthat is made up mostly of small towns and rural communities, I am \npersonally grateful to him for his insistence that rural America be \ntreated fairly.\n  But Senator Kerrey's greatest contribution to this Senate, and to \nthis nation, may be the fact that he is not afraid to challenge \nconventional wisdom.\n  In 1994, almost singlehandedly, he created and chaired the Bipartisan \nCommission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. Conventional wisdom said, \ndon't get involved with entitlements. You can't make anyone happy; you \ncan only make enemies. But Bob Kerrey's personal experience told him \nthat preserving Social Security and Medicare was worth taking a \npolitical risk.\n  He has repeatedy opposed efforts to amend our Constitution to make \nflag-burning a crime. It is politically risky, even for a wounded war \nhero, to take such a position. But Senator Kerrey has taken that risk, \ntime and time again, because--in his words, ``America is a beacon of \nhope for the people of this world who yearn for freedom from the \ndespotism of repressive government. This hope is diluted when we advise \nothers that we are frightened by flag burning.''\n  He is a genuine patriot, and a genuine American hero.\n  There is a story Senator Kerrey has told many times about a \nconversation he had with his mother 30 years ago. Doctors at the \nPhiladelphia Naval Hospital had just amputated his leg. When he awoke \nfrom surgery, his mother was standing at his bedside. ``How much is \nleft?'' he asked her. His mother responded, ``There's a lot left.'' As \nSenator Kerrey says, ``She wasn't talking about body parts. She was \ntalking about here.'' She was talking about what was in his heart.\n  He has said that he would like to focus now on his private life. As \nmuch as I regret his decision, I respect it. Public life offers great \nregards, but it also makes great demands--on the officeholder, and on \nhis or her family.\n  The only consolation in seeing Bob Kerrey leave this Senate will be \nwatching what he does next with his remarkable life. There is still a \nlot left. I have no doubt he will continue to contribute in significant \nways to our Nation. And until he goes, we will continue to look to him \nfor unorthodox solutions and uncommon courage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution on behalf \nof myself and my colleagues Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, and \nSenator Durbin. Because I have not solicited cosponsors of this \nresolution, others may wish to add their names at a later time.\n  This resolution is virtually identical to a resolution that has been \nintroduced in the other body by Congressman Rangel of New York, along \nwith a number of other Members of the House. I am told that support for \nthat resolution is bipartisan in nature.\n  I am going to read the resolution into the Record. That is not a \nnormal event, but I think the wording of it is so significant that it \ndeserves to be read into the Record. The resolution deals with the case \nof 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who we all know tragically \nlost his mother in that dreadful boating incident, an accident as they \nleft Cuba and sought to come to the United States. Young Elian spent \nsome time in the water alone and survived that tragedy. Today, after \nweeks of this going on, this matter has attracted national and \ninternational attention.\n  Yesterday, together with Senators Leahy, Boxer, Durbin, and Hagel, I \nmet for about an hour with the two grandmothers of this 6-year-old boy. \nI was convinced before the meeting--and even more so afterwards--that \nthis is a matter which ought to be resolved immediately by reuniting \nthis young boy with his father in Cuba.\n  I am terribly upset and worried that this matter may end up as a \nsubject of debate in the Senate. I have no intention whatsoever of \npursuing the resolution that I introduce today. In fact, it is my \nstrong desire not to pursue it--unless the Senate is forced to address \nlegislation that would extend citizenship or permanent resident status \nto this young boy. Should such legislation come to the Floor of the \nSenate, then I will offer this resolution as an alternative.\n  My sincere hope is that the leadership of the Senate and of the House \nwill think again before deciding to make this child a focal point in a \ndebate about the current regime in Cuba. He really should not be, in my \nview. The Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives \nought not to utilize this child as a way of advancing the debate on \nCuba. This would be a great travesty, in my view. Conferring, by \nspecial legislation, citizenship or permanent resident status on this \nboy would, I believe, set a dangerous precedent. It would violate \nlongstanding legal processes. Furthermore, it would violate a cherished \nprinciple ingrained in the Constitution and laws of our country, and \nembraced by all of us here--namely, that the best interests of a child \nis normally served by that child being with his or her parents.\n  Tragically, this young boy lost his mother. His father, we are told, \nwas a good father--and is a good father. This boy ought to be returned \nto his dad and be home with him, and the quicker the better. So I hope \nthe matter will not come before the Senate.\n  I have great respect for our majority leader. Most of my colleagues \nknow this. We have our disagreements, but the Senator from Mississippi, \nthe majority leader, and I are good friends, and I cherish that \nfriendship. I urge him to think again about this before deciding to ask \nthis body to cast votes on extending citizenship to an infant. I do not \nthink it is a wise move. I think it is wrong for the Senate to do so, \nand I hope a different decision will be reached and this matter is left \nto be resolved in the courts where it is now. That is the best way, in \nmy view, to expedite this process so this boy can be returned to his \nfather and cease to be a pawn in a larger geopolitical debate.\n  Let me, if I can, read the wording of this resolution because I think \nit might enlighten some Members who\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\nare not necessarily familiar with all the facts and details.\n  The resolution reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 79\n\n       Whereas Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old citizen of Cuba, lost \n     his mother in a tragic boat accident and floated alone for \n     days in treacherous conditions off the coast of Florida;\n       Whereas Elian Gonzalez was found November 25, 1999, alive \n     but physically and emotionally drained, brought ashore and \n     examined at a hospital, and released temporarily by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) into the care of \n     his great-uncle and cousins in the Miami area while it \n     evaluated his case;\n       Whereas the natural father and sole surviving parent of \n     Elian Gonzalez. Juan Gonzalez of Cuba, has repeatedly \n     requested that the United States Government return his son to \n     him immediately;\n       Whereas the President rightly determined that the fate of \n     Elian Gonzalez should be determined by United States statutes \n     and regulations related to immigration cases involving \n     children;\n       Whereas the INS, after interviewing Juan Gonzalez twice in \n     Cuba and carefully reviewing all relevant laws, rules, and \n     evidence, correctly determined on January 5, 2000, that Juan \n     Gonzalez is a caring and involved father, that Elian Gonzalez \n     faces no credible threat of political persecution if returned \n     to his father, and as a result, that Juan Gonzalez possesses \n     the sole authority of speaking for Elian Gonzalez regarding \n     his son's immigration status in the United States under \n     Federal immigration law and universally accepted legal norms;\n       Whereas the INS resolved to return Elian to Cuba by January \n     14, 2000, to live with his father Juan Gonzalez, in \n     accordance with his father's request;\n       Whereas on January 12, 2000, the Attorney General fully \n     supported the INS ruling, reaffirmed INS jurisdiction over \n     the matter, and said that a decision by a Florida State court \n     judge granting temporary custody of Elian Gonzalez to his \n     relatives in Miami, establishing a March 6, 2000, date for a \n     hearing on permanent custody, and calling for the father's \n     presence at that hearing had no force and effect;\n       Whereas only the Federal courts have the jurisdiction to \n     review the Attorney General's decision;\n       Whereas what Elian Gonzalez needs most at this time is to \n     be with the father and both sets of grandparents who raised \n     him so that he can begin the process of grieving for his \n     mother, in peace;\n       Whereas despite the existence of important political \n     disagreements between the Governments of the United States \n     and Cuba, these differences should not interfere with the \n     right to privacy of a 6-year-old child or his sacred bond \n     with his father; and\n       Whereas any unusual or inappropriate changes to immigration \n     law made by Congress to naturalize a minor without the \n     parents' consent would have the effect of encouraging parents \n     in other nations to risk the lives of their children under \n     the false hope that they might receive special treatment \n     outside standard channels for legal immigration: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved * * *\n\n  The resolve clause basically says Elian Gonzalez ought to be returned \nto his father.\n  I send this resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is received and appropriately referred.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate that.\n  I stated the facts in that resolution.\n  Mr. President, let me state, again, this boy ought to be home with \nhis father. We have a significant disagreement with the Government of \nFidel Castro. Those disagreements are not going to be resolved by this \ncase. But good families exist in countries with bad governments. The \nidea that the family of Elian Gonzalez, because he lives under a \nrepressive regime in Cuba, cannot be a good family is, on its face, \nfalse. There are plenty of good families all over this globe who live \nunder governments that we do not approve of.\n  In this case, I believe--based on the examination by the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service of Elian Gonzalez' father, and based on all \nthat is known about his grandparents and other family members--that \nsuch a family exists in Cuba. The evidence suggests that his father is \nnot only fit as a parent, but caring and involved, as well. Despite the \nfact that he was divorced from Elian's mother, the evidence suggests \nthat he shared with her the responsibility of raising this young boy. \nTherefore, I think it is in the interests of this child that he be \nreturned to that family as quickly as possible.\n  That really ought to settle this matter. Based on what we know today, \nhis father loves him, and wants him back. That is a desire that every \nAmerican parent can understand and share.\n  But what has happened here, apparently, is that the hatred on the \npart of some for an old man in Cuba--Fidel Castro--is interfering with \nthe love of a father and a son. If there is a debate--and there is \nbetween our two Governments--let that debate be conducted by adults.\n  Let us debate the embargo. Let us debate the issue of food and \nmedicine. I note, as I stand here, the Presiding Officer has been an \nenlightened and thoughtful participant in that discussion, as we are \ntrying to work our way through what is the best way for us to try to \nrepair this relationship between the Governments of Cuba and the United \nStates that has gone on for 40 years, to bring about the kind of change \nin Cuba that would bring freedom to the people of Cuba.\n  We have said repeatedly that our argument is with Fidel Castro and \nhis government, not with the Cuban people. Yet, unfortunately, in this \ndiscussion, it appears that for some the debate is with the Cuban \npeople if Elian Gonzalez is denied the opportunity to return to Cuba to \nbe with his father.\n  I hope, again, as I said a few moments ago, that this matter will not \ncome to the floor of the Senate for debate, that the leadership, in its \nwisdom, will decide to move on to other matters--the bankruptcy bill, \nthe budget matters that we need to discuss, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, a Patients' Bill of Rights,and a minimum wage \nincrease, to name just a few. There is a long list of issues for us to \ndebate and discuss. But we ought not to debate the custody status of a \n6-year-old child who, in the opinion of all who have taken a look at \nthis issue from a neutral and responsible position, have concluded that \nElian Gonzalez ought to be home with his father in Cuba. We ought to \ninstead allow the current legal process to work so that a decision on \nthis boy's fate can be rendered expeditiously and, hopefully, in favor \nof reuniting him with his father.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say at the outset, I agree completely \nwith the Senator from Connecticut. I ask unanimous consent that if my \nname is not shown as a cosponsor----\n  Mr. DODD. It is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Dodd's resolution.\n  What a curious footnote in the history of this world that this Senate \nChamber would focus its debate and the attention of the media in this \ncountry on a little 6-year-old boy from Cuba.\n  But if you scan history, you will find similar cases where one person \nbeing caught in the vortex of controversy becomes the focal point. In \nthis case, the focal point is a 6-year-old boy named Elian Gonzalez, \nand at issue is the foreign policy between the United States of America \nand the Nation of Cuba.\n  Yesterday, Senator Dodd was kind enough to invite me, as well as \nthree other Senators, to meet with the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez. \nI sat and listened for an hour as they explained their family \ncircumstances and answered our questions. It really brought me back to \nthat moment in time many years ago when I was a practicing lawyer in \nSpringfield, IL, and spent many days involved in family law. It was not \nthe most enjoyable part of my legal practice.\n  In fact, many times those cases, involving divorce and child custody \nand child support, unfortunately, brought out the very worst in people. \nThose battles over children became proxy battles over a failed \nmarriage. It saddened me, as I am sure it saddens many who are involved \nin this.\n  As I listened yesterday, I understood that these two grandmothers \nwere basically making the case that they had a good family to offer in \nCuba, a good family for Elian Gonzalez. I thought they made their case \nconvincingly. The fact that this young boy, after his parents were \ndivorced, was the subject of joint custody is, in and of itself, a \ntelling fact. It is rare. There are people who fight in court for years \nand spend thousands of dollars over the question of joint custody.\n  In this case, Elian Gonzalez' mother decided that she could trust her \nformer husband, the father of Elian, so much so that she left him with \nhis father 5 out of 7 days each week. That simple fact told me a great \ndeal about whether or not Elian Gonzalez' father was a fit parent. In \nthe eyes of Elian's mother, the former wife of Elian's father, he \ncertainly was a fit parent.\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\n  But then I have to tell you that some of the things said to me by \nthese grandmothers were so touching. Consider Elian's maternal \ngrandmother who came to the United States. Think about what she has \nbeen through. In just a few short weeks, she saw an effort by her \ndaughter and Elian, along with a man, to come to the United States. I \nam not sure how much she knew of this in advance. In fact, she \nindicated to us she did not know that they were going to take off for \nthe United States.\n  Then she was told her daughter was involved in a ship sinking, that \nher daughter drowned at sea, that this little 6-year-old boy watched \nhis mother drowning at sea, that he grabbed on to a life preserver and \nhung on, some say for days, before he was rescued, and then was swept \nup into the caring arms of those who rescued him, brought to the United \nStates, and given to a great uncle, who I am sure cares for him very \nmuch.\n  But since he arrived in the United States, this little boy, no more \nthan a first grader, has been the focus of such attention. They have \nheaped gifts on him, puppies and gifts and trips to Disney World. The \ncameras swirl around him as he walks across the backyard and plays with \na ball or pets his little puppy.\n  I remember things similar to that in my practice of law. We used to \ncall it Disneyland daddy. If you are only going to get this little boy \nfor a weekend, you will give him the world. You will take him to the \nice cream shop as often as he wants to go, buy some toys, take him on a \nnice vacation, create an atmosphere in his mind that is idyllic. That \nis what has happened to Elian Gonzalez. In an effort to show love and \ncaring, he has had all these gifts heaped upon him by his great uncle \nand his family. Yet I believe, as the grandmothers do, that the most \nbasic thing Elian Gonzalez needs is his last surviving parent. He needs \nhis father's loving arms more than he needs a trip to Disney World.\n  I think with his father and the rest of his family in Cuba, they \ncould start to try to reconstruct this little boy's life and to say to \nhim that though you have seen more tragedies in your few years than \nmany people do in a lifetime, we will stand by you. We will give you \nthe support to make your life whole again. That should be what this \ndebate is all about.\n  I think the Immigration and Naturalization Service has it right. They \nasked the first question: Who will speak for this boy's interest? They \nconcluded it would be his natural father. Then they asked the second \nimportant question: Is this natural father a fit parent? They \ninterviewed him twice, went to Cuba to do it. They asked a lot of \npeople about his background and came back and said, yes, he is a fit \nparent. He had joint custody of the little boy. The mother entrusted \nthe boy to his father many, many times.\n  They concluded, and properly so, that Elian Gonzalez should be \nallowed to return home to Cuba, but unfortunately that is not the end \nof the story because this little boy is caught up in a foreign policy \ndebate that has been going on for more than 40 years in America. During \nmy time in college, I lived with a Cuban American expatriate who \nexplained to me what it was like to be forced out of Cuba, to be forced \nout of your home, to give up everything, by the Castro regime, by this \nCommunist leader who refused to recognize the most basic human rights. \nI heard firsthand from this roommate of mine in college what his family \nwent through, the sacrifice, the deprivation, the loss of things they \nwould never see again.\n  I always understood the feelings as best I could, not having lived \nthem personally, of that generation of Cuban Americans who escaped to \nAmerica's shores to finally get away from Castro and to have a chance \nat their own life and democracy. I have seen what they have created in \nsouth Florida and many other places around the United States. I am very \nproud that this group of immigrants to this country has made such a \nvaluable contribution to our Nation, but like most immigrants, they \nnever forget their homeland. That is not to say they don't love the \nUnited States, but they never forget their homeland of Cuba. They stay \nintensely involved in the foreign policy debate in Washington about the \nfuture of Cuba. They have become quite a political force in Florida, \nperhaps in national politics.\n  They feel--and I share their feeling--that the people of Cuba deserve \nbetter than Fidel Castro. They deserve a democracy. They deserve an \nopportunity to live in freedom. They remind us of that frequently. I \nshare their belief. I think they are right. But I have to say I believe \nthey have taken the wrong tack when it comes to Elian Gonzalez. It is \nmuch more compelling to most American families that this little boy be \nreunited with his family than it is that he be in the midst of a \nforeign policy debate. Some Members of the Senate have suggested that \nnext week we will stop the business of the Senate and we will focus the \nattention of this deliberative body on a 6-year-old Cuban boy named \nElian Gonzalez. They have proposed, in one of the rare instances in \nAmerican political history, that this little boy will have conferred \nupon him American citizenship--frankly, citizenship without even \nasking.\n\n  We presume in most courts of law that a 6-year-old boy can hardly \nmake a big decision about his life. He is too easily swayed by emotions \nand doesn't have the maturity to decide. They want to make the decision \nfor him. They want to decide that he is an American citizen.\n  I am reminded of an experience I had not long ago in Chicago. I went \nto a Mexican restaurant. After I finished my meal, a fellow came up to \nme from the kitchen. He was wearing a cook's clothes. He said: Can I \ntalk to you for a minute, Senator? I said: Of course. He said: I am \nalmost 65 years old. I was born in Mexico. My dream, for as long as I \nhave lived, is to be a citizen of the United States of America. Here is \nmy application form for naturalization.\n  He had taken it and encased it in plastic; it meant so much to him. \nHe said: This means so much to me, but the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service system is so slow and so bureaucratic and the \nnew laws coming out of Washington make it so difficult, it has been \nover 2 years, and I am waiting for my chance to raise my hand and swear \nmy loyalty to the United States of America. He said: Senator, I am \nafraid I will die before that happens. That would break my heart and \nthe hearts of my family.\n  I think about him, and I think of hundreds of thousands like him who \nhave come to this country and followed the orderly process to become \ncitizens. They have had to wait. They have had to go through a tangle \nof bureaucracy. They are hoping they will get the chance to raise their \nhands and become naturalized citizens.\n  My mother was one of those. She was an immigrant to this country from \nLithuania. In her 20s, after being married, she became a naturalized \ncitizen. I have her naturalization certificate above my desk here in \nWashington. I am very proud of that.\n  But you won't hear any efforts on the floor of the Senate for the \nhundreds of thousands of people who are longing for this chance to \nbecome Americans, waiting for the naturalization process to be \ncompleted. No, we will focus on one 6-year-old boy from Cuba. Why? \nBecause he makes an important foreign policy point. I don't believe it \nis fair to him, only 6 years of age. Nor is it fair to the hundreds of \nthousands who are waiting patiently for us to say that he will move to \nthe front of the line and become a citizen without even asking for it. \nThat doesn't speak well for this country and our respect for the law.\n  I have compassion for this little boy and what he has been through. \nDo I believe he could live in the United States and enjoy freedom in \nthis country? Certainly. But as Senator Dodd and others have said, \nthere are many good families living in countries with bad governments. \nThough Elian Gonzalez, by the matter of fate, was born in Cuba under a \nrepressive regime, I don't doubt for a minute that he has a loving \nfamily who can give him so much in his life as he grows up. If we are \ngoing to have compassion for children and particularly immigrant \nchildren, let me tell you, the Senate has a full agenda. I returned 2 \nweeks ago from Africa where there are literally over 20 million AIDS \norphans. These kids need the same compassion and concern.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  There are many millions of children around the world who deserve our \nconcern and our compassion. I hope those who are expressing this \nfeeling about Elian Gonzalez will not stop at that, will decide that we \ncan do more to help many others in small ways and large ways combined. \nI hope next week the leadership of the Senate does not bring this \nmatter before us. I will oppose it. I will support the resolution from \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I think it is sensible. It answers the \nbasic question with the most basic family value. Where should Elian \nGonzalez be? He should be with his father, his last surviving parent. \nThe trauma that he has been through I think, I hope he can endure. I \nhope he will be a strong little boy. I hope he will grow up and reflect \non his experience in the United States, remembering that there were \npeople who loved him in this country as well, and there certainly are.\n  Let me close by saying that I hope Cuban Americans will consider this \nfor a moment. I don't believe the action they have taken relative to \nElian Gonzalez has increased the popularity of their cause at all. Many \npeople are confused and bewildered that they would fight a foreign \npolicy battle on the back of a 6-year-old boy.\n  I think we should learn a lesson from history. There was a time when \nEastern Europe was under Soviet domination.\n  There was a time when we considered them to be victims of a Communist \nregime. We decided in the latter part of the last century that the best \nway to change that government and that mindset in Eastern Europe was to \nopen the doors wide, let them see the rest of the world, let them trade \nwith the United States and Europe, and let them understand what \ndemocracy was all about, let them see what freedom meant in their daily \nlives, and, you know, it worked.\n  We saw the Berlin Wall come down. We saw countries such as Poland, \nunder Soviet domination for 40 years, emerge into a democracy and an \neconomy that is an inspiration to all. Can't we learn the same lesson \nwhen it comes to Cuba? If we open the doors and allow Cubans to come to \nthe United States to visit, to work, to trade, to engage in cultural \nand educational exchanges, is there anyone who can doubt that will lead \nto a new Cuba? Is there anyone who doubts that kind of exchange, \ninstead of this isolationism, will force the political change we have \nbeen waiting for for over four decades?\n  I don't think that change will come about by granting citizenship to \nElian Gonzalez. That one little boy will become just a tragic footnote \nin history. He has endured enough in his short life. I hope this Senate \ndoesn't add to the burden he now has to carry--the memory of seeing his \nmother drown at sea. I hope the leadership of the Senate will think \ntwice before they allow us to become party to what has become a sad \nchapter in the history of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S102-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, about a year ago, I was still celebrating my \nvictory from the election of 1998. It was a tough election. The reason \nI mention that today is because in the small State of Nevada, with less \nthan 2 million people, the two candidates running for the Senate spent \nover $20 million. We had less than 500,000 people who voted in that \nelection but we spent over $20 million. We spent approximately $4 \nmillion in our campaign accounts, and then each party spent about $6 \nmillion. So it was a total of $20 million, plus an undisclosed amount \nof money that was spent by people who represented the National Rifle \nAssociation, the truckers' association, and other groups. These \nindependent expenditures on both sides were something that added to the \ncost of that election in Nevada.\n  The reason I mention this is when I first came to the Senate, I had \nan election I thought cost too much money. It cost about $3 million. In \nthis election I spent over $10 million--that is, counting the money \nspent mostly on my behalf and on behalf of the others in that election \ncycle.\n  Something has to be done to stop the amount of money being spent on \nthese elections. We know that on the Presidential level, Senator \nMcCain, who is running for the Republican nomination for the \nPresidency, is spending a lot of his time talking about the need for \ncampaign finance reform. I admire and appreciate the work of Senator \nMcCain in this regard. On the Democratic side, both Senators Bradley \nand Vice President Gore are talking about the need for campaign finance \nreform. Those who support campaign finance reform got a real boost, a \nreal shot in the arm, in the last few days when the U.S. Supreme Court, \nin a case that came out of Missouri, rendered a 6-3 opinion. In effect, \nthat opinion said in the case of Shrink v. Missouri Government that the \nCourt had a right to set maximums as to how much somebody could spend. \nThe Court held that the Missouri law imposing a little over a $1,000 \nlimit on contributions to State candidates did comply with the \nConstitution, despite a challenge claimed that the limit was so low it \naffected the ability of interested people to give to the candidate of \nhis choice.\n  The reason this case was so important is that everybody has been \nwaiting for almost 25 years to determine what the Court would do about \nBuckley v. Valeo, were the Court held that political contributions are \nspeech protected by the first amendment. Though certain limits could be \nenforced, the Government could not put too many restrictions on when \nand what a person could spend on political candidates. Some hoped and \nwished the Shrink case, cited by the Supreme Court, would throw out all \nthe limitations and, in effect, there would be a free-for-all as to how \nmuch money could be raised, and there would be no restrictions as to \nfrom where the money would come. The Shrink case, while it didn't cite \nall the problems with campaign finance money, decided there could be \nlimits established in campaign finance spending. That is an important \nstep.\n  I think what we need is to have elections that are shorter in time. \nWe have to have limitations on how much people can spend on elections. \nWe can't do anything in light of the present law with having \nindividuals spend unlimited amounts of money until we pass a \nconstitutional amendment, which has been pushed by Senator Fritz \nHollings for many years. In spite of our being unable to stop people \nfrom spending personal moneys of unlimited amounts, the Court clearly \nsaid limits\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\ncan be set. I think this should add impetus to the Presidential \ncampaign now underway. What Senator McCain is saying is that we should \ngo with the Feingold-McCain bill that is going to stop the flow of soft \nmoney, corporate money, in campaigns. That seems to be something that \ncertainly can be done. We know in the past it has been done in Federal \nelections, and this should be reestablished.\n  So I hope Senator McCain, Bill Bradley, and Vice President Gore will \ncontinue talking about this. I hope it becomes an issue in the \nPresidential campaign, which will be shortly upon us.\n\n  I do appreciate the Supreme Court. There are some who come here and \nberate them very often. I think it is time we throw them a bouquet. \nThis was a tough opinion, decided by a 6-3 margin. I think this is \nimportant. Justice Stevens noted:\n\n       Money is not speech, it is property. Every American is \n     entitled to speak, but not every American has the same amount \n     of property.\n\n  That is something I hope will be carried over into future discussions \nby the Supreme Court in reviewing Buckley v. Valeo, as to what it means \nregarding whether or not free speech is the ability to spend as much \nmoney as you want in a campaign. I don't think it is. I think the \nSupreme Court will agree with me.\n  In short, the Supreme Court did the right thing. It should give us, \nas a body, the ability to change the law and revisit some of the things \ntaking place in America today. What Senator Feingold and Senator McCain \nhave tried to do is the right approach. We should do that. All the \narguments made about how it would be unconstitutional to do that \ncertainly fail in light of what the Supreme Court recently decided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S103-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S103-S104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE FREEDOM OF ACCESS TO CLINIC ENTRANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to coming here I was a trial lawyer. I \nstarted out representing insurance companies. I was a defense lawyer \nrepresenting insureds who were involved in automobile accidents and \nother problems. I went to court and tried those cases--lots of them. \nThen, in the second part of my career, I represented people who had \nbeen injured. We sued, in effect, insurance companies. I also had the \nopportunity and the experience to represent people charged with crimes. \nI took those cases to juries. I had the good fortune to ask juries \napproximately 100 times to understand my client's plight and to, \nhopefully, be an advocate for what was right. I came to the conclusion \nthat what juries do, with rare exception, is arrive at the right \ndecision. It may not always be for the right reason, but it is usually \nthe right decision. I believe in our system of justice, where juries \nmake decisions.\n  I believe in following the law. What I mean by that is, if there is a \nlaw on the books, or the Supreme Court has interpreted that law, I \nbelieve it should be followed. There is a very controversial issue that \nis always before this body dealing with the reproductive rights of \nwomen. It doesn't matter how you feel, whether you are a so-called pro-\nchoice or pro-life person; a group of Senators and Congressmen, \nDemocrats and Republicans, pro-life and pro-choice Members, joined \ntogether to pass what is called the Freedom of Access to Clinic \nEntrance Act, called FACE.\n  In effect, the law said if there is a legally constituted entity, \nsuch as planned Parenthood, that is giving women reproductive advice, \nand on occasion they also perform abortions --it is legal. Some of us \nmay not agree with what they are doing. But, it is a legal entity. They \nare doing legal things. But FACE said you can't go to one of these \nentities and stop them from doing business, because if you do, you will \nviolate the law.\n  A number of people who were unwilling to follow the law were sued as \na result of their doing the wrong thing in the FACE States, and a court \nof law--like those courts I just talked about--ruled against them.\n  For example, Randall Terry is a person who is opposed to abortion. He \nsought to intimidate and do acts of violence at abortion clinics. A \ncourt awarded $1.6 million to the people who sued him. He acknowledged \nhis intent in doing harm, and he said: I am going to file bankruptcy. \nIndeed, He filed bankruptcy to avoid the judgement.\n  Another person by the name of Bonnie Behn of Buffalo, NC, filed for \nbankruptcy to discharge a debt of some $36,000 because she violated a \ncourt order regarding a local clinic where there was an established \nbuffer zone around the clinic. Money damages were assessed against her. \nShe filed for bankruptcy.\n  These and other acts I think are just out of line. People who do not \nbelieve in our system of justice obviously don't believe in our trial \nby jury system. They don't believe in courts having the ability to \naward damages when they do something wrong. In effect, they believe the \nlaw is for everybody but them. Having violated the law, the judgment is \nrendered against them. They say: We are going to discharge this debt in \nbankruptcy. The debt lien means nothing.\n  That is why I joined with Senator Charles Schumer of New York in \namendment No. 2763 to say that if people do this, they cannot discharge \nthese debts in bankruptcy. I believe that very strongly.\n  When I practiced law, I also did some bankruptcy work. I learned very \nquickly that people who willfully violate the law by willful, wanton \nacts should not discharge their debts to bankruptcy. In fact, one of \nthe things we looked at was, if somebody was a drunk driver, they \nshould not be able to discharge that debt in bankruptcy.\n  We have made sure that is now the law because the court said, well, \nthere wasn't intent and therefore it wasn't willful and wanton. The \ncourts have said in various cases, for example, that if one is charged \nwith drunk driving, they can discharge those debts in bankruptcy. In \nthese cases, we have allowed these individuals to discharge their debts \nin bankruptcy. They should not be able to do that. This amendment would \nstop that.\n  We have had some real difficulties in recent years. We have to have \npeople respond in monetary damages. Why do we have to have them respond \nin money damages? Because there have been in the last 10 years 2,000 \nreported acts of violence against abortion providers, including \nbombing, arson, death threats, kidnaping, assaults, and over 38,000 \nreported acts of disruption, excluding bomb threats and pickets. \nMurders have taken place. Clinic workers constantly face the threat of \nmurder. Since 1993, doctors, clinic employees, clinic escorts, and \nsecurity guards have been murdered. In addition to the murders that \nhave been accomplished, we have had 16 attempted murders.\n  These providers face violence, threat, and intimidation. In addition \nto the two murders in 1998, we have had 19 cases where people threw \nwhat they called butyric acid. It burns people who come in contact with \nit. It smells very bad. In fact, the facility where this acid is thrown \nbecomes inoperable. Clinic workers must take extraordinary measures for \nprotection. They have to vary routes to work and call police if they \nreceive suspicion packages, which they do all the time. They are \nspending hundreds of thousands of dollars on glass, guards, security \ncameras, metal detectors, and security devices. These are lawful \nbusinesses. We have to make sure we live in a law-abiding society.\n  Anti-choice violence and terror is worsening every day, and one of \nthe reasons is that these people flaunt the law. They throw this acid. \nThey intimidate people, recognizing that there is no way they are going \nto have to respond in money damages.\n  I commend and applaud Senator Schumer for offering this amendment. \nThe amendment is part of those that have been accepted as amendments \nthat will be taken up on the bankruptcy bill. There is only a half hour \nof time that Senator Schumer has to make his case.\n  I hope this body, both the majority and minority, will overwhelmingly \nsupport this legislation. This has nothing to do with how you feel \nabout the matter of choice; that is, whether you are pro-choice or pro-\nlife. What it has to do with is whether or not you are going to support \nthe law and whether you believe in our system of justice.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for over six decades people have come to \nrely, expect, and depend on investments made into the Social Security \nsystem. However, the very financial structure created with the program \nin 1935 is about to face some very significant strains placed on it by \nchanges in demographics and also by poor fiscal management by \nWashington. Basically, we are at a crossroads. Do we let the system \nwither on the vine or do we work to save Social Security?\n  At the crux of this discussion is how best to serve our Nation's \nretirees. How can we offer them the most financial security in their \nretirement? I have some ideas I have shared with Minnesotans and also \nwith the Senate. They are aimed at saving the Social Security system. \nIt is a package of proposals, the Grams Plan for Retirement Security, \nthat encompasses what we expect to do to protect and preserve the \nexisting system, as well as what other steps we might take to offer \nretirees more security in their elder years.\n  There are several main elements in my package. On Monday, I \nintroduced the Social Security and Medicare Surplus Protection Act \nwhich would trigger an automatic across-the-board cut if the Government \nwould happen to spend any of the surpluses, either Social Security or \nMedicare.\n  In effect, this creates a retroactive lockbox to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare surpluses. Even those in Washington who are \nfiscally conscious of the commitments made to our Nation's retirees \nwere surprised that last year was the first in over 60 to not dip into \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for other Washington programs.\n  This all-too-common practice necessitates a retroactive lockbox. My \nlegislation contains the lockbox enforcement mechanism that triggers an \nautomatic reduction in Government discretionary spending, including \ncongressional Members' pay, if any of the Social Security or Medicare \nsurplus is spent on other Government programs, thereby restoring the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds. This would lock up the trust \nfunds in case budget forecasts were inaccurate--and surpluses were \nspent.\n  The Grams lockbox saves Social Security and Medicare from \nWashington's big spenders and reaffirms our commitment to our Nation's \nretirees.\n  I have also introduced the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement \nAct. It creates personal retirement accounts and offers every American \nthe opportunity to achieve personal wealth, and also the dignity, \nfreedom, and security that it affords in their retirement years. It \nalso protects seniors by guaranteeing that their benefits won't be cut. \nThe retirement age and taxes will not be raised if they decide to stay \nwithin the Social Security system as we know it today.\n  At the heart of the Personal Security Wealth in Retirement Act is the \npersonal retirement account, or a PRA. A PRA allows the option to \ninvest dollars into the market that taxpayers are now forced to \nsurrender to the Federal Government in their withholding for the FICA \ntaxes. Workers would now have the freedom to design their own \nretirement plans, investing in stocks, in equities, bonds or T-bills, \nor any combination of these, or any other financial instruments with \napproved investment firms and approved financial institutions. \nTaxpayers can invest funds into traditional savings accounts if that is \nwhat they want. The result would be maximum freedom to control their \nresources for their own retirement security.\n\n  There is no doubt that a market-based retirement system and the power \nof compounded interest would generate much better returns than under \nthe traditional Social Security system we have to date. Under today's \nSocial Security program, the average annual retirement benefit for a \nfamily with two working spouses is about $33,000 a year. Under the \nPersonal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, families could receive \nan annual benefit of more than $200,000 a year by investing the same \ndollars in a PRA rather than in the current system. Low-income families \nalso would do better under this plan. Where Social Security now \nprovides an annual benefit of about $18,000 a year, my proposal would \nproduce benefits as high as $100,000 a year.\n  Despite the obvious benefits of a PRA, if one chooses to stay within \nthe traditional Social Security system, that is their right, and the \nGovernment would guarantee the promised benefits that would not be cut \nand that Washington could not increase the retirement age and \nWashington could not increase taxes.\n  Special protections have been built in to keep the PRA safe. \nGovernment-approved private investment companies would manage those \nPRAs to ensure, to guarantee a return higher than what Social Security \npays today. Social Security, by the way, today pays them less than a 2-\npercent return, and in the near future it will be less than 1 percent. \nThat is not the kind of investment most people would make if they could \nwalk up to a window. I don't think they would invest in an account that \npays less than 1 percent. That is what happens. Many taxpayers in the \nfuture will have a negative rate of return, meaning it is better to put \nmoney under your mattress or bury it in a tin can in the backyard than \ninvest in Social Security.\n  Rules similar to those applying to individual retirement accounts \nwould apply to the new personal retirement accounts. If a worker \nhappened to fall short of accumulating the minimum retirement benefits, \nthis is where the Federal Government would step in to make up that \ndifference--in other words, to fill the glass full; to assure a minimum \nretirement benefit so no one will retire into poverty, so you will not \nlose if you choose a PRA.\n  The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act also offers \nfeatures not found in Social Security because you can choose when you \nwant to retire. Right now the Government tells you how much you pay \ninto Social Security, when you can retire, and what your benefits are \ngoing to be. But under our Personal Retirement Account plans, you make \nthose decisions, you choose when you want to retire. As long as you \nhave accumulated the minimum benefits necessary for your lifetime, you \nare free to retire whenever you want. PRAs could be established early \non in life, even before a child is out of diapers. The idea is, when a \nchild was born and given a Social Security number, his or her parents \nor grandparents will be able to begin putting money into that child's \nretirement account.\n  As an example, if you put $1,000 into an account for a newborn baby, \nthat account would grow to nearly $250,000 by the time that child would \nbe ready to retire. From $1,000 seed money to $250,000 by the time that \nchild would retire--not a bad start.\n  The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act ensures that your \nPRA remains your private property and that you have a right to pass it \non. When you die, the remaining funds that are in your account will be \ntransferred, under your estate, to your heirs free of taxes. Right now, \nas you know, when you die there is no residual Social Security. That is \nit. So all the money you have paid in you do not get back. The Personal \nSecurity and Wealth in Retirement Act confidently answers the question \nof whether prosperity in retirement can best be achieved by the \nGovernment or by you, the individual. Given the tools and the freedom \nto put them to work, every American will discover that a successful and \nsecure future is just a PRA away.\n\n  These proposals are at the heart of the Grams Plan for Retirement \nSecurity. In addition to these bills, there are several others in the \nGrams Plan for Retirement Security. I have introduced the Social \nSecurity Benefit Guarantee Act which would create a legal right to \nSocial Security benefits, including an accurate cost-of-living \nincrease. I have also introduced the Fair COLA for Seniors Act, \nlegislation to ensure that older Americans receive accurate cost-of-\nliving adjustments based on their consumption patterns so\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nthey can better achieve retirement security, and the Social Security \nInformation Act, to ensure that hard-working Americans receive adequate \ninformation on which they can begin to plan for their retirement, such \nas the rate of return on their Social Security investment. As I have \nmentioned, I think if people today would get information on what the \nreturn was going to be on their investment, it would play a big part in \ntheir decision to have that or turn to a private retirement account.\n  I have introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs Act--that \nis legislation to ensure seniors do not have to choose between their \nmedicines and their food--and the Tax Relief for Seniors Act, \nlegislation to repeal taxes on our seniors' Social Security incomes. \nThat is unfair, again--that tax on our seniors.\n  These are all components of the Grams Plan for Retirement Security, \nlegislation aimed at helping hard-working Americans receive retirement \nsecurity. As I close, and as we enter this new session of the 106th \nCongress, we need to have an honest discussion, not about how best to \nextend the life of a Government program or how to alter numbers so we \nmight technically fit within spending limits at the expense of our \nNation's retirees; instead, we should debate and discuss how to offer \nhard-working Americans the retirement security they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as a grandmother, and as a member of \nthe Senate Immigration Subcommittee, I want to say a few words about \nthe case of Elian Gonzalez, and particularly to indicate my strong \nsupport for the concurrent resolution Congressman Rangel has introduced \nin the House. Senator Dodd has just submitted a similar resolution in \nthe Senate this afternoon, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  As you know, this resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that \nElian Gonzalez should be reunited with his father, Juan Gonzalez of \nCuba. I have been in California, but nonetheless I have been following, \nas closely as anyone could over the television, the events surrounding \nthis youngster--the very tragic events.\n  Based on my understanding of the situation, Elian has enjoyed a very \nclose and loving relationship with his father and his grandparents in \nCuba. As a grandmother, this has a lot of meaning to me. Those who know \nJuan Gonzalez have described him as an ``ideal father'' who spent as \nmuch time as he could with his son.\n  Elian has been living in his father's home, where his grandparents \nalso play a role in raising him. Although Elian's mother and father \nshared joint custody of the child, he actually spent 5 out of every 7 \ndays of the week in his father's home. It is my understanding that his \nfather can support him, that he can provide a good home for him, and, \nabove all, he is a good and loving father. Both he and Elian's mother \nhad joint custody of the youngster.\n  To the best of my knowledge, there is no evidence that Juan Gonzalez \nwas either neglectful or abusive in his relationship with his son. \nAfter all, a strong parental bond should be the overwhelming test for \nreunification--that and the fact that the touchstone of U.S. \nimmigration policy has been to protect and reunite the family.\n  Elian's maternal grandparents also took part in raising their \ngrandchild, often keeping him when either parent was working. Despite \nthe divorce of Elian's mother and father, both parents and their \nrespective families maintained, warm relations and continued to play an \nactive role in the youngster's life.\n  We cannot know of the mother's true motivations or intentions when \nshe and Elian left Cuba. Elian's father has maintained, however, that \nElian's mother, Elizabet Broton, took their son without his knowledge \nor consent.\n  Elian's fate should not be subject, I believe, to the politics of any \none party or political ideology. I urge all of us--in Florida, in Cuba, \nand in the Halls of Congress--to cool the rhetoric, to set aside any \npolitical views, and commit ourselves to seeing this process to a \nrightful conclusion.\n  The central issue in this case should not be America's policy toward \nCuba but, rather, the sanctity of the family bond between a parent and \nhis child. Without evidence of abuse or neglect on the father's part, \nno government has the authority to disrupt that bond, no matter if the \nbond is in the United States or Cuba, or any other place. The father is \nthe father and should have lawful custody.\n  In addition to my concerns about the negative impact of legislation \nto grant citizenship to Elian on him and his family, and what that does \nto the pending court case, I also have deep concerns about the impact \nthis would have on our own immigration policy. It would certainly, at \nthe very least, reflect an uneven application of immigration policy by \nthe United States. It would be, I believe, a case of major political \nfirst impression and set a precedent all across this land in virtually \nevery case from anywhere. It could also create a precarious situation \nfor an American child abroad.\n  The INS continues, to this day, to send back children to their home \ncountries, even those with repressive regimes. Several months ago, two \nHaitian children were sent back to Haiti while their mother remained in \nthe United States to file for asylum. Here you have a mother in the \nUnited States filing for asylum, and during that period the children \nwere sent back to Haiti. It is true that, after protests and several \nweeks of separation from their mother, Federal authorities did permit \nthe children to reenter the United States. Or you can look at the case \nof a 15-year-old Chinese girl who today is being held in juvenile \ndetention and has been held in juvenile detention for 7 months. At her \nasylum hearing, the young girl could not wipe away her tears because \nher hands were chained to her waist. According to her lawyer, her only \ncrime was that her parents had put her on a boat so she could get a \nbetter life over here. She remains in detention to this day.\n\n  I think that is a terrible wrong. Here is a youngster who was put on \na boat by her parents, who is now in a jail on the west coast of the \nUnited States and goes to a hearing chained like a common criminal. In \ncases such as these, I believe we should review and perhaps even change \nimmigration laws as they relate to minors in certain situations.\n  I am in the process of writing a letter to the chairman of my \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Michigan, asking that he hold hearings \non some of these cases as well as on whether immigration law with \nrespect to children should, in fact, be changed in certain \ncircumstances.\n  I believe our immigration policy must be consistent and fair. In any \ngiven year, the INS handles more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors, and \nthe vast majority are sent back to their families. Others are detained.\n  I have received scores of phone calls from citizens in California who \nsay, if this child were Salvadoran, if he were a Mexican child, if he \nwere a child from China, the child would be sent back to his country. \nWhy is this child different? Because political organizations in a \ncouple of States want to make a point with this child's situation?\n  I think the point is, granting American citizenship in this manner \nwill affect every other situation. We might as well know what we are \ndoing when we do this. I think the only way to look at it is to take a \nlook at all of our immigration laws, as they affect children, in an \norderly way over a period of time. But in the meantime, current law \nshould be followed with respect to this youngster.\n  I think granting U.S. citizenship in this manner, which is really \nwithout any precedent, would be a very far-reaching action. It would \nalso play out negatively for U.S. children who might be taken to \nforeign countries without the consent of the U.S. citizen parent. I \nhave actually tried to help in a case involving a child in Saudi Arabia \nand\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\nfound it most difficult. Once we begin to violate that law, what does \nit say for other American children who might find themselves in a \nsimilar circumstance in a foreign country? As a grandmother, I must \nsay, I shudder to think how I would feel in this same situation.\n  In conclusion, I don't believe our role as a national legislature is \nto interpose ourselves in a decision that should rightfully be made by \na father.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/26/senate-section/article/S106-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 8:30 P.M.
