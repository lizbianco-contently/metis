And today we consider two of the \npillars of character: fairness and caring.\n  Let us pray.\n  O dear God, in a world where so much seems not fair and in a culture \nthat has become so careless, where people so often are unfair and \nuncaring to each other, we ask You to give us more love, self-\nsacrifice, and more likeness of You so that we may do battle with \nanything that denies fairness or caring of people who are cherished by \nYou. May our fairness and caring go beyond a cautious give and take. \nTeach us to sacrifice our own comfort to comfort others, our own \npreferences to give others a sense of what is good for them. Make us \nfair in thought, kindly in attitude, gentle in word, generous in deed. \nRemind us that it is better to give than to receive, to forget \nourselves than to put ourselves first, to serve rather than expect to \nbe served.\n  O dear God, help us care for our Nation and its future. May the \nSenators' caring for every phase of our society be an example to the \nAmerican people. May there be a great crusade of caring and fairness, \nbeginning right here and spreading across this land. May children see \nfrom their parents and from these leaders that caring and fairness are \nnot only crucial but are the crux of our civilization. Dear God, make \nus courageous, caring, and fair people, for You are our Lord and \nSavior. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12861-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable WAYNE ALLARD, a Senator from the State of Colorado, led \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12861-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1692, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1692, a bill \n     to amend title 18, United Sates Code, to ban partial-birth \n     abortions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes for debate equally divided and controlled between the majority \nand minority leaders.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is now recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we will be voting on a motion to proceed to a bill \nthat we have brought up in the Senate now for the third session of the \nSenate, third Congress in a row. I do not believe there is much \ncontroversy with respect to considering this bill. Obviously, this bill \nis going to pass, and it is going to pass by an overwhelming vote.\n  The concern that was voiced last night, and I think will be voiced \ntoday, is that we are moving off campaign finance reform to the \npartial-birth abortion bill. I am hopeful we can recognize that we had \na good debate on campaign finance reform; amendments were offered; \nthere were several days for those amendments to be offered; and it is \napparent there is not enough votes to overcome cloture, to break a \nfilibuster, if in fact that was going to be called for, and that it is \ntime to move on to other business, whether it is partial birth or \nbankruptcy or appropriations bills and the like, and that a week, \nalmost a week-long debate on the issue of campaign finance reform was, \nin fact, sufficient.\n  We know where the votes are going to come out. I don't think anyone \nis going to be changed by further debate and further amendments. It is \ntime to move on to the other business at hand. I hope we can have some \nsort of comity here that would allow the business to continue. I think \nthat would be good for all of us, particularly those of us who would \nnot like to be here through the holidays for a long period of time, who \nwould like to get back home after we finish our business to spend some \ntime with our constituents in our States.\n  So, again, I think a fair debate was had, the votes are clear, and \nfurther debate will do nothing other than take up\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\nthe time of the Senate and delay action on important matters that we \nhave to get to before we adjourn for the end of the year.\n  So with that, I am hopeful my colleagues, frankly, on both sides of \nthe aisle will support moving off campaign finance reform.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, do I understand there are 10 minutes for \nthis side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The majority leader has authorized me to allocate time to \nmyself. I yield to myself 4 minutes.\n  A majority of the House and a majority in the Senate support campaign \nfinance reform. It was clearly indicated yesterday that we have a \nmajority in favor of campaign finance reform. A minority of the Senate \nis not in favor of campaign finance reform, and they have decided to \ntry to block the will of the majority, which is their right. They can \nfilibuster this legislation to which they are so strongly opposed, and \nI defend their right to oppose this legislation with all their might, \nalthough I disagree with them with all my might.\n  The supporters of campaign finance reform have every right to try to \npass the bill. That means we have every right to not agree to withdraw \ncampaign finance reform legislation just because we didn't get cloture \non the first, second, or third vote. It took four votes to get civil \nrights legislation passed in the late 1960s and 7 weeks to get that \nlegislation passed. It wouldn't have passed had the supporters of civil \nrights legislation, after they did not get the necessary votes to adopt \ncloture the first time, backed off from their cause.\n  We, the supporters of campaign finance reform, are just as \npassionately in support of closing the soft money loophole as the \nopponents are passionate in their opposition. We do not need to \nwithdraw as long as we are in the majority. We don't have to go quietly \ninto that good night after a failed cloture vote.\n  This vote we are about to take on a motion to proceed to another item \nof business, this motion to end the Senate's consideration of campaign \nfinance reform in the face of a filibuster by the opposition, is the \nvote that really counts on campaign finance reform. This is the moment \nof truth. A cloture vote simply decided that we did not succeed in \nbreaking the filibuster. Today the majority will decide whether to give \nin to that filibuster. That is what this vote is about, whether or not \na majority of this Senate which favors closing the campaign loopholes \nin the law that are supposed to put limits on how much a person can \ncontribute to a campaign or candidate, gives in to a filibuster, \nwhether those laws which have been so totally undermined by the soft \nmoney loophole, in effect, will be restored to good health. That is the \ndecision we are going to make.\n  This is the vote that tests the determination of supporters of \ncampaign finance reform against the determination of the opponents--\nwhether the majority which went on record yesterday as favoring \ncampaign finance reform will say we are going to give up our cause for \nwhatever length of time because we haven't gotten 60 votes yet. We \nwould not have had civil rights legislation if that were the position \ntaken by the supporters of civil rights--8 long weeks on just one of \nthe civil rights bills in the 1960s and four cloture votes, which \nfinally, with the help of a bipartisan group, were able to take them \nover the finish line.\n  Yes, the opponents have a right to filibuster, a right to tie up the \nSenate. However, we in the majority on campaign finance reform do not \nhave to back down. This is the vote that counts: Whether we in the \nmajority agree we will move to something else or whether we will say to \nthe filibusters they may do what they are doing under our rules and we \nwill defend that right, but we need not and will not back down to that \nfilibuster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nleader's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask I be yielded such time as I shall \nconsume.\n  I especially thank the Senator from Michigan for his great \ndetermination on this issue. I am certainly going to join him on this.\n  I will vote ``no'' on the motion to proceed in a few minutes, but it \nis not because I oppose moving to the late-term abortion bill at this \ntime. Supporters of campaign finance reform are prepared to move that \nbill by consent, which keeps the campaign finance bill as the pending \nbusiness of the Senate--that is all we are trying to do--and thereby \nallows the Senate to return to it once the late-term abortion bill is \ncompleted.\n  This vote we are going to have in a few minutes is not about whether \nwe will debate late-term abortion. Everybody here is prepared to do \nthat. It is about whether we will keep working on the campaign finance \nbill after a short hiatus to do other business.\n  I want to be clear: Senator McCain and I are ready to move forward in \ndebating our bill. I thought we had an exciting series of votes \nyesterday, the upshot of which is, we have three new supporters of \nreform. We need to keep up the pressure for reform. We did not have \nadequate time on the floor to do that. The majority leader promised on \nthe record 5 days of debate. We had 4 days, and 1 of the days was \nyesterday when all we did was vote on cloture.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues who say they want the chance to \noffer amendments, now that we have had those two cloture votes, we can \ndo that. There is every opportunity now to offer amendments. There are \na variety of ways to clear places on the amendment tree so the debate \ncan proceed and we can see if we can work something out and actually \npass the bill.\n  I appreciate the candor of the Senator from Pennsylvania, who just \nsaid, as I understand it, we had a fair debate. This is not what some \nof the other Republicans said. He also indicated there had been an \nopportunity to offer amendments. That is what the Senator said. That is \nthe opposite of what many of the opponents of reform said. Which is it? \nWas there an opportunity to offer amendments or not? Maybe it is an \nacademic debate at this point. It is a very interesting difference in \nthe way the last few days have been characterized.\n  What really counts is that amendments can be offered right now. If \nthere is any Senator out there who is saying he has not had that chance \nto offer amendments, they should vote to have the Senate continue on \nthe campaign finance reform bill and come down and offer an amendment. \nNow is not the time to put campaign finance reform back on the \ncalendar, which in this case means the back burner. It is time to come \ntogether and work to find a consensus.\n  Whatever different spin is put on this issue, the bottom line is \nthis: The soft money system is wrong and it must be ended. Mr. \nPresident, 55 Members of this body have now voted for reform. The time \nhas come to finish the job.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to proceed and \nhelp the Senate take a step toward doing that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, again I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in voting to move to proceed to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. \nIt is a bill that is important business. It is something that has \noverwhelming support in the Senate. I hope we can move to this issue.\n  If there is a need to debate campaign finance reform in the future, \nthen that is a matter for the leaders to work out, whether we want to \ncome back to that issue. I think we have spent enough time on this \nbill. It is very clear where this issue is going. At least the issues \nof McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan do not have the necessary votes to \npass in this Senate. Maybe there are other kinds of campaign finance \nthat could, and maybe we could use this time over the next several \nmonths to find some middle ground to get a compromise.\n\n[[Page S12863]]\n\n  We are not there right now. It is time to move on with the business \nof the Senate and the American people.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on why I will \nvote against the motion to proceed to S. 1692, the Partial-Birth \nAbortion bill. I support this legislation. I have voted for passage of \nthis bill in the past, and I have twice voted to override the \nPresident's veto. I think we should take up this bill in the Senate, \nand I am quite certain we will get to it. Yesterday, in fact, we \noffered to move to this bill by unanimous agreement and, had that been \naccepted, we would be on it now.\n  The problem with this procedural tactic of having a recorded vote on \nthis motion is that it ends the Senate's work on campaign finance \nreform, and we are not finished with that bill yet. We started debating \ncampaign finance reform last week, and we have a chance to make some \ngenuine improvements in American politics. We should finish what we \nhave started.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the motion to \nproceed to S. 1692, legislation to ban partial birth abortions.\n  This is an unnecessary parliamentary maneuver designed solely to \ndisplace S. 1593, the campaign finance reform bill, from the floor. A \nunanimous-consent agreement was offered, with no known opposition, to \ntemporarily lay aside the campaign finance reform bill so that the \nSenate could consider the partial birth abortion ban legislation. Under \nthat procedure, when the Senate finishes its work on the latter bill, \nwe could then return to complete the debate on campaign finance reform. \nBut if this procedural vote is successful, the McCain-Feingold bill \nwill be returned to the Senate calendar, effectively cutting off the \ndebate, well short of the time promised to consider this important \nissue.\n  I want to make very clear, my strong support for this bill and my \nunequivocal and long-standing opposition to the practice of partial \nbirth abortion. I am pro-life and oppose abortion except in the case of \nrape or incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger. Partial \nbirth abortion is a repugnant procedure and an abomination, which \nshould be outlawed.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation, as I was in previous years. I \nhave voted five times over the past 5 years to ban this repugnant and \nunnecessary procedure, including two votes to overturn the President's \nveto of this legislation. When the Senate votes on S. 1692, I will \nagain vote for the ban.\n  As I stated yesterday, I will not give up the fight to enact \nmeaningful reform of our campaign finance system. If the McCain-\nFeingold bill is pulled from the floor today, I will return to the \nSenate floor with amendments on campaign reform this year, next year, \nand as long as it takes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1692) to amend Title 18, United States Code, to \n     ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we now, somewhat belatedly, begin the \ndebate on partial-birth abortion. To review the actions of this body on \nthis issue and the actions of the Congress, this is the third time this \nbill or some form of this bill has been voted on to pass the Senate. We \npassed this bill in 1995 and in 1997. Here we are again in 1999. We had \ntwo override attempts of the President's veto in 1996 and 1998, and I \nam fairly sure we will probably have another attempt on a Presidential \nveto override next year, in the year 2000.\n  Each time this bill has been voted on, succeeding Congresses picked \nup votes. In other words, we have gotten closer to the two-thirds \nnecessary, 67 Senators, to override an anticipated Presidential veto. I \nam hopeful we will continue that trend. We started in 1995 with a vote \nof 55 or 56 Senators supporting banning this procedure. As of the vote \nlast year, we were up to 64 Senators in this body agreeing this \nprocedure is not necessary. It is, in fact, unhealthy and it is a \nthreat to the health and life of the mother, as well as being a brutal \nand barbaric procedure.\n  I am hopeful through the course of this debate we can have a fair \ndebate about this issue. Some have tried to turn this into a broader \ndebate about abortions and view this as just the first shot at Roe v. \nWade, an attempt to put a chink in the armor, intimating there is a \ngrand agenda to try to chip away abortion rights that were given by the \nSupreme Court in Roe v. Wade.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that is not my intention. This bill is a \nstraightforward piece of legislation that deals with a specific \nprocedure. In fact, I am hopeful we will be able, through an amendment \nprocess, to make it even more clear we are referring simply to the \nprocedure known as\n\n[[Page S12864]]\n\npartial-birth abortion. I will describe what that procedure is in a \nmoment. But there is no such intent here. In fact, one of the reasons \nwe are offering this amendment is because we believe this comports with \nRoe v. Wade; that this is a constitutional restriction and, in fact, it \nfalls outside the concerns of Roe v. Wade because the baby is outside \nof the mother. The baby is no longer in the mother's womb.\n\n  So decisions have been made in the courts across the country. There \nhave been several State bans that have been held unconstitutional, one \nthat was held constitutional. So my guess is we will continue to see \nStates deal with this issue, courts continue to be all over the map, \nsome saying it is unconstitutional, some saying it is constitutional, \nuntil we get, finally, to the Supreme Court and they can look at it. I \nam confident it is constitutional.\n  Having said that, we just finished a debate on campaign finance \nreform where the very Members who stand before the body to say we \ncannot pass this because it is unconstitutional voted for campaign \nfinance reform bills that are clearly unconstitutional, clearly in \nviolation of the Supreme Court's edict on allowing unlimited soft \nmoney. But they come here and say: We think the Court is wrong and we \nare going to ban it anyway. This is directly on point with a Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  In our case, with partial-birth abortion, where the baby is killed in \nthe process of being born, the baby is outside the mother, under Roe v. \nWade they let stand a Texas statute that was under appeal under Roe v. \nWade prohibiting the killing of a child in the process of being born.\n  So in a sense we have a case on point in Roe v. Wade that says this \nkind of thing is, in fact, constitutional. Yet you will hear the \narguments, I am sure, at length in the next day or two that we cannot \npass this because some courts have said this is unconstitutional. I \nthink at best that is an unclear argument. At worst, I would argue it \nis clearly constitutional because of the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  To make that argument the very day--or the day after, now--many of \nthe Members making this argument vote for something that is clearly \nunconstitutional because they want to send it to the Court and have the \nCourt take another look at it strikes me as a little disingenuous; that \nyou would make one argument one day and do a 180 degree turn and say we \ncannot pass it because it is unconstitutional when the day before you \npass what you know is unconstitutional and you hope the Court will \nchange its mind.\n  I think now what I want to do is go through briefly what a partial-\nbirth abortion is, how it is performed, when it is performed, who \nperforms it, where it is performed, and why. If I could first start out \nwith a chart that describes the procedure, you can see this is a baby. \nBy the way, that is at least 20 weeks of gestation. During a 40-week \ngestational period, partial-birth abortions are performed on babies who \nare at least 20 weeks. So this is a late-term abortion. This is a \nsecond- and in some cases a third-trimester abortion. Let me start with \nhow it starts.\n  First, the mother presents herself to the abortion clinic. The \nabortionist decides what procedure he or she wants to use to kill the \nbaby. In a small percentage of second- and third-trimester abortions, a \npartial-birth abortion is used. It is not the most common method of \nabortion in late trimester. In fact, it is relatively rare. We are not \nsure of the numbers. The reason we are not sure of the numbers is we \nhave to rely on the abortion industry--which, by the way, opposes this \nbill--to give us their numbers on how many they say they do. The \nFederal Government does not keep track of the method of abortion used \nin the second and third trimester. In fact, they don't keep track of \nthe method of abortion period. So we do not know from any Government \nstatistics or any independent source how many of these abortions are \nperformed. We only can go by what the opponents of this bill tell us is \nthe number.\n\n  They originally told us there were just a few hundred. Then a report \ncame out in a paper in northern New Jersey, the Bergen County Record, \nand they just happened to have a good reporter who thought maybe he \nwould ask his local abortion clinic how many of these abortions were \nperformed. He took the time, as reporters I think would want to do, to \nfind out the accuracy of the story he was reporting. He contacted an \nabortion clinic in northern New Jersey and the abortion clinic there \nsaid they did 1,500 a year at that clinic. Where the national \norganization said they did 500 nationally, there were 1,500 done at \nthat clinic. The person at the clinic who said they did 1,500 there \nsaid they had trained a couple of other abortionists who perform them \nin New York, in addition to the 1,500 that were done there.\n  So when I say a small percentage, that is what has been reported to \nus, again, by the people who oppose this and who realize the more they \nreport the harder it is for them to defend. Because, again, what you \nhear the President and other advocates of this procedure talk about is \nthis is a rare case--just to protect the mother's health or life, in \nthe case of a severely deformed baby, so it is very rarely done. What \nwe found is that is not the case.\n  I think it is clear and many have admitted since within the abortion \nindustry, that is just not true. So what we have is a case where we do \nnot know how many are performed but we believe, according to them, it \nis around 5,000 or more a year. I want to stop right there and pause \nfor a minute. I want everybody to think if we heard about the murder of \n5,000 children a year through a procedure or some act of violence--if \nwe heard about 5,000 a year, people would be marching on Congress and \nsaying: How can you let 5, much less 5,000, babies be killed in such a \nhorrific way? But because we put it under the rubric of abortion, it is \nOK.\n  What I want to show today, looking at this procedure, is this is not \nlike abortion. This is like infanticide. This is a baby who is all but \nborn and then killed. So I think we need to look at it and have this \ndebate focus on not the issue of abortion because there are plenty, as \nis evidenced by the numbers, of other procedures available to perform \nabortions. This is a rogue procedure that is infanticide. That is why \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who are supporters of abortion \nrights have joined with us because they believe this is a step too far. \nWe have drawn the line in the wrong place. Once the baby is in the \nprocess of being born, we have to say: Wait a minute; this baby is now \noutside of the mother, almost outside of the mother. This is not \nabortion anymore.\n  What happens is the mother presents herself to the  abortionist and \nthe abortionist decides they would like to do an intact D, or a \npartial-birth abortion. What happens is the abortionist will give the \nmother pills to dilate the mother's cervix so the abortionist can then \nperform the abortion. Not immediately; this is a 3-day procedure. The \nmother comes back in 2 days. On the third day, after she has taken the \npills the first day and the second day, she presents herself back to \nthe abortionist with the cervix dilated.\n\n  I can get into all the health reasons why this is dangerous and could \nlead to infections and problems, and what we have seen, not just \ninfections but it can lead to and, in fact, has led to babies being \nborn as a result of the dilation of the cervix. The mothers go into \nlabor and babies are born and born alive. In fact, we have cases in the \nlast few weeks where a baby who was to have been aborted through a \npartial-birth abortion was born alive and is alive today. By the way, \nthis is a perfectly healthy little girl. So when the argument is these \nbabies wouldn't live or these babies are deformed or it is for the \nhealth of the mother, none of this is true. None of this is true.\n  Now we have cases--in fact, just in the last few weeks, a case where \nthis baby is alive today. Another baby was born alive but not attended \nto by the abortionist, not attended to. They let the baby die.\n  Again, the point I am trying to make is, the line is a very important \none. You can see from the case where the baby was allowed to die that \nonce we begin to think of this little baby outside the mother as just a \ndisposable item, then we have lost something. We have blurred the line, \nwhich I do not think we as a society want to allow to be blurred, about \nwho is protected by our Constitution and our right to life.\n  Clearly, I hope we all believe that once a baby is born, that baby is \nentitled to life. Where we draw the line as\n\n[[Page S12865]]\n\nto when that occurs is significant. That is why many people who are, \nagain, for abortion rights say: Once the baby is outside, I am a little \nuncomfortable saying you can kill the baby, as well they should.\n  The mother presents herself, on the third day of the cervix being \ndilated, to the abortionist. The abortionist uses an ultrasound to \nexamine the mother and guide the abortionist to insert forceps in \nthrough the cervix, up into the uterus.\n  Those of you who have been involved in the birth of children know--we \nhave six children--babies are usually at that age in a head-down \nposition. They move around, but as they go further in pregnancy, the \nbaby usually has its head in the down position.\n  They reach up with the forceps and grab the baby by the foot or the \nleg. Again, this is a 20-week-plus baby. We have plenty of \ndocumentation that this has gone on at 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and even \nolder--but rare as it gets older, I admit that. This is a fully \ndeveloped baby that would otherwise, if delivered at this week of \ngestation, be born alive.\n  They take the baby and grab the leg with the forceps. Then  they turn \nthe baby around in the uterus. Many of you are familiar with the term \n``breech birth.'' When you present yourself for delivery of a baby and \nyou are told your baby is in a breech position, bells and whistles go \noff. Obstetricians get very nervous because there are a lot of \ndifficulties with delivering a baby in a breech position. There are a \nlot of complications, obviously for the baby, but also for the mother. \nTo deliberately turn a baby into a breech position, by common sense, \nendangers the mother. Obviously, in abortion it dramatically endangers \nthe baby.\n\n  They take the leg, and they pull the baby feet first out of the \nuterus through the birth canal. All of the baby is delivered except for \nthe head. The entire baby is outside the mother with the exception of \nthe baby's head. Again, we get back to the question, Is this an \nabortion or is this infanticide?\n  The reason this debate is so crucial is that it is where worlds \nintersect. It is the line we are going to draw. There are a lot of \npeople who are for abortion rights who say: Look, the line is, the baby \nis inside the mother; the mother can abort the baby, period. And they \nsay: But yes, obviously, when the baby is outside the mother, you \ncannot kill the baby.\n  This is where the worlds intersect because we have a situation where \nthe baby is almost outside the mother. This baby would be born alive \nbecause this procedure occurs after 20 weeks. What the abortionist does \nis deliver the baby, all but the head. Why? Because the head is the \nlargest part of the body at that age, so the most difficult to deliver.\n  There is also some question that if the baby comes out head first and \nonce the head is delivered, will the Constitution treat it differently, \nif the head comes out first as opposed to the feet coming out first? \nSome have argued that once the baby's head is through the cervix, that \nis birth, so maybe they are under constitutional rights.\n  Do you see how fuzzy this line is, and do you see why some on both \nsides of this issue believe it is important to draw the line so we do \nnot get into this rather difficult situation?\n  The baby is delivered, all but the head. The abortionist then does a \nbarbaric thing. I even think those who support this procedure would \nargue and would agree with me that this is barbaric. This is a living \nbaby, a human being. It is delivered outside of the mother. Its arms, \nits legs, its torso are outside the mother. The doctor, because they \ncannot see; it is a blind procedure--the baby is face down--feels up \nthe spine to the base of the neck, base of the skull, top of the neck, \nfinds the point at the bottom of the base of the skull, takes a pair of \nscissors, and jams it into the base of the baby's skull.\n  I do not have to tell you, a baby at 20-plus weeks has a fully \ndeveloped--I should not say fully--has a developed nervous system and \nfeels pain, acutely some have suggested, more than you would feel pain. \nA medical doctor takes a pair of scissors and jabs the baby in the \nskull.\n  Nurse Brenda Shafer, who testified before the Senate and House \nJudiciary Committees, described the reaction of one of the babies when \nthis occurred. The baby threw out its arms and legs. If you ever held a \nlittle baby and you gently bounced them in your arms, they stick out \ntheir arms because they are not sure, they lose their equilibrium. She \nsaid it was just like that. The little baby lost its equilibrium and \nthen fell down.\n  The baby is dead now. The abortionist has killed the baby that was 3 \ninches from being protected by the Constitution. Three inches more and \neverybody in America would say--everybody but a couple of people in \nPrinceton--that baby should no longer be able to be killed. But for \nthose 3 inches, that little baby is allowed to be executed in the most \npainful, brutal, insensitive, barbaric fashion of which I think any of \nus have heard.\n  To add insult to injury--let me put it a different way. To add insult \nto execution, they take the suction catheter, insert it in the hole \nmade by the scissors, and they suction out the baby's brains.  And a \nbaby's skull is soft. It has those plates that move, grow, allow the \nbaby's head to expand. The baby's head just collapses as a result of \nthe suction. And then this otherwise beautiful, healthy, normal baby--\nthat would otherwise be born alive and, in a vast majority of the \nnumbers, particularly after 22 weeks, would not only be born alive but \nwould be viable outside the mother--is then extracted completely from \nthe womb.\n\n  If you described what I just described as a procedure done on any \nhuman being in some foreign country as a way of torture, the American \npublic would be aghast, they would be outraged, outraged that such \nbarbarism could occur in a civilized country. But this barbarism occurs \nevery single day in America. Thousands of times a year, little babies \nare killed in this brutal fashion. Why? I will get to that in a minute.\n  Who performs this? And where, by the way? Is this performed in \nhospitals? The answer to that is no. No hospital would do an abortion \nsuch as this. Is this in the medical literature? The answer is no. It \nis not taught in any medical school. It is not taught anywhere except \nby the developer and another person from Ohio who developed this \nprocedure.\n  Is the person who developed this abortion technique a well-known \nobstetrician, someone who is board certified, someone who is an expert \nin internal fetal medicine? No. No. Not only is this person not board \ncertified, not only is this person not an expert in internal fetal \nmedicine, this person is not even an obstetrician.\n  The person who developed this procedure was a family practice doctor \nwho, I guess, could not make it saving children so went into the \nabortion business and developed this procedure, not because this was a \nprocedure that was in the best interest of anybody concerned, except \nthe abortionist, but because this is a much simpler procedure in the \nsense it takes less time, so you can do more abortions during a day. It \ntakes less time than other late-term abortions, so you can do more of \nthem. And, of course, when you get paid for these, the more you can do, \nthe more money you make.\n  Why is this procedure done? You will hear arguments today that this \nprocedure is done to protect the life and health of the mother--that is \nwhat you will hear: life and health--and another thing which is health \nrelated: the future fertility of the mother. We will have a long debate \nabout that. I am not going to take a lot of time in my opening \nstatement about that, but I do want to address it briefly.\n  No. 1, life. There is a clear life-of-the-mother exception in this \nbill. If this procedure needs to be used to protect the life of the \nmother, it can be used. Having said that, the person who developed this \nprocedure, the person who does, from what we know--again, we do not \nhave good information--most of these kinds of procedures, a guy named \nDr. Haskell from Ohio, has said under oath in a court of law--in a \ncourt of law, under oath--that this procedure is never used to protect \nthe life of the mother.\n  Under oath, in a court of law, what would seemingly be an admission \nagainst his own interest, in one of these suits that challenges the \nconstitutionality of this, he admitted, as, frankly, has everybody \nelse--except a few folks on the other side of the aisle who have it in \ntheir mind that somehow this is needed to save the life of the mother--\nit is never used.\n\n[[Page S12866]]\n\n  Do you know what we say? Fine. It is never used? We will  still put \nit in the bill. If there is some strange occurrence that no \nobstetrician I have heard of has come forward with to say needs to be \nused to protect the life of the mother, it is covered.\n\n  Think about this intuitively. This is why the doctor arrived and why \neverybody who has looked at this issue has arrived at the conclusion \nthat this is never used to protect the life of the mother.\n  If you had a mother who presents herself in a life-threatening \nsituation, would you give her two pills and say come back in 3 days? \nYou do not have to be an obstetrician to figure this one out, folks. If \nsomeone is in a life-threatening situation, you do not give them two \npills and say go home and come back in 3 days, and dilate their cervix \nduring that 3-day period.\n  So the argument that this is somehow used to protect the life of the \nmother is as bogus as a number of other lies I will go through here in \na minute that have been put forward by the other side to stop this \nprocedure from being banned.\n  Second, health. Again, same doctor, same case. Different question: Is \nthis procedure ever necessary to protect the health of the mother? \nAgain, the abortionist who helped develop the procedure, who uses it \nmore than anybody else, testifying in court, under oath: Is this \nnecessary to protect the health of the mother? Answer: No. No.\n  But you will see people come to the floor and talk about, oh, how \nthis is absolutely necessary, how this is an important health issue for \nwomen. We have over 400 obstetricians, most of them board certified, \nmany of them specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, who have written \nletters, who have signed documents, including the AMA--which is not a \npro-life organization, I might add--who have signed letters saying this \nis bad medicine; it is never necessary to protect the health of the \nmother to do this procedure.\n  Yet people will come down to this floor and say: Well, I can't be for \nthis because I need a health-of-the-mother exception and put up \n``cases'' where this was done and, as a result of this, the mother was \nable to have more children, was able to do other things; and if this \nprocedure were not done, then they would not have this opportunity.\n  I would not argue that this procedure could result in a positive \noutcome for the mother's health. Certainly it could. But that is not \nthe question. The question here is, Is it necessary--the answer is, \nno--to protect the health of the mother or the life of the mother.\n  And second, is it the best method? Clearly, given what we know about \nthis procedure and its profound implications on who we are as a \nsociety, the answer has to be emphatically--I hope from this body, \nwhich is so concerned about the consuming problem of violence in our \nsociety--I think a group of people who stand up and complain about \nshootings at Columbine will look at this and say: Wait a minute. If \nwe're saying this kind of brutality is OK, if the Senate and the \nPresident of the United States say this kind of brutality of our \nchildren is OK, then how in the world can we be aghast when other \nviolence is done to our children?\n  If we can stand here, with straight faces, and with passion in some \ncases, and argue that this kind of execution is not only legitimate but \npreferable, proper, constitutional, necessary, how can we be even the \nleast surprised that young people, looking at what goes on in the world \naround them--obviously, they get a lot of bad messages from Hollywood \nand from the media, but they only need to look to the Senate and to \nthis President to get their cue. The cue is violence is OK, as long as \nthere is some purpose to be served. And the purpose is to make sure we \ndon't have a chink in the armor of abortion rights. That is the \npurpose.\n\n  The question is, Why are they fighting this so hard? What is really \nthe problem? Why are they fighting what is an abomination? It is \nuncomfortable to talk about it. I am sure for those listening it is \nvery difficult to listen. This is not a pleasant subject. Why would you \nwant to get up year after year and fight this issue? What is the great \ncause at stake that we have to draw the line in the sand?\n  They will argue it is the health of the mother. It is not true. That \nhas never stopped them from arguing that. But when you have the people \nwho perform the abortions saying under oath that it is not true, it is \ndarn hard to come here and say this is why we want to do it, and for \nthose of us who have to listen to it, to say: Is this really what is at \nstake? Is this really the issue? Or is there something else going on? \nIs there an agenda?\n  I can tell you what the agenda is on our side. The agenda is very \nsimple. At a time when we are faced with senseless, irrational \nviolence, with a culture that is insensitive to life and promotes death \nthrough our music, through videos, just a little beacon of hope, a \nlittle grain of sand of affirmation that life is, in fact, something to \nbe cherished, not to be brutalized; that there are lines in our society \nthat we can't blur, that we shouldn't cross, because when we do that, \nwe throw in doubt, for millions of children and adults, the issue of, \nwell, maybe this isn't so wrong. We cloud the issue, the issue of life \nfor children that are 3 inches away from constitutional protection. \nDon't you think that is a good place to draw the  line? Don't you think \nthat is a reasonable place to say, OK, enough is enough?\n\n  No one is standing here arguing overturning Roe v. Wade. In fact, I \nwill make the argument, this is legitimate under Roe v. Wade. There is \nnothing here that will, even if it goes to the Court, overturn Roe v. \nWade. It is not our intention with this act.\n  This act is an attempt, and I would argue a feeble attempt--many of \nyou listening were around 30, 40 years ago. Could you imagine walking \nonto the Senate floor 40 years ago, turning on the television and \nseeing Walter Cronkite report on the debate on the Senate floor about \nwhether this should be legal in America? Can you imagine 40 years ago \nthat we would even have a debate in the Senate about whether this would \nbe allowed in America?\n  There isn't a person in the Senate who, 40 years ago, would have said \nthis is OK. They would have been appalled. Well, maybe in Nazi Germany \nor maybe in the Soviet Union, but in America, this? No. But how far we \nhave come. How much more civilized we have become. How culturated we \nhave become that now 40 years hence we can have these kinds of rational \ndebates and people can come to the floor of the Senate and say that \nthrusting a pair of scissors in the base of the skull of a little baby \nis OK. How far we have come. How humanity has grown and developed. How \nsophisticated we are that we can find precise legal arguments that will \nweave us through this web of destruction and say, but it is OK. \nAmericans go to sleep at night knowing that thousands of children, \nalmost born, inches from reaching toward that constitutional \nprotection, can be executed. We are all better for it. We are better as \na society for this.\n  They will not say that, but underneath the argument is this: This \nbeing legal is better for America. When people come and cast their \nvotes, you will have to cast the vote saying that allowing this to \noccur in America is better for us. It is preferable in the United \nStates of America that this occurs. We want this to continue. We \nbelieve this is right. We believe this is just. We believe this is \nhumane. We believe this is in the best spirit of America, liberty, and \nfreedom.\n  How twisted, how twisted we have become. How we contort ourselves to \nfind that path through rights to allow this to be the best that we are \nin America. We are better than that. This country stands for higher \nideals and principles than that. A majority of the Senate will agree \nwith me. A majority of the House will agree with me, a majority of \nAmericans. But that is not enough.\n  So this contorted construction of freedom will continue to be legal. \nCan you envision our Founding Fathers with these charts in front of \nthem saying: This is the product of liberty? This is the product of the \nhigh ideals that we suffered through in revolutionary, civil, and major \nworld wars to preserve? This is what it has come to? This is the \npersonification of liberty in America today? It is no wonder we are \nconcerned when we tuck our children into bed at night and we see what \nkind of world is ahead of them. How much more will we be able to twist \nfreedom and liberty to destroy their true freedoms? I tuck five little \nones in bed every night. I wonder, I wonder what is in store for them,  \nif we continue as the Senate, the greatest deliberative body\n\n[[Page S12867]]\n\nin the world, to allow this wanton destruction of the most vulnerable \nin our society. Where are we headed?\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for those who have followed this debate \nsince it opened about an hour ago, you have heard that those of us who \nwill fight on the floor of the Senate for moms, for our daughters, for \ntheir health, for their lives, are somehow evil and bad people. You \nhave heard in this debate, in some of the most inflammatory language, \nwhich I think is, in essence, very dangerous for this country, that \nthose of us who stand up to fight to make sure that every child is a \nwanted child, that every child who comes into this world is wanted and \nloved, that every woman has a right to be respected--you have heard \nthat somehow we want to bring violence to children. You have heard the \nword ``executioners'' relating to doctors who take an oath ``to do no \nharm,'' who save lives, who bring babies into the world. Executioners. \nI am stunned by the tenor of the debate. I am troubled by the tenor of \nthe debate.\n  The majority leader was sent a letter by a number of groups asking \nhim to please not bring this issue up this week, could he wait a week. \nThey noted that on Saturday, we will have the 1-year anniversary of the \nassassination of a doctor, Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered in his \nhome, through a window, by a coward who took this man from his family. \nThe majority leader was told there have been five sniper attacks on \nU.S. and Canadian physicians who performed abortions since 1994. All of \nthose victims were shot in their homes by a hidden sniper who used a \nlong-range rifle. Dr. Slepian was killed, and three other physicians \nwere seriously wounded in these attacks--for making sure that women had \ntheir legal rights protected and their health protected.\n  I think it is sad that we would have this debate, with the most \ninflammatory language I have ever heard on the Senate floor to date. I \nknow the FBI and the Attorney General are going to be ever more \nvigilant because of this debate. I know that and I am glad about that. \nIt is very hard for me to imagine that we could not have put this off a \nweek. Here we are. And instead of having a debate that should be based \non the merits of the discussion, it has been inflamed.\n  Yesterday, I said if 100 doctors walked into the Senate and sat down \nin our chairs to practice being Senators, they would be arrested and \ndragged out of here. Yet here we are in the Senate --100 of us, and not \none of us an obstetrician, not one of us a gynecologist--deciding what \nprocedures should or should not be used, and under what circumstances, \nin a matter that should be left to the medical profession, left to the \nfamilies of this country, left to loving moms and dads. So here we are \npracticing medicine in the Senate and not even doing a very good job of \nit, I might say, if you listen to the physicians who have written to us \non this matter.\n  I am going to place into the Record several letters from \norganizations consisting of physicians. Here is one from the Society of \nPhysicians for Reproductive Choice and Health--the people my colleague \nhas called ``executioners.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate and of this country, these are the \npeople who bring our children into the world. These are the people who \nsave their lives when they are hurt. These are the people we run to \nwhen they have to go to an emergency room.\n  This is the statement:\n\n       In what it claims as a tribute to mothers, the United \n     States Senate today will vote on a bill criminalizing a \n     procedure . . .\n       . . . legislators supporting this ban are not celebrating \n     mothers--but, in fact, are dishonoring and condemning \n     motherhood by placing pregnant women at greater risk for \n     infertility and death.\n\n  These are the people to whom we turn when we are sick, and they are \ntelling us not to pass the Santorum bill. They bring back the days \nbefore 1973:\n\n       Prior to abortion's legalization in 1973, the leading cause \n     of maternal death in this nation was illegal abortion. As \n     Congress attempts to ban abortion, procedure by procedure, \n     more and more pregnant women will die. As physicians \n     concerned about the health and lives of our women patients, \n     we believe this is a shameful celebration of motherhood.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Statement On Santorum Bill (H.R. 1122/S. 6) Banning a Procedure Known \n          Medically as Dilatation and Extraction, May 20, 1997\n\n       In what it claims is a tribute to mothers, the United \n     States Senate today will vote on a bill criminalizing a \n     procedure known medically as dilatation and extraction. \n     Ironically, legislators supporting this ban are not \n     celebrating mothers--but, in fact, are dishonoring and \n     condemning motherhood by placing pregnant women at greater \n     risk for infertility and death.\n       Congressional supporters of this ban are hiding from women \n     and their families the true consequences of this bill: it \n     makes unavailable to physicians and their women patients a \n     safer, less risky medical option during health- and life-\n     threatening events that can occur during pregnancy. Women, \n     their families and their physicians must be alarmed by \n     Congressional plans to deny a medical option that preserves \n     women's health and lives.\n       Contrary to popular belief, it already is illegal to \n     perform a third trimester abortion on a healthy mother \n     carrying a healthy fetus. Abortion opponents who present \n     graphics of darling, full-developed babies being aborted are \n     gravely misleading and misinforming the public and \n     policymakers. Opponent admit these graphics are false, but \n     continue to use them anyway.\n       Annually, 300 to 600 third trimester post-viability \n     pregnancies are terminated legally for specific medical \n     complications that can develop during the pregnancy's course. \n     These conditions pose severe health and life threats to the \n     women--including infertility and death. When maternal \n     complications develop, these pregnancies are terminated only \n     after attempts are made to deliver the fetus safely while \n     preserving the health and life of the mother. Decisions to \n     terminate pregnancy at this stage are not considered by one \n     physician alone. In fact physicians and their patients seek \n     second and third medical opinions.\n       Some severe complications that can affect pregnancy \n     include; The development of cancer during pregnancy; severe \n     pre-eclampsia (toxemia) accompanied by kidney or liver \n     failure; uncontrollable health failure; long-standing insulin \n     dependent diabetes causing declining renal kidney function; \n     Lou Gehrig's disease and other conditions causing respiratory \n     failure; or, severe hypertension (high blood pressure) \n     diseases causing maternal organ failure and maternal death.\n       The severity of these complications may make labor or \n     caesarean section fatal.\n       Approximately one percent of all legal abortions occur late \n     in the second trimester before fetal viability. Some are \n     performed on women facing medical complications described \n     earlier. Other women carry fetuses with serious genetic or \n     developmental anomalies, including abnormal fetal kidneys, \n     heart and brains--complications not usually detected until \n     the second trimester.\n       Legal late second trimester abortions also are performed on \n     women who, lacking health insurance and access to healthcare \n     facilities, are unaware they are pregnant or unable to \n     terminate the pregnancy earlier. Some women with irregular \n     menstrual cycles may be unaware of their pregnancy. For some \n     of these women, dilatation and extraction is the safest \n     medical option because the fetal head is disproportionately \n     large and trapped in the dilated cervix during delivery.\n       Banning dilatation and extraction will force competent \n     physicians to choose riskier medical options that increase \n     danger to patients. For women, these options are lengthy and \n     painful, including the placement of surgical instruments into \n     the uterus, increasing the risk of uterine perforation and \n     infertility. Another option uses medication to induce labor, \n     increasing the risk of maternal death from blood clotting \n     failure and hemorrhage.\n       Prior to abortion's legalization in 1973, the leading cause \n     of maternal death in this nation was illegal abortion. As \n     Congress attempts to ban abortion, procedure by procedure, \n     more and more pregnant women will die. As physicians \n     concerned about the health and lives of our women patients, \n     we believe this is a shameful celebration of motherhood.\n       Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health oppose the \n     Santorum Bill (H.R. 1122/S.6).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have a letter from the executive vice \npresident of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \nThese are the men and women who bring life into the world. These are \nthe men and women who deliver our babies. I find it interesting when \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania talks about breach births--I had a breach \nbirth; I don't think he ever did, and I know what it is. I know what \nthe risks are. I am a mother of two beautiful children. I am a \ngrandmother of one beautiful grandson, and I tuck him in and I read him \nstories and I love him. I want him to\n\n[[Page S12868]]\n\ngrow up in a world where families are respected, where physicians are \nrespected, where no one stands up on the floor of the Senate and calls \na physician an executioner. I don't think that is a good country. I \ndon't think that is respect. I don't think that brings healing to this \nissue.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said:\n\n       [This bill] is vague and broad. . . . It fails to use \n     recognized medical terminology and fails to define explicitly \n     the prohibited medical techniques it criminalizes.\n\n  That is an important point. Bills just like this one have been ruled \nunconstitutional 20 times. One of those decisions was in the State of \nArkansas, and I am going to share those decisions with you because I \nthink it is important. So many of us say: local control, let the States \ndecide.\n  The States have passed these laws, and not one of them yet has been \nproven constitutional or declared constitutional. But they have been \ndeclared unconstitutional because of what the doctors are saying--the \nlanguage in this bill is so vague. And the language in all those bills \nis that they would, in fact, outlaw all abortion at any particular time \nduring the pregnancy.\n  So when my colleague from Pennsylvania says, well, we don't want to \noverturn Roe v. Wade--and perhaps we will have a chance to vote on that \nas well--but when he says that, that is not what the courts are saying. \nThe courts are saying his law does, in fact, make all abortions illegal \nand would criminalize abortion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n           Women's Health Care Physicians,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization representing 40,000 \n     physicians dedicated to improving women's health, continues \n     to oppose S. 928, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n     1999.'' ACOG urges the Senate to reject this legislation.\n       ACOG believes that S. 928, as amended, continues to \n     represent an inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous \n     intervention into medical decision-making. The amended bill \n     still fails to include an exception for the protection for \n     the health of the woman.\n       Further, the bill violates a fundamental principle at the \n     very heart of the doctor-patient relationship: that the \n     doctor, in consultation with the patient, based on that \n     patient's individual circumstances, must choose the most \n     appropriate method of care for the patient. This bill removes \n     decision-making about medical appropriateness from the \n     physician and the patient.\n       S. 928 is vague and broad, with the potential to restrict \n     other techniques in obstetrics and gynecology. It fails to \n     use recognized medical terminology and fails to define \n     explicitly the prohibited medical techniques it criminalizes. \n     In the most recent court action, the Eighth US Circuit Court \n     of Appeals ruled that the ``partial birth'' abortion laws in \n     three states were unconstitutionally vague.\n       Moreover, the ban applies to all stages of pregnancy. It \n     would have a chilling effect on medical behavior and \n     decision-making, with the potential to outlaw techniques that \n     are critical to the lives and health of American women. Chief \n     Judge Richard Arnold wrote in the Eighth Circuit decision \n     that, ``Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the \n     right of women to choose whether to have an abortion.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is a letter from the American \nMedical Women's Association.\n  Are these executioners, too? They work in the medical field. They say \nthey are gravely concerned with governmental attempts to legislate \nmedical decisionmaking through measures that do not protect a woman's \nphysical and mental health, including future fertility, or fail to \nconsider other pertinent issues such as fetal abnormality. And they \nstrongly oppose governmental efforts to interfere with physician-\npatient autonomy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Statement of the American Medical Women's Association on Abortion \n                   Legislation in the 105th Congress\n\n       Alexandria, VA (May 20, 1997).--The American Medical \n     Women's Association, ``is committed to protecting the \n     reproductive rights of American women and has opposed any \n     legislative intervention for medical and or surgical care \n     decisions,'' says current AMWA President Debra R. Judelson, \n     MD. This week, AMWA reitrated its opposition to H.R. 1122 and \n     S. 6, which seek to ban a particular medical procedure.\n       It is the opinion of AMWA's Executive Committee that \n     legislative efforts to regulate abortion have been flawed. \n     Concerns in the following areas have prevented AMWA from \n     taking a position on recent legislative efforts focusing on \n     abortion in the 105th Congress.\n       AMWA is gravely concerned with governmental attempts to \n     legislate medical decisionmaking through measures that do not \n     protect a woman's physical and mental health, including \n     future fertility, or fail to consider other pertinent issues, \n     such as fetal abnormalities. Physicians and their patients \n     base their decisions on the best available information at the \n     time, often in emergency situations. AMWA strongly opposes \n     governmental efforts to interfere with physician-patient \n     autonomy.\n       It is irresponsible to legislate a particular test of \n     viability without recognition that viability cannot always be \n     reliably determined. Length of gestation is not the sole \n     measure of viability because fetal dating is an inexact \n     science.\n       AMWA resolutely opposes the levying of civil and criminal \n     penalties for care provided in the best interest of the \n     patient. AMWA strongly supports the principle that medical \n     care decisions be left to the judgment of a woman and her \n     physician without fear of civil action or criminal \n     prosecution.\n       Any forthcoming legislation will be carefully reviewed by \n     AMWA based on the criteria outlined above, and AMWA will seek \n     to ensure that there is no further erosion of the \n     constitutionally protected rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. \n     Says AMWA President Debra R. Judelson, MD, ``AMWA firmly \n     believes that physicians, not the President or Congress, \n     should determine appropriate medical options. We cannot and \n     will not support any measures that seek to undermine the \n     ability of physicians to make medical decisions.''\n       AMWA has long supported a woman's right to determine \n     whether to continue or terminate her pregnancy without \n     government restrictions placed on her physician's medical \n     judgment and without spousal or parental interference.\n       Founded in 1915, the American Medical Women's Association \n     represents more than 10,000 women physicians and medical \n     students and is dedicated to furthering the professional and \n     personal development of its members and promoting women's \n     health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the American Nurses Association--are they \nexecutioners or are they loving people who choose this field of work \nbecause they want to make people well because they have compassion in \ntheir hearts--what do they say about this?\n  They oppose the Santorum bill. They say it is inappropriate for \nCongress to mandate a course of action for a woman who is already faced \nwith an intensely personal and difficult decision. They represent 2.2 \nmillion registered nurses. They ask us to defeat this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the \n     opposition of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1122, \n     the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997'', which is \n     being considered by the Senate this week. This legislation \n     would impose Federal criminal penalties and provide for civil \n     actions against health care providers who perform certain \n     late-term abortions.\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and \n     equitable access of all women to basic health services, \n     including services related to reproductive health. This \n     legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles. It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a \n     course of action for a woman who is already faced with an \n     intensely personal and difficult decision.\n       The American Nurses Association is the only full-service \n     professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 \n     million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations. ANA advances the nursing profession by \n     fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the \n     economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, \n     projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by \n     lobbying the Congress and regulatory agencies on health care \n     issues affecting nurses and the public.\n       The American Nurses Association appreciates your work in \n     safeguarding women's\n\n[[Page S12869]]\n\n     access to reproductive health care and respectfully urges \n     members of the Senate to vote against H.R. 1122.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Geri Marullo, RN,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if someone wants to stand up here on the \nSenate floor and attack a whole part of our America, and if they want \nto use cartoons on the floor of the Senate to depict a woman's body, \nthat is up to them. But I ask the American people to be the judge both \nof the substance of what is happening here, the techniques that have \nbeen used, and the inflammatory level of the debate.\n  I want you to meet a real person. I want to picture a real face--not \na cartoon, but a real face--on the floor of this Senate. I want to tell \na little bit about her story.\n  This is Tiffany Benjamin:\n\n       My husband and I waited until we established in our careers \n     and could provide the best possible environment for a child. \n     In 1994, we were thrilled with the news that we were \n     expecting a baby. My first five months were joyous months of \n     pregnancy. During a routine checkup my physician performed a \n     standard AFT test. The results were abnormal. So my doctor \n     ordered another test. Unfortunately, this test was also \n     irregular. In my 20th week of pregnancy we discovered that \n     our child had trisomy 13.\n\n  In plain English, each cell of her body carried an additional 13th \nchromosome. Doctors advised that her condition was lethal.\n\n       No one could offer us hope. Sadly we determined that the \n     most merciful decision for our child--\n\n  Our child in our family--\n\n     would be to terminate my pregnancy. Although the years have \n     passed, for us the depth of our loss is vivid in our mind. We \n     are astounded that anyone could believe that this type of \n     decision is made irresponsibly and without a great deal of \n     soul searching and anxiousness. These choices were \n     undoubtedly the most painful decisions of our lives. Please \n     don't compound the pain of other families like ours by taking \n     away our ability to make the difficult choices that only we \n     can make in consultation with our physician. Please reject S. \n     1692 and protect our families from this dangerous \n     legislation.\n\n  I ask you to look at Tiffany with her child. Does she look like an \nexecutioner to you? Does she look like someone who didn't want to have \nthis child and suddenly woke up and said: I have changed my mind? No. \nThis is a loving woman, a loving family member. She had to have this \nprocedure, and this legislation would stop her from having it.\n  I want to tell you about another woman, Cindy, a 30-year-old mother \nof five living in Kansas City who said very proudly that she is a \nCatholic.\n  In June of 1998, Cindy noticed a lump on her neck and called her \ndoctor. Within weeks, she found that she had thyroid cancer and, after \nsurgery, began iodine radiation treatment. Contrary to medical \nprotocol, she was not given a pregnancy test prior to the radiation \ntreatment. Cindy's body did not respond to the radiation, and blood \nresults indicated her body still contained the deadly disease. After \nreturning to the hospital for another treatment, her blood was drawn \nfor a pregnancy test, but the staff did not wait for the results; they \ngave her another iodine radiation pill.\n  Due to the radioactive iodine in her body, she was placed in an \nisolation room. No one could enter--not her husband, or her nurses, or \nher physician.\n  Two hours later, she received a phone call from her physician telling \nher they had made a terrible mistake. Her pregnancy test came back \npositive. She immediately started drinking water because the doctors \ntold her all she could do in an attempt to shield her baby from the \nradiation was to drink a lot of water.\n\n  The next day, a second pregnancy test confirmed the first and a \nsonogram was ordered. That is when Cindy and her husband learned that \nnot only was she 13 weeks pregnant but she was expecting twins, the \ntwins they had always hoped for.\n  Imagine the feeling of that family. Within hours, the family learned \nthat their babies would not survive, not grow, not develop. The \nradiation her babies received was equivalent to the bomb dropped on \nHiroshima.\n  Cindy says:\n\n       We decided that termination would be best for our family \n     and our babies. Through our research, our insurance company \n     told us, however, that we were on our own.\n\n  And she adds:\n\n       You see, as a Federal employee my insurance will not pay \n     for elective abortions.\n\n  She says because this abortion was meant to preserve her health, \nbecause of the votes in this Congress, she could not get help. She \nsays:\n\n       I have five little ones at home who depend on their mommy \n     ever day. I didn't want to have an abortion but I needed one. \n     And the abortion that I had would have clearly been banned by \n     this bill, and I thank God that this bill didn't tie my \n     doctor's hands.\n\n  Let me just say that again. This is a woman who is religious. This is \na woman who says to us thank God that bill wasn't law, the bill that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania is fighting so hard to become law. She \nsays thank God it wasn't the law. She says this is clearly an intensely \nprivate, torturous decision.\n  Are proponents willing to tie the hands of both parents and \nphysicians and say to a woman: You must carry your child to term \ndespite the fact that it has been determined the child won't live and \nyour health will be affected?\n  I have to say that these women who are proud to come forward to help \nus in a very difficult issue deserve our thanks because here they are \nbeing called the worst names in the book, being essentially told that \nthey don't love children, that they don't care about children, when in \nfact these are loving moms and, in many cases, quite religious.\n  This is the third time the Republican leadership has brought this \nbill before the Senate. Again, it is playing doctor without one \nobstetrician or one gynecologist among us. The obstetricians and the \ngynecologists say we shouldn't do this. The women who have had this \nprocedure say we shouldn't do it.\n  We are going to have a lot more debate. I know my colleague from \nIllinois is here, and he has a very important piece of legislation to \noffer. But before I give up the floor this time, I want to talk about \nwhat has happened in the courts because my colleague from Pennsylvania \nhas made a statement I think that is fairly dismissive of what has \nactually happened. He says some of the courts have upheld this \nprocedure and some have not.\n\n  I will discuss what the courts have done not because I am telling my \ncolleagues to vote against their conscience; if they want to vote for \nsomething unconstitutional, that is their right. They ought to hear the \narguments made in the 20 States in which this particular procedure has \nbeen called unconstitutional.\n  This chart shows which States have enjoined these bans. I put \n``partial-birth abortion bans'' in quotes because there is no such \nthing. This is the political terminology. Nearly every court to rule on \nthe merits of an abortion ban since the Senate last voted on the issue \nhas ruled this abortion ban is unconstitutional. These are the States \nthat have so far enjoined this Santorum-like legislation from going \ninto effect: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, \nKentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, \nOhio, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and in Georgia and \nAlabama there has been limited enforcement.\n  We have a string of decisions. I will read quotes of judges from \nthese States--and as so many of my colleagues have said, as our \nPresident has said, we ought to listen to the States. Let's hear what \nthe State judges are saying when they have overturned these types of \nbans.\n  First, from a Federal judge in Arizona:\n\n       The term ``partial-birth abortion'' is not a term found in \n     the medical literature.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The judge writes:\n\n       The term ``partial-birth abortion'' is not a term found in \n     the medical literature. The testimony of witnesses at trial \n     indicates that this term is ambiguous and susceptible to \n     different interpretations.\n\n  The important point is, when my colleague from Pennsylvania says he \nonly means it to be a handful of procedures, this particular judge, \nJudge Bilby in Arizona says no, the term is so vaguely worded it could \napply to many other abortions, and that essentially would overturn a \nwoman's right to choose.\n  In Arkansas, Judge Richard Arnold says:\n\n       As we shall explain, ``partial'' delivery occurs as part of \n     other recognized abortion procedures, methods that are \n     concededly constitutionally protected. Under precedents laid \n     out by the Supreme Court, which is our\n\n[[Page S12870]]\n\n     duty to follow, such a prohibition is overbroad and places an \n     undue burden on the right of women to decide whether to have \n     an abortion.\n\n  This is a judge in Arkansas saying the Santorum-type language is so \nbroad and the procedure is so broadly explained it could, in fact, \napply to any type of abortion. He ruled it unconstitutional.\n  In Illinois, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Kocoras, said:\n\n       First, the statute, as written, has the potential effect of \n     banning the most common and safest abortion procedures.\n\n  He looked at the Santorum-like bill and said it also was \nunconstitutional.\n  U.S. District Court Judge Heyburn in Kentucky says:\n\n       By choosing words having a broader scope, the legislature \n     moved from arguably firm constitutional ground--banning a \n     very limited procedure use for late-term abortions--to a \n     quagmire of constitutional infirmity.\n\n  There is a common thread among the judges--by the way, from very \nconservative areas of our country--who are saying the Santorum-type of \nban is so broadly worded it would take away a woman's right to choose \neven at the early stages of pregnancy.\n  In Nebraska, Judge Richard Arnold says:\n\n       The law refers to ``partial-birth abortion'' but this term, \n     though widely used by lawmakers and in the popular press, has \n     no fixed medical or legal content.\n       It would also prohibit in many circumstances the most \n     common method of second trimester abortions . . . under the \n     controlling precedents laid down by court, such a prohibition \n     places an undue burden on the right of women to choose \n     whether to have an abortion.\n\n  For colleagues who say vote for Santorum; it doesn't take away a \nwoman's right to choose, we have 20 court decisions that say it does. \nIn certain States, they have stopped performing abortions because the \ndoctor was afraid he would be arrested for performing an early-stage \nabortion.\n  In summing up, we were elected to be Senators. We have a lot of work \nto do. We weren't elected to be the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists. They have their own organization. We should vote \ndown this unconstitutional bill. If we do not--because I know this is \npolitical--why else would it be before the Senate? This is politics at \nits worst. This is the third time the President will veto this bill. We \nall know we will have the votes to sustain that veto. Why go through \nthis if not for politics?\n  This is a debate we should not be having right now. It has been, \nunfortunately, in my view, very divisive so far. I hope we can get back \non solid ground. Let Members not call people executioners; let Members \nnot call families unimportant; let Members not demean women, and say \nthe other side says the health of the woman is important. Yes, the \nhealth of women, the health of men, the health of families, that should \nbe our paramount concern. We are not physicians. Within the context of \nthe law, Roe v. Wade, which was decided in 1973, let Members make the \ndecision as to what is best for our women, our families, and our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I consider my service in the Senate \nrepresenting the people of Illinois to be the highest honor I have ever \nbeen given. I continue to believe it is the very best job in American \npolitics. As I go back to my home State and meet with people who have \nentrusted me with this responsibility, I literally thank them for \ngiving me this opportunity.\n  However, this debate may be one of the most painful aspects of \nserving in the Congress, and specifically in the Senate, because it \nraises before the Senate an issue which most Senators would rather not \nlook at again. In the course of 17 years, I have voted on this abortion \nissue countless times. Each time has been a struggle.\n  I am sure those who are listening to this debate might question what \nI just said. Don't you get used to it? Isn't it automatic? Don't you \njust vote the same way you did last time?\n  That has never been the case for me. I have tried in every instance \nto be honest about the specific debate that was involved. My views on \nthis issue have changed over the years as I have listened to the debate \nof those with various positions.\n  I have come to a position now that I am at peace with personally. \nThough I know that I am at peace, the people I represent may see \ndifferently.\n  The best I can say in the course of this debate is what I am about to \nsay and what I am about to offer in terms of an amendment which \nrepresents my best good-faith effort to deal with a painful issue. This \nis not like most issues we face in the Senate. I can go home after a \nweek of working most times and people do not have a clue as to what we \nhave even talked about or debated. I can go to family reunions and get-\ntogethers and people do not ask me how did you vote on a certain bill \ninvolving grazing rights in the West. It never comes up.\n  But this issue, the issue of abortion, is one that most Americans \nhave an opinion on because we have been confronted, since the Roe v. \nWade decision, with a huge national debate, a very divisive debate as \nto whether the Supreme Court was correct or incorrect in giving a woman \nin the United States the right to choose whether to have an abortion \nprocedure.\n  There are people dug in on both sides of this debate. What I am \nsaying, I am sure, is no surprise to anyone who observes it. There are \nsome who believe that Roe v. Wade was just plain wrong; that the \nSupreme Court never should have legalized abortion procedures under any \ncircumstances. There are those on the opposite side of the spectrum who \nbelieve that Roe v. Wade did not go far enough with respect to a \nwoman's right to choose and her privacy. I think you will find the \nmajority of Americans in between those two groups; struggling, on one \nhand, I think, to keep abortion safe and legal but, on the other hand, \nto put restrictions on it which are common sense.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania comes before us today with a bill which \nseeks to address one aspect. He has focused on one particular abortion \nprocedure. It goes by a lot of different names. The common parlance is \npartial-birth abortion. There are some who say that is just a made-up \nname for politics; it has nothing to do with medical terminology. But \nfor better or for worse, that is how this debate is characterized, the \npartial-birth abortion debate, which has been around so many times on \nthis floor and in Congress.\n  It now has a further shorthand, PBA. I do not think that is fair to \nthe Senator offering the amendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania, nor \nto the gravity of the issue. This is a serious issue. The Senator from \nPennsylvania focuses on this procedure which I will tell you, as I view \nit, is a gruesome procedure. It is gruesome. I don't know if his \ndescription of it is accurate, but if it is close to accurate it is \ngruesome.\n  He believes this procedure should be banned at every stage of \npregnancy. Let me address that from two perspectives. First, there has \nbeen a lot said on the floor already this morning as to whether or not \nthis kind of procedure is ever medically necessary. I am not a doctor. \nI cannot reach that conclusion on my own. I have to turn to others for \nadvice.\n  Let me tell you what I did last year, in July. I had just read an \narticle published in the Chicago Tribune in my home State that quoted \nformer Surgeon General Everett Koop. Because of that article and what I \nread and my respect for him, I sent a letter. My letter was addressed \nto Dr. Ralph Hale, the executive director of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists here in Washington.\n  I am going to read the letter because I want you to understand I \ntried my very best to give an open-ended opportunity for this medical \ndoctor in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology to tell me his \nprofessional opinion. Let me read the letter:\n\n       Dear Dr. Hale, enclosed is a commentary that appeared in \n     yesterday's Chicago Tribune. It quotes former Surgeon General \n     C. Everett Koop as saying that ``Partial-birth abortion is \n     never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or \n     future fertility.''\n       I am writing to request your College's response to this \n     statement. In the medical judgment of the experts among your \n     members, is it true that partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future \n     fertility?\n       As I am sure you know, this is a matter of great concern to \n     many members of Congress including myself, and I would \n     appreciate your timely response to this important question.\n\n  I sent that letter on July 28, 1998. I received a reply on August 13, \n1998,\n\n[[Page S12871]]\n\nfrom Dr. Ralph Hale, executive vice president of the American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists. When I finish reading it, I will \nask it be printed in the Record. But I would like to read it in its \nentirety so there is no doubt I asked an open-ended question of experts \nin the field, and this is Dr. Hale's reply:\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am writing in response to your July \n     28th letter in which you asked for the College's response to \n     Dr. Koop's statement that ``Partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future \n     fertility.''\n\n  The letter went on to say:\n\n       The College's position on this is contained in the \n     statement of policy entitled Statement on Intact Dilation and \n     Extraction. In that statement we say, ``Terminating a \n     pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life \n     or preserve the health of the mother.'' It continues, ``A \n     select panel convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances \n     under which this procedure, as defined above, would be the \n     only option to save the life or preserve the health of the \n     woman.'' Our statement goes on to say, ``An intact D & X \n     however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a \n     particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with \n     the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances \n     can make this decision.'' For this reason, we have \n     consistently opposed ``partial-birth abortion'' legislation.\n\n  It goes to say:\n\n       Please find enclosed ACOG's statement on intact D & X. \n     Thank you for seeking the views of the College. As always, we \n     are pleased to work with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ralph W. Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for the question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator very much for yielding. The reason \nI am going to ask the question is an article written by two \nNorthwestern health care physicians from Northwestern University in \nEvanston, IL, who cited the same statement out of the select panel. \nThey went on to say, after they quoted what you quoted in your letter:\n\n       However, no specific examples of circumstances under which \n     intact D will be the appropriate.\n\n  In fact, in subsequent communications with ACOG and others, we have \nasked, give us one set of medical--any set of medical circumstances \nwhere you believe that this ``may be--whatever.''\n  Never have we gotten any circumstance where that was the case. So \nthey say it may be, but no one to date has provided any circumstance, \nas hypothetical as you want, where, in fact, it would be.\n  Just to say it may be without giving evidence of what it was, I think \nmy question is--I think the next question to which you hopefully can \nget an answer, I can't--you say it may be. Give me a for instance. So \nfar, we have not been able to get any for instance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. That is a \nreasonable question.\n  I would say to him, though, there is clearly, at least, a difference \nof opinion within the medical community as to medical necessity.\n  Dr. Koop, whom I respect very much and have worked with on a lot of \nissues, says: Never. The American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists says it is never the only thing you can do, but it may be \nthe most appropriate thing to do for the health of the mother. And \nthen, of course, you go on to say give us some examples. I think that \nis reasonable.\n  I ask we continue the debate at least to find out what those examples \nmight be. That is reasonable.\n  But you have to say at this moment in time there at least is a \ndifference of opinion, based on the letters introduced by the Senator \nfrom California, among medical professionals as to whether this is ever \nmedically necessary or the most appropriate thing.\n  This raises a policy question. When we get to the point where doctors \ndiffer about the use of a procedure, is it appropriate, then, for the \nSenate to decide that we will ban a procedure, a medical procedure? \nThat is what the Santorum amendment does. I think the Senator from \nPennsylvania would concede it.\n  He attempts to ban the use of this procedure. Based on this letter I \nreceived from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nto do so would say to doctors in some circumstances: You may not use \nthe safest procedure for my wife, my daughter, my sister; Congress has \nbanned that procedure. That is where I struggle with what the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is attempting to do.\n  I am not the doctor. I will not play one in the Senate. When I rely \non doctors' opinions, they are at best divided on the question.\n  Let me address the second issue in relation to the Santorum \nlegislation, and that is why we are doing this again and again. I do \nnot question the sincerity of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I know his \nfeelings on this subject are heartfelt, but I do question why we \ncontinue to bring this same legislation time and time again before the \nSenate, not because it is not important to the Senator from \nPennsylvania and others, but, frankly, we have been getting readings \nfrom courts across America that this language he is proposing today is, \non its face, unconstitutional.\n  We are spending our time in a debate over a bill which 19 States have \nstricken. These States have all tried to model some type of legislation \nbased on his banning this procedure, and time after time, Federal \ncourts have come forward and said, no, this is unconstitutional. The \njudges making the decisions are not so-called liberal jurists. You will \nfind within their ranks appointees of President Reagan and President \nBush, some very conservative jurists who say on its face this is not \nconstitutional.\n  We took an oath as Members of the Senate to uphold that Constitution. \nThere are times when interpretations can differ as to what that oath \nmeans. But in this case, the Santorum legislation before us has \nconsistently been stricken by the courts, I believe, with only one \nexception, in the United States. Because of that, I have to ask this \nquestion, not questioning the Senator's sincerity, but why are we doing \nthis? Why are we engaged in this debate over language which time and \ntime again has been found unconstitutional and enjoined in my home \nState of Illinois and across the Nation?\n  This is a political exercise. It is not an attempt to pass a bill \nwhich will become a law. Forget for a moment the President's veto, if \nyou will, and take a look at the merits of the legislation which time \nand time again has been found by the courts to violate the \nConstitution.\n  I would think that at this point in time, the author, whose feelings \non this are heartfelt, would have changed his approach, changed his \nlanguage, tried to address some of the constitutional questions, but it \nhas not happened. We get a rerun every year. This is all about a record \nvote. This is all about raising this issue for public consciousness and \na record vote of the Members of the Senate.\n  Some people want a scorecard. Some people want to use it politically. \nSo be it. That happens around here. It is a shame that it happens on an \nissue of this gravity and importance because, honestly, I do believe \nthere are things we can and should do which will address what I raised \nearlier. The feeling of the vast majority of Americans is that \nabortions should remain safe and legal and that restrictions on \nabortion should be in place only when necessary.\n  I am going to offer an amendment shortly which addresses my approach \nto this. As I said earlier, although I am honored to have nine \ncosponsors, nine other Senators who join me in this amendment--it is a \nbipartisan amendment--including the two Senators from the State of \nMaine, both Republican, I do not suggest it is the point of view of \nanyone other than ourselves. A vote will demonstrate whether I am right \nor wrong. I hope a majority sees this as a reasonable way to bring this \ncontentious debate to a constitutional and fairminded conclusion.\n\n  If we do not, I predict we will have another vote next year on the \nunconstitutional Santorum legislation and perhaps in years in the \nfuture. But what will we have achieved? Contentious, painful debate \nwith no resolution other than a political scorecard, and that for me is \na troubling outcome.\n  I hope we can find a better way to do it because I believe there is a \nmore sensible way. Let me tell you why I think there is.\n\n[[Page S12872]]\n\n  I am going to offer an amendment which addresses not an abortion \nprocedure but addresses a stage in pregnancy. It is a stage which is \nknown as postviability, that moment in time where the decision is \nreached that the fetus can sustain survival outside the womb with or \nwithout artificial support. That is a moving target. Viability has \nchanged because medicine has changed. Go into any neonatal intensive \ncare unit in America and look at the size of the babies who are \nsurviving. They are smaller than your hand, tiny little babies who are \nsurviving.\n  Viability is a moving target, and it was a standard that was used in \nthe Roe v. Wade decision. They said until that moment in time when that \nfetus is viable, could survive outside the womb, then there are certain \nlegal rights in this country. But once viability is reached, those \nrights change, and we start acknowledging the fact that this fetus has \nnow become a potential human being at birth. Roe v. Wade said we will \ndefine the laws of America based on viability.\n  The problem with the Santorum legislation, the reason why this bill \nand versions similar to it have been found unconstitutional time and \nagain, is they refuse to accept this basic premise, the premise of Roe \nv. Wade, the premise of existing law in this country. They will not \nacknowledge that you should have a law banning a certain procedure only \nafter viability. Each time it is stricken because it would, in fact, \nrestrict the right to abortion before viability, before the fetus can \nsurvive. Court after court after court has stricken down State laws \nthat have followed this Santorum model. Yet here we are again.\n  My amendment, the one which I will offer to the Santorum bill, \naccepts the Roe v. Wade premise that any changes which we are going to \nmake have to be consistent with Roe v. Wade, and this is what it says: \nAny late-term abortion--that is, an abortion after viability--is \ndisallowed or prohibited under law. We are talking usually 7th, 8th, \n9th month of gestation. Those abortions are prohibited under law except \nin two specific cases: where continuing the pregnancy threatens the \nlife of the mother or in those cases where continuing the pregnancy \nposes a risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. That is it. \nGrievous physical injury. There are those who disagree with me and say \nit should include emotional injury as well. I have drawn this line at \nphysical injury.\n  Here is why I believe this is a reasonable standard: At this late \nstage in the pregnancy, the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, I believe Roe v. \nWade tells us we have to look at the pregnancy in different terms. We \nare now postviability. We are now in a position where the fetus can \nsurvive. In those circumstances, what I have said is, the only reason \nlegally you could terminate the pregnancy is if continuing it could \nliterally kill the mother or continuing it could subject her to the \npossibility of grievous physical injury, which is defined in the \namendment.\n  I go on. One of the objections customarily made is that if you allow \na doctor to certify that a mother's life is at stake or she runs the \nrisk of grievous physical injury if the pregnancy continues, you are \nplaying right into the hands of the people who perform the abortions.\n  I have heard this argument so many times on the other side of the \naisle. They argue doctors will say anything, the ones who perform these \nprocedures, because they just want to make the money; they don't care.\n  I take an additional step. I require a second doctor to certify. You \nwill have two doctors in those decisions, two doctors who come forward \nand say: If this pregnancy continues, this mother could die, or, if \nthis pregnancy continues, this mother could risk grievous physical \ninjury.\n  What risks do these doctors take if they are falsifying this \ninformation? Substantial fines and the suspension of their licenses to \npractice medicine are included in this amendment. It is very serious.\n  When we get to this stage in the pregnancy, I do believe the rules \nshould be a lot stricter. That is why I am offering this as an \nalternative, one which I believe deals with some very fundamental \nquestions.\n  S. 1692 is the bill offered by Senator Santorum. We have to ask \nourselves several questions:\n  Should just one or all postviability abortion procedures be banned? \nSenator Santorum addresses one. The amendment I offer addresses all \npostviability abortion procedures.\n  No. 2: Should a mother's health be protected throughout pregnancy? \nUnder the Santorum legislation that is before us, the mother's health \nis not an issue; only if her life is at stake could you engage in \ncertain procedures. In the amendment I offer, it will protect a \nmother's life and a mother's health, the health in terms of the risk of \ngrievous physical injury.\n  No. 3: Should a woman's constitutional right to choose before \nviability be preserved? There are differences of opinion on this. \nPerhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania has a difference of opinion. But \nRoe v. Wade said--and I agree--that previability, a woman, in \nconsultation with her doctor, her husband, her family, and her \nconscience, has the right to make this decision. They protect that \nright in Roe v. Wade.\n  Oh, I know there are those who disagree. I respect that. I have been \nin lots of debates with them. That is where I come down. The reason the \nSantorum language has been rejected in court after court after court as \nunconstitutional is that, I believe, those on his side just do not \naccept the basic premise that, previability, this is a decision, a \nchoice, to be made by a mother and her doctor.\n  As I said, I respect their position, but as long as they fly in the \nface of this basic principle, as long as they defy Roe v. Wade, with \nthe language in the Santorum bill or the language in the State \nlegislation, it will continue to fall time after time after time; we \nwill continue to go through these political exercises; we will debate \nuntil our voices are gone. Then we will have a vote, and then we will \ngo on to the next item of business. And, unfortunately, we will have \nmissed an opportunity to do something that is meaningful. That is why I \noffer this amendment.\n  My amendment--I will go to the second chart--in comparison to the \nSantorum approach, can be spelled out with three specifics.\n  The Santorum approach bans only one procedure and allows others in \nits place. Make no mistake, if the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nsuccessful someday in somehow enacting this legislation, he will not \neven tell you that is going to stop abortion from occurring. He deals \nwith one procedure. My amendment bans all postviability abortions \nregardless of procedure.\n\n  The Santorum bill violates a woman's constitutional right to have her \nhealth protected. We preserve exceptions for life and health of the \nmother--narrowly defined.\n  The Santorum approach violates a woman's constitutional right to \nchoose under Roe v. Wade before viability. My amendment specifically \nprotects a woman's constitutional right to choose before viability.\n  Let me tell you what I am talking about when I talk about grievous \ninjury. Grievous injury in this amendment is narrowly defined. And I \nquote:\n\n       a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically \n     caused or exacerbated by the pregnancy; or\n       an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-\n     threatening condition.\n\n  What could that be? You can all understand the first part: If \ncontinuing the pregnancy could kill the mother is clear. But what would \nthe second one be? What if you diagnosed a mother, during the course of \nher pregnancy, with serious cancer? And what if you found continuing \nthe pregnancy somehow compromised your ability to treat her for that \ncancer? That is what I am driving at here, to make sure it is serious \nand grievous, because we are literally talking about late-term, where I \nthink the rules should be much stricter, as does the Court in Roe v. \nWade.\n  My amendment also requires the attending physician who makes the call \non these decisions to have the benefit as well--and it requires it--of \nan independent physician to certify, in writing, that in their medical \njudgment the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's \nlife or risk grievous injury to her physical health.\n  I make an exception. I want to make it clear for the record. The \ncertification requirement by the doctors can be waived in a medical \nemergency. But the physician would have to subsequently certify, in \nwriting, what specific medical condition formed the\n\n[[Page S12873]]\n\nbasis for determining that a medical emergency existed.\n  This legislation will reduce the number of late-term abortions. In \ncontrast, the so-called partial-birth abortion ban will not stop a \nsingle abortion at any stage of gestation. The partial-birth abortion \nban, by prohibiting only one particular procedure, will merely induce \nphysicians to switch to a different procedure that is not banned by \nSenator Santorum.\n  Other procedures, such as induction, hysterotomy, or dilation and \nevacuation, can all pose a greater risk to the mother's health in \ncertain cases. My alternative amendment will stop abortions by any \nmethod after a fetus is viable, except when medical necessity indicates \notherwise.\n  Can we or should we try to define ``viability'' in this? I did not. \nAnd the courts have warned us: Don't even try. That is a medical \njudgment and, as I mentioned earlier, is a moving target. Viability \ntoday, in other words, fetal survivability today, is different from \nwhat it will be tomorrow or next month because these procedures are \nchanging so dramatically in terms of saving the fetus and giving it an \nopportunity for life.\n  My alternative fits clearly within the constitutional parameters set \nforth by the Supreme Court for government restriction of abortion. In \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court reiterated Roe's \ndetermination that, after viability, the State may limit or ban \nabortion.\n\n  In contrast, the partial birth abortion ban, by prohibiting certain \ntypes of abortions before viability, breaches the Court's standard that \nthe Government does not have a compelling interest in restricting \nabortions prior to viability.\n  Nineteen Federal courts in 19 States have enjoined, have stopped, the \nenforcement of the so-called partial-birth abortion bans Senator \nSantorum brings to the floor. The States include: Alaska, Arkansas, \nArizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMichigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, \nWisconsin, and West Virginia.\n  The Santorum bill is clearly unconstitutional. It will be struck down \nby the courts and have no lasting impact.\n  My alternative retains the abortion option for mothers facing \nextraordinary medical conditions, such as breast cancer discovered \nduring the course of pregnancy, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkins \nlymphoma, for which termination of the pregnancy may be recommended by \nthe woman's physician due to the risk of grievous injury to the woman's \nphysical health or life.\n  In contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban provides no such \nexception to protect the mother from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth.\n  To this point, this debate has been fairly general. To this point, \nwith the exception of the Senator from California, in noting a few \nmothers who have been through experiences which they have shared \npublicly, we have talked in generalities.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has brought up a chart that is not a \nhuman depiction; it is an effort to put forth some drawing that depicts \nthis procedure.\n  We have talked about the Constitution. But I will tell you this. My \nambivalence over this issue--I was ambivalent when I first heard of \nthis procedure--was put to rest because I sat down with real people, \nwith mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, who faced medical \nemergencies. And when each of them told me their stories, I thought to \nmyself: How can I possibly vote for the Santorum bill which would have \nendangered the life of the woman I am talking to? That is why I opposed \nhis legislation in the past and will continue to do so. For the record, \nI will at this point tell two or three stories that have been a matter \nof public record and testimony before Congress and that I think \ndemonstrate when you get beyond the theory of this debate and to the \nreality of it, life gets complicated, very complicated. It is easy to \nstep back and make a moral decision involving other people, if you are \nnot in their shoes. Listen to some of these and you will see what I \nmean.\n\n  This is the story of Coreen Costello from Agoura, CA. Coreen, her \nhusband Jim and their son Chad and daughter Carlyn live in Agoura, CA. \nCoreen is a full-time stay-at-home wife and mom. She describes herself \nas a registered Republican and very conservative. She does not believe \nin abortion. In fact, she never thought she would be testifying before \nCongress supporting an abortion procedure, which is exactly what she \ndid, on March 21, 1996, before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution.\n  In March 1995, the Costellos were joyfully expecting their third \nchild. However, when she was 7 months pregnant, Coreen began having \npremature contractions and had to be rushed to the hospital. After \nreviewing the results of the ultrasound, Coreen's doctor informed her \nhe did not expect the baby to live. Coreen's child, a girl she had \nnamed ``Katherine Grace,'' was unable to absorb the amniotic fluid. As \na result, the fluid was puddling into Coreen's uterus. Katherine Grace \nhad a lethal neurological disorder and had been unable to move for \nalmost 2 months. Her chest cavity was unable to rise and fall to \nstretch her lungs and prepare them for air. It was as if she had no \nlungs at all. Her vital organs were atrophying. Katherine Grace was \ngoing to die.\n  A perinatologist recommended terminating the pregnancy. All the \ndoctors agreed. The Costellos' safest option was an intact D, the \nvery procedure banned by this bill by the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nFor Coreen and her husband, this was not an option. They chose to wait \nto go into labor naturally, which wouldn't be long. Due to the excess \namniotic fluid, a condition called polyhdramnios, premature labor, was \nimminent. Despite the difficulty of knowing her baby was going to die, \nCoreen continued with the pregnancy. Over the course of the next few \nweeks, she saw many experts. If possible, the results were even grimmer \nthan those she had earlier.\n  Her baby's body was rigid and wedged in a transverse position in her \nwomb. Most babies are in a fetal position. Katherine Grace's position \nwas exactly the opposite. It was as if she were doing a swan dive. The \nsoles of her feet were touching the back of her head. Her body was in a \nU-shape. Due to swelling, her head was already larger than that of a \nfull-term baby. Coreen, her mother, did daily exercises trying to \nchange Katherine Grace's position so she could be delivered naturally.\n  Meanwhile, the amniotic fluid continued to puddle in Coreen's uterus. \nIn the ensuing weeks, the condition had grown worse. Everyone started \nto fear for the mother's health. The mother could no longer sit or lie \ndown for more than 10 minutes because the pressure on her lungs was so \ngreat. During one of her last ultrasounds, Coreen's doctor told her she \ncould not deliver the baby via caesarean under the circumstances \nbecause the risk was too great. The doctor told Coreen there was a \nsafer way for her to deliver. It was at this point Coreen realized this \nwas not a choice anymore, that it was not up to her or her husband. \nThere was no reason to risk leaving her children, Chad and Carlyn, \nmotherless, if there was no hope of saving their new baby.\n\n  The Costellos drove to Los Angeles for a D They expected a cold \ngray building. They found a doctor and a staff willing to help them. It \nwas at this point Coreen realized she had done the right thing. This \nwas the safest thing for her. The fact this option was open to Coreen \nis important in this story. This option would be closed to her by the \nSantorum bill.\n  After the procedure, she went on to say Katherine Grace was \nbeautiful. She was not missing part of her brain. She had not been \nstabbed in the head with scissors. She looked peaceful and she did not \nsuffer. Because of the safety of this procedure, Coreen became pregnant \nagain with another baby, after losing Katherine Grace. Thanks to the \nskill and compassion of the doctors and the procedure she was forced to \nuse under these extraordinary circumstances, Coreen was able to have a \nhealthy baby.\n  If you outlaw the surgical procedure, which the Santorum bill seeks \nto do, women such as Coreen will be denied the safest and best medical \nprocedure they need under these emergency circumstances and their \nability to have more children and the happiness in life which children \nbring us will be compromised severely.\n  The next story is about a lady who I met several times. I like her a \nlot. Her\n\n[[Page S12874]]\n\nname is Vikki Stella. She is from my home State of Illinois, and she \ncame to Washington, DC, to tell her story. Vikki, her husband Archer \nand their two daughters, Lindsay, age 11, and Natalie, age 7, live in \nNaperville, the western suburbs of Illinois right outside Chicago.\n  In 1993, Vikki discovered she was pregnant with a much-wanted son. \nBecause she is diabetic, she had more prenatal tests than most pregnant \nwomen--amnios, ultrasounds, the works.\n  After the first round of tests, her doctor brought her in and said: \nYour pregnancy is disgustingly normal. Then at 32 weeks, she went in \nfor another ultrasound, and everything fell apart--32 weeks into the \npregnancy. Vikki's son was diagnosed, the one she was carrying, with \nnine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain \ntissue at all. Vikki's much-wanted son would never survive outside her \nwomb. The only thing keeping him alive was his mother's body.\n  The Stellas found the only answer they could: a surgical abortion \nprocedure performed by a physician in Los Angeles. Because Vikki was \ndiabetic, the controlled gentle nature of this surgery was much safer \nthan induced labor or a C section. Vikki's son died peacefully and \npainlessly from the combination of steps taken in preparation for the \nsurgery. He was brought out intact and the family was able to hold him \nand say their goodbyes.\n  That is a sad story about a couple that dearly wanted a baby and then \nfound late in the pregnancy this terrible news that the baby would not \nsurvive and continuing the pregnancy could threaten the life of the \nmother. The procedure Vikki Stella used is the procedure banned by the \nSantorum bill, a procedure which her doctor thought was best for her.\n  There is an end to this story which is much happier. The ending to \nthe story is that in 1995, Vikki gave birth to a little boy. They \nfinally got their son. She came up to Capitol Hill with the little \nfellow in a stroller and a big smile on everyone's face.\n  It is hard for me, when I hear the intense rhetoric of this debate, \nto believe we are talking about the same thing. Some people refer to \nthis as ``cruel'' and ``execution-like.'' This family didn't ask for \nthis medical emergency. They wanted to have their little boy and be \nhappy, as all of us. They found late in the pregnancy something \nterrible happened. When they went to the doctor, the doctor said, this \nis what you have to do, and they did it. As painful as it was, they did \nit. This bill says, no, this will not be a decision of the Stella \nfamily, the mother and father in a room with the doctor. This will be a \ndecision of the Stella family in a room with the doctor and the Federal \nGovernment. If that doctor decides this procedure is the safest to save \nthis mother's life or to give her a chance to have another baby, the \nSantorum law will say, no, the Government will make the decision--not a \ndecision by a mother and father and a physician, a decision which has \nto be so painful and emotional.\n  The last story is about a lady who testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in 1995 named Viki Wilson. She is a registered \nnurse, 18 years of experience, 10 in pediatrics. Her husband Bill is an \nemergency room physician--a nurse and a doctor.\n\n       We have three beautiful children: Jon is 10, Katie is 8, \n     and Abigail is in heaven with God.\n       In the spring of 1994, I was pregnant and expecting my \n     third child on Mother's Day. The nursery was ready and we \n     were very excited anticipating the arrival of our baby. Bill \n     had delivered our other two children, and he was going to \n     deliver Abigail. Jon was going to cut the cord and Katie was \n     going to be the first to hold her. She had already become a \n     very important part of our family.\n       At 36 weeks of pregnancy all of our dreams of happy \n     expectations came crashing down around us. My doctor ordered \n     an ultrasound that detected what all my previous prenatal \n     testing, including a chorionic villus sampling, an alpha \n     fetoprotein and an earlier ultrasound had failed to \n     detect, an encephalocele. Approximately two-thirds of my \n     daughter's brain had formed on the outside of her skull.\n\n  Viki Wilson said:\n\n       I literally fell to my knees from the shock.\n\n  This is a woman who was a nurse. When she heard this news, she \nliterally fell to her knees from the shock.\n\n       I immediately knew that [my baby] would not be able to \n     survive outside my womb. My doctor sent me to a \n     perinatologist, a pediatric radiologist, and geneticist, all \n     desperately trying to find a way to save [the baby girl].\n\n  Her husband is a doctor.\n\n       My husband and I were praying that there would be some new \n     surgical technique to fix her brain. But all the experts \n     concurred. Abigail would not survive outside my womb. And she \n     could not survive the birthing process, because of the size \n     of her anomaly, her head would be crushed and she would \n     suffocate. Because of the size of her anomaly, the doctors \n     also feared that my uterus would rupture in the birthing \n     process, most likely rendering me sterile. It was also \n     discovered that what I thought were big, healthy, strong baby \n     movements were, in fact, seizures. They were being caused by \n     compression of the encephalocele that continued to increase \n     as she continued to grow inside my womb.\n\n  Viki Wilson asked:\n\n       ``What about a C-section?'' Sadly, my doctor told me, \n     ``Viki, we do C-sections to save babies. We can't save \n     [Abigail]. A C-section is dangerous for you and I can't \n     justify those risks.''\n       The biggest question for me and my husband was not ``is \n     [Abigail] going to die?'' A higher power had already decided \n     that for us. The question now was: [Am I going to die? Is the \n     mother going to die with the child?] ``How is she going to \n     die?'' We wanted to help her leave this world as painlessly \n     and peacefully as possible, and in a way to protect my life \n     and health and allow us to try again to have more children.\n\n  They used the procedure that would be banned by the Santorum \nlegislation, which is before us today.\n  Mr. President, I give these three examples because I think it is \nimportant for all of us, despite our values and principles and the \nthings we hold dear, to listen to people who struggle with these \ntragedies. I didn't think in any of those cases, the 5 or 6 women I \nhave met who ever used this procedure to save their lives or protect \ntheir health, that I ever detected selfishness or greed. In every \nsingle case, these were mothers and fathers who wanted their babies. \nThey had painted nurseries, and they had given them names. They were \nprepared for this joyful home coming that never happened.\n  This was not some casual decision. This was a decision that would \nhaunt them for a lifetime. Why had they been singled out to lose that \nbaby? Why did they have to go through the emotion and the trauma of all \nthe decisions that came with that? I can't answer that. All I can do is \nsympathize with them for what they had to live through and to say to \nmyself as a Senator, do you really want to say that you know better in \nterms of that mother's life and health? That is what the Santorum \nlegislation says. It says we know better; we want to be the doctors \nhere; we want to decide which abortion procedure you can use and which \nyou can't use.\n  As I said at the outset, I am not a doctor, and I am not going to \nplay one in the Senate. The doctors that I have relied on and the \npatients I have spoken to have led me to conclude that the Santorum \napproach is the wrong approach. I know that it will be an issue in \nevery campaign forever. I have already faced that. I am sure I will \nface it again. But I am confident in my position that I can go back not \nonly to my home State but even to my family where this is debated and \nexplain to them why I have done what I am doing today.\n\n  This amendment I am offering is a sensible approach. It is one \nconsistent with Roe v. Wade. It deals with late-term abortion, and it \nis one that is sensitive to a mother's health. It is one that attempts \nto protect that mother when she runs the risk of grievous physical \ninjury.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2319\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute.)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Ban on certain abortions.................................1531.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator, \nand I appreciate his good faith in offering this amendment. I am not \ngoing to discuss that amendment specifically right now, although I \ncertainly will.\n  I have a couple of comments. First off, it has to be noted here that \npartial-birth abortions are performed--this is according to the people \nwho perform them--well over 90 percent of the partial-birth abortions \nthat are performed--and some have suggested much higher than 90 \npercent--on healthy babies and healthy mothers. Healthy babies, healthy \nmothers. A very small percentage are the cases that you have heard \nbrought up here today.\n  The question is then posed: Well, who are we to make the decision \nabout these tough cases? I think even the Senator from Illinois would \nsay, if it is a healthy mother and baby and this procedure isn't \nnecessary, I have some problems. I think a lot of Members who have \nvoted against this bill have said, if it is that case--but there are \nthese cases. I am happy to address those cases, but let me do it in a \nbroader context.\n  The reason we inject ourselves is the same reason the Supreme Court \nhas injected itself into the debate on second-\n\n[[Page S12876]]\n\nand third-trimester abortions. It is because we are not talking about \nremoving a tumor. It is not where we are going to say you should not \nremove this cancerous tumor this way or that way or that appendix that \nway. What we are talking about here is killing a baby--from my \nperspective, particularly killing a baby in such a barbaric fashion--\nwhich is almost born and is almost protected by the Constitution. So I \nunderstand the concern that we should not be practicing medicine. No \none is practicing medicine here. What we are doing here is drawing a \nvery important line about what we will allow in our society when it \ncomes to killing a living human being. I don't think anybody is going \nto question that the baby is living and it is a human being. So what we \nare talking about here is how can you kill a living human being?\n  What we are saying is you should not be able to kill a living human \nbeing that is almost born, especially in a brutal fashion. The reason \nis because of how horrendous this is. It creates some real slippery \nslopes when the Senator from California gets up and says, ``I want \nevery child to be wanted.'' So now if you are not wanted, you are not \nprotected by the Constitution and that is the way it works? If you are \nnot wanted as a child, you don't get protection. What if you're not \nwanted as a Senator. Do you not get protection? I don't think we want \nto go down that road.\n  I am concerned, particularly as we talk about this procedure, where \nthe baby is three inches away from protection from the Constitution, \nand when you get into this area and say, people have to have all the \nrights to do whatever they want. That is not what the Constitution \nsays. That is not what we have said here. We have drawn a line because \nwe think it is important for society to draw lines about what is, in \nfact, legal and what is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to explore this, because I really want to \nunderstand what we are driving at here. I gave an example of a baby \ninside a mother's womb with its brain outside of its skull. This brain \nwas growing in size. It was very clear that the baby was alive through \nthe mother that continued to detect a fetal heart beat, and there is an \nobvious question as to whether this baby could ever survive. At the \nmoment, they had to make a decision. They knew if they went through \ncertain procedures, the mother could have her uterus rupture because of \nthe size of this abnormal growth of the baby, and they decided to use \nthe procedure that the Senator would ban.\n  Now, conceding everything you have said, does the Senator from \nPennsylvania not acknowledge the fact that the baby's life was \nsomething that, frankly, was not going to last but a few seconds? As \nsoon as that baby was disconnected from the mother's umbilical cord, \nthe placenta, that baby was not going to survive at that point. The \ndoctor had to say: This baby is not going to live and if I don't use \nthe procedure that you are going to ban here, I can do damage to this \nwoman where she would never have another baby. That is the kind of \ncase. I understand the Senator says it is a living thing, but it is \nliving because of the mother's body and it cannot live on its own.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand that very well. I just say this. What we \nhave been told by the overwhelming amount of medical evidence--and, \nagain, it gets back to the discussion we had earlier about whether this \nprocedure is the only appropriate procedure--what we have been told \nover and over again is that this is never medically necessary. In this \ncircumstance, this is not the only procedure that could be used, No. 1.\n\n  Again, we have overwhelming medical evidence saying that this is, in \nfact, not the safest--in fact, is the most dangerous. Even the person \nwho wrote the textbook on second- and third-trimester abortions, a guy \nby the name of Warren Hern, who talks about this procedure--he does \nmore second- and third-trimester abortions than any other abortionist \nin the country--says, ``I have serious reservations about this \nprocedure. You really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement \nthat says this is the safest procedure to use.''\n  This is an abortionist from Colorado who does more third-trimester \nabortions than anybody in the country.\n  My point is not that we should say you can't have an abortion if that \nis what the person wants at that point. But there are other options \nother than an intact D There are other abortion options, as the \nSenator explored in his statement. There is the caesarean section, \ndepending on what the problem is. You have the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute which looked at statistics on abortion. They say that \nabortion is twice as risky to the life of the mother as is delivery in \nthe second- and third-trimester.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield so I understand the Senator's \npoint of view?\n  I don't want to put words in his mouth. But what I hear him say is \nyou can find some other abortion procedure in that instance other than \nthe one you are banning. That is fine. The Senator may not personally \nlike abortion at all. But from his point of view, he is saying just as \nlong as you use a different kind of procedure, this bill is OK.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This bill is going after one procedure.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are very clear. I don't think this is a problem \nunder Roe v. Wade. I think we are very clear, and are, frankly, working \non making it clearer in the definition dealing with the issue of \nvagueness because that has been raised, as the Senator mentioned, in \nthe court cases across the country. Even though one case held it to be \nconstitutional, we are looking into ways in which we can tighten that \ndefinition.\n  To make sure, what we are saying is, look, if an abortion is what the \nmother chooses, or a family chooses, it is legal under certain \ncircumstances in the second- and third-trimester, in almost all \ncircumstances. But we are saying this procedure, because of the very \ndifficult slippery slope of having an almost born child being killed, \nshould not be allowed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Let me say this: The American Council of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists comes to a different conclusion. They say in some \ncircumstances this is the safest.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But they do not identify any.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Having said that, there are choices where these women use \nthis procedure under extraordinary circumstances. In the cases the \nSenator was talking about, they were literally dealing with the birth \nof a fetus which was not going to survive which was so abnormally sized \nthat it caused a danger and the possibility that the mother would never \nhave another child. Why would we want to preclude any medical procedure \nthat might save that mother's life or give her a chance to have another \nchild, if the Senator from Pennsylvania concedes that he is not arguing \nagainst all abortion procedures?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Because there are safer alternatives available \naccording to all of the medical literature, and we have definitive \nstatements from obstetricians, hundreds of them, as well as people from \nNorthwestern--I will be happy to share the article with the Senator--\nfrom a fairly reputable medical school; I am sure the Senator would say \none of the best medical schools. But we have overwhelming evidence that \nthere are safer procedures to use, that this is a rogue practice. It is \nnot used much. And, again, according to Warren Hern, he can't defend \nthis procedure. It is something that should not be used. It is not \nsafe.\n  I will show you arguments. I don't have it handy, but we will enter \ninto the Record an analysis of the cases that you have made by \nobstetricians who will say under these circumstances there would have \nbeen a safer course, a better course than what was done by the \nphysicians in this case. What we are saying is it is not the best \nmedicine, period. It is not medically necessary, period. And it is a \nbarbaric infringement on the rights of an almost born child.\n  I agree. This is a very narrow bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask this question, if I might. I ask this question \nin good faith because I think we should have this dialogue.\n  Step aside from the argument about whether we should have abortion at \nall, and go to the first two points; that this\n\n[[Page S12877]]\n\nprocedure is never medically necessary and is especially risky.\n  Before I was elected to Congress, I used to practice law as a trial \nlawyer in medical malpractice cases.\n  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, why would any physician subject \nthemselves to a medical malpractice case if the two points that the \nSenator made are so obvious; that is, this procedure is never medically \nnecessary, and it is more dangerous than other procedures for the \nmother? Why in the world would they ever take the risk of a lawsuit by \nusing this procedure unless they believe they could justify that it is \nmedically necessary and that in effect it was the safest procedure for \nthe mother to use?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is not commonly practiced. It is only practiced \nwith a few thousand abortions a year. Given the fact there are 1.4 \nmillion abortions, a few thousand abortions, it is not something that \nis practiced in every abortion clinic. I think a lot of abortion \nclinics will say this is a rogue practice. That is not to say people do \nnot practice medicine that is somewhat strange. There are a lot of \npeople who do things in medicine that are not considered to be \nmedically sound judgments. That doesn't mean that they aren't done. \nThey are, in fact, done. This is a situation where we believe that is \nthe case. This is a rogue procedure. Someone may be sued. I don't know. \nMaybe someone has. I am not aware of someone being sued. But, again, \nthe person most likely to sue would be the child that is dead. I am not \ntoo sure that in the case of the mother that is necessarily a most \ncommon thing you will see. I don't think a lot of abortionists are \nsued, period.\n  I would like to address a couple of issues that the Senator from \nCalifornia brought up, and then the Senator from Illinois.\n  First, to state very clearly what the Senator from California said, \ntalking about the murder of abortionists and snipers firing at people, \nI am against murder. I think everybody who supports this legislation--\nand, frankly, everybody in this Chamber agrees--believes that acts of \nviolence against anybody on the issue of abortion is counterproductive \nto an effort that seeks to affirm life. Certainly, taking the law into \ntheir own hands is an outrage, is offensive to me, is wrong, and should \nbe prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. There is no room in a \nmovement that talks about nonviolence--and violence toward babies in \nutero--for condoning actions of violence of any sort, whether it is \nmurder or attempted murder or destruction of property, et cetera. I \ndon't stand here condoning that, and I would join with the Senator from \nCalifornia to condemn it and condemn it in the strongest words \npossible. That is no service to those who are trying to get the \ncountry's ear in defense of innocent human life.\n  I want to correct what the Senator from California said also about no \ncourt has found our language in this bill constitutional. That is not \ntrue. The court in Wisconsin has found this language to be \nconstitutional. It is now being appealed to the Seventh Circuit. The \nlaw is enjoined upon appeal. But, again, we have a district court that \nhas found this to be constitutional.\n  I would like to go through again, quoting from the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, an article printed in 1998, a year ago in \nAugust, by two obstetricians from Northwestern University, and go \nthrough again why this procedure--it keeps coming back to two issues, \nas the Senator from Illinois talked about.\n  One, the term is too vague. The definition is too vague.\n  I will be addressing that. Hopefully, in the next couple of days we \nwill work on that, although I think, frankly, the definition is \nperfectly clear. We are willing to work and to see whether we can make \nit a little bit more definitive.\n  Second, that this may be necessary to protect the health of the \nmother, again, that is the discussion in which the Senator from \nIllinois and I were just engaged.\n  I want to restate again how overwhelming the evidence is of people \nwho can definitively state without question that over 400 obstetricians \naround the country say it is never medically necessary.\n  C. Everett Koop--as the Senator from Illinois said, is never \nmedically necessary. It is a pretty strong term to say it is never \nmedically necessary.\n\n  What do we have on the other side? We have some anecdotes about cases \nwhere it was used, but in no case do they state that was the only \noption or that was the best option.\n  On our side we have the abortionist, Dr. Haskell from Ohio, who \nprobably does more of these abortions than any other person. He says it \nis never--underline never--medically necessary to protect the life of \nthe mother and not medically necessary to protect the health of the \nmother. The abortionist himself says that.\n  On the other side, we have the statement from the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists. That is the argument on the other \nside. This whole debate on health is centered around an organization \nthat is very pro-abortion that says they put together a select panel \nthat:\n\n       . . . could identify no circumstances under which this \n     procedure would be the only option to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  This is an organization that opposes this bill. This is an \norganization they rely upon to hold on to the ``health exception.'' \nThat is the cover behind not voting for this bill.\n  There are two arguments: Health of the mother--we need that, \notherwise we can't vote for this if we don't have that--and it is too \nvague, the definition is too vague.\n  The organization they rely upon says they can:\n\n       . . . identify no circumstances under which this procedure \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman and that an intact D, however--\n\n  This is what they hold on to--\n\n     . . . may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a \n     particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman, and only the doctor, in consultation \n     with the patient, based upon the woman's particular \n     circumstances, can make this decision.\n\n  That is their rationale. It ``may be,'' and we should ``leave it to \nthe doctor and the patient.'' ``May be.'' OK, fine. It may be.\n  We have asked this organization to provide one circumstance--just \none. By the way, we have asked them now for 3 years to give one \ncircumstance where we can have peer review by obstetricians, have them \nlook at their circumstance where this ``may be'' the best option. Give \na hypothetical; give an example we can actually examine.\n  What is the answer from that organization? Nothing.\n  They say it ``may be.'' We can't say how, we can't give any evidence \nof it, but ``it may be.'' Because it may be--which is not \nsubstantiated--that is the health exception they need.\n  It is pretty lame. If they cannot come forward and give facts, we \nneed a health exception because it ``may be,'' but if we cannot give \ncircumstances where that is the case, where is the health exception?\n  They admit it is not the only way. The AMA has said it is not good \nmedicine; it is a rogue procedure, and the AMA is a pro-choice \norganization. That is what their board votes.\n  Again, it is hard for me to argue against ``May be's,'' without \nspecifics. That is what we have. Members are hiding behind ``we need a \nhealth exception because it may be.'' This is a debate about facts. We \nhave hundreds and hundreds of physicians who say it may be never the \nbest option; it will never be the best option; there are always better \nalternatives.\n  From the point of view of someone who is on the Senate floor and \nwhose job it is to look at all the information, to be able to make a \njudgment, don't hide behind a health exception that doesn't exist and \nis not substantiated. Just because it is substantiated by anecdotes of \npeople who used them because it happened to save them, that doesn't \nmean there weren't better options at the same time. Just because this \nworked to save the health of the mother doesn't mean there weren't \nbetter options.\n  Mr. President, 400 years ago we used to bleed people, and it probably \nhelped some people, but that doesn't mean there weren't better options. \nWe are saying, what is the best option? Why do we want the best option? \nThis is not removing a tumor. This is killing a baby that is outside \nthe mother. That is why we don't like this procedure.\n  This is not practicing medicine and telling doctors how to do their \nbusiness. If this were about an ingrown toenail, we wouldn't care. This \nis about\n\n[[Page S12878]]\n\nkilling a living human being--about killing a living human being. I \ndon't think anybody on the floor will argue with that. We are talking \nabout killing a living human being. That is this far away from the \nConstitution saying ``no.'' This far.\n  I will read from this article the rationale given by these physicians \nas to why they believe this is not the best procedure for mothers from \na health perspective.\n\n       There exist no credible studies on intact D\n\n  This is a rogue procedure--\n\n       . . . that evaluate or attest to its safety. The procedure \n     is not recognized in medical textbooks nor is it taught in \n     medical schools or in obstetrics and gynecology \n     residencies. Intact D poses serious medical risks to the \n     mother. Patients who undergo an intact D\n\n  Intact D is a partial-birth abortion as defined in the bill--\n\n     are at risk for the potential complications with any surgical \n     midtrimester termination, including hemorrhage, infection, \n     and uterine perforation. However, intact D places these \n     patients at increased risk of two additional complications.\n\n  So a traditional late-term abortion has certain risks associated with \nit, according to these doctors from Northwestern University. But this \nprocedure has two other complications in addition to the ones already \ninherent in a late-term abortion:\n\n       First, the risk of uterine rupture may be increased. An \n     integral part of the D procedure is an internal podalic \n     version, during which the physician instrumentally reaches \n     into the uterus, grasps the fetus' feet, and pulls the feet \n     down into the cervix, thus converting the lie to a footling \n     breach. The internal version carries risk of uterine rupture, \n     abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus.\n       The second potential complication of intact D is the risk \n     of iatrogenic laceration and secondary hemorrhage. Following \n     internal version and partial breech extraction, scissors are \n     forced into the base of the fetal skull while it is lodged in \n     the birth canal. This blind procedure risks maternal injury \n     from laceration of the uterus or cervix by the scissors and \n     could result in severe bleeding and the threat of shock or \n     even maternal death.\n       These risks have not been adequately quantified.\n       None of these risks are medically necessary because other \n     procedures are available to physicians who deem it necessary \n     to perform an abortion late in pregnancy. As ACOG policy \n     clearly states, intact D is never the only procedure \n     available. Some clinicians have considered intact D \n     necessary when hydrocephalus is present.\n\n  Water on the brain.\n\n       However, a hydrocephalic fetus could be aborted by first \n     draining the excess fluid from the fetal skull through \n     ultrasound-guided. . .[procedures.] Some physicians who \n     perform abortions have been concerned that a ban on late term \n     abortions would affect their ability to provide other \n     abortion services. Because of the proposed changes in federal \n     legislation, it is clear that only intact D would be \n     banned.\n\n  I can and I will, throughout the course of the next couple of days, \nprovide letter after letter signed by hundreds and hundreds of \nobstetricians, the best in their field, perinatologists, people who \ndeal with maternal and fetal medicine, who say this procedure is \ndangerous, more dangerous to a woman. So the issue of health is a bogus \none. It is a bogus issue.\n  Again I go back to Warren Hern, the author of ``Abortion Practice,'' \nthe author who does more third-trimester abortions, I am told, than \nanybody else in America. He says:\n\n       I have very serious reservations about this procedure. You \n     really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement that \n     this is the safest procedure to use.\n\n  This is not a fan of this bill. So, again, all these comments and \nconcerns about ``we have to protect health, we have to protect \nhealth''--if we outlawed this procedure, we would be protecting health. \nWe would be protecting the health of women where doctors who do it do \nit for the convenience of the abortionist.\n  Do you want to know why it is done? It is done for the convenience of \nthe abortionist, because they can do more in 1 day. That is why this \nprocedure was developed. That is what they will tell you. That is, the \ndoctor who invented this procedure, he will tell you that is why he did \nit.\n  On the other issue--and we will get to this a little later in the \ndebate--the issue of vagueness, the Senator from California said every \ncourt in the country that has ruled on this has ruled it is vague or \nruled it is unconstitutional.\n  First off, that is not true. Wisconsin ruled in fact it is \nconstitutional. But I am willing to work with those who have genuine \nconcerns about the issue of vagueness, to get a definition that makes \npeople perfectly comfortable that we are not talking about any other \nform of abortion because it is not my intent, as has been ascribed to \nme, that what I am trying to do is eliminate all second- and third-\ntrimester abortions.\n  What is clear about this debate and the debate that has been going on \nnow for three Congresses is that we are not trying to do that. I think \nwe have stood on the floor and said that is not our intent. Our intent \nis to get rid of a dangerous procedure. Yes, it is painful to the baby. \nYes, it is dangerous to the mother. But it is also dangerous to our \nsociety, to be able to kill a baby that is this close to being born. I \nthink it is something we have to stand up and draw the line on clearly, \nand that is what we are asking to do.\n  So to me it is pretty simple. We have no evidence this jeopardizes \nthe health of the mother--none. We have speculation, no facts. We have \nthe vagueness concern. Again, I am willing to work on that issue. If \nthat is a genuine concern that people have, I am willing to work on it \nto make sure we can make people comfortable that what we are talking \nabout is only this procedure.\n\n  But once you get past those two concerns, I do not know what is left. \nI do not know why you defend this. I do not know why you defend killing \na baby this far away from being born who would otherwise be born alive. \nI do not know how you defend it.\n  So I look forward to this debate over the next couple of days. I know \nthe Senator from California feels very passionately about this, but I \nthink the issue of where we draw the line constitutionally is very \nimportant. I am sure the Senator from California agrees with me. I \nthink the Senator from California would say that she and I, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, the Senators from Arkansas and Kansas, we are all \nprotected by the Constitution with the right to life.\n  Would you agree with that, Senator from California? Do you answer \nthat question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I support the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Do you agree any child who is born has the right to \nlife, is protected by the Constitution once that child is born?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I agree with the Roe v. Wade decision, and what you are \ndoing goes against it and will harm the women of this country. And I \nwill address that when I get the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But I would like to ask you this question. You agree, \nonce the child is born, separated from the mother, that that child is \nprotected by the Constitution and cannot be killed? Do you agree with \nthat?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would make this statement. That this Constitution as it \ncurrently is--some want to amend it to say life begins at conception. I \nthink when you bring your baby home, when your baby is born--and there \nis no such thing as partial-birth--the baby belongs to your family and \nhas the rights. But I am not willing to amend the Constitution to say \nthat a fetus is a person, which I know you would. But we will get to \nthat later. I know my colleague is engaging me in a colloquy on his \ntime. I appreciate it. I will answer these questions.\n  I think what my friend is doing, by asking me these questions, is off \npoint. My friend wants to tell the doctors in this country what to do. \nMy friend from Pennsylvania says they are rogue doctors. The AMA will \ntell you they no longer support the bill. The American Nurses don't \nsupport the bill. The obstetricians and gynecologists don't support the \nbill. So my friend can ask me my philosophy all day; on my own time I \nwill talk about it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may reclaim my time, first of all, the AMA still \nbelieves this is bad medicine. They do not support the criminal \npenalties provisions in this bill, but they still believe--I think you \nknow that to be the case--this procedure is not medically necessary, \nand they stand by that statement.\n  I ask the Senator from California, again, you believe--you said \n``once the baby comes home.'' Obviously, you don't mean they have to \ntake the baby out of the hospital for it to be protected by the \nConstitution. Once the\n\n[[Page S12879]]\n\nbaby is separated from the mother, you would agree--completely \nseparated from the mother--you would agree that baby is entitled to \nconstitutional protection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will tell you why I don't want to engage in this. You \nhad the same conversation with a colleague of mine, and I never saw \nsuch a twisting of his remarks.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me be clear, then. Let's try to be clear.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to be clear when I get the floor. What you are \ntrying to do is take away the rights of women and their families and \ntheir doctors to have a procedure. And now you are trying to turn the \nquestion into, When does life begin? I will talk about that on my own \ntime.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may reclaim the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What I am trying to do is get an answer from the \nSenator from California as to where you would draw the line because \nthat really is the important part of this debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will repeat. I will repeat, the Senator has asked me a \nquestion----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am answering the question I have been posed by the \nSenator, and the answer to the question is, I stand by Roe v. Wade. I \nstand by it. I hope we have a chance to vote on it. It is very clear, \nRoe v. Wade. That is what I stand by; my friend doesn't.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are you suggesting Roe v. Wade covered the issue of a \nbaby in the process of being born?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am saying what Roe v. Wade says is, in the early stages \nof a pregnancy, a woman has the right to choose; in the later stages, \nthe States have the right--yes--to come in and restrict. I support \nthose restrictions, as long as two things happen: They respect the life \nof the mother and the health of the mother.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is where I stand. No matter how you try to twist it, \nthat is where I stand.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I say to the Senator from California, I am not twisting \nanything. I am simply asking a very straightforward question. There is \nno hidden question here. The question is----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will answer it again.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Once the baby is born, is completely separated from the \nmother, you will support that that baby has, in fact, the right to life \nand cannot be killed? You accept that; right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't believe in killing any human being. That is \nabsolutely correct. Nor do you, I am sure.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So you would accept the fact that once the baby is \nseparated from the mother, that baby cannot be killed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I support the right--and I will repeat this, again, \nbecause I saw you ask the same question to another Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All the Senator has to do is give me a straight answer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Define ``separation.'' You answer that question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let's define that. Let's say the baby is completely \nseparated; in other words, no part of the baby is inside the mother.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You mean the baby has been birthed and is now in the \nmother's arms? It is a human being? It takes a second, it takes a \nminute----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Say it is in the obstetrician's hands.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I had two babies, and within seconds of them being born--\n--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We had six.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You didn't have any.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My wife and I did. We do things together in my family.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Your wife gave birth. I gave birth. I can tell you, I \nknow when the baby was born.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Good. All I am asking you is, once the baby leaves the \nmother's birth canal and is through the vaginal orifice and is in the \nhands of the obstetrician, you would agree you cannot then abort the \nbaby?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say when the baby is born, the baby is born and \nwould then have every right of every other human being living in this \ncountry, and I don't know why this would even be a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Because we are talking about a situation here where the \nbaby is almost born. So I ask the question of the Senator from \nCalifornia, if the baby was born except for the baby's foot, if the \nbaby's foot was inside the mother but the rest of the baby was outside, \ncould that baby be killed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The baby is born when the baby is born.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the answer to the question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am asking for you to define for me what that is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I can't believe the Senator from Pennsylvania has a \nquestion with it. I have never been troubled by this question. You give \nbirth to a baby. The baby is there, and it is born, and that is my \nanswer to the question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What we are talking about here with partial birth, as \nthe Senator from California knows, is the baby is in the process of \nbeing born----\n  Mrs. BOXER. In the process of being born. This is why this \nconversation makes no sense, because to me it is obvious when a baby is \nborn; to you it isn't obvious.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Maybe you can make it obvious to me. What you are \nsuggesting is if the baby's foot is still inside of the mother, that \nbaby can then still be killed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not suggesting that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am asking.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am absolutely not suggesting that. You asked me a \nquestion, in essence, when the baby is born.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am asking you again. Can you answer that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will answer the question when the baby is born. The \nbaby is born when the baby is outside the mother's body. The baby is \nborn.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not going to put words in your mouth----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But, again, what you are suggesting is if the baby's \ntoe is inside the mother, you can, in fact, kill that baby.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. OK. So if the baby's toe is in, you can't kill the \nbaby. How about if the baby's foot is in?\n  Mrs. BOXER. You are the one who is making these statements.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We are trying to draw a line here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not answering these questions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the head is inside the mother, you can kill the \nbaby.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is losing his temper. Let me say to my friend \nonce again--and he is laughing----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am not laughing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say, this woman is not laughing right now because \nif this bill was the law of the land, she might either be dead or \ninfertile. So if the Senator wants to laugh about this, he can laugh \nall he wants.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President. All I suggest is I \nwas not laughing about the discussions. It is a very serious \ndiscussion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, you were.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was smiling at your characterization of my demeanor. \nI have not lost my temper. I think I am, frankly, very composed at this \npoint. What I will say--and the Senator is walking away--is the Senator \nsaid, again, the baby is born when the baby is born. I said: If the \nfoot is still inside the mother? She said: Well, no, you can't kill the \nbaby. If the foot is inside, you can't, but if the head is the only \nthing inside, you can.\n  Here is the line. See this is where it gets a little funny.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Let the Record show \nthat I did not say what the Senator from Pennsylvania said that I did. \nThank you.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I hate to do this, but could we have the \nclerk read back what the Senator from California said with respect to \nthat question?\n  I understand it will take some time for us to do that. I will be \nhappy--\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I know what I said. I am saying your \ncharacterization of what I said is incorrect. I didn't talk about the \nhead or the foot. That was what my colleague talked about. And I don't \nappreciate it being misquoted on the floor over a subject that involves \nthe health and\n\n[[Page S12880]]\n\nlife of the women of this country and the children of this country and \nthe families of this country.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It also involves--and that is the point I think the \nSenator from California is missing--it also involves when in the \nprocess--that is why people on both sides of the abortion issue support \nthis bill, because it also involves what is infanticide and what is \nnot. A lot of people who agree with you on the issue of abortion say \nthis is too close to infanticide. This is a baby who is outside the \nmother.\n  Again, I will not put words in the Senator's mouth, but what I \nheard--and again I am willing to have that corrected by the Record and \nthe Senator can correct me right now--what I heard her say is if the \nfoot is inside the mother, no, you cannot kill the baby, but when the \nhead is, you can. That is a pretty slippery slope.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, what I said was I wasn't answering \nthose questions. What the Senator was trying to do was to bait me on \nhis terms of how he sees this issue.\n  We have a situation where this procedure is outlawed. It will hurt \nthe women and the families of this country. My friend can disagree with \nthat, but I never got into the issue of when is someone born. I said to \nyou I am very clear on that, and I understand that completely, but it \nwas my friend who kept on asking these questions, which to me do not \nmake any sense because the issue here is an emergency procedure that my \nfriend from Pennsylvania wants to make illegal, and it will hurt the \nwomen and it will hurt the families of this country.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, first off, the Senator from \nCalifornia said this was an emergency procedure. Name me an emergency \nprocedure that takes 3 days. That is what the procedure takes. That is \none of the things that was put forward early in the debate, now risen \nagain, that this is somehow an emergency procedure. It is not an \nemergency procedure. It is a 3-day procedure.\n  No emergency do you present yourself in an emergency condition and \nget sent home with pills for 3 days to present yourself back.\n  Again, I want to finalize, and then the Senator from Arkansas has \nbeen waiting for quite sometime, and I want to allow him to speak. This \nis not a clean issue. This is not a removal of a tumor. We are talking \nabout drawing the line between what is infanticide and what is \nabortion, and that is why many of us are disturbed about this. No one \nis trying to reach in and outlaw abortions.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I were very clear about the limited \nscope of this bill. What we are saying is, this is too close to \ninfanticide. This is barbaric. This fuzzies the line that is dangerous \nfor the future of this country. And what you saw, as the Senator from \nCalifornia was hesitant to get involved in that because she realizes \nhow slippery this slope is, that you can say the foot does, the head \ndoesn't, maybe the ankle--folks, we don't want to go there. It is not \nnecessary for the health of the mother, it is not necessary for the \nlife of the mother, and if you don't believe me, believe the person who \ndeveloped it because they said so.\n  I think we need to have a full debate, not just on narrow issues, but \non the broader issue of what this means to the rights of every one of \nus born and unborn, sick and well, wanted and unwanted. I think the \nline needs to be a bright one. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nthis legislation to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure. I commend \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania for his passionate, eloquent, and \narticulate explanation in defense of this legislation.\n  I had the privilege of presiding during Senator Santorum's statement. \nI cannot say as well, I cannot say as passionately what the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania said so very well in explaining the need for this \nlegislation and why we are taking the time on the floor of the Senate \nto debate it and to vote on it. I am here so he might not stand alone, \nand he does not stand alone.\n  There will be better than 60 percent of the Senate voting for this \nlegislation, and better than 80 percent of the American people support \na ban on this horrible procedure. But this is not a subject, it is not \na topic, it is not an issue about which people like to talk. It is not \nsomething Senators feel comfortable coming down and talking about; it \nis not something I feel comfortable talking about, but I do think it is \nvery important.\n  Once again, I commend my colleague for the leadership he has shown on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, the Nation was shaken with a sense of disbelief over 5 \nyears ago in 1994 when we discovered that a young mother in South \nCarolina, Susan Smith, had murdered her own children and then pretended \nthey had been kidnapped.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, in recent days, a young woman in her \nninth month of pregnancy was savagely attacked by three young men who \nhad been hired by the woman's boyfriend and the father of her unborn \nchild to force her to lose her baby. That was the reason he contracted \nwith these thugs, to, in effect, murder that unborn child. They beat \nher with severe blows to her stomach and explicitly told her that their \nintent was to kill her child, a child the father did not want.\n  As we were dealing with the shock of this gruesome tragedy, we \nlearned of a Memphis man who confessed to driving across the river last \nsummer into the Arkansas Delta with his wife and throwing the couple's \n18-month-old child down into a 15-foot levee, leaving the child to die \na slow and painful death of exposure to the elements. After this \nhorrific event, the same couple allegedly returned 3 days later and \ndrowned their other child in a pond.\n  Last month, the Washington papers were filled with the news of a \nMaryland man who stands accused of killing his two small children and \nthen reporting their deaths as the result of a carjacking.\n  Unfortunately, these kinds of incidents become all too frequent \ntoday. The list goes on and on.\n  The question I raise is, Are the tragedies I have recounted, and the \nscores of others that could be enumerated, related to the debate that \nwe are having about partial-birth abortion?\n  I know there are people who will howl there is no connection. There \nwill be people who would object strenuously to even the suggestion \nbeing made that the all-too-frequent violence toward children could be \nrelated to a society's permissive attitude toward a procedure that \nwould allow a baby to be partially born and then killed.\n  But I would suggest that, in fact, there is a connection; that \nviolence begets violence; that dehumanizing one part of mankind \ncontributes to the dehumanizing of all vulnerable human beings--whether \nthey are the disabled, whether they are the elderly, or whether they \nare the newborn.\n  Many Americans were shocked--I was shocked--to hear of the Princeton \nprofessor of bioethics, who was recently hired, assumed a seat on the \nfaculty at Princeton University, one of our most distinguished \nuniversities--a professor of bioethics, ironically--who said:\n\n       I do not think it is always wrong to kill an innocent human \n     being. Simply killing an infant is never equivalent to \n     killing a person.\n\n  A professor of bioethics, at a major American university, who can say \nthat publicly and be defended.\n  The questions Senator Santorum posed a few moments ago to the Senator \nfrom California--well, Professor Singer would not have had difficulty \nin answering the questions that he posed. He simply says: It is not \nalways wrong to kill an innocent human being. Killing an infant is not \nthe equivalent of killing a person.\n  Is this where we are going?\n  This professor believes parents should be allowed, 28 days after the \nbirth of a severely disabled child, to decide whether or not they want \nto kill the child or keep the child.\n  It was suggested earlier in the opening comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania that the debate we are having about this kind of \nprocedure, 40 years ago, would have been unheard of in our society. No \none can doubt that in this so-called age of enlightenment we have moved \nso far in what we view as acceptable in the area of taking the lives of \nthose who are innocent.\n  I listened very closely to the objections to this legislation as I \npresided in\n\n[[Page S12881]]\n\nthe chair during the opening statements of both sides earlier today. It \nseemed to me that every issue that was raised in opposition to this \nlegislation was an effort to divert attention from the horror of this \nprocedure.\n  There was the issue of the timing of the vote. Whether this vote \noccurs this week or whether this vote would have occurred last week or \nnext week does not change the horror of what we are talking about; it \ndoes not change the terrible nature of a procedure that kills a child \nthat is partially born.\n  I think every objection that has been raised is an effort to turn our \nattention away, divert our attention away from that chart that Senator \nSantorum had on the floor earlier today, which was far from being a \ncartoon but was very similar to medical charts.\n  Then there was the objection that we were practicing medicine; that \nthe Senate was seeking to practice medicine; that we should not make \nthis decision; that it is a decision that should be made within the \nprofession.\n  It was Thomas Jefferson who said--and I will say it as close to his \nwords as I can: The first and fundamental purpose of Government is the \nprotection of innocent human life.\n\n  There is no more fundamental goal and object of Government than the \nprotection of its citizens, the protection of human life. We could not \nfind a subject more relevant to what Government ought to be doing than \nthis subject.\n  To say we should not be involved in it because it is a medical issue \nis simply an effort to divert us from what really is the issue; that \nis, whether human life should be protected by law or not.\n  It is always ironic to me that those who say Government should not be \ninvolved in this issue are the first to say Government should pay for \nthis procedure, or at least abortions in general.\n  Then there was the argument that the courts may rule this \nunconstitutional; therefore we should not even be voting on this \nbecause the courts, and the Supreme Court eventually, might rule this \nlegislation unconstitutional.\n  Isn't that ironic? Because I just listened to 4 days of debate in \nwhich the constitutionality of campaign finance reform proposals were \nargued on the floor of this Senate. No one said, well, we shouldn't \neven debate this proposal because the courts--in fact, the evidence is \nthe courts have and will rule many portions of the so-called Shays-\nMeehan legislation unconstitutional as a violation of the first \namendment--but it did not prevent us from having a healthy, prolonged \ndebate about the need for campaign finance reform.\n  I think it is an absolute red herring to say: Well, ultimately when \nthe Supreme Court makes a definitive ruling on this subject, they may \nor may not rule that it is constitutional. That, in no way, abrogates \nour responsibility to debate it and to pass legislation that we believe \nis not only constitutional but in the best interests of this country.\n  Then it was said: Well, we have had repeated votes on this before. We \nhave had repeated votes on a lot of issues. The fact is, we have new \nSenators now. We are going to have some different votes. We voted \nrepeatedly on campaign finance reform. It is a debate, I suspect, that \nwill go on year after year.\n  Because we have voted on this legislation before is no reason that we \nshould not, once again, raise what many believe is the fundamental \nmoral issue facing our culture today; that is, the issue of life.\n  Senator Santorum so eloquently demonstrated the folly of where this \nultimately leads. If killing an unborn child, who is partially \ndelivered, with only his or her head still within the body of the \nmother, is legal, where then do we draw the line? Could we have a more \nbasic, fundamental issue of gravity before this body than that? So time \nand time again we will hear, during the debate, the effort to take our \nattention away from where the focus should be, and that is unborn child \nand this horrible procedure.\n  Every effort will be made to bring up the timing of the vote, the \nissue of whether or not this is in our purview, the practicing of \nmedicine, which, of course, is very much within our purview, this issue \nof human life; the fact of what the courts have ruled or may yet rule \non this or similar legislation--all of these are efforts to take the \nNation's eyes off what this legislation is all about, and that is \neliminating a barbaric, uncivilized procedure that no right-minded \nperson can surely defend.\n  It is a Federal crime to harm a spotted owl or a bald eagle or even \nits egg, but a helpless infant, completely dependent on its mother, is \nnot accorded the same protections we afford the spotted owl or the bald \neagle.\n  In this body--I say to my colleagues who say we shouldn't take the \ntime of the Senate to debate this issue--in this body, we debated an \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill that would have \nprohibited the use of steel leg hold traps. Perhaps that was a debate \nwe should have had, but I believe it pales in comparison to the gravity \nand the seriousness of the issue we are now debating. We would protect \nthe spotted owl, the bald eagle, or the inhuman practice of steel leg \nhold traps, but we have trouble protecting infants who are pulled from \ntheir mother's womb by the legs and killed.\n  One of the finest writers in this Nation, I believe, hails from the \nState of Arkansas. He is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist whose name \nis Paul Greenberg. He is one of the most brilliant and, I think, \narticulate defenders of human life I have ever had the opportunity to \nread. I want to read for the record a couple of short paragraphs from \nthe many columns this Pulitzer Prize winner has written:\n\n       As always, verbal engineering has preceded social \n     engineering. The least of these must be aborted in words \n     before it becomes permissible to abort them in deed. Those \n     whom we want out of the way must first be dehumanized or \n     something within might hold us back.\n\n  I wonder why there was such objection to even the term ``partial-\nbirth abortion.'' Clearly, it describes what this procedure is. I think \nthe author, Mr. Greenberg, has said it right: We have to do the verbal \nengineering before we do the social engineering, because to use the \nterm ``partial-birth abortion'' suggests the humanity of that child.\n\n  Then Greenberg wrote:\n\n       What once would have inspired horror is now the mundane, \n     even the scientific, the advanced, the enlightened. What once \n     might have inspired dread is now sanctioned in the elastic \n     name of constitutional right and individual freedom.\n\n  That is what we are hearing today. We are hearing the defense of an \nindefensible procedure, sanctioned in the elastic name of \nconstitutional right and individual freedom. When a question is raised, \nit is simply: I support Roe v. Wade; that is our right. What an elastic \nright it has become, to defend under Roe v. Wade a procedure that no \none, no civilized person, could suggest is either good medicine or \nhumane practice.\n  I ask my colleagues to not be diverted from the issue but to think \nabout the baby, think about the procedure, this horrible procedure, \nthink about the pain that little baby feels, think about what kind of \ncountry we want to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will make a unanimous consent request. I \nhope it is OK with my colleague from Pennsylvania. I would like to \nspeak for 2 minutes. I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing that, Senator Wellstone take 10 minutes and, following that, \nSenator Lieberman be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may amend that to say, following that, Senator \nBrownback would be recognized after Senator Lieberman.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will repeat the understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will repeat it, as amended by my friend from \nPennsylvania. It would be Boxer for 2 minutes, Wellstone for 10 \nminutes.\n  How much time would Senator Lieberman like to have?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Ten minutes is fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ten minutes for Senator Lieberman, at which time we would \ngo to Senator Brownback for 10 minutes. That is my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S12882]]\n\n  Let me say, the Senator from Arkansas said the charge of government \nis to protect innocent life. We all want to protect every life. But \nwhen it comes to pregnancy, we do have a law that prevails in this \ncountry, which my friend may not agree with --I have a hunch he \ndoesn't--called Roe v. Wade. It was decided in 1973. In that decision, \nthe Court said when it comes to abortion, in the first trimester a \nwoman has the right to choose, without any interference by the \nGovernment; and after that time, the States can regulate and restrict, \nbut always the life of the woman and the health of the woman must be \nprotected. That is Roe. That is, it seems to me, a very sound decision.\n  What we have in the Santorum bill is an out-and-out attack on that \nphilosophy because there is no exception for health.\n  My friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, is trying to deal with that \nissue. I say to him, my compliments for working on his bill.\n  The bottom line for this Senator: I want to make sure if my daughter \nor anybody else's daughter is in an emergency situation, that the \ndoctor or doctors do not have to open up the law books and decide \nwhether or not they can do what is necessary to save the health and \nlife of my daughter.\n  When one talks about innocent life, one must look at the faces \ninvolved. Here is a face of a beautiful young woman who wanted \ndesperately to have children. I will tell her story later. She is an \ninnocent person. Roe protects her; the Santorum bill leaves her out in \nthe cold.\n  So the Senator from Pennsylvania can engage me in debates all he \nwants as to when I believe life begins and when I think a baby is born. \nTo me, it is very obvious when a baby is born. When it leaves the \nmother, it is born. That is pretty straightforward.\n\n  I would prefer to leave the medical emergencies to the physicians. I \nthink they know. This isn't a Roe procedure we are talking about. This \nis a procedure that the American College of Gynecologists and \nObstetricians supports. They say they need it in their arsenal when \nthey work to protect a woman's life and her health. The American Nurses \nAssociation--I could go on and on.\n  At this time, I yield the floor and will come back to this as often \nas we have to until this debate concludes.\n  I know Senator Wellstone has something to offer to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nshall be brief. First, I ask unanimous consent that I be included as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will describe the amendment one more \ntime for those who are following this debate. I think it is important \nwhat the amendment says. It would ban all postviability abortions, \nexcept in cases where both the attending physician and an independent \nnontreating physician both certify in writing, in their medical \njudgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's \nlife or risk grievous injury to her physical health, with then a very \nstrict and very clear definition of ``grievous injury.'' That is what \nthe amendment says.\n  It would actually reduce the number of late-term abortions. This \nlegislation fits in with the constitutional parameters set forth by the \nSupreme Court for government restriction of abortion. This legislation \nretains the abortion option for mothers facing extraordinary medical \nconditions such as breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. At the same \ntime, this amendment clearly limits the medical circumstances where \npostviability abortions are permitted. By doing that, this legislation \nprotects fetal life in cases where the mother's health is not at high \nrisk.\n  I came to the floor to speak about this amendment because I believe \nthe Durbin amendment is, if you will, where I am kind of within me. \nThis is what I believe. I think it makes sense to move in this \ndirection. I think it makes sense to set up a strict standard. I think \nit is terribly important, when we look at postviability abortions, to \nhave this test, to have this standard that has to be met. I am \ncertainly not going to vote for an amendment or a piece of legislation \nwhich is so open-ended that where there clearly are the medical \ncircumstances, the life of a mother is threatened, she can't go forward \nwith this procedure.\n\n  Here is why I come to the floor. I don't understand why those who \nwant to see some change would not support this compromise. If you are \ninterested, I say to my colleagues, in trying to make a difference, if \nyou are concerned about some of these late-term abortions, if you think \nthere ought to be a more stringent standard, then that is what this \nDurbin amendment says. If you are interested in passing legislation, if \nyou are interested in making a change, if you are interested in passing \na bill that isn't going to be vetoed by the President, if you are \ninterested in passing legislation, as opposed to one more time going \nthrough this political war and making this a big political issue, then \nyou ought to support this amendment.\n  There are some people from the other side who think this amendment is \na mistake. They don't want to see this amendment pass. I think this \namendment is reasonable. I think it is a compromise that makes sense. I \nthink it deserves our support.\n  I actually will make this not at all personal in terms of what other \nSenators have said. It is simply not true that there aren't many people \nin the Senate who are not concerned, that don't share some of the \nconcerns that have been reflected by speeches given on the floor. \nSheila and I have three children, and we also were confronted with two \nmiscarriages--6 weeks and over 4 months. Anybody who goes through that \nknows what this debate is all about. I also know it is about a woman, a \nmother, a family having their right to choose. I am very nervous about \na State coming in and telling a family they are going to make this \ndecision. But I also understand the concerns, especially the concerns--\nagain, I go to the language about postviability abortions. But here we \nhave an amendment that says it will ban this except in the cases where \nthe attending physician and an independent, nontreating physician \ncertify that, in their medical judgment, if you don't do this, then you \nare going to see a threat to the mother's life or she is going to risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health.\n  Isn't that reasonable? I am so tired of the sharp drawing of the line \nand the polarization and the accusations and the emotion and the \nbitterness. Why don't we pass this amendment? It is a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  For those who want to overturn Roe v. Wade, that is never going to \nhappen. That is the law of the land. But if we want to make a \ndifference and we have this concern, I think we should support this \nDurbin amendment. I come to the floor of the Senate to thank him for \nhis effort. I am comfortable with this amendment. I think it would make \na difference. I think it would meet some of the agonizing concerns that \nI and other Senators have. I am not about to support legislation that \nis so open ended that it makes no allowance at all for the health of a \nmother. That is my position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. The underlying bill and \nthis amendment bring us back to these morally perplexing questions. We \nheard it in the sincerity of the speech by the Senator from Minnesota \nand the sincerity of all of my colleagues speaking on either side, for \neither of these approaches.\n  This problem, more than any I have confronted in my public life, \nseems to me to join our personal value systems, our personal \nunderstanding about profound philosophical medical questions, such as \n``When does life begin?'' with our role as legislators, with our role \nas lawmakers, with the limits of what our capacities are in making law \nand, ultimately, of course, also with what the reality is that the \ncourts have stated as they have applied our Constitution, as the \nultimate arbiter of our values and our rights in this country.\n\n[[Page S12883]]\n\n  I support this proposal of Senator Durbin's because, once again, I \nthink it actually will do what I believe most everybody--I would say \neverybody--in this Chamber would like the law to do, and that is to \nreduce the number of abortions that are performed. I support it also \nbecause I think it can be upheld as constitutional, and I sincerely and \nrespectfully doubt the underlying proposal, the so-called Partial-Birth \nAbortion Act, will be upheld as constitutional.\n  I remember I first dealt with these issues when I was a State senator \nin Connecticut in the 1970s, after the Roe v. Wade decision was first \npassed down by the Supreme Court, and the swelter of conflicting \nquestions: What is the appropriate place for my convictions about \nabortion, my personal conviction that potential life begins at \nconception and, therefore, my personal conviction that all abortions \nare unacceptable? How do I relate that to my role as a lawmaker, to the \nlimits of the law, to the right of privacy that the Supreme Court found \nin Roe v. Wade?\n  This proposal that deals with partial-birth abortion, or intact \ndilation and extraction, brings us back once again to all of those \nquestions. I have received letters from constituents in support of \nSenator Santorum's proposal. I have had calls and conversations with \nconstituents and friends--people I not only respect and trust but \nlove--who have urged me to support Senator Santorum's proposal.\n  When you hear the description of this procedure, it is horrific; it \nis abominable. There is a temptation, of course, to want to respond and \ndo what the underlying proposal asks us to do in the law by adopting \nthis law. And then I come back to my own personal opinion, which is \nevery abortion, no matter when performed during pregnancy--this is my \npersonal view--is unacceptable and is, in its way, a termination of \npotential life.\n  So as I step back and reach that conclusion, I have to place the \nproposal Senator Santorum puts before us and the one Senator Durbin \nputs before us now in the context, one might say, of some humility of \nwhat the appropriate role for each of us is as lawmakers, what the \nappropriate role for this institution is as a lawmaking body, and what \ndoes the Court tell us is appropriate under the Constitution. I cannot \nreach any other conclusion, personally, than that Senator Santorum's \nproposal is not constitutional, that Senator Durbin's is, and will, in \nfact, reduce the number of postviability abortions and, therefore, the \nnumber of abortions that are performed in our country.\n  That is why I have added my name as a cosponsor to Senator Durbin's \nproposal.\n  The courts have created well-defined boundaries for legislative \naction. Under Planned Parenthood versus Casey, the Supreme Court held \nthat ``subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in \nthe potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even \nproscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate \nmedical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \nmother.'' Partial birth legislation has been challenged 22 times in the \ncourts resulting in 19 injunctions. The court-imposed constraints must \nbe reflected in legislative efforts if we are going to achieve our goal \nof reducing late-term abortions. Enacting legislation that courts have \nstruck down time and again is unlikely to reduce abortions.\n  Most recently, of course, that conclusion was reached by the Eighth \nCircuit Court on September 24, little less than a month ago, when the \ncourt said:\n\n       Several states have enacted statutes seeking to ban \n     ``partial-birth abortion.'' The precise wording of the \n     statutes, and how far the statutes go in their attempts to \n     regulate pre-viability abortions, differ from state to state. \n     The results from constitutional challenges to the statutes, \n     however, have been almost unvarying. In most of the cases \n     that reached the federal courts, the courts have held the \n     statutes unconstitutional.\n\n  So the constitutional impediment to the proposal Senator Santorum \nmakes is that, notwithstanding the horrific nature of the so-called \npartial-birth abortion, the intact dilation and extraction method of \nabortion, you cannot prohibit by law, according to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, any particular form of terminating a pregnancy at \nall stages of the pregnancy. You can prohibit almost all forms of \nterminating a pregnancy after viability. That is what the Durbin \namendment will do.\n  Incidentally, viability as medical science has advanced, has become \nan earlier and earlier time in the pregnancy.\n  There are exceptions.\n  Incidentally, the language in the Durbin proposal is not full of \nloopholes. It is very strict and demanding. It requires a certification \nby a physician that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten \nthe mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Those \nare serious requirements not meant to create a series of loopholes \nthrough which people intending to violate the law can go.\n  As has been said, a new provision has been added to this amendment \nwhich requires that an independent physician who will not perform nor \nbe present at the abortion, who was not previously involved in the \ntreatment of the mother, can affirm the first physician's opinion by a \ncertification in writing.\n  A physician who knowingly violates the act may be subject to \nsuspension of license and penalties as high as $250,000.\n  The limitations are specific. They are narrow. And they are, if I may \nsay so, inflexible. In that sense, they respond in the most narrow way \nto the health exception required by the Supreme Court.\n  This is such a good proposal which Senator Durbin has offered that I \nhope we may come back to it at some other time when it is not seen by \nthe proponents of Senator Santorum's legislation as a negation of that \nlegislation because this amendment in that sense never gets a fair vote \nor a clear vote. I think if we brought it up on its own, perhaps it \ncould allow us the common ground on this difficult moral question \ntoward which I think so many Members of the Chamber on both sides \naspire. I hope we can find the occasion to do that.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Illinois for the work he \nhas done in preparing this amendment and bringing it before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know Senator Brownback is going to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Brownback is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request so \nthat Senator Mikulski could follow the Senator?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski follow Senator Brownback and be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. I thank my colleague, Senator \nSantorum, for once again bringing this important issue in front of this \nbody and to this floor.\n  Once again, I join Senator Santorum as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation to end partial-birth abortion in this country. Last year, \nthe Senate failed to override the President's veto by three votes. \nPresident Clinton has twice vetoed similar measures in 1996 and 1997. \nWe will continue, however, to raise this issue until the President \nsigns this into law, or until this procedure is banned for forever.\n  I follow my colleague from Connecticut, who I rarely disagree with on \nmatters of this nature. But this happens to be one of those which I do. \nI view this as an abhorrent procedure, as my colleague from Connecticut \ndoes as well. I also view it as a constitutional issue that we can \nraise, that we can deal with, and this body should deal with.\n  This goes to one of the most fundamental issues for us as a country, \nfor us as a people, and that is when life begins and when it should be \nprotected. These lives should be protected.\n  As I sat and listened to much of this discussion, I have to say I am \nsad as I listened to this discussion because it is so difficult, and it \nis such an awful thing--the birth of a child, and then it is killed by \na blunt instrument.\n  I think some medical facts bear mentioning at this point in time.\n  Brain wave activity is detectable in human beings at 41 days after \nconception--just 41 days. A heartbeat is detectable 24 days after \nconception.\n  Consistently, State statutory or case law establishes a criteria of \ndead as the\n\n[[Page S12884]]\n\nirreversible cessation of brain wave activity or spontaneous cardiac \narrest.\n  In short, these are lives of individuals that are ended by this \nprocess. It is death. These are heartbeats and brain waves. They are \nstopped. They are denied life by this abhorrent procedure.\n  I would like to share some thoughts with you from a writer, a Jewish \nwriter, Sandi Merl, when he was asked about this procedure of partial-\nbirth abortion. He said this:\n\n       When I think of Partial-Birth Abortion, I hear only the \n     first two words--``partial birth.'' To me, this procedure is \n     not abortion. It is pre-term delivery followed by an act of \n     destruction leading to a painful death . . . This is \n     infanticide, clearly and simply, and must be stopped . . . \n     This is about leaving no fingerprints when committing a \n     murder of convenience.\n\n  That is why I will once again vote to end partial-birth abortion when \nit comes to the Senate floor. It is a cruel and shameless procedure \nwhich robs us of our humanity with every operation performed. It is not \ntrue that the anesthesia kills the child before removal from the womb. \nInstead, it is the fact that the baby is actually alive and experiences \nextraordinary pain when undergoing the operation.\n  Nor is this brutality only reserved for the most extreme \ncircumstances. According to the executive director of the National \nCoalition of Abortion Providers, the ``vast majority'' of partial-birth \nabortions are performed in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy on \nhealthy babies of healthy mothers.\n  The facts speak for themselves. Bluntly put, this involves the death \nof a child in a brutal fashion, and all of it legally condoned by the \ncurrent President of the United States.\n  Our institutionalized indifference to this extraordinary suffering \nmakes me wonder, what has happened to our collective conscience as a \nnation? Are we really so callous that we knowingly condone this form of \ndeath for our very weakest, which we would never force on any adult, no \nmatter how bad the crime? Even murderers on death row are given more \nconsideration when executed. Yet our babies are painfully killed while \nconscious. This extraordinary cruelty should cause us to bow our heads \nin shame.\n  In a Wall Street Journal article, Peggy Noonan rightly labeled events \nsuch as that at Columbine High School as evidence of a much deeper \nproblem, one she identified as the ``culture of death.'' Quoting Pope \nJohn Paul II from his recent visit to Mexico City, he urged a rejection \nof this increasingly influential culture of death, instead embracing \nthe dignity and principles of life for everyone.\n  It is obvious, especially after the Columbine tragedy, that a culture \nof death is playing in our land. Lately, the volume has been turned up \nvery loudly. The words to this song include the extremes we know now by \nheart: Excessively high murder rates, the repeated rampages of violence \nby schoolchildren against schoolchildren, the unending tawdriness of \ntelevision programming and other media, to name only a few cultural \nmalfunctions.\n  As Noonan went on to observe:\n\n       No longer say, if you don't like it, change the channel. \n     [People] now realize something they didn't realize ten years \n     ago: There is no channel to change to.\n\n  Perhaps our increasingly violent culture has dulled our consciences \nand worn us down to this place where it no longer is politically \nexpedient to protest the obscene suffering of infants. This explains \nwhy we continue to tolerate such a brutal practice as partial-birth \nabortion--what a dreadful name. I hope it isn't so. It is to this \nconscience that I appeal. I appeal to those who recognize the suffering \nand do not turn their heads, who take personal responsibility to \ncorrect this course of destruction, no matter the political \nconsequences.\n  Please, please, open your hearts and listen. Hear that voice in \nthere, the cries of thousands of little children, saying: Hear me, let \nme live.\n  Every once in a while, something happens which shakes us from our \ndullness. I want to share an event reported in the Washington Times \nthat described an incident in April of this year in Cincinnati where a \nbotched partial-birth abortion resulted in the birth of a little girl \nwho lived for 3 hours. It is reported that the emergency room \ntechnician rocked and sang to her. After the inevitable death of the \nbaby, the staff members grieved so badly that hours were spent in \ncounseling and venting to get over the emotional trauma of the \nincident. One person observed that the real tragedy is that no laws \nwere broken.\n  I hope we will continue to let ourselves be troubled by this event \nand by this practice and instead of turning a cold heart to it or \nsaying, ``I'm tied into a certain political position I can't change.'' \nI hope we will prayerfully consider and at night go and search \nourselves and ask: Is this something we want to continue in America? Is \nthis something I want to be a part of allowing to continue in America?\n  People of great tradition serve in this body who seek to protect and \nto serve the poorest of the poor and the weakest of the weak in our \nculture and society. They serve so admirably, and they speak glowingly \nabout the need to protect those who are weakest. Yet, is it not this \nchild in the womb who is the weakest of all in our society and in our \nculture? And that child cries right now. If we will just for a moment \nlisten, we will hear the cry of that child. Can't we just for a moment \nturn from our locked in, dug in positions and say, OK, just for a \nmoment I will listen, I will see if I can hear that small voice that is \ncrying out to me: Just let me live. Let me have that God-given life \nthat has been promised to me. Let me have that God-given life of which \nwe speak so eloquently in our Declaration of Independence and our \nConstitution.\n\n       We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life. . . .\n\n  Let's live. Let's stop this culture of death from going forward. \nLet's appeal to that inner voice that says let that life live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Santorum \namendment and on behalf of the Durbin amendment of which I am a \ncosponsor. I wish to speak on the merits of the amendment, but I will \nsay a few words before I debate the amendment about an issue the \nSenator from Kansas has raised. I have had the opportunity to get to \nknow and so respect the position of the Senator from Kansas.\n  The Senator spoke about the culture of death. I believe we should \nhave a debate on the culture of death here in the Senate. I believe it \nshould occur among Members privately, when we are having conversations \nin the lunchroom. I believe one of the things we should do as we end \nthis century, which has been such a ghoulish, grim, violent century, is \nthink about how we can affirm a life-giving culture.\n  I speak to my colleague from Kansas with all due respect and a desire \nto work with him on those issues. The Pope, the leader of my own faith, \nand the Catholic bishops of America have spoken about the culture of \ndeath. They say when we choose life, it is ending all forms of \nviolence--the violence of poverty, hunger, armed conflict, weapons of \nwar, the violence of drug trafficking, the violence of racism, and the \nviolence of mindless damage to our environment.\n  In other statements from both the Pope and the bishops, they speak \nout on famine, starvation, the spread of drugs, domestic violence, and \nthe denial of health care.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, when we think about a defense \nagainst the culture of death, we need a broader view. We are need to \ntalk not only about one amendment or one procedure--which I say is \nquite grim--but also to talk about what we are going to do to address \nthese other critical issues.\n  We rejected a judicial nomination last week because of the nominee's \nposition on the death penalty. I don't know how we can be against the \nculture of death and yet vote against a distinguished man who makes \nserious, prudent, judicial decisions on certain death penalty cases.\n  We defeated an arms control treaty, with no real serious opportunity \nfor full debate and development of side agreements. There were \nlegitimate ``yellow flashing lights'' about the agreement that deserved \nthorough debate. But we rushed to a vote with only hasty, last minute \nhearings and no opportunity for complete investigation of the treaty.\n\n[[Page S12885]]\n\n  I say to my colleagues, let's look at what we are going to do to \nprotect our own families and how we can look at promoting a culture of \nlife. I say that with sincerity. I say it with the utmost respect for \npeople whose position I will disagree with on this amendment. We need \nto reach out to each other, think these issues through, and put aside \nmessage amendments, put aside tactical advantages, put aside partisan \nlines.\n  I say to my colleague from Kansas, I know he is deeply concerned \nabout the issues of culture in our own country. Many of those issues I \ndo share. I reach out and say to my colleagues, let's think through \nwhat we are doing.\n  Having said that, I rise to support the Durbin amendment. In this \ndebate, I say to my colleagues, the first question is: Who really \nshould decide whether someone should have an abortion or not? I believe \nthat decision should not be made by government. I believe when \ngovernment interferes in decisionmaking, we have ghoulish, grim \npolicies.\n\n  Look at China, with their one child/one family official practice. The \ngovernment of China mandated abortions.\n  Look at Romania under the vile leadership of Ceausescu, who said any \nwoman of childbearing age had to prove she was not on any form of birth \ncontrol or natural method. They were mandated to have as many children \nas they could.\n  I don't want government interfering. I think government should be \nsilent. We have a Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. We should \nrespect that decision. I think it is in the interests of our country \nthat government now be silent on this. We should move forward. Medical \npractitioners should make decisions on medical matters. It should not \nbe left up to politicians with very little scientific or theological \ntraining.\n  There is a substantial difference on when life begins. Science and \ntheologians disagree on this. Some say at the moment of conception. St. \nThomas Aquinas, in my own faith, said the soul comes into a male in 6 \nweeks, but it takes 10 weeks for the soul to enter the body of a woman. \nWe would take issue with Thomas Aquinas on that. Our Supreme Court said \nthat given conflicting scientific viewpoints, fetal viability should \ndetermine to what extent a state may limit access to abortion.\n  The Durbin amendment is consistent with the Court's framework. It \nwould ban all post-viability abortions except when the life or health \nof the woman is at risk. The Durbin amendment provides clear \nguidelines, which are narrowly but compassionately drawn, to allow \ndoctors to use a variety of procedures, based on medical necessity in a \nparticular woman's situation. It must be medically necessary in the \nopinion of not one but two doctors. Both the doctor who recommends this \nas a procedure and then an independent physician must certify that this \nis the medically necessary and appropriate course for a particular \nwoman facing a health crisis.\n  This is why I think the Durbin amendment is a superior amendment. It \nacknowledges the grave seriousness of the possibility of a medical \ncrisis in a late-term pregnancy that can only be resolved with the \nfamily and the physician. To single out only one procedure means other \nprocedures could be used, equally as grim. What we want to do is \npreserve the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and make \nsure there is no loophole, by requiring two physicians to independently \nevaluate the woman's medical needs.\n  So I believe the Durbin amendment is a superior way to address this \nmost serious issue, and I intend to support the Durbin amendment. I \nrecommend to my colleagues that they, too, give the Durbin amendment \nserious consideration.\n  Let me say again what I think this debate is about. I believe it is \nabout the right of women facing the most tragic and rare set of \ncomplications affecting her pregnancy to make medically appropriate or \nnecessary choices.\n  This is not a debate that should take place in the U.S. Senate. This \nis a discussion that should remain for women, their health care \nproviders, their families and their clergy. The Senate has no standing, \nno competency and no business interfering in this most private and \nanguishing of decisions a woman and her family can possibly face.\n  That is why I so strongly oppose the Santorum bill. It would violate \nto an alarming degree the right of women and their physicians to make \nmajor medical decisions.\n  And that is why I rise in strong support of the Durbin amendment. I \nsupport the Durbin alternative for four reasons.\n  First, it respects the constitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade.\n  Second, it prohibits all post-viability abortions.\n  Third, it provides an exception for the life and health of a woman \nwhich is both intellectually rigorous and compassionate.\n  Finally, it leaves medical decisions in the hands of physicians--not \npoliticians.\n  The Durbin alternative addresses this difficult issue with the \nintellectual rigor and seriousness of purpose it deserves. We are not \nbeing casual. We are not angling for political advantage. We are not \nlooking for cover.\n  We are offering the Senate a sensible alternative--one that will stop \npost-viability abortions, while respecting the Constitution. We believe \nthat it is an alternative that reflects the views of the American \npeople.\n  The Durbin amendment respects the Supreme Court's ruling in the Roe \nv. Wade decision. When the Court decided Roe, it was faced with the \ntask of defining ``When does life begin?'' Theologians and scientists \ndiffer on this. People of good will and good conscience differ on this.\n  So the Supreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a fetus is \nviable, it is presumed to have not only a body, but a mind and spirit. \nTherefore it has standing under the law as a person.\n  The Roe decision is quite clear. States can prohibit abortion after \nviability, so long as they permit exceptions in cases involving the \nwoman's life or health. Let me be clear. Under Roe, states can prohibit \nmost late term abortions. And many states have done so.\n  In my own state of Maryland, we have a law that does just that. It \nwas adopted by the Maryland General Assembly and approved by the people \nof Maryland by referendum. It prohibits post viability abortions. As \nthe Constitution requires, it provides an exception to protect the life \nor health of the woman.\n  Like the Maryland law, the Durbin alternative respects that key \nholding of Roe. It says that after the point of viability, no woman \nshould be able to abort a viable fetus. The only exception can be when \nthe woman faces a threat to her life or serious and debilitating risk \nto her health.\n  The bill before us--the Santorum bill--only bans one particular \nabortion procedure at any point in a pregnancy. By violating the \nSupreme Court's standard on viability, this language would in all \nprobability be struck down by the courts.\n  In fact, this language has already been struck down in many states \nbecause of this very reason. The proponents of the legislation know \nthis.\n  The Durbin alternative, though, bans all post viability abortions. It \ndoesn't create loopholes by allowing other procedures to be used.\n  I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should abort a \nviable fetus for a frivolous, non-medical reason. It does not matter \nwhat procedure is used. It is wrong, and we know it.\n  The Durbin alternative bans those abortions. It is a real solution.\n  On the other hand, S. 1692, proposed by Senator Santorum and others, \ndoes not stop a single abortion. For those who think they support this \napproach, know that it is both hollow and ineffective.\n  S. 1692 attempts to ban one particular abortion procedure. All it \ndoes, though, is divert doctors to other procedures. Those procedures \nmay pose greater risks to the woman's health. But let me be clear--late \nterm abortions would still be allowed to happen. And for that reason, \nthe Santorum approach is ineffective.\n  The Durbin amendment provides a tough and narrow health exception \nthat is intellectually rigorous, but it is compassionate as well. It \nwill ensure that women who confront a grave health crisis late in a \npregnancy can receive the treatment they need.\n  The Amendment defines such a crisis as a ``severely debilitating \ndisease or\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\nimpairment caused or exacerbated by pregnancy.'' And we don't leave it \nup to her doctor alone. We require that a second, independent physician \nalso certify that the procedure is the most appropriate for the unique \ncircumstances of the woman's life.\n  But I want to be very clear in this. The Durbin amendment does not \ncreate a loophole with its health exception. We are not loophole \nshopping when we insist that an exception be made in the case of \nserious and debilitating threats to a woman's physical health. This is \nwhat the Constitution requires and the reality of women's lives \ndemands.\n  Let's face it, women do sometimes face profound medical crises during \npregnancy. Some of these traumas are caused or aggravated by the \npregnancy itself. I'm referring to conditions like severe hypertension \nor heart conditions.\n  I'm referring to pre-existing conditions--like diabetes or breast \ncancer--that require treatments which are incompatible with continuing \npregnancy. Would anyone argue that these are not profound health \ncrises?\n  The Durbin amendment recognizes that to deny these women access to \nthe abortion that could save their lives and physical health would be \nunconscionable. When the continuation of the pregnancy is causing \nprofound health problems, a woman's doctor must have every tool \navailable to respond.\n  I readily acknowledge that the procedure described by my colleagues \non the other side is a grim one. I do not deny that. But there are \ntimes when the realities of women's lives and health dictates that this \nmedical tool be available.\n  I support the Durbin alternative because it is leaves medical \ndecisions up to doctors--not legislators. It relies on medical \njudgement--not political judgement--about what is best for a patient.\n  Not only does the Santorum bill not let doctors be doctors, it \ncriminalizes them for making the best choice for their patients. Under \nthis bill a doctor could be sent to prison for up to two years for \ndoing what he or she thinks is necessary to save a woman's life or \nhealth. I say that's wrong.\n  In fact, those who oppose the Durbin amendment say it is flawed \nprecisely because it leaves medical judgements up to physicians.\n  Well, who else should decide? Would the other side prefer to have the \ngovernment make medical decisions? I disagree with that. I believe we \nshould not substitute political judgement for medical judgement.\n  We need to let doctors be doctors. This is my principle whether we \nare talking about reproductive choice or any health care matter.\n  Physicians have the training and expertise to make medical decisions. \nThey are in the best position to recommend what is necessary or \nappropriate for their patients. Not bureaucrats. Not managed care \naccountants. And certainly not legislators.\n  The Durbin alternative provides sound public policy, not a political \nsoundbite. It is our best chance to address the concerns many of us \nhave about late term abortions. The President has already vetoed the \nSantorum bill and other similar legislation in earlier Congresses. I \nbelieve he will veto it again.\n  But today we have a chance to do something real. We have an \nopportunity to let logic and common sense win the day. We can do \nsomething which I know reflects the views of the American people.\n  Today we can pass the Durbin amendment. We can say that we value life \nand that we value our Constitution. We can make clear that a viable \nfetus should not be aborted. We can say that we want to save women's \nlives and women's health. The only way to do all this, Mr. President, \nis to vote for the Durbin amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2320 To The Text Intended To Be Stricken By Amendment \n                                  2319\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes amendment \n     numbered 2321 to amendment No. 2320.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ROE V. WADE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n     to exercise their full rights under Federal and State law;\n       (2) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973));\n       (3) the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade \n     established constitutionally based limits on the power of \n     States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy; and\n       (4) women should not be forced into illegal and dangerous \n     abortions as they often were prior to the Roe v. Wade \n     decision.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an \n     important constitutional right; and\n       (2) such decision should not be overturned.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will ask it again, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe I had the floor. I had the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note the Senator lost the floor \nwhen he asked for the yeas and nays.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I withdraw my request for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered will \nbasically express the sense of the Congress in support of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade. With all of the amendments that keep \ncoming up and trying to chip away at Roe v. Wade, Senator Boxer and I \ndecided that it was important for us to see if there was support in the \nCongress for Roe v. Wade.\n  I know there are some groups around the United States that believe \nRoe v. Wade should be overturned. I do not believe that. I think it was \nan eminently wise decision. As time goes on, and as we reflect back, \nthe decision enunciated by Justice Blackmun becomes more and more \nprofound and more elegant in its simplicity and its \nstraightforwardness.\n  However, it seems as we get wrapped up in these emotionally charged \ndebates on partial birth abortion, we lose sight of what it is that \ngave women their full rights under the laws of our Nation and our \nStates.\n  I was interested a couple of minutes ago in what Senator Mikulski \npointed out; that the eminent theologian, St. Thomas Aquinas, had \nbasically stipulated that in soul man--that is the putting of the soul \nin the human body--occurred 6 weeks after conception for a\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\nman but 10 weeks after conception for a woman. That was a theology that \nheld for a long time.\n  I studied Saint Thomas Aquinas when I was in Catholic school. He was \nan eminent theologian, as I said. We look back and we say: That is \nridiculous. The very division of 6 weeks for a man and 10 weeks for a \nwoman is kind of ridiculous. Medical science has progressed. We know a \nlot of things they did not know at that time. What will we know 50 \nyears from now that we do not know today?\n  Women, through the centuries, as we have developed more and more the \nconcept of the rights of man--and I use man in the terms of mankind, \nall humans, the human race--that as we enlarge the concept of human \nrights--those rights we have that cannot legitimately be interfered \nwith or trespassed upon by the power of any government--as we \nprogressed in our thinking about those human rights, all too often \nwomen were left out of the equation.\n  It was not until recent times, even in our own country, that women \nhad the right to own property. It was not until recent times that women \neven had the right to vote in this country, not to say what rights are \nstill denied women in other countries around the globe.\n  As we progressed in our thinking of human rights, we have come a long \nway from Thomas Aquinas who said that for some reason a man gets a soul \na lot earlier than a woman gets a soul. Yes, we've come a long way.\n  I believe our concept of human rights now is basically that human \nrights applies to all of us, regardless of gender, regardless of \nposition at birth, regardless of nationality or station in life, race, \nreligion, nationality; that human rights inure to the person.\n  One of the expansions of those human rights was for women to have the \nright to choose. After all, it is the female who bears children. That \nparticular right inures to a woman. It was the particular genius of Roe \nv. Wade that Justice Blackmun laid out an approach to reproductive \nrights that basically guarantees to the woman in the first trimester a \ntotal restriction on the State's power to interfere with that decision. \nIn the second trimester, the State may, under certain inscriptions, \ninterfere. And in the third trimester, after the further decision of \nthe Casey case, the States may interfere to save the life or health of \nthe mother.\n\n  We have a situation now where women in our country are given--I \nshould not use the word ``given''--but have attained their equal rights \nand their full human rights under law.\n  That was Roe v. Wade. Since that time, many in the legislatures of \nour States and many in this legislature, the Congress of the United \nStates--the House and the Senate--have sought repeatedly to overturn \nRoe v. Wade; if not totally to overturn it, but to chip away at it--a \nlittle bit here, a little bit there, with the final goal to overturn \nRoe v. Wade.\n  According to CRS, only 10 pieces of legislation were introduced in \neither the House or Senate before the Roe decision. Since 1973, more \nthan 1,000 separate legislative proposals have been introduced. The \nmajority of these bills have sought to restrict abortions.\n  Unfortunately, what is often lost in the rhetoric and in some of this \nlegislation--is the real significance of the Roe decision.\n  The Roe decision recognized the right of women to make their own \ndecisions about their reproductive health. The decision whether to bear \na child is profoundly private and life altering. As the Roe Court \nunderstood, without the right to make autonomous decisions about \npregnancy, a woman could not participate freely and equally in society.\n  I do not believe that any abortion is desirable--nobody does. As \nCatholic and a father, I've struggled with it myself. However, I do not \nbelieve that it is appropriate to insist that my personal views be the \nlaw of the land.\n  I think there are some things that Congress can do to prevent \nunintended pregnancy and reduce abortion by increasing funding for \nfamily planning, mandating insurance coverage for contraception and \nsupporting contraception research.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution. I believe it would establish the one important principle \nthat we can agree on--that despite the difference in our views, we will \nnot strip away a woman's fundamental right to choose.\n  So I think we need to make it clear, we need to make it clear that we \nhave no business--especially we in the Congress of the United States--\nhave no business interfering with a woman's fundamental right to \nchoose.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor, I would be \ndelighted to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very grateful to the Senator from Iowa for this \namendment. It is interesting to me; in all the years I have been in the \nSenate, we have never had a straight up-or-down vote on whether this \nSenate agrees with the Supreme Court decision that gave women the right \nto choose.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I am very grateful to my friend for giving us a chance \nto talk about that because I wonder if my friend was aware that prior \nto the legalization of abortion, which is what Roe did in 1973, the \nleading cause of maternal death in this Nation was illegal abortion. \nWas my friend aware of that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I was. I didn't know the exact figure, but I knew \nmany women died or were permanently injured and disabled because of \nillegal abortions performed in this country--because they had no other \noption.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my colleague from California, I want to thank \nher for her stalwart support and defense of Roe v. Wade through all \nthese years. I follow in her footsteps, I can assure you. But I \nremember as a kid growing up in a small town in rural Iowa, that it was \ncommonplace knowledge, if you had the money, and you were a young woman \nwho became pregnant, you could go out of State; you could go someplace \nand have an abortion. But if you were poor and had nowhere else to go, \nyou went down to sought out someone who would do an illegal abortion. \nThose are the women who suffered and died and were permanently \ndisfigured.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I remember those days. Further, even \nwhen women who did have the wherewithal, sometimes they resorted to a \nback-alley abortion and paid the money----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Under the table and risked their lives and their ability \nto have children later and were scarred for life.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure\n  Mrs. BOXER. So the Roe v. Wade decision, as my friend has pointed \nout, in his words, was an ``elegant decision.'' And why does he say \nthat? Because it did balance the mother's rights with the rights of the \nfetus. Because it said, previability, the woman had the unfettered \nright to choose and in the late-term the State could regulate.\n  Roe v. Wade was a ``Solomon-like'' decision in that sense. I again \nwant to say to my friend, I greatly appreciate him offering this \nsecond-degree amendment to my amendment. I think it is important for us \nto support Roe v. Wade in this Congress. I think if we do, it will be a \nrelief to many women and families in this country who are concerned \nthat that basic right might be taken away because there are many people \nrunning for the highest office in the land who do not support Roe, who \nwant to see it overturned, who might well appoint Judges to the Court \nwho would take away this right to choose, which is hanging by a thread \nin Court as it is. So I, most of all, thank my friend for offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California. I thank her for the \nquestion. I will elaborate on that in just a minute.\n  Again, I say to the Senator from California, we do need to send a \nstrong message that the freedom to choose is no more negotiable than \nthe freedom to speak or the freedom to worship. It is nonnegotiable.\n  This ruling of Roe v. Wade has touched all of us in very different \nways. As the Senator from California just pointed out, it is estimated \nthat as many as 5,000 women died yearly from illegal abortions before \nRoe.\n\n  In the 25 years since Roe, the variety and level of women's \nachievements have reached unprecedented levels. The Supreme Court \nrecently observed:\n\n       The ability of women to participate equally in the economic \n     and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their \n     ability to control their reproductive lives.\n\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\n\n  I will also quote Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter in the Casey \ncase:\n\n       At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own \n     concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the \n     mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not \n     define the attributes of personhood were they formed under \n     compulsion of the State.\n\n  I think that is what this is all about--whether we will use the heavy \nhand of the State to enforce certain individuals' concepts of when life \nbegins, how life begins, when can a person have an abortion, when can a \nperson not. People are divided on this issue. Some people are uncertain \nabout it. I quarrel with myself all the time about it because it is as \nmultifaceted as there are individual humans on the face of the Earth.\n  I would not sit in judgment on any person who would choose to have an \nabortion, especially a woman who went through the terrifying, \nagonizing, soul-wrenching procedure of having a late-term abortion \nbecause her health and her life was in danger. That must be one of the \nmost soul-wrenching experiences a person can go through.\n  And you want me to sit in judgment on that? The Senator from \nPennsylvania wants to be able to say: Here it is. You can't deviate \nfrom that. I am sorry; that is not our role; that is not the role of \nthe Government or the State.\n  That is why, again, I believe it is particularly important that we \ncut through the fog that surrounds this issue and get to the heart of \nit, which is Roe v. Wade.\n  I used the word ``elegant.'' It means simplistic, simplicity. \nElegant: Not convoluted, not hard to understand, not shrouded and \ncomplex, but elegant, straightforward, simple in its definition. That \nis Roe v. Wade.\n  There are now those who want to come along and change it and make it \ncomplex, indecipherable, benefiting maybe one person one way, adding to \nthe detriment of another person another way, so that we are right back \nwhere we were before Roe v. Wade.\n  So I believe very strongly that we need to express ourselves on this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. That is why I will be asking for a \nrollcall vote at the appropriate time because it is going to be \nimportant for us to send a message on how important it is to preserve a \nwoman's fundamental right to choose under Roe v. Wade.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure it is clear, for those who may be \nfollowing this debate, that the underlying bill is the Santorum bill, \nwhich would ban a particular procedure at any point in the stage of \npregnancy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This type of approach has been stricken, I believe, in 19 \ndifferent States as unconstitutional.\n  I offered a substitute which related strictly to late-term abortions, \nthose occurring after viability, after a fetus could survive, and said \nthat we would only allow an abortion in an emergency circumstance where \nthe life of the mother was at stake or the situation where continuing \nthe pregnancy ran the risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. I \nbelieve, of course, the Court will, if it comes to that, ultimately \ndecide what I have offered, being postviability, is consistent with Roe \nv. Wade which drew that line. Before that fetus is viable and can \nsurvive outside the womb, the woman has certain rights. When the \nviability occurs, then those rights change, according to Roe v. Wade.\n\n  To make sure I understand, the Senator from Iowa is offering an \namendment that is not antagonistic to my amendment but, rather, wants \nto put the Senate on record on the most basic question about Roe v. \nWade as to whether or not the Senate supports it.\n  My question to the Senator is this: Is the Senator saying in his \namendment, in the conclusion of the amendment, Roe v. Wade was an \nappropriate decision and secures an important constitutional right, and \nsuch decision should not be overturned--that is the conclusion of his \namendment--is he saying that if we are to keep abortion legal in this \ncountry and safe under Roe v. Wade, we vote for his amendment and those \nwho believe abortion should be outlawed or prohibited or illegal would \nvote against his amendment? Is that the choice?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Illinois has stated it elegantly, very \nsimply and straightforward. That is the essence of the amendment, and \nthe Senator is correct. Voting on the amendment, which I offered, a \nvote in favor of my amendment would be a vote to uphold Roe v. Wade and \na woman's right to choose. A vote against it would be a vote to \noverturn Roe v. Wade and to take away a woman's right to choose.\n  The amendment I have offered would be consistent with the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  A further question to the Senator from Iowa, if he will yield. The \nSenator is from a neighboring State. There are many parts of Iowa that \nlook similar to my State, particularly in downstate Illinois. On this \ncontroversial issue--there are those who have heartfelt strong feelings \nagainst abortion, Roe v. Wade; those who have heartfelt strong feelings \non the other side in support of a woman's right to choose and Roe v. \nWade--I have found the vast majority of people I meet somewhere in \nbetween. It is my impression most people in America have concluded \nabortion should be safe and legal, but it should have some \nrestrictions. I ask the Senator from Iowa, has the Senator from Iowa \nhad that same experience in his State of Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I answer the Senator affirmatively. I have had that same \nexperience, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might further ask the Senator from Iowa a question, \nwhat he is saying is this vote on the Harkin amendment tries to answer \nthe first and most basic question: Should abortion procedures in \nAmerica remain safe and legal, consistent with Roe v. Wade, should we \nacknowledge a woman's right of privacy and her right to choose with her \nphysician and her family and her conscience as to the future of her \npregnancy within the confines of Roe v. Wade? That is the bottom line, \nis it not, of his amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, in closing, I think this is an \nimportant vote. I think we have walked around this issue in 15 \ndifferent directions in the time I have served on Capitol Hill. I \ncommend the Senator from Iowa for offering this amendment. I think it \ngets to the heart of the question as to those who would basically \noutlaw abortion in America and those who believe Roe v. Wade should be \ncontinued.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for \nenlightening this issue and for clearly drawing what this amendment is \nall about.\n  Again, a vote in favor of the amendment which I have offered states \nwe will support Roe v. Wade, that Roe v. Wade should be the law, that a \nwoman's right to choose should be kept under the provisions of Roe v. \nWade, as further elaborated in the Casey case. A vote against my \namendment would say you would be in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade \nand taking away a woman's fundamental right to choose.\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois.\n  In closing my remarks, knowing others want to speak, the Roe decision \nrecognized the right of women to make their own decisions about their \nreproductive health. The decision is a profoundly private, life-\naltering decision. As the Roe Court understood, without the right to \nmake autonomous decisions about pregnancy, a woman could not \nparticipate freely and equally in our society.\n  I think there are some things we ought to be doing to prevent \nunintended pregnancies and reduce abortions. We could, for example, \nincrease funding for family planning. Every time we try to do that, \nthere are those who are opposed to increasing funding for family \nplanning. We could mandate insurance coverage for contraception. That \ncould help. But, no, there are those who say we shouldn't do that \neither. We could have more support for contraception research. There \nare those who say, no, we shouldn't do that either. And those who are \nopposed, by and large, to increasing funding for family planning and \ninsurance coverage for contraception and contraception research are the \nsame ones who want to overturn Roe v. Wade or take\n\n[[Page S12889]]\n\naway a woman's right to have a late-term abortion in the case of \ngrievous health or life-threatening situations.\n  A little bit off the subject of Roe v. Wade, but which I think is \nparticularly important to point out, is that Saturday, October 23, 3 \ndays from today, will mark the 1-year anniversary of the assassination \nof Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered in his home in Amherst, NY, 1 \nyear ago this Saturday. As most are aware, there have been five sniper \nattacks on U.S. and Canadian physicians who perform abortions since \n1994. Each of these attacks has occurred on or close to Canada's \nRemembrance Day, November 11.\n  All of the victims in these attacks were shot in their homes by a \nhidden sniper who used a long-range rifle. Dr. Slepian tragically was \nkilled. Three other physicians were seriously wounded in these attacks.\n  I am reading a letter sent to the majority leader, Senator Lott, \ndated October 18, signed by the executive director of the National \nAbortion Federation, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica, the executive director of the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice, the \npresident and CEO of the Association of Reproductive Health \nProfessionals, and the executive director of Physicians for \nReproductive Choice and Health. All of these signed the letter to \nSenator Lott spelling out what I said. The letter goes on:\n\n       Federal law enforcement officials are urging all women's \n     health care providers, regardless of their geographic \n     location, to be on a high state of alert and to take \n     appropriate protective precautions during the next several \n     weeks. Security directives have been issued to all physicians \n     who perform abortions for clinics or in their private \n     practices, and to all individuals who have been prominent on \n     the abortion issue.\n       Senator Lott, on behalf of our physician members, and in \n     the interest of the public safety of the citizens of the US \n     and Canada, we urge you to reconsider the scheduling of a \n     floor debate on S-1692 at this time. As you are aware, each \n     time this legislation has been considered, extremely \n     explicit, emotional and impassioned debate has been aroused.\n       We have grave fears that the movement of this bill during \n     this particularly dangerous period has the potential to \n     inflame anti-abortion violence that might result in tragic \n     consequences.\n       We sincerely hope that you will take the threats of this \n     October-November period as seriously as we do, and that you \n     will use your considerable influence to ensure that the \n     Senate does not inadvertently play into the hands of \n     extremists who might well be inspired to violence during this \n     time. We urge you to halt the movement of S. 1692. Please \n     work with us to ensure that the senseless acts of violence \n     against U.S. citizens are not repeated in 1999.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 18, 1999.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, there is one other thing I want to \nmention. I am going to read a letter because this person is a personal \nfriend of mine, someone I have gotten to know over the years. I believe \nthe Senator from California has a picture of Kim Koster. I ask a page \nto bring me the picture back here, if I may have that.\n  This photo is Kim Koster and her husband, Dr. Barrett Koster. They \nare both friends of mine, whom I have known for I guess about 3 or 4 \nyears. I am going to read her letter in its entirety:\n\n       My name is Kim Koster. My husband, Dr. Barrett Koster, and \n     I have been married for more than seven years. We have known \n     since before we were married that we wanted very much to have \n     children.\n       To our joy, in November of 1996 we discovered that we were \n     expecting. The news was a thrill, to us and to our family and \n     friends. We were showered with gifts and hand-me-downs, new \n     toys, books and love. Barry's family gave us a 19th-century \n     cradle which had rocked his family to sleep since before his \n     grandmother Sophie was born more than 100 years ago.\n       Our first ultrasound was scheduled a little more than four \n     months into the pregnancy. On Thursday, February 20, we saw \n     our baby and spent five short minutes rejoicing in the new \n     life, and then the blow fell. The radiologist informed us \n     that he had ``significant concerns'' about the size of the \n     baby's head. His diagnosis was the fatal neural tube defect \n     known as anencephaly, or the lack of a brain. After four \n     months of excitement and joy, our world came crashing down \n     around us.\n       Once the diagnosis was made, there was no further medical \n     treatment available for me in our hometown, and we were \n     referred to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in \n     Iowa City. Our first OB appointment there was set for Monday \n     morning. My husband and I spent that long weekend, the \n     longest of our lives, doing research on anencephaly, talking \n     with family and friends, and hearing personal stories about \n     the fate of anencephalic babies.\n       In Iowa City, a genetics OB specialist examined a new \n     ultrasound and immediately confirmed the diagnosis. An alpha-\n     feto-protein blood test and amniotic fluid sample only drove \n     the truth harder home. Our fetus had only a rudimentary \n     brain. There were blood vessels, which enabled the heart to \n     beat, and ganglion, which enabled basic motor function. There \n     was no cerebellum and no cerebral cortext. There was no skull \n     above the eyes.\n       I had been preparing for pregnancy for more than a year \n     with diet, exercise and prenatal vitamins, including the dose \n     of folic recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Yet we \n     still lost our child to one of the most severe and lethal \n     birth defects known. Our baby had no brain--would never hear \n     the Mozart and Bach I played for it every day on our great-\n     grandmother's piano, would never look up into our eyes or \n     snuggle close to our hearts, would never even have an \n     awareness of its own life.\n       On Tuesday, February 25, 1997, my husband and I chose to \n     end my pregnancy with a common abortion procedure known as \n     ``D and E.'' As difficult as it was, I literally thank God \n     that I had that option. As long as there are families who \n     face the devastating diagnosis we received, abortions must \n     remain a safe and legal alternative.\n       In 1998, Barry and I discovered to our delight that I was \n     pregnant again. Although we were overjoyed, our happiness was \n     tempered by the knowledge that we had a 1-in-25 chance of a \n     second anencephalic pregnancy. This time, we asked our loved \n     ones to hold off on the baby gifts, we played no Bach, and \n     every week was a mix of excitement and unavoidable worry. And \n     on July 17, 1998, an ultrasound revealed the worst. We had a \n     second anencephalic pregnancy--a second daughter lost to this \n     lethal birth defect.\n\n[[Page S12890]]\n\n       Fortunately for my medical care, the so-called ``partial \n     birth abortion'' bans have been vetoed by President Clinton, \n     and my doctors were able to provide me with a safe, \n     compassionate procedure that brought this second tragic \n     pregnancy to an end. And thanks to those doctors and their \n     ability to give me that care, my recovery has been rapid--\n     enabling Barry and I to plan to try again.\n       But if this bill becomes law, we would not be able to do \n     so. For the chances of our having a third anencephalic \n     pregnancy are all the way up to 1 in 4, and this bill would \n     ban any procedures that would help us. It would force me to \n     carry another doomed child through all nine months. That idea \n     is far more horrifying than all the unreal anti-choice \n     rhetoric that can be manufactured, for the reality is that \n     this is a terrible law, a grievous interference between \n     doctor and patient, and would only compound the tragedy and \n     heartache faced by families like us.\n       Please protect the health of women and families like mine, \n     and reject S. 1692.\n\n  There is nothing one can add to that. S. 1692 would say that the Kim \nKosters in families across the country that we legislators--I am not a \ndoctor, I am not a theologian, I am not a psychiatrist or a \npsychologist; but the bill proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwould say that we know more than all of them, that we stand in the \njudgment seat of the Mrs. Kosters: We are going to decide for you.\n  Attorneys? I am an attorney. Maybe some of us are teachers, I don't \nknow. Maybe some are social workers or business people. There are a \nvariety of different people here on the floor of the Senate. But \nsomehow we get to tell you: Mrs. Koster, you and your husband have no \nright to decide. We are going to do it for you. Our decision is, no \nmatter what--even under these terrible circumstances--you are going to \nhave to carry that to term and bear the consequences of that. Maybe \nthere are some in this body who want to sit in that kind of judgment \nseat. Count me out. Count me out. I leave these decisions to Kim and \nher husband, to her doctor, to her own faith, to her own religion to \nmake those very profound, anxiety-producing, soul-wrenching decisions. \nThat is why I have fought for this amendment--to state loudly and \nclearly that Roe v. Wade gave women that right and we don't want it \noverturned.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend hold the floor for a moment \nso I may ask him a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield the floor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question. I didn't realize. I apologize.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  I say to my friend that I thank him for sharing the story on the \nfloor of the Senate. He has the photo of Kim and her husband up there. \nHe read the story into the Record. I think it is very appropriate that \nthe Senator from Iowa do so because this is a couple whom he knows.\n  I am, in a way, happy that my friend was not on the floor when the \nSenator from Pennsylvania used some very tough words in talking about \nthis procedure and calling doctors who perform it executioners.\n  I say to my friend, in light of the poignant story he read to us, \nwhen he thinks of the doctor who helped this couple through a \ntraumatic, horrific experience twice, what are his feelings about the \ndoctor who performed that particular procedure?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry if someone referred to them as executioners. \nThat, I think, is totally inappropriate and inflammatory and could lead \nto tragic consequences in our country.\n  I don't know the doctors who helped Kim Koster. But from talking to \nher, they were sensitive. They are doctors who wanted Kim and her \nhusband to know every facet of what was happening and wanted them to \nmake their own decision. They are doctors who have a lot of compassion \nand professionalism and, under the legal framework, were able to help \nthis couple get through a very bad time and enabled them to move on \nwith their lives and to plan on another child.\n  If that had not been there--if we had taken Roe v. Wade away or if we \nhad adopted S. 1692--I don't know what would have happened to Kim \nKoster and her husband or whether they would be here today planning to \ntry again to raise a family.\n  I say to my colleague from California that I believe Kim Koster is an \nextremely brave individual. In fact, I would say to anyone who wants to \ntalk to her about what happened to her, she is out in the reception \nroom right now. She would be glad to tell them why it is important to \nnot only adhere to Roe v. Wade but to defeat S. 1692 that would have \ntaken away her reproductive rights and under very tragic circumstances.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my friend a final question. Will my \nfriend be willing to read one more time, if he can find it, the \nstatement that was made by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, all \nJustices appointed under a Republican President, when they made their \nstatement on Casey because I really hope colleagues will listen to \nthis. I think if they listen to it, they will vote for my friend's \namendment to reaffirm Roe v. Wade and will also be against the Santorum \nunderlying bill.\n  If my friend would repeat that, I would greatly appreciate it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from California because I believe this \nstatement by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is really aimed at \nus. They are aiming it at legislators who somehow sit in judgment--\nlegislators who would put themselves in the position of defining for \nwomen what their reproductive rights are. Here is the quote:\n\n       At the heart of liberty--\n\n  At the heart of liberty--\n\n     is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of \n     meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. \n     Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes \n     of personhood were they formed under the compulsion of the \n     state.\n\n  That is the quote. I believe it is directed at us.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how long people want to talk on this. I \nknow the day is getting late. I ask unanimous consent that we have 30 \nminutes equally divided before we have an up-or-down vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 60 \nminutes equally divided before a vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to work out--reserving the right to \nobject--a time arrangement once people on our side want to proceed. But \nat this point I have to object. We would be happy to work something \nout. Right now, I just can't do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am not going to debate the Harkin amendment. The Harkin amendment \nhas nothing to do with the bill that is before us. The bill that is \nbefore us, as I have said over and over again, and I will say it again, \nis not about Roe v. Wade. One of the reasons we believe this bill is \ngetting bipartisan support, as well as supporters on both sides of the \nabortion issue, is that it is outside the realm of Roe v. Wade.\n  I remind everyone that this is a baby in the process of being born. \nThis is a baby who is almost outside of the mother except for 3 inches.\n  Again, I repeat that in Roe v. Wade, the original decision, which the \nSenator from Iowa was referring to, the Court let stand a Texas law \nthat said you cannot kill a baby in the process of being born.\n  Again, we can have a vote on this. But we might as well be having a \nvote or another vote on the chemical weapons treaty. It is as related. \nThis is not the subject. It is a completely different subject. If they \nwant to have a vote on it, obviously the Senator has the right to offer \nan amendment. That is within the rights here in the Senate, and I \ncertainly will stand by his right to offer that.\n  But to suggest somehow that the underlying bill is an assault on Roe \nv. Wade is again proof positive that when it comes to the real factual \ndebate on what this procedure does, the response is: Well, let's change \nthe subject.\n  I don't want to change the subject. Let's focus in on the facts. The \nfacts are not anecdotes from people who aren't physicians about what \nhappened to them. What happened in these cases you see and the pictures \nyou see--I always believe, if you argue the facts, argue the facts; if \nyou can't argue the facts, argue the law; if you can't argue the law, \nthen appeal to the sentimentality or emotion of the situation.\n\n[[Page S12891]]\n\n  That is what this is. These are horrible situations, tragic \nsituations, of pregnancies that have gone awry late in pregnancy. I \nsympathize with these people more than you know, to have something such \nas this happen for a child that you want desperately. I know the \ndifficult decisions they have to make. I know what doctors tell you and \nhow they influence your decision.\n  But the fact of the matter is, we can't in a legislative forum \ndealing with such an important issue deal with emotional stories as \npowerful as they are unless we look at the facts underlying those \nstories. The facts underlying those stories are very clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth--fact--about two cases \ndiscussed by the Senator from Illinois where they talk about how this \nwas the only option available, or this saved our life, or our future \nfertility, et cetera. Again, letters from this Physicians' Ad Hoc \nCoalition for Truth. One is from Pamela Smith, a director of medical \neducation of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mount Sinai \nMedical Center in Chicago, about the case of Vicki Stella and the case \nof Coreen Costello, another letter from the Physicians' Ad Hoc \nCoalition for Truth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Physicians' Ad Hoc\n\n\n                                          Coalition for Truth,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 23, 1996.\n       Dear Member of Congress: My name is Dr. Pamela E. Smith. I \n     am a founding member of PHACT (Physicians' Ad-hoc Coalition \n     for Truth). This coalition of over three hundred medical \n     providers nationwide (which is open to everyone, irrespective \n     of their political stance on abortion) was specifically \n     formed to educate the public, as well as those involved in \n     government, in regards to disseminating medical facts as they \n     relate to the Partial-Birth Abortion procedure.\n       In this regard, it has come to my attention that an \n     individual (Ms. Vicki Stella, a diabetic) who underwent this \n     procedure, who is not medically trained, has appeared on \n     television and in Roll Call proclaiming that it was necessary \n     for her to have this particular form of abortion to enable \n     her to bear children in the future. In response to these \n     claims I would invite you to note the following:\n       1. Although Ms. Stella proclaims this procedure was the \n     only thing that could be done to preserve her fertility,the \n     fact of the matter is that the standard of care that is used \n     by medical personnel to terminate a pregnancy in its later \n     stages does not include partial-birth abortion. Cesarean \n     section, inducing labor with pitocin or protoglandins, or (if \n     the baby has excess fluid in the head as I believe was the \n     case with Ms. Stella) draining the fluid from the baby's head \n     to allow a normal delivery are all techniques taught and used \n     by obstetrical providers throughout this country. These are \n     techniques for which we have safety statistics in regards to \n     their impact on the health of both the woman and the child. \n     In contrast, there are no safety statistics on partial-birth \n     abortion, no reference of this technique on the national \n     library of medicine database, and no long term studies \n     published that prove it does not negatively affect a woman's \n     capability of successfully carrying a pregnancy to term in \n     the future. Ms. Stella may have been told this procedure was \n     necessary and safe, but she was sorely misinformed.\n       2. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that tends to \n     get worse over time and that predisposes individuals to \n     infections that can be harder to treat. If Ms. Stella was \n     advised to have an abortion most likely this was secondary to \n     the fact that her child was diagnosed with conditions that \n     were incompatible with life. The fact that Ms. Stella is a \n     diabetic, coupled with the fact that diabetics are prone to \n     infection and the partial-birth abortion procedure requires \n     manipulating a normally contaminated vagina over a course of \n     three days (a technique that invites infection) medically I \n     would contend of all the abortion techniques currently \n     available to her this was the worse one that could have been \n     recommended for her. The others are quicker, cheaper and do \n     not place a diabetic at such extreme risks for life-\n     threatening infections.\n       3. Partial-birth abortion is, in fact, a public health \n     hazard in regards to women's health in that one employs \n     techniques that have been demonstrated in the scientific \n     literature to place women at increased risks for uterine \n     rupture, infection, hemorrhage, inability to carry \n     pregnancies to term in the future and material death. Such \n     risks have even been acknowledged by abortion providers such \n     as Dr. Warren Hern.\n       4. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, \n     recently stated in the AMA News that he believes that people, \n     including the President, have been misled as to ``fact and \n     fiction'' in regards to third trimester pregnancy \n     terminations. He said, and I quote, ``in no way can I twist \n     my mind to see that the late term abortion described . . . is \n     a medical necessity for the mother . . . I am opposed to \n     partial-birth abortions.'' He later went on to describe a \n     baby that he operated on who had some of the anomalies that \n     babies of women who have partial-birth abortions had. His \n     particular patient, however, went on to become the head nurse \n     in his intensive care unit years later!\n       I realize that abortion continues to be an extremely \n     divisive issue in our society. However, when considering \n     public policy on such a matter that indeed has medical \n     dimensions, it is of the utmost importance that decisions are \n     based on facts as well as emotions and feelings. Banning this \n     dangerous technique will not infringe on a woman's ability to \n     obtain an abortion in the early stage of pregnancy or if a \n     pregnancy truly needs to be ended to preserve the life or \n     health of the mother. What a ban will do is insure that women \n     will not have their lives jeopardized when they seek an \n     abortion procedure.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Pamela Smith, M.D.,\n         Director of Medical Education, Department of Obstetrics \n           and Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Chicago, IL, \n           Member, Association of Professors of Obstetrics and \n           Gynecology.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n the case of coreen costello--partial-birth abortion was not a medical \nnecessity for the most visible ``personal case'' proponent of procedure\n\n       Coreen Costello is one of five women who appeared with \n     President Clinton when he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act (4/10/96). She has probably been the most active and \n     the most visible of those women who have chosen to share with \n     the public the very tragic circumstances of their pregnancies \n     which, they say, made the partial-birth abortion procedure \n     their only medical option to protect their health and future \n     fertility.\n       But based on what Ms. Costello has publicly said so far, \n     her abortion was not, in fact, medically necessary.\n       In addition to appearing with the President at the veto \n     ceremony, Ms. Costello has twice recounted her story in \n     testimony before both the House and Senate; the New York \n     Times published an op-ed by Ms. Costello based on this \n     testimony; she was featured in a full page ad in the \n     Washington Post sponsored by several abortion advocacy \n     groups; and, most recently (7/9/96) she has recounted her \n     story for a ``Dear Colleague'' letter being circulated to \n     House members by Rep. Peter Deutsch (FL).\n       Unless she were to decide otherwise, Ms. Costello's full \n     medical records remain, of course, unavailable to the public, \n     being a matter between her and her doctors. However, Ms. \n     Costello has voluntarily chosen to share significant parts of \n     her very tragic story with the general public and in very \n     highly visible venues. Based on what Ms. Costello has \n     revealed of the medical history--of her own record and for \n     the stated purpose of defeating the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act--doctors with PHACT can only conclude that Ms. \n     Costello and others who have publicly acknowledged undergoing \n     this procedure ``are honest women who were sadly misinformed \n     and whose decision to have a partial-birth abortion was based \n     on a great deal of misinformation'' (Dr. Joseph DeCook, Ob/\n     Gyn, PHACT Congressional Briefing, 7/4/96). Ms. Costello's \n     experience does not change the reality that a partial birth \n     abortion is never medically indicated--in fact, there are \n     available several alternative, standard medical procedures to \n     treat women confronting unfortunate situations like Ms. \n     Costello had to face.\n       The following analysis is based on Ms. Costello's public \n     statements regarding events leading up to her abortion \n     performed by the late Dr. James McMahon. This analysis was \n     done by Dr. Curtis Cook, a perinatologist with the Michigan \n     State College of Human Medicine and member of PHACT.\n       ``Ms. Costello's child suffered from at least two \n     conditions: `polyhydramnios secondary to abnormal fetal \n     swallowing,' and `hydrocephalus'. In the first, the child \n     could not swallow the amniotic fluid, and an excess of the \n     fluid therefore collected in the mother's uterus. The second \n     condition, hydrocephalus, is one that causes an excessive \n     amount of fluid to accumulate in the fetal head. Because of \n     the swallowing defect, the child's lungs were not properly \n     stimulated, and an underdevelopment of the lungs would likely \n     be the cause of death if abortion had not intervened. The \n     child had no significant chance of survival, but also would \n     not likely die as soon as the umbilical cord was cut.\n       The usual treatment for removing the large amount of fluid \n     in the uterus is a procedure called amniocentesis. The usual \n     treatment for draining excess fluid from the fetal head is a \n     procedure called cephalocentesis. In both cases the excess \n     fluid is drained by using a thin needle that can be placed \n     inside the womb through the abdomen (``transabdominally''--\n     the preferred route) or through the vagina \n     (``transvaginally.'') The transvaginal approach however, as \n     performed by Dr. McMahon on Ms. Costello, puts the woman at \n     an increased risk of infection because of the non-sterile \n     environment of the vagina. Dr. McMahon used this approach \n     most likely because he had no significant expertise in \n     obstetrics and gynecology. In other words, he may not have \n     been able to do it well\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n\n     transabdominally--the standard method used by ob/gyns--\n     because that takes a degree of expertise he did not possess. \n     After the fluid has been drained, and the head decreased in \n     size, labor would be induced and attempts made to deliver the \n     child vaginally.\n       Ms. Costello's statement that she was unable to have a \n     vaginal delivery, or, as she called it, `natural birth or an \n     induced labor,' is contradicted by the fact that she did \n     indeed have a vaginal delivery, conducted by Dr. McMahon. \n     What Ms. Costello had was a breech vaginal delivery for \n     purposes of aborting the child, however, as opposed to a \n     vaginal delivery intended to result in a live birth. A \n     cesarean section in this case would not be medically \n     indicated--not because of any inherent danger--but because \n     the baby could be safely delivered vaginally.''\n       Given these medical realities, the partial-birth abortion \n     procedure can in no way be considered the standard, medically \n     necessary or appropriate procedure appropriate to address the \n     medical complications described by Ms. Costello or any of the \n     other women who were tragically misled into believing they \n     had no other options.''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. They clearly state this was not medically necessary; \nthis, in fact, was not in the best interests of the patient in this \ncase; and this was, in fact, not good medicine.\n  Did it have a good result? Yes, it did in the sense the health of the \nwomen was not jeopardized. That does not mean there is a good result. \nIt was the best practice. A lot of things are done that turn out OK \nthat may not have been the best thing to do. I think that is what we \nare saying. More importantly, it is not medically necessary. In fact, \nit is medically more dangerous.\n  A group that said it ``may be'' necessary, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, 3 years ago said: Clearly, it is not \nthe only option. The proponents of partial-birth abortion are saying it \nis medically necessary. They want to keep this option open. If they \ndon't, it is a violation of Roe v. Wade.\n  They stand behind anecdotes. In some cases, including the Viki Wilson \ncase that Senator Durbin brought up, it is clear from her testimony she \ndid not have a partial-birth abortion. She says in her testimony the \nbaby was dead inside of her womb and then the baby was delivered. If \nthe baby dies inside the womb, it is outside the definition of the \nbill. The definition of the bill says a living baby is born. The baby \nwas not living.\n  I don't want to pick apart the very tragic stories and make a very \ndifficult situation even more difficult for these people because I \nunderstand the pain they have gone through. Our job is to not be \nclouded by personal anguish and tragic circumstances. Ours is to look \nat the underlying facts of what happened and what can happen in the \nfuture.\n  Again, we have over 600 obstetricians and gynecologists, specialists \nin perinatology, who say this is never medically necessary. The AMA \nsays it is never medically necessary and is bad medicine. It is not a \npeer review procedure. It is not in the medical textbook. It is not \ntaught in medical schools. It is not performed in hospitals. It is only \nperformed at abortion clinics. Again, this is a rogue procedure.\n  They present case after case, as if this is some wonderful creation \nof medical science by some genius in obstetrics. I remind Members the \nperson who created this procedure is not an obstetrician, much less a \nspecialist in perinatology or difficult pregnancies. It is a family \npractitioner who only does abortions.\n  Again, I stress over and over again what seems to be the \ncompassionate argument is a smokescreen. It is a smokescreen. It is not \ntrue. There is no compassion in allowing a procedure that is dangerous \nto the health of the woman to be continued any more than it is \ncompassionate to prescribe any kind of medical treatment that is \ninappropriate. We have an overwhelming body of evidence saying it is \nbad medicine; it is inappropriate.\n  On the other side we have two things: One, stories, stories that \nturned out OK. In other words, the procedure was used--not in all \ncases; sometimes some of the people brought up in stories actually \ndidn't have the procedure, and even those who did may have resulted in \na good outcome--but it wasn't the proper course according to the \noverwhelming body of evidence.\n  The only thing counter, as far as factual comments by physicians, is \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The pillar \nupon which they rest the health-of-the-mother exception, the select \npanel they put together says they:\n\n       . . . could identify no circumstances under which this \n     procedure would be the only option to save the life or \n     preserve the health of the woman.\n\n  It is not the only option. It is not the only option.\n  From the Wisconsin case that upheld the Wisconsin statute, quoting \nthe judges:\n  Haskell, who invented the procedure, admitted that the D procedure \nis never medically necessary to save the life or preserve the health of \nthe woman.\n  We have the person who invented it saying it is not medically \nnecessary.\n  ACOG goes further and talks about whether it is preferable in some \ncases. Here is what they say:\n\n       An intact D [partial-birth abortion] however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make \n     this decision.\n\n  We have asked them to identify one of these circumstances. Give an \nexample. They cannot say this may be the best thing for the health and \nlife of the mother, may be preferable, and yet give no situation which \ncan be reviewed by the medical community. That is what we have to base \nthe judgment on. The medical community is saying it is necessary to \nprotect the health of the mother. Yet they give no example, give no \nexample as to when this, in fact, would be preferable.\n  We have a thorough smokescreen, anecdotes with many of the cases \nhaving nothing to do with partial-birth abortions; those that did, \nargued by hundreds of physicians as being bad practice of medicine, \nwere an improper course of conduct. Then we have the only scientific \ngroup that says it is never medically necessary, never the only option, \nonly that it ``may be'' the best thing. Yet they give no example and \nafter repeated inquiry are still giving no examples.\n  Again, we come back to the health question. There is a dearth of \nevidence to support the position.\n  I am hopeful the Senator from Iowa can debate his amendment, saying \nsomehow this is important vis-a-vis Roe v. Wade. I argue the opposite. \nThis legislation has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade. I think when we \nare looking at specific amendments to deal with that issue, the \nconstitutional issue of vagueness--again, that is not necessarily a Roe \nv. Wade issue, although it gets into the issue of undue burden. From my \npoint of view, if we can tailor that definition narrowly to make sure \nwe are talking about partial-birth abortion, it leaves open other \nmethods of abortion to be used. It gets to the counterargument some \nhave suggested, that all we are doing is trying to outlaw abortion, \ntrying to restrict a woman's right.\n  No. All we are doing is, for gosh sakes, drawing a line about who is \nprotected. When a baby is 3 inches from being completely born, that is \ntoo close. That is too close. We are going to get into a whole lot of \nissues when we start drawing lines. In fact, we have gotten into a lot \nof issues with respect to drawing the line. Now we are talking about \nassisted suicide. We talk about quality of life instead of life itself.\n  As the Senator from California said, we want everyone to be wanted. \nWhat if everyone isn't wanted? Is that license to get rid of them? It \ncertainly is if you are in the womb. Now we are suggesting it certainly \nis if you are just outside the womb; it certainly is if you are within \n3 inches of being born. If you are not wanted, too bad. If we draw the \nline that close, it is not a very long way to go to get where our new \ntheologian at Princeton University, Dr. Singer, is coming from. He \nsuggested that it is, in fact, the moral thing to do; that once the \nbaby is born, if we don't like it, to kill it.\n  One might suggest this is outrageous; this could never happen in \nAmerica. This is a professor at Princeton, whose works, unfortunately, \nhave been published in the popular press and hundreds of thousands of \ncopies of this radical--I would consider it radical but on this floor \nmaybe it is not radical. Maybe killing a baby after it is born, if it \nis not a healthy baby, is not a radical thing anymore. Certainly \nkilling a\n\n[[Page S12893]]\n\nbaby who is 3 inches from being born is not a radical thing anymore, so \nI don't know where 3 inches--maybe that does not make any difference. \nIf you do not like what you have, then you can sort of exchange it.\n\n  But that is where we are. Someone suggests: Senator, this is \noutrageous. How can you make the comment that once a baby is born you \ncan kill it?\n  I am not making that argument. But Dr. Singer is, and there are those \nwho follow him. There will be judges who follow him. There will be \njudges who say the mother was distraught and she killed her baby, but \nit is sort of normal. If the baby was not perfect, it is probably \nbetter--we are probably all better off.\n  But what is the rationale given for partial-birth abortion, as \nextreme as that sounds, that Dr. Singer is proposing? What is the \nrationale for partial-birth abortion? Why do we need to keep it legal? \nBecause we have pregnancies that have gone awry and these babies, they \nare not perfect. They might not live long. They may have cleft palate--\nin fact, yes, many partial-birth abortions were performed because the \nbabies had cleft palate and mom and dad just didn't want the baby \nbecause it was not perfect.\n  So we have gotten to the point where the defenders of partial-birth \nabortion are defending it on the basis that things go bad in pregnancy \nand these children just do not deserve our protection because they are \nnot normal like you and me. They should be given less rights. Because \nof their imperfections, they should be allowed--why would you bring a \nbaby into this world who is going to die? Kill it first before it has a \nchance to die. That is the argument. It sounds rough. Let's cut to the \nchase. That is exactly what they are saying.\n  All we are suggesting is, first off, we do not stop you from doing \nthat. This bill does not stop anyone who wants to have a late-term \nabortion from having it. If you want to have a late-term abortion, you \ncan have a late-term abortion if this bill we propose passes. All we \nsay is, don't have the baby outside the mother, don't have the baby 3 \ninches away from the protection of the Constitution, and then brutally \nexecute the baby. That is just too close. That creates this nebulous \narea that the Dr. Singers of this world will gladly fill in. Because if \nwe say 3 inches, then why not 3 inches later? What is the big deal? If \nthe baby is not wanted, the baby is not wanted.\n  Many listening to this will say that is a ridiculous argument. There \nis no such slippery slope. Although, by the way, the people who oppose \nthese often themselves provide a slippery slope argument. Certainly \nthey do here. They say, if you restrict this right in abortion, it is a \nslippery slope; we are going to get rid of Roe v. Wade completely. That \nis why we have this amendment, to get at the Roe v. Wade amendment, to \nmake sure we are not providing the slippery slope. Fine. Let's have a \nRoe v. Wade amendment to show we don't have a slippery slope. No \nproblem. Let's have a vote.\n  But allowing a baby who is almost born to be killed, that is not a \nslippery slope? The Senator from California--we were talking about what \nif the foot or the leg were the part not born, would it be OK to kill \nthe baby? I have the transcript, by the way. I asked that question. I \nwill read it:\n\n       What you are suggesting--\n\n  This is me talking.\n\n       What you are suggesting is if the baby's toe is inside the \n     mother you can, in fact, kill that baby.\n       Mrs. Boxer. Absolutely not.\n\n  So she said if the toe or foot is inside the baby, you can't kill the \nbaby. But if the head is, you can. No slippery slope there, is there? \nNo problems with a bright line there, is there?\n  We are headed down a very dangerous path if we start differentiating \nbetween what body part is outside the mother and what is inside the \nmother, as to whether an abortion is legal or not. The reason we have \ntrouble differentiating is because this is not about abortion. This is \nabout killing a baby. It is in the process of being born that under Roe \nv. Wade was protected. The Texas law was not stricken under Roe v. Wade \nthat said you couldn't kill a baby in the process of being born.\n  Under Roe v. Wade, the seminal decision of the right of privacy, even \nthat Court understood that once the baby is in the process of being \nborn you should not be able to kill it. That is what we are saying. We \nare not restricting the right of Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade ruled on this \nby not striking that law down.\n  So fine, we are going to have a vote on Roe v. Wade. Fine, have a \nvote on Roe v. Wade. But this is not about Roe v. Wade. This is about \ninfanticide. A lot of folks want to try to change the subject. They \nwant to talk about these difficult cases.\n  Again, there is no one in this Chamber who sympathizes as much with \nthese men and women, mothers and fathers, who dealt with a pregnancy \ngone awry. It is incredibly painful to have that hit your family. I \nhesitate to talk about it because I know how painful it is to revisit \nthem. But they have brought their situation into the public square to \nprove a point. The problem is, it does not prove the point.\n  Again and again there is no medical reason. It is never medically \nnecessary to do this procedure. So I hope we can get to the facts, that \nwe can stay away from anecdotes that are inapplicable or not relevant; \nand we can get to, hopefully, from the other side, a factual discussion \nas to when this is medically necessary. Once I would like to see a \npeer-reviewed document where everyone examined the case and someone \nwill say: You know what, there is a situation where this is medically \nnecessary, where no other option is as safe or safer.\n  To date, that has not occurred. Let me underline that. To date, no \nsuch evidence has ever been put before the Senate.\n  Yet there are people who will stand here and say, ``We need it, we \nneed it to protect the health of the mother,'' when there is not a \nshred of evidence, not a shred of evidence before the Senate, these \nstories aside. There is not a shred of evidence that suggests these \nstories, or all the other instances that have been brought up, were the \nmost safe or there were not things as safe that could be used in place \nof a procedure that is infanticide. What we are hoping is we can get to \nthat discussion.\n  I understand the process now; we want to play some games on Roe v. \nWade. But that is not the issue before us. I cannot reiterate that \nenough. The issue before us is should this procedure remain legal. And \nit should be overturned. It should not remain legal.\n  It does not surprise me we are seeing smokescreens. This is the Roe \nv. Wade smokescreen. We have the anecdote smokescreen. We can get the \ncharts up about the previous attempts by supporters of this procedure. \nThey have tried case after case to misinform the Senate. The advocates \nof this legislation, the abortion rights groups, have deliberately--and \nthis is according to their own people now who have come clean--\ndeliberately misled the Congress, deliberately lied, as Ron \nFitzsimmons, who is a lobbyist for a great number, if not all, of the \nabortion clinics in America, said that he lied through his teeth and \nthat the industry lied through their teeth.\n\n  Now after lie after lie--and I will go through all the lies--after \nlie after lie, they now are going to come up with new stories and say: \nWell, no, believe us now; OK, yes, we may have lied to you before, but \nbelieve us, health is really an issue.\n  There is not one shred of substantive evidence to support that \nclaim--not one shred of substantive evidence. And yet, a group of \npeople that has come to the Congress in opposition to this bill, they \nhave lied in at least six cases, and, after those, we are now supposed \nto believe them when they have no evidence to support what they are \nasserting.\n  What are they? The National Abortion Federation called illustrations \nof the partial-birth abortion procedure ``highly imaginative and \nartistically designed, but with little relationship to the truth or to \nmedicine.''\n  You heard the Senator from California talk about the cartoons that \nshowed how a partial-birth abortion is done, and proponents of the \nprocedure argued early on: These are cartoons; they are not factual; \nthey have nothing to do with how the procedure actually works, until \nDr. Haskell publicly described this procedure at the National Abortion \nFederation meeting on September 1992. Dr. Haskell told the AMA News the \ndrawings depicting partial-birth abortion were accurate ``from a \ntechnical point of view.'' Strike 1.\n  Argument 1: This does not occur; this thing is not factually correct; \nthis is\n\n[[Page S12894]]\n\nnot how partial-birth abortions are done; you are wrong. Strike 1.\n  By the way, they went even farther than that. Many of them argued \nthis did not exist. First they said this is just a cartoon, these \nthings do not happen at all, much less the drawings, but Dr. Haskell \nstraightened them out.\n  Believe it or not, people actually came to committee meetings in the \nCapitol and suggested the anesthesia that is given to the woman during \nthis procedure ensures the fetus feels no pain; in other words, it \npasses through and assures us the fetus does not feel any pain during \nthis procedure.\n  Again, this is Dr. James McMahon, who is one of the originators of \nthis procedure:\n\n       The fetus feels no pain through the entire series of the \n     procedures. This is because the mother is given narcotic \n     analgesia at a dose based upon her weight. The narcotic is \n     passed, via the placenta, directly into the fetal \n     bloodstream. Due to the enormous weight difference, a medical \n     coma is induced in the fetus. There is a neurological fetal \n     demise. There is never a live birth.\n\n  That was testimony before Congress under oath. When this happened, \nthe American Society of Anesthesiologists went bananas. Why? Again, \nhaving gone through six births, one of the options available to women \nduring childbirth is to receive a narcotic to help with the pain. Women \nwere justifiably very nervous about receiving a narcotic for pain that \nwould kill their baby. One of the pain management procedures during \nchildbirth is, in fact, the giving of a pain killer, a narcotic.\n\n  Immediately we got response from them and this letter later on:\n\n       In my medical judgment, it would be necessary in order to \n     achieve neurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth \n     abortion to anesthetize the mother to such a degree as to \n     place her own health in serious jeopardy.\n\n  The community of experts responded saying this is not true; you would \nhave to give so much in the way of narcotics, you could jeopardize the \nlife of the mother, which is certainly something I am sure no one on \neither side would like to do.\n  Lie No. 2: The baby does not feel any pain. The fact is that after 20 \nweeks, babies have developed nervous systems; they feel pain. In fact, \nsome have suggested because their nervous system is, in fact, not in a \nfull developmental state, they feel increased pain as a result of this \nprocedure. As described by Nurse Brenda Shafer when she witnessed a \npartial-birth abortion, when that scissor was plunged into the base of \nthe skull, when those scissors were rammed into the base of that skull, \nthe baby's arms and legs shot out, similar to if you held a little baby \nand the baby thought it was going to fall; it would spasm out, and then \nthe baby's arms fell limp and legs fell limp.\n  Again, in October of 1995, during this period of time after McMahon's \ntestimony, ``the fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the \nmother intravenously.''\n  Again we have Dr. Haskell, who is another one of these abortion \nproviders--Dr. McMahon is one and Dr. Haskell; they are the two who do \nthe most in the country--who says: Let's talk about whether or not the \nfetus is dead beforehand.\n  Haskell says: No, it's not. No, it's really not.\n  That is pretty clear. Again, people fighting this bill are putting \ninformation out that is not true. Why? To try to get support for this \nposition.\n  Fourth: Partial-birth abortion is a rare procedure.\n  We had this debate the first time. We are in a very difficult \nsituation because we have to rely upon the information of the abortion \nindustry. When Senator Smith, who is here, argued this debate 4 years \nago, he had to deal with a deck that was stacked against him. He did \nnot have the information we have today.\n  The organizations out there were saying--there were just a couple \nhundred of these--it was very rare, only done on babies who were sick \nand mothers whose health was in jeopardy or life was in jeopardy, but \nthis was a very rare procedure.\n  This is the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, National \nOrganization of Women, Zero Population Growth, Population Action \nInternational, National Abortion Federation, and a whole list of other \norganizations that wrote to Congress saying:\n\n       This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer \n     than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the cases of \n     wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong, when a family \n     learns late in the pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies or a \n     medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or \n     health.\n\n  Lie. What is the truth? We have two sources outside of the industry. \nBy the way, we still do not know the truth. We do not know the truth \nbecause the folks who provide us with the statistics on partial-birth \nabortions are the very organizations that oppose the bill. How would \nyou like to go into a courtroom and argue with a set of facts that is \ngiven to you by your opponents? That is what we have to do here right \nnow.\n\n  Most of what we have to deal with certainly on this issue--the \nnumbers--we have to take from people who vehemently oppose this bill.\n  We have one source of independent judgment. Our crack news staff on \nthe Hill of which--let me look up in the news gallery: Gee, nobody is \nup there. Our crack news staff on the Hill, whom we have challenged \ntime and time again to get the facts, why don't you ask a few abortion \nclinics how many of these they do. A couple of people have. I know a \nreporter for the Baltimore Sun did. Do you know what the abortion \nclinics said in Baltimore? ``None of your business; none of your \nbusiness. We don't have to tell you.''\n  Maybe some other crack staff, who really, I am sure, in their heart \nof hearts, want to get down to the bottom of this because I know they \ncare deeply about this issue, will call around some of their \ncommunities and find out what the Bergen County Record did in New \nJersey.\n  What did they find out? That at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions \nare performed each year, three times the national rate at one clinic in \nnorthern New Jersey.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask the Senator if he is aware, during \nthe time a few years ago when I stood on the floor and debated this \nissue, as well, that there were a number of people who said this was \nonly happening a few times a year; some said as few as 15 or 20 times a \nyear; some said, well, maybe it happened a couple hundred times a year, \nthat it was the exception rather than the rule; it was usually when \nthere was an anomaly?\n  Is the Senator also aware, we began to receive testimony from inside \nthe abortion industry itself, which indicated--from those who had \nperformed them--that this, indeed, was not the case, that we found that \nin about 80 percent of the cases, if not more, the child was perfectly \nhealthy? So the idea that these were performed in only a few cases, \nwhen the child was in a so-called anomaly, if you will, is clearly \nuntrue.\n  I would also ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, is he aware that \nthere is numerous medical testimony, much medical testimony to the \neffect of how one partially delivers a child, and then restrains the \nchild from exiting the birth canal? And how does that, in fact, help \nthe safety, the health, or even to promote the life of the mother? Is \nthe Senator also aware that on numerous occasions doctors have said, it \ndoesn't?\n  As a matter of fact, I wondered if the Senator was aware that when \nPresident Clinton had several women down at the White House a short \ntime ago after one of these override votes that he is so good at, he \nalso indicated that these were people who had ``needed'' these for \ntheir own health. Then we found one particular case of a woman by the \nname of Claudia Ades, who appeared by telephone on a radio show in \nwhich she said during the course of the show: ``This procedure was not \nperformed in order to save my life. This procedure was totally \nelective. This is considered an elective procedure, as were the \nprocedures of all the other women who were at the White House veto \nceremony.''\n\n  So I think the Senator would probably agree with me that this was \norchestrated and used to promote this terrible procedure which, as the \nSenator has so eloquently described, is infanticide, is the killing of \nchildren.\n  And to think that somehow you are basically coming to the conclusion \nthat this is OK, based on the part of the child that is outside of the \nbirth\n\n[[Page S12895]]\n\ncanal. I did not hear whether the Senator pointed this out, but is the \nSenator aware that if you were to turn the child around, and the head \nwould exit first, that would be illegal under the law? That child could \nnot be killed in this way. Yet 90 percent of the child is still inside \nthe mother's body.\n  So it is an outrageous procedure. I want to compliment him for his \nleadership and look forward to joining him a little later on in the \ndebate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is someone who deserves a tremendous amount of \ncredit for his courage in coming to the floor 4 years ago, offering \nthis bill, fighting for this, and beginning the battle in the Senate. \nAnd he continues to be a stalwart supporter and someone who deserves a \nlot of credit for the movement that has occurred already.\n  I will finish my charts, and that is, again, getting back to where \nthis abortion procedure is ``rare.'' Ron Fitzsimmons on ``Nightline,'' \nin 1997, said that between 3,000 and 5,000 partial-birth abortions \ncould be performed annually. They say they didn't even know because, \nagain, they do not get reports--at least we are told they do not get \nreports as to how many of these late-term abortions are done in this \nmanner.\n  The Centers for Disease Control does not track the method of \nabortion. So we know 1,500 are done in one clinic. And the people at \nthat clinic said they have trained others to do it in New York City. So \nI hesitate to guess of the thousands upon thousands of living human \nbeings--living human beings--who are brutalized in this fashion, 3 \ninches away.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire just said, if that baby was born \nhead first, even though a smaller portion of the baby's body is out, I \nthink most people in this body would say: Well, you couldn't kill the \nbaby then.\n  Isn't that funny? Isn't that funny in the sense that we draw these \nartificial lines that don't exist? We would say, it depends on which \nway the baby exited the mother as to whether you could kill the baby or \nnot. Think about that. This is the bright line. This is the bright line \nthat we will never cross in our society as to who deserves the \nprotection of our Constitution or not. That is the issue, folks. That \nis the issue.\n  Who in this Senate Chamber, who within the sound of my voice is safe \nif that is the bright line? Who is safe from a group of Senators who \nthink they are being compassionate, who decide that maybe we are better \noff drawing the line somewhere else, maybe drawing the line that after \nthe baby is born, if the baby isn't what we want. As, again, Dr. \nSinger, a noted professor at Princeton University, now suggests, why \ndon't we draw the line afterwards?\n\n  There is not much difference, folks, is there? There really isn't. \nLet's get honest about this. What is the difference? It is just a \ncouple of inches. We will be back someday. If we keep this procedure \nlegal, we will be back someday. We will be back someday arguing whether \nthat 3 inches really means anything. It is an artificial line. That \nwill be the argument. Come on. ``What is the difference because it is 3 \ninches if the baby is really deformed? Let it die. Kill it. Put it out \nof its misery. This baby is going to die anyway.''\n  The arguments you are hearing this very day about children who are \nnot wanted because they are not perfect, in our eyes--I know whose eyes \nthey are very perfect in. In the eyes that matter most in this; they \nare perfect little children. But to those on the Senate floor who argue \nthat because of their imperfection we have to keep this legal, so we \ncan dispose of unwanted, imperfect children--3 inches from legal \nprotection--folks, when the issue is 3 inches, it might as well be 1 \ninch or half an inch and eventually it is no inches because the 3-inch \nline is the Maginot Line. It will be blown through at some point when \nit suits the majority of Americans that they do not want to be bothered \nwith this burden--with this burden. ``It would be better off for this \nchild,'' I am sure the argument will be, ``that we let this baby die or \nwe kill this baby. Why let it suffer?'' That is the argument now--3 \ninches from protection.\n  Oh, how those 3 inches will shrink; mark my word. This is not a far-\nout debate. It is the mainstream of political debate right now that we \ncan kill children 3 inches from birth because they are not perfect. \nThat is the argument. That is the mainstream of thought in America \nright now.\n  On the horizon, the Dr. Singers of this world will say: Why quibble \nover 3 inches? I remind you, step back in your mind, those of you who \nwere here on this Earth 40 years ago, and imagine--close your eyes and \nimagine--the Senate Chamber without television cameras, without the \nbright lights, without the microphones, and people on the Senate floor \ndebating whether it is OK to kill a child who is almost born. It would \nbe beyond anyone's possible comprehension that that could have occurred \nin Manhattan, much less Washington, DC, here in the Senate Chamber. But \nhere we are. Where will we go from here? The Senate can take a stand on \nthat. So far it hasn't in the numbers necessary, but we are working on \nit.\n\n  Lie No. 5: Partial birth abortion is used only to save the woman's \nlife and health and when the fetus is deformed.\n  Again, Ron Fitzsimmons said:\n\n       The procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives \n     were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.\n\n  That was 1995. Fast forward to 2 years later. Ron Fitzsimmons \nadmitted he lied through his teeth when he said the procedure was used \nrarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses \nwere damaged. Yet that is the debate you continue to hear on the floor \nof the Senate, case after case after case after case of this.\n  But what did Ron Fitzsimmons say:\n\n       What the abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge \n     [the people on this floor] is that the vast majority of these \n     abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy \n     fetuses and healthy mothers. The abortion rights folks know \n     it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably does \n     everyone else.\n\n  Would you please inform the rest of the Senate, Mr. Fitzsimmons, so \nthey can begin to discuss the facts of this case, not the smoke and the \nmirrors of this legislation. I guarantee my colleagues, we will have \nclouds and clouds of smoke hovering over this Chamber over the next 2 \ndays in an attempt to obfuscate what really is going on.\n  Lie No. 6: Partial-birth abortion protects a woman's health.\n\n       I understand the desire to eliminate the use of a procedure \n     that appears inhumane but to eliminate it without taking into \n     consideration the rare and tragic circumstances in which its \n     use may be necessary would be even more inhumane.\n\n  The argument that this protects a woman's health.\n  President Clinton, again, veto message of 1997:\n\n       H.R. 1122 does not contain an exception to the measure's \n     ban that will adequately protect the lives and health of a \n     small group of women in tragic circumstances who need an \n     abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy to avert \n     death or serious injury.\n\n  A, there is a provision in the bill that says life of the mother is \nan exception to the ban. Factually incorrect. There is a life of the \nmother exception. I think it is agreed on all sides that that is not \nnecessary because it would never be used, but we have a prohibition \nthere anyway.\n  Going to the truth:\n\n       The American Medical Association endorsed the Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act. The AMA stated that partial-birth abortion \n     is not medically indicated.\n\n  I have talked about hundreds of physicians, over 600 obstetricians, \nnot medically necessary.\n\n       The partial-birth abortion procedure, as described by \n     Martin Haskell [the nation's leading practitioner of the \n     procedure] and defined in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, \n     is never medically indicated and can itself pose serious \n     risks to the health and future fertility of women.\n\n  Over 600 obstetricians signed this, over 600, pro-life, pro-choice, \nsigned this.\n  Those are the facts. This attempt by those who oppose this bill to \nchange the subject to get to Roe v. Wade doesn't obscure those facts.\n  I will get back to that.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to commit the bill, and I send a \nmotion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] moves to \n     commit the bill to the HELP Committee with instructions to \n     report back forthwith.\n\n\n[[Page S12896]]\n\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2322 To The Instructions Of The Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \nmotion to commit with instructions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the Senator has the yeas and nays on the \nmotion, the amendment is not in order.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2322.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the instructions, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ROE V. WADE AND \n                   PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BANS.\n\n       Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wae (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973));\n       (2) no partial birth abortion ban shall apply to a partial-\n     birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother \n     whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or \n     injury.\n       Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       Partial birth abortions are horrific and gruesome \n     procedures that should be banned.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote \noccur on or in relation to the Santorum amendment No. 2322 and the \nDurbin amendment No. 2319 in 10 minutes, with the time between now and \nthen to be equally divided, and if the amendment is agreed to, it be \nconsidered as an amendment to the bill and the motion to commit be \nimmediately withdrawn.\n  I further ask consent that there be 2 hours total for debate equally \ndivided prior to a motion to table amendment No. 2321, with the \nminority time under the control of Senator Boxer, and the vote to occur \non or in relation to the amendment no later than 11 a.m. on Thursday, \nand the Boxer amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to without \nany intervening action.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, may I inquire of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania on my amendment whether or not it is a \nstraight up-or-down vote on the amendment or a motion to table.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is that the same situation in terms of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. They could be tabled under this unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may ask my friend to yield for a question, it \nappears to me that everyone is going to wind up tabling someone else's \namendment. So if he can make that clear, it would be helpful.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It does say ``on or in relation to'' the amendment, so \nthat means on the amendment or in relation, which is a tabling motion. \nIt is clear under the UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2319\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add two \nadditional cosponsors to my amendment No. 2319: Senator Blanche Lambert \nLincoln and Senator Chris Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and \nthe senior Senator from Maine to ban all late-term abortions, including \npartial-birth abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's \nlife or to protect her health from grievous physical harm.\n  Let me be clear from the outset. I am strongly opposed to all late-\nterm abortions, including partial-birth abortions. I agree they should \nbe banned. However, I also believe that an exception must be made for \nthose rare cases when it is necessary to save the life of the mother or \nto protect her physical health from grievous harm. Fortunately, late-\nterm abortions are extremely rare in my State where, according to the \nMaine Department of Human Services, just two late-term abortions have \nbeen performed in the last 16 years.\n  This debate should not be about one particular method of abortion \nbut, rather, about the larger question of under what circumstances \nshould late-term or postviability abortions be legally available. The \nsponsors of this amendment--and I am pleased to be a cosponsor--believe \nthat all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure used, should \nbe banned except in those rare cases where the life or the physical \nhealth of the mother is at serious risk.\n\n  In my view, Congress is ill equipped to make judgments on specific \nmedical procedures. As the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, which represents over 90 percent of OB/GYNs and which \nopposes the legislation introduced by the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nhas said:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.\n\n  Most of us have neither the training nor the experience to decide \nwhich procedure is most appropriate in a given case. These medically \ndifficult and highly personal decisions should be left for families to \nmake in consultation with their physicians and their clergy. The Maine \nMedical Association agrees with this assessment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that an April 1999 statement from the Maine Medical Association \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in its statement, the Maine Medical \nAssociation states that ``such a ban would deny a patient and her \nphysician the right to make medically appropriate decisions about the \nbest course for that patient's care. . . . The intervention of \nlegislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill \nadvised and dangerous.''\n  The MMA statement goes on to say:\n\n       . . . when serious fetal anomalies are discovered or a \n     pregnant woman develops a life or health-threatening medical \n     condition that makes continuation of the pregnancy dangerous, \n     abortion--\n\n  Unfortunately, I add--\n\n       may be medically necessary. In these cases, intact dilation \n     and evacuation procedures may provide substantial medical \n     benefits or, in fact, may be the only option. This procedure \n     may be safer than the alternatives . . . [may] reduce blood \n     loss, and reduce the potential for other complications.\n\n  That is what the experts are telling us. That is what the doctors are \ntelling us.\n  Our amendment goes far beyond, in many ways, what the Senator from \nPennsylvania is attempting to accomplish. His legislation would only \nprohibit one specific medical procedure. It will not prevent a single \nlate-term abortion. Let me emphasize that point. The partial-birth \nlegislation before us would not prevent a single late-term abortion. A \nphysician could simply use\n\n[[Page S12897]]\n\nanother, perhaps more dangerous, method to end the pregnancy.\n  By contrast, the Durbin-Snowe proposal would prohibit the abortion of \nany viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to \npreserve the life of the mother or to prevent grievous injury to her \nphysical health.\n  We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception in our \nbill to grievous injury to the mother's physical health. It would not \nallow late-term abortions to be performed simply because a woman is \ndepressed or feeling stressed or has some minor physical health problem \nbecause of pregnancy.\n  Moreover, we have included a very important second safeguard. The \ninitial opinion of the treating physician that the continuation of \npregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to \nher physical health must be confirmed by a second opinion from an \nindependent physician.\n  This second opinion must come from an independent physician who will \nnot be involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved \nin the treatment of the mother. This second physician must also \ncertify--in writing--that, in his or her medical judgment, the \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk \ngrievous injury to her physical health.\n  What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable \nthreats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or \naggravated by pregnancy.\n  Let me give you a few examples: Primary pulmonary hypertension, which \ncan cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe \npregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver \nfailure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or \nblindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as \nleukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n  These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical \nliterature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these \nextremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two \nphysicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous \nphysical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult \ndecisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, \nfamilies, and physicians involved.\n  The Durbin-Snowe-Collins amendment is a fair and compassionate \ncompromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all \nlate-term abortions--including partial-birth abortions--are strictly \nlimited to those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical \nhealth of the mother is in serious jeopardy. This amendment presents an \nunusual opportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' advocates \nto work together on a reasonable approach, and I urge our colleagues to \njoin us in supporting it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       The Maine Medical Association takes no position on the \n     moral or ethical issue of abortion. Our membership includes \n     individuals who are ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life.''\n       Still, abortion currently is a legal medical procedure in \n     the United States. Accordingly, the Maine Medical Association \n     opposes any legislation proposed to ban any legal medical \n     procedure whether that be abortion, ``intact dilation and \n     extraction'' (partial birth abortion), or another medical \n     procedure. Such a ban would deny a patient and her physician \n     the right to make medical-appropriate decisions about the \n     best course for that patient's care. The determination of the \n     medical need for and effectiveness of a particular medical \n     procedure must be left to the patient and her physician \n     acting in conformity with standards of good medical care.\n       In addition, imposing civil or criminal sanctions on \n     physicians who perform abortions would have a chilling effect \n     on physicians' willingness to perform legal abortions. Doing \n     so would limit patients' access to safe abortions. The Maine \n     Medical Association opposes such efforts to ``criminialize'' \n     the practice of medicine.\n       An abortion performed in the second or third trimester or \n     after viability is extremely difficult for everyone involved. \n     The Maine Medical Association does not support elective \n     abortions in the last stage of pregnancy. However, when \n     serious fetal anomalies are discovered or the pregnant woman \n     develops a life or health-threatening medical condition that \n     makes continuation of the pregnancy dangerous, abortion may \n     be medically necessary. In these cases, intact dilation and \n     evacuation procedures may provide substantial medical \n     benefits or, in fact, may be the only option. This procedure \n     may be safer than the alternatives, maintain uterine \n     integrity, reduce blood loss, and reduce the potential for \n     other complications. Also, this procedure permits the \n     performance of a careful autopsy and, therefore, a more \n     accurate diagnosis of a fetal anomaly. This would permit \n     women who wish to have additional children to receive \n     appropriate genetic counseling and better prenatal care and \n     testing in future pregnancies. The intact dilation and \n     extraction procedure may be the most medically appropriate \n     procedure for a woman in a particular case.\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decision-making is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous. \n     The Maine Medical Association urges the Maine Legislature and \n     the People of Maine to allow the patient and her doctor to \n     determine the most appropriate method of care based upon \n     accepted standards of care in the medical profession and upon \n     the patient's individual circumstances.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes on the majority side has \nexpired. The Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire of the Chair, pursuant to the unanimous \nconsent request, I understood 10 minutes would be allotted for \ndiscussion on my pending amendment, and if the Presiding Officer can \nplease clarify what is the current status of that time request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes allotted to Senators was for \ntwo amendments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 minutes \nagainst the Durbin amendment and the Senator from Illinois be given 5 \nminutes for the Durbin amendment. It will be 5 minutes. I was not aware \nthe Senator was using our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, since we are adding some \ntime here--and I think we should--I want to have about 2 minutes to \nspeak before we vote on the Santorum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one last inquiry, so I understand it. As \nit presently stands, there will be 12 minutes of debate before two \nvotes: First on the Santorum amendment, then the Durbin amendment; then \nin that 12-minute period, 5 minutes allotted to me, 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to say something to my colleagues who are following this \ndebate in their offices. There are not that many on the floor, but many \ndo watch these debates in their offices.\n  We are coming perilously close to reaching a consensus opinion on one \nof the most divisive topics that this Congress has ever faced. The \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and my colleague, Senator Snowe, on \nthe Republican side of the aisle, and about 10 Members on the \nDemocratic side, finally have said: Let us try to get down to the \nbottom line and see if we can come out with some commonsense answer to \nsuch a divisive issue as late-term abortions.\n  I respect the Senator from Pennsylvania and his heartfelt views on \nthis. I have said it repeatedly on the floor. But I think if we are \ngoing to finally be able to say to the American people, we have \nfollowed what we think are your feelings; first, keep abortion safe and \nlegal for women across America; but second, restrict abortions so that \nthey are in situations which are necessary, postviability in \nparticular, that is what the Durbin amendment strives to do. And I \nthank the Senator from Maine for her kind words.\n  Here is what it says, very basically: All late-term abortions, \nregardless of the type of procedure, are prohibited after the fetus is \nviable; that is, after the moment when it can survive outside the womb, \nexcept for two specific exceptions: One, if continuing the pregnancy \nthreatens the life of the mother, or if continuing the pregnancy means \nthe mother runs the risk of grievous physical injury.\n  We then go on to say--we are serious about this--not only the \ntreating doctor but an independent physician has to certify, in \nwriting, that one of those two conditions are met for any late-term \nabortion postviability. If the doctor misleads or states something that \nis not truthful in that certification, he is subject to a civil fine, \nand with repeated offenses the fine grows and his license to practice \nmedicine can be suspended.\n  The reason I think we should take care--and I hope my colleagues will\n\n[[Page S12898]]\n\nlook carefully at this amendment--is that we would finally emerge from \nthis tangled debate with something that many of us can agree on.\n  I am characterized as a pro-choice Senator. I am offering an \namendment which some pro-choice groups do not support. I would hope \nthat some on the pro-life side would look at this as a reasonable way \nto restrict late-term abortions.\n  If Senator Santorum's amendment passes, and restricts one rare \nprocedure, it will reduce the number of abortions that are involved in \nthat procedure, and they are very small relative to the total number. \nIn all honesty, if my amendment passes, the bipartisan amendment, even \nmore abortions will be restricted after viability. So for those on the \npro-life side, it is a situation they should accept, too.\n  I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity. It has come along so \nseldom in the time that I have been up here on this contentious issue. \nI hope they will understand that ours is an attempt to strike a good-\nfaith compromise, consistent with Roe v. Wade, consistent with the \nConstitution, that protects a woman's health, as well as her life, in \nmedical emergency circumstances.\n\n  I think if we pass this amendment that I have offered, with the help \nof so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we will finally \nsay to the American people: Yes, we did come together on the issue of \nlate-term abortion, and we think this is a reasonable way to deal with \nit.\n  I will readily concede there are differences of opinion and those on \nboth sides of the aisle who see it differently. But I think I can go \nbefore my voters in Illinois, and my family because we talk about this, \nand explain to them the case histories that I presented on the Senate \nfloor--where mothers, anxious for the birth of their babies, having \npainted the nursery and named the baby, found, at the last minute in \nthe pregnancy that some terrible complication had occurred, and the \ndoctor said: If you continue the pregnancy, you could die. And if you \ndon't die, you might lose your chance to ever have another baby. Think \nabout that, what the families face; and the doctors said, in that \ncircumstance: We have to go forward with an abortion procedure.\n  Some of the women involved said: I've been conservative, antiabortion \nmy whole life, and it struck me that it was going to hit me right in \nthe face. I had to deal with it. And they did.\n  Frankly, any of our families faced with that would want to have every \navailable medical option to save the life of the mother or to protect \nher from grievous physical injury.\n  I urge my colleagues to please look carefully at this amendment. We \nare perilously close to doing something by way of consensus that is a \ncommonsense answer to a very contentious issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nHeather MacLean and Adam Pallotto from my staff have access to the \nfloor during the consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Durbin amendment purports to ban certain kinds of \nabortion, and I wish that were true because I think that would be \nconstructive. But it does not.\n  I do not question the motives of Senator Durbin, Senator Collins, and \nmany others, who, I think, are trying to find some ground where we \nmight be able to meet. But the problem with this amendment is the \nproblem with all these amendments that deal with the issue of health of \nthe mother.\n  The courts have defined ``health'' so broadly that it includes \neverything. This definition in the amendment talks about serious, \ngrievous physical injury, and it requires a second opinion.\n  Here is the second opinion. If I put the phone number on here, and if \nthis bill were to become law, you could call Dr. Warren Hern, who \nperforms many second- and third-trimester abortions, and he will say \nthis: ``I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life \nand could cause grievous injury to her physical health.''\n  See, the problem is there are lots of people in this country who \nwould argue that pregnancy itself, following through with a pregnancy, \ncan cause grievous physical injury. And in fact, it could.\n\n  So signing a document that says if we did not do this abortion, \ngrievous physical injury would occur, is, by definition, something any \ndoctor--or at least any doctor, Dr. Hern would say--could sign in good \nfaith.\n  So what you have is a loophole, a loophole that would make this \nprohibition void. So as good as it sounds--and I do not question the \nintentions. Senator Daschle had offered this amendment in the past, and \nI certainly did not question his intention. I think there is an honest \nattempt to say, and I take the speakers at their word, that they do not \nwant to see these kinds of abortions performed. However, when you \nprovide a health exception, in reality the health exception becomes the \noperation of the bill, which is: There is no limitation.\n  So as much as I would like to see what the Senator from Illinois \npurports to have happen with his amendment, his language does not \naccomplish what he purports to accomplish. So voting for something \nthat, frankly, is hollow, is not effective.\n  Our bill would, in fact, ban a particular procedure, period, and that \nis with the life of the mother exception.\n  If the Durbin amendment was amended to just provide for the life-of-\nthe-mother exception, it would be a different story. But it does not do \nthat.\n  So as much as I, again, commend those who have signed on to this as \nan attempt on their part to try to search for some sort of middle \nground, I do not think they have found it yet. I am hopeful that good \nfaith and openmindedness will continue and that they will understand \nwhere I am coming from.\n  This is not a limitation at all, and to put forward such as a \nlimitation would be misleading and I think not particularly \nconstructive to getting at the real problem.\n  Again, I say--and my amendment that we will be voting on, which is a \nsense of the Senate, alludes to this--this is a debate about a \nprocedure. And the reason we are debating this procedure is because it \nis the line in our society that we have drawn about who is covered by \nour Constitution and who isn't.\n  I think everyone will agree, once the baby is born, you have \nconstitutional protections. When the baby is inside the womb, the Court \nhas been very clear: you don't. The point is, when the baby is in the \nprocess of being born, it is almost completely outside of the mother. \nHow can one suggest that that baby does not have some additional \nprotection or full protection?\n  We heard the Senator from California say, if the foot was in the \nmother, they wouldn't be entitled to protection. What is the difference \nbetween the foot being inside the mother and the head being inside the \nmother? Why does one give protection and the other one doesn't? We are \ngoing to get into that very kind of fuzzy line. I am not too sure that \nis a line we want to say is our line of demarcation as to when rights \nbegin or not.\n  I think we want to be very clear: Once the baby is in the process of \nbeing born, that is where the right to abortion ends and that is where \ninfanticide begins. I am hopeful the Senate will make that choice \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I urge Senators to read the text. It was \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania who talked about the feet. I talked about \na baby and when a baby is born.\n  The Santorum amendment, just as his bill, is a direct overturning of \nRoe v. Wade, which gave women the right to choose in 1973. Before Roe, \n5,000 women a year died because of illegal abortion. Now abortion is \nsafe, and it is legal. Why don't we keep it that way? It is working. It \nis working for women and their families. It balances the rights of the \nwoman with the rights of the fetus. That is why it says in Roe, in the \nbeginning of a pregnancy, a woman has an unfettered right to choose, \nand later there can be restrictions. But this is where the Santorum \nbill steps over\n\n[[Page S12899]]\n\nthe line. It makes no exception for the health of the woman. Senator \nDurbin reaches to that issue. I commend him for his effort.\n  The fact is, if you make no exception for the health of the woman, \nyou are overturning Roe; there is no question about it. And by using \nthe term ``partial-birth abortion,'' which has never been in any \nmedical directory in the history of medicine--it is a political term--\nit is so ill-defined that the courts have ruled it would in fact make \nmost abortion illegal.\n  Listen to what some of the judges have said. In the State of Alaska: \nIt would restrict abortion in general; in the State of Florida: This \nstatute may endanger the health of women who might seek abortion; in \nIdaho: The act bans the safest and most common method of abortion used \nin Idaho and, therefore, imposes an undue burden on a woman. It goes on \nand on.\n  Nineteen States have said this Santorum language goes against Roe, \nendangers the life, the health--in particular, the health--of a woman.\n  I hope we will table the Santorum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Late Term \nAbortion Limitation Act of 1999.\n  I would like to thank Senator Durbin for working with me and others \nwho oppose later term abortions like the procedure being discussed \ntoday, which some have called partial-birth abortion.\n  Let me start by saying that this is a difficult issue for anyone to \ndiscuss. And it is an emotional issue. It is not easy for any of us in \nthis Chamber to discuss terminating a pregnancy.\n  As a mother who has gotten infinite joy from twin 3-year-old boys and \nwas blessed with a safe and healthy natural delivery, it is an \nespecially sensitive topic for me.\n  Like many of the people that I represent in Arkansas, I do not \nbelieve the so-called partial-birth abortion should be an elective \nprocedure.\n  We should put an end to all forms of abortion after viability except \nin cases where a late term abortion is medically necessary to save the \nlife of the mother or when ``grievous injury'' could harm the mother.\n  Congress has attempted to eliminate what some people call partial-\nbirth abortions in the past. And 30 states have enacted similar \nlegislation. But most efforts to end this horrific procedure have been \nunsuccessful thus far because the courts have overturned them.\n  As I have shown during debate on HMO reform and tax reform, I am \nresult-oriented. I believe we're here to get things done, to effect \nchange, instead of scoring political points.\n  For that reason, I have chosen to support Senator Durbin's approach \nto eliminating late term abortions because Senator Durbin has taken \ncare of the concerns raised by courts and because this legislation will \nactually reduce the number of late term abortions.\n  I should point out that, while serving in the House of \nRepresentatives, I twice voted in favor of a ban on partial-birth \nabortions, expressing my concern that the life and serious health of \nthe mother be considered.\n  Much has happened since then. Nineteen courts have overturned laws \nvery similar to the one I supported. Some rule that the term ``partial-\nbirth abortion'' is too vague.\n  While I am not a lawyer, I understand the courts' point because all \nof the doctors I have discussed this issue with tell me that there is \nno such procedure as partial birth abortion.\n  In addition, the courts have noted that states cannot regulate or \nprohibit abortion prior to viability. So it is very important, if we \nwant results from this debate, to specify that we are talking about \npost-viability.\n  Senator Durbin has corrected these prior legislative flaws by \nreferring to abortions after viability rather than partial-birth \nabortions.\n  In addition, the Durbin late term abortion ban would eliminate \nelective late term abortions by requiring not one but two doctors to \ncertify the need for a late term abortion to save the life or serious \nhealth of the mother.\n  I support the Durbin amendment because if Senators really want to \nensure that we stop late term abortions, then we should pass \nlegislation that can stand the test of the courts.\n  The Durbin amendment could stand the test and become law. It has the \nbest chance of producing results.\n  So if results are what we're looking, if stopping late term \nabortions--including the so-called partial-birth abortions--is our \ngoal, then this is the right option.\n  If we vote for other vague measures, we will be right back here next \nyear, and the next year, still debating this issue--without results.\n  Let's do the right thing and ban unnecessary late term abortions by \nvoting for the Durbin amendment which can stand up to federal court \ntests.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table the Santorum amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2322. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Wade (410 U.S. 113 \n     (1973)):\n       (2) No partial birth abortion ban shall apply to a partial-\n     birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother \n     whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or \n     injury.\n       Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--\n     partial birth abortions are horrific and gruesome procedures \n     that should be banned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12899-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12899-S12904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n          AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask consent that the Senate proceed to the conference \nreport on the bill (H.R. 2670) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \nagencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000,\n\n[[Page S12900]]\n\nand for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     2670, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 19, 1999.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Gregg, in presenting to the Senate the fiscal year \n2000, Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related agencies \nappropriations conference report. I would like to thank Senator Gregg \nfor his efforts in resolving many of the difficult issues that were \nencompassed in this bill. As a result of over four weeks of \nnegotiations, the conference report before the Senator today--for the \nmost past--is good and balanced.\n  As Senator Gregg stated, this agreement includes $39 billion and \nexceeds last year's appropriation by almost $3 billion. While this \nsounds like a tremendous increase in funding, for all intent and \npurpose, this increase is for the 2000 decennial census. Consequently, \nthe funding decisions encompassed in this bill were difficult. Senator \nGregg has already covered many of the major issues in this bill so I \nwill not go into great detail. But, I would like to point out to my \ncolleagues some of the highlights of this bill:\n  The Justice Department accounts for the largest portion of this bill \nand contains $18.5 billion for many important law enforcement agencies \nincluding the FBI, DEA, INS, and Marshals Service. This level of \nfunding is only an increase of $287 million above last year's \nappropriated level. Within DOJ, the conferees agreed to recede to the \nSenate's position the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services \n(COPS) program, and funded the program at the Senate level of $325 \nmillion. In addition, $250 million in carryover is available bringing \nthe total budget authority for this program for fiscal year 2000 to \n$575 million. While many of us would like to see a higher level of \nfunding for this program, I believe that we have provided a responsible \nlevel given the austere funding constraints this year.\n  Mr. President, the conferees also agreed to continue the Safe Schools \nInitiative that Senator Gregg and I began funding last year. To further \nefforts in combating violence in and around our schools, we have \nincluded $225 million in funding. Included in that funding is $180 \nmillion for school resource officers and $30 million for prevention \nprograms.\n  Regarding the Commerce Department, $8.7 billion is provided for the \nnumerous missions undertaken by the various agencies of the Commerce \nDepartment, including stewardship of our nation's oceans and waterways, \nsatellite coverage and weather forecasting, regulation of trade and \ntelecommunications, assistance to rural areas, high risk technology \nresearch, and assistance to small manufacturers. Also within this level \nof funding for the Commerce Department is the $4.47 billion necessary \nfor conducting the constitutionally mandated decennial census. I would \nlike to thank Chairman Gregg for working to resolve the issues around \ncensus funding without lengthy and counter-productive debate.\n  I am pleased that the conference report reflects a level of funding \nfor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that is \ncloser to the Senate position that the House. NOAA is the premier \nagency for addressing catastrophic weather conditions as well as daily \nforecasts. This year has been one filled with natural disasters--\neverything from droughts, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes. During \nthis past month while our staff was negotiating on this bill, about 10 \nmillion people were evacuated from the coast during Hurricane Floyd. \nThanks to NOAA's hurricane research, their flights into the storm their \nsatellite coverage and weather forecasts, the loss of life, while still \nvery tragic, was significantly less than what it otherwise would have \nbeen. Mr. President, when we went into conference 6 weeks ago, there \nwas a $600 million difference in funding for NOAA between the House and \nSenate. The Senate worked diligently to restore NOAA's funding and the \nconference report reflects those efforts with NOAA funded at an \nincrease of $137 million above last year's appropriated level. Given \nthis agency's missions that include everything from weather forecasting \nand atmospheric research to ocean and fisheries research and ocean and \ncoastal management, this level of funding in still insufficient, but \ngiven the fiscal constraints, it is enough to allow the agency to \ncontinue forward with its critical missions.\n  This conference report provides $5.9 billion for the Department of \nState and related agencies. This will fund security upgrades for State \nDepartment facilities, construction and maintenance of U.S. missions, \npayment of international organization and peacekeeping funds, and \neducational and cultural exchanges. This year we are providing $313.6 \nmillion in funding for much needed security upgrades at State \nDepartment facilities around the world. Incidents such as the bombings \nin Kenya and Tanzania have reminded us that we cannot dismiss the \nsafety and security of our citizens abroad.\n  Now I would like to take a moment to thank the staff for all their \nhard work in bringing this agreement to the floor. Specifically I would \nlike to thank Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Eric \nHarnischfeger, Clayton Heil, and Dana Quam of Senator Gregg's staff and \nLila Helms, Emelie East, and Tim Harding of my staff. I know that they \nhave all worked long hours during the past 4 weeks, including weekends \nand late evenings to reach a compromise and I appreciate their efforts. \nThis a large bill that funds the Federal law enforcement, oceans and \nfisheries, our nations courts and everything in between. Reaching \ncompromise on these myriad accounts is no small task and I thank them \nfor their diligence.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to give a few words of thanks \nto someone who has been a tremendous help to me and the Commerce, \nJustice, State Subcommittee over this last year. That person is Tim \nHarding, an extremely bright young man who was detailed to me by the \nDepartment of Justice COPS on the Beat program.\n  Tim worked with me and my staff since last winter. He has seen this \nprocess through--from receipt of the President's budget, to our \ncongressional hearings, to markup, through our whirlwind day on the \nSenate floor, and through this month and a half of conference. At every \npoint, Tim was willing and ready to give 100 percent. While we all know \nthe Senate is like no other place, Tim took the time to learn what \nmakes this process work, and he was able to easily adapt. He provided \nme with memos, helped me with my constituent relations, and drafted \ngood-quality statements for my use during hearings, markup, and floor \nconsideration of our bill. His work will be sorely missed by me and my \nstaff, and I wish him all the best in what promises to be a bright \nfuture.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I bring to the floor the conference \nagreement for the Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary \nappropriations for fiscal year 2000.\n  This conference agreement includes $39 billion for these and other \nrelated agencies. This is $2.8 billion above last year's level and $7.9 \nbillion below the President's request. Also, it is $3.6 billion above \nthe Senate level, which includes the additional funding requested for \nthe census.\n  To start out with, I want to address the department that comprises \nalmost half of the funding in this bill, the Department of Justice. We \nprovide it with $18.5 billion.\n  Within Justice, we continue counterterrorism measures. A total of \n$152 million is directed to the counterterrorism program to bolster \ncurrent counterterrorism initiatives. The conference agreement provides \n$14 million to the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium for their \ncooperative efforts. We put emphasis this year on equipment for first \nresponders so that they have what is needed when they arrive first-on-\nthe-scene of any terrorist attack.\n  We also remain concerned about attacks on computer systems, these \nbeing a primary target to sabotage.\n\n[[Page S12901]]\n\nThe conferees agreed to $18.6 million for the National Infrastructure \nand Protection Center, through the FBI account, which serves as the \ncentral clearinghouse for threats and warnings or actual cyber-attacks \non critical infrastructures. The FBI has field computer crime-intrusion \nsquads and computer analysis and response teams to combat cyber crime \nand sabotage.\n  However, I remain concerned by the release of the FALN members by the \nPresident, and its effect on our overall counterterrorism policy. In \nthe past few years, the Appropriations Committee has worked closely \nwith all aspects of the law enforcement community to hammer out a \nunited, comprehensive counterterrorism strategy. There has been marked \nimprovement in understanding where we need to go to prevent and to be \nready for terrorist incidents. The President's clemency agreement takes \nthat understanding and drives a stake in it. The President chose to \nrelease members of a known terrorist organization, against the \nrecommendation of the pardon attorney and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations.\n  The FBI is one of the lead agencies on terrorism policy, and the \nPresident disregarded their opposition to the clemency agreement. The \nPresident's actions went against his own administration and \ncongressional efforts to craft and implement a strong counterterrorism \npolicy.\n  Ironically, his argument was that none of these individuals had been \ncharged with murder. Terry Nicholas was not charged with murder, but \n168 died in the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Unfortunately, the President's actions have created a schism in our \nterrorist policy that may take years to overcome.\n  Moving to an area that is as horrifying as a terrorist attack, the \nconference agreement provides funding to address child abductions and \nmissing children. We were able to retain the Senate's Missing Children \nprogram, which provides $19.9 million to help law enforcers find and \ncare for missing children. We also fund the FBI's programs to prevent \nchild sexual exploitation on the Internet. These efforts help solve \ninvestigations involving missing children by creating specialized cyber \nunits whose purpose is to monitor and react to Internet pedophiles. The \nFBI works closely with the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren to find the victims of these attacks and return them to their \nfamilies.\n  To protect children in schools, the conference agreement recommends \n$225 million through the Safe Schools Initiative. The availability of \nthese funds for schools, groups, and law enforcement should encourage \ncommunities to work together to address the escalation of violence in \nschools throughout the Nation.\n\n  The conferees believe it is also important to encourage out-of-school \nprevention methods as well. One way to stop juvenile violence is to get \nyoung people involved in programs outside of school. The conference \nagreement includes the Senate number, $50 million, for the Boys and \nGirls Clubs of America. It retains the Senate language regarding the \nuse of the Internet in the clubs. Additionally, $13.5 is provided for \nJuvenile Mentoring Programs (JUMP), such as Big Brothers and Big \nSisters and similar community programs that bring responsible adults \ntogether with children in a mentoring capacity. I believe prevention is \npreferable to punishment, and these programs can redirect the energies \nof high risk youth into positive activities.\n  The conference agreement provides over $537 million for juvenile \nprograms through the juvenile justice budget and accountability \nincentive grants.\n  In an effort to combat another problem our society faces daily, the \nconference agreement supports counter drug efforts by the Justice \nDepartment. We provide DEA with $53.9 million for mobile enforcement \nteams and $17.4 million for regional drug enforcement teams. These \nteams have the flexibility to go to the hot spots in small cities and \ntowns and provide an immediate, effective response to drug trafficking. \nThey come in at the request of State and local law enforcement and work \ntogether to stop drug trafficking.\n  The agreement also includes $27.1 million for the DEA and $35.6 \nmillion for State and local enforcement efforts to end methamphetamine \nproduction and distribution.\n  Under my tenure as chairman, this committee has been supportive of \nthe Violence Against Women Act Programs. The conference agreement \nincludes the Senate level of $284 million. Within this level, $207 \nmillion is available for general formula grants to the States. Within \nthose grants, $10 million will be available for programs on college \ncampuses and $10 million for Safe Start programs. In addition, we \nretained the increase for court appointed special advocates and provide \n$10 million.\n  The Senate will be glad to hear we were able to bolster some accounts \nin conference that had been reduced this year in the Senate bill. The \nlocal law enforcement block grant was raised to last year's level of \n$523 million.\n  The conferees provide $30 million for police corps; $25 million for \ngrants for bullet proof vests; and $40 million for the Indian country \nlaw enforcement initiative.\n  The State prison grants were increased above the Senate proposed \nlevel to $686.5 million, and $420 million was designated for SCAAP.\n  The last issue I want to address within the Justice Department is \nfunding for law enforcement technology grants. As we approach the new \nmillennium and provide funding for fiscal year 2000, it is important \nthat we ensure that law enforcement is not behind in technology. The \nconference agreement includes funding of $250 million for law \nenforcement technology grants. These grants will be available for State \nand local law enforcement to acquire equipment and training to address \ncriminal activities in our communities.\n  Moving to Commerce, the conferees recommend a level of $25.6 million \nfor the United States Trade Representative. The International Trade \nCommission is funded at $44.5 million, and the International Trade \nAdministration is funded at a level of $313.5 million. The funding \nlevel for the Bureau of Export Administration is $54 million.\n  The conferees provide full funding for the Bureau of the Census at a \nlevel of $4.8 billion. The decennial census is funded at the \nAdministration's requested level. The Administration sent a budget \namendment to Congress as the Senate's Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations measure was being reported to the Senate. Therefore, the \ncommittee was unable to incorporate this amendment in the original \nbill. A hearing was held on the administration's budget amendment in \nlate July, and the conference report before us today contains all of \nthe funds requested by the administration.\n  The funding for the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration includes $26.5 million for the public broadcasting grant \nprogram and $15.5 million for information infrastructure grants.\n  The agreement funds the programs of the National Institute for \nStandards and Technology (NIST) at a total of $639 million for fiscal \nyear 2000. Of this amount, $283.1 million is for NIST's scientific and \ntechnical research and services programs.\n  NIST's external activities, the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and \nManufacturing Extension Program (MEP) are funded at the levels of $211 \nmillion, including carryover balances, and $104.8 million, \nrespectively.\n  The agreement fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration programs at a level of $2.3 billion. This funding level \nwill continue vital funding for oceanic and atmospheric research \nprograms which have such strong support in the Senate.\n  The five major line offices of the agency are funded as follows: the \nNational Ocean Service at a level of $267.3 million; the National \nMarine Fisheries Service at $403.7 million; the Office of Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research at $300 million; the National Weather Service at \n$603.8 million; and, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and \nInformation Service at a level of $111.4 million.\n  The agreement also provides funding for the first new fishery \nresearch vessel approved for the agency in several years.\n  The conference agreement contains $10 million to capitalize two funds \ncreated under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, and $50 million for a Pacific \nSalmon Restoration Fund requested by the administration.\n\n[[Page S12902]]\n\n  A small part of our bill--$3.7 billion--is the judiciary. The \nconference agreement provides the judiciary with $122 million more than \nthe Senate level. We fully fund defender services, and increase the \nhourly rate for court appointed public defenders. In addition, the \nSenate COLA provision was retained.\n  Now, for the last department in this bill, we provide $5.8 billion to \nthe State Department.\n  The conferees recommend $254 million for worldwide security under \nDiplomatic and Consular Programs. We also provided $313.6 million in \nsecurity-related construction under the Security and Maintenance of \nU.S. Missions account. These levels will address infrastructure \nconcerns raised by the Dar Es Salaam and Nairobio bombings last year.\n  Cultural and Educational Exchange Programs are funded at $205 \nmillion. These programs give U.S. and foreign citizens the chance to \ninteract on an educational level where cultural diversity can be \nexplored.\n  The conference agreement includes adequate funding for the agencies \nrelated to the State Department, including the Asia Foundation and the \nNational Endowment for Democracy.\n  Lastly in State, we provide $351 million to cover U.N. arrears, \nsubject to authorization. This represents the final payment associated \nwith the Helm-Biden agreement on UN reforms.\n  This bill contains a handful of related agencies that act \nindependently of the departments within this bill, and comprise $2 \nbillion of the total of this conference agreement.\n  For the Maritime Administration, the conference agreement recommends \n$178.1 million. Within the level, the Maritime Academy receives $34.1 \nmillion. The Maritime Security Program is funded at $98.7 million, \nincluding carryover balances.\n  The conference agreement funds the Federal Communications Commission \nat a level of $210 million. This funding level permits the agency to \npay rent in its new location, but does not provide funding for some of \nthe new technology initiatives the agency had hoped to implement in FY \n2000.\n  As requested in the FCC budget, the Senate bill contained a provision \npermitting the FCC to protect our national spectrum assets. The \nprovision in the Senate bill, Section 618, would have permitted the FCC \nto re-auction licenses currently entangled in bankruptcy court \nproceedings. This provision was dropped in conference at the insistence \nof the House. I regret that it was dropped.\n  The FCC began auctioning licenses for spectrum in late 1994, and some \nof the companies who were successful bidders subsequently filed for \nbankruptcy. The bankruptcy courts have permitted some of these \ncompanies to avoid paying their debt to the Federal Government for \nobtaining these licenses. Billions of dollars are being lost to the \ntreasury because of these rulings. These companies should not be \npermitted to use these licenses, for which they have not paid in full, \nas assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. Spectrum licenses are national \nassets, and the proceeds from the sale of these licenses are the \ntaxpayers' assets. I hope we will be able to revisit this provision at \na later date.\n  The Small Businesses Administration (SBA) is one of the larger \nagencies in this bill. The conference agreement provides $803.5 million \nfor their SBA. Within the amount, $84.5 million goes to the Small \nBusiness Development Centers.\n  We also provide the Senate level of funding for the Women's Business \nCenters and National Women's Business Council.\n  The SBA disaster loan assistance program is funded at a level of \n$255.4 million.\n  And, as a last mention on this bill, the agreement before us \nrecommends $125 million for the Federal Trade Commission. Of particular \nimportance is the Senate language regarding the Internet.\n  The conference agreement contains modified language regarding efforts \nto police the Internet and U.S. electronic financial markets within the \nFederal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe conferees are aware that the explosion of Internet commerce also \nincreases the opportunities for fraud and abuse. We want to ensure that \nthose agencies that monitor the Internet are able to adapt to the \nincreasing activity and match their consumer protection efforts in \nequal measure.\n  I think this agreement addresses the issue, yet believe there is \nstill much more to do in the areas of Internet policy.\n  Overall, I believe this conference agreement of the House and Senate \nbills provides funding required to execute the needed services and \nprograms under our purview. We have not reduced these accounts like we \nhad to to meet the low Senate allocation. We were able to provide \nadditional funding to these accounts that Senators and the \nadministration thought were not given their due in the Senate bill. The \nranking member and his staff participated fully in bringing this \nagreement to you. I want to extent my thanks for their collegian \nefforts. They worked with us side-by-side to construct what we believe \nis a respectable bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this conference agreement as being a \nsound compromise.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the staff for all their \nefforts on this conference agreement. Every year they do their best to \nget this particular bill completed quickly, and, every year we find \nourselves jockeying for last position. I know they work hard to avoid \nthis situation. The diverse jurisdiction of this bill tends to lead to \ncontroversy somewhere within its's realms even in the best of years. I \nappreciate the staff giving up weekends and countless nights to bring \nto Congress a passable CJS appropriations bill. Thanks to my staff, Jim \nMorhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Eric Harnischfeger, Clayton Heil, \nVas Alexopoulos, Dane Quam, Brian McLaughlin, and Jackie Cooney.\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, civil rights is still the unfinished \nbusiness of America. It is unconscionable that Congress would signal \nthat the Federal Government has no role in combating hate crimes in \nthis country. Yet, that is exactly the signal the Republican leadership \nhas sent by eliminating the Senate-passed provisions on hate crimes \nfrom the final report of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act.\n  Since just after the Civil War, Congress has repeatedly recognized \nthe special Federal role in protecting civil rights and preventing \ndiscrimination. This Federal responsibility, based on the 14th \namendment to the Constitution, is reflected in a large body of Federal \ncivil rights laws, including many criminal law provisions. These laws \nare aimed at conduct that deprives persons of their rights because of \ntheir membership in certain disadvantaged groups. The Federal criminal \nlaw, among other prohibitions, bars depriving individuals of housing \nrights, destroying religious property because of religious bias, and \ncommitting violent acts because of racial hatred.\n  The point of these laws is not to protect only certain people from \nviolence--we all deserve to be protected. The point is to recognize \nthis special Federal responsibility to stop especially vicious forms of \ndiscrimination, and penalize it with the full force of Federal law.\n  Hate crimes legislation recognizes that violence based on deep-seated \nprejudice, like all forms of discrimination, inflicts an especially \nserious injury on society. These crimes can divide whole nations along \nracial, religious and other lines, as are seen too often in countries \nthroughout the world. These crimes send a poisonous message that the \nmajority in society feels free to oppress the minority. The strongest \nantidote to that unacceptable poison is for the majority to speak out \nstrongly, and insist that these flagrant acts of violent bigotry will \nnot be tolerated. That is why it is essential for hate crimes \nlegislation to be endorsed by our nation and our communities at every \nlevel--Federal, State, and local.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, that so many of us support, \nis bipartisan. It is endorsed by a broad range of religious, civil \nrights and law enforcement organizations. It takes two needed steps. It \nstrengthens current laws against crimes based on race, religion, or \nnational origin. And it adds gender, sexual orientation, and disability \nto the protections in current law.\n\n[[Page S12903]]\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate added these important provisions to the \nCommerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. But last Monday evening, the \nSenate-House conferees approved a conference report that does not \ncontain the hate crimes provision. Behind closed doors, the conferees \ndropped the provisions. As a result, Congress is now MIA--missing in \naction on this basic issue of tolerance and justice and civil rights in \nour society.\n  Clearly, we must find a way to act on this important issue before the \nsession ends. The Federal Government should be doing all it can to halt \nthese vicious crimes that shock the conscience of the nation. State and \nlocal governments are doing their part to prevent hate crimes, and so \nmust Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments that \nthe Senate adopted this summer as part of the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill was the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This \nlegislation strengthens current law by making it easier for federal \nauthorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, color, \nreligion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and \nresources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes \ncommitted against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, \nor disability.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this bill, and I am \nproud to have been an original cosponsor. Now is the time to pass this \nimportant legislation\n  Recent incidents of violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry have \nshocked the American conscience and made it painfully clear that we as \na nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans from \nthese crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The \nanswer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased \nrespect and tolerance. But strengthening our Federal hate crimes \nlegislation is a step in the right direction.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that great and \nhonorable tradition.\n  Five months ago, Judy Shepard, the mother of hate crimes victim \nMatthew Shepard, called upon Congress to pass the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act without delay. Let me close by quoting her eloquent \nwords:\n\n       Today, we have it within our power to send a very different \n     message than the one received by the people who killed my \n     son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a \n     real problem that is destroying families like mine, James \n     Byrd Jr.'s, Billy Jack Gaither's and many others across \n     America. . . . We need to decide what kind of nation we want \n     to be. One that treats all people with dignity and respect, \n     or one that allows some people and their family members to be \n     marginalized.\n\n  There are still a few weeks left in this session; we should pass the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act this year.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I feel compelled to express my concerns \nwith the Commerce, Justice, State, and the judiciary appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2000. I am disappointed by the inadequate funding \nfor coastal salmon recovery and the Pacific Salmon Treaty. While I \ncannot complain about the funding for Washington State in relation to \nAlaska, California, and Oregon, I do believe the overall funding is \nwoefully inadequate to address the tremendous crisis facing threatened \nand endangered salmon runs. Each state and their counties and cities \nare prepared to face the challenge of salmon recovery, but they must be \ngiven the tools to do so. The funds for Pacific coastal salmon recovery \nshould be at the President's request level of $100 million.\n  In relation to the Pacific Salmon Treaty, I must again bemoan the \nlack of adequate funding. The treaty agreement was signed late in the \nappropriation process and thus it is understandable that large scale \nfunding would be difficult. However, the funding provided under this \nconference report does not approach our obligations under the treaty. \nWe need to be signaling the intention of the U.S. to meet its treaty \nobligations and this bill does not do this. I believe the funding for \nthe Northern and Southern Funds called for under the treaty should be \nmore than the $10 million provided. Furthermore, the elimination of the \nbuy-back money for fishers is not only cruel to the families affected \nby the fishing reductions, but again does not send the right message to \nCanada.\n  In a related matter, the conference report contains legislative \nlanguage that exempts Alaska from the provisions and requirements of \nthe Endangered Species Act in relation to salmon. While I appreciate \nthe State of Alaska's desire to have the Pacific Salmon Treaty protect \nits salmon fishery from any jeopardy findings, the provision is not in \nthe spirit of the treaty. The states of Oregon and Washington, as well \nas the Pacific Northwest tribes, negotiated in good-faith to conclude \nthe treaty. I must support Governor Kitzhaber and Governor Locke and \nthe tribes in their opposition to this provision. This legislative \nprovision is in effect an addendum to the treaty that the treaty \nnegotiators did not agree to. It should be removed.\n  I am very disappointed the conference did not adopt the language of \nthe Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Hate crime is real. Despite great gains \nin equality and civil rights over the latter part of the century, hate \ncrimes are still being committed and offenders must be punished. \nIncluding this provision would have given us more tools to fight hate. \nThe proposal would have expanded the definition of a hate crime and \nimproved prosecution of those who act our their hate with violence. If \nsomeone harms another because of race, gender, color, religion, \ndisability or sexual orientation, they would be punished.\n  I am very disappointed that the conference failed to include the \nSenate language of the Hate Crime Prevention Act. Along with many of my \ncolleagues, I will continue to push this legislation. It is about basic \nhuman rights for those who all too often persecuted while the majority \nlooks the other way.\n  I am also unhappy the Community Oriented Policing Services Program \n(COPS) was so underfunded. The Subcommittee mark in the Senate included \nno funding for COPS. Some of us on the full Appropriations Committee \nrestored a modest amount of money to the program. The President \nrequested $1.2 billion, but the conference funded COPS at only $325 \nmillion. That is wrong.\n  COPS is one of the most successful programs of this decade. The \ninitiative to get an additional 100,000 new police officers on the \nstreets was widely criticized by many from the other side of the aisle. \nThey said that the federal government could never successfully assist \nlocal law enforcement. They were wrong. The program is now praised by \nformer opponents, the states are happy with it, and it has proven to be \nvery effective.\n  Another problem is that once again behind closed doors, we continue \nto assault reproductive health care for women. Section 625 of this \nconference report includes a major authorizing change that was not part \nof the House or Senate passed bills. We did not debate or discuss this \nmajor expansion of the conscience clause included in Public Law 106-58, \nFY00 Treasury Postal Appropriations.\n  For those members who were not in this closed door meeting, let me \nexplain. Section 625 would allow a pharmacist to object to providing a \nwoman with a prescribed contraceptive if he or she felt the use of this \ncontraceptive was contrary to their own individual religious beliefs or \nmoral convictions. Pharmacists can make a moral judgment and deny women \naccess to emergency contraceptives or any form of contraceptive.\n  We already allow plans participating in the FEHBP to object on \nreligious grounds to providing reproductive health services; we now \nwill allow pharmacists to deny women access. A small town pharmacist \ncould simply object to filling a prescription because she morally \nobjects to the use of contraceptives. A woman is now subjected to the \nmoral judgment of her pharmacists. Is she free to simply go to another \npharmacy? In many rural communities there really aren't nearby other \noptions. In addition, many plans require use of a preferred provider \nfor pharmacy benefits. What happens if your preferred provider is \nmorally opposed to providing contraceptives?\n\n[[Page S12904]]\n\n  I do not oppose conscience clauses, but I do oppose denying women \naccess to legally prescribed contraceptives simply based on moral \nobjections. This is simply outrageous and once again the threat to \nwomen's health is ignored.\n  Let me end on a positive note. I am appreciative of the \nsubcommittee's work to provide $5 million in State Department monies \nfor costs related to the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting \nwhich will be held in Seattle, WA. The President requested $2 million \nand I am pleased Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings agreed to my \nrequest for a significant increase for WTO expenses. I had hoped for \nsome additional language to ensure that the State Department reimbursed \nlocalities in Washington State for legitimate WTO police and fire \nexpenses. The WTO Ministerial will be the largest trade meeting ever \nheld in the United States, both the Federal Government and Washington \nState are bearing significant costs to host the world's trade \nnegotiators. I expect and I will push the State Department to be \nresponsive to the needs of local governments in Washington State in the \nexpenditure of these additional monies.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for recognizing \nthe need of three Vermont towns to upgrade, modernize and acquire \ntechnology for their police departments in this Conference Report. \nAllowing these police departments to improve their technology will \npermit them to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nservices they provide.\n  Reflecting the needs of the police departments, the $1 million in \ntechnology funds for these three towns should be divided on the \nfollowing basis: one-half ($500,000) to the Burlington Police \nDepartment, one-third ($333,000) to the Rutland Police Department, and \none-sixth ($167,000) to the St. Johnsbury Police Department. Again, I \nappreciate his help in addressing the technology problems these towns' \npolice departments are facing. I look forward to working with him to \nget this important appropriations bill signed into law.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the conference report be agreed to \nand the motion to consider be immediately laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12904-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12904-S12920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Brittany \nFeiner be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of Senate \nconsideration of S. 1692.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to, once again, \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote to ban partial-birth abortion. \nThree times Congress has voted to pass legislation to ban the barbaric \npractice of partial-birth abortion--but tragically, at every \nopportunity, the President of the United States has vetoed the act of \nCongress to ban this needless and horrific procedure.\n  The words of Frederick Douglass uttered more than 100 years ago I \nbelieve are very applicable to this discussion. This is what Frederick \nDouglass said:\n\n       Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and \n     you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong \n     which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till \n     they are resisted. . . .\n\n  We must continue our struggle to ban partial-birth abortion in this \ncountry. We are debating a national question that in my ways, is not \nunlike the issue of slavery, in part, because opponents of this \nlegislation are truly using artificial arguments to justify why certain \npeople, in their opinion, have no legal status and no civil, social, or \npolitical rights. Those opposing the partial-birth abortion ban imply \nthat the almost-born child has no right to live. Clearly, the vast \nmajority of the American people, and a majority of Congress disagree.\n\n  Every year the tragic effect of this extreme indifference to human \nlife becomes more and more apparent. We must ban this procedure. We \nmust simply say that enough is enough.\n  In my home State of Ohio, two tragic cases of partial-birth abortions \ndid not go ``according to plan.'' Each reveals, in its own way, the \nunpleasant facts of this horrible tragedy of partial-birth abortion.\n  On April 6, in Dayton, OH, a woman went into the Dayton Medical \nCenter to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This facility is operated \nby Dr. Martin Haskell, a pioneer of the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure. Usually this procedure takes place behind closed doors, \nwhere it can be ignored--its morality left outside.\n  But, this particular procedure was different. Here is what happened.\n  The Dayton abortionist inserted instruments known as laminaria into \nthe woman, to dilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be \nremoved and killed. This procedure usually takes 3 days.\n  This woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton for \ncompletion of the procedure in 2 or 3 days. But, her cervix dilated too \nquickly and so shortly after midnight, she was admitted to Bethesda \nNorth Hospital in Cincinnati.\n  The child was born. A medical technician pointed out that the child \nwas alive. But apparently her chances of survival were slim. After 3 \nhours and 8 minutes, this baby died. The baby was named Hope.\n  On the death certificate is a space for ``Method of Death.'' And it \nsaid, in the case of Baby Hope, ``Method of Death: Natural.'' That, of \ncourse, is not true. There was nothing natural about the events that \nled to the death of this poor innocent child.\n  Baby Hope did not die of natural causes. Baby Hope was the victim of\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\nthis barbaric procedure--a procedure that is opposed by the vast \nmajority of the American people. It is a procedure that has been banned \nthree times by an act of Congress--only to see the ban overturned by a \nveto by the President of the United States.\n  The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of \nan abortion clinic. The death of this baby took place in public--in a \nhospital dedicated to saving lives, not taking them. This episode \nreminds us of the brutal reality and tragedy of what partial-birth \nabortion really is, the killing of a baby--plain and simple.\n  And, almost to underscore the inhumanity of this procedure--4 months \nlater, in my home State of Ohio it happened again. This time, though, \nsomething quite different occurred.\n  Once again, the scene is Dayton, OH. This time on August 18, a woman \nwho was 25-weeks pregnant, went into Dr. Haskell's office for a \npartial-birth abortion. As usual, the abortionist performed the \npreparatory steps for the barbaric procedure by dilating the mother's \ncervix. The next day, August 19, the mother went into labor, and was \nrushed to Good Samaritan Hospital. This time, however, despite the \nmassive trauma to this baby's environment, a miracle occurred. By \ngrace, this little baby survived, and so she now is called ``Baby \nGrace.''\n  I am appalled by the fact that both of these heinous partial-birth \nabortion attempts occurred anywhere, but particularly because in my \nhome State. When I think about the brutal death of Baby Hope and then \nponder the miracle of Baby Grace, I am confronted with the question--a \nhaunting question that we all face--Why can't we just allow these \nbabies to live?\n  Opponents of the ban on this ``procedure'' say that this procedure is \nnecessary to protect the health of women. We know from testimony that \nwe heard in our Judiciary Committee that that simply is not true. The \nAmerican Medical Association says that this procedure is never--never--\nmedically necessary. In fact, many physicians have found that the \nprocedure itself can pose immediate and significant risks to a woman's \nhealth and future fertility. Clearly, the babies did not have to be \nkilled in the Ohio cases I just cited. No. The babies were both born \nalive. One survived; one did not.\n  Why does the baby have to be killed?\n  Opponents of this legislation say that this procedure is only used in \nemergency situations, when women's lives are in danger. Again, from the \ntestimony that we heard in the Judiciary Committee, we know this is \nabsolutely not true. It seems strange that a 3-day procedure would be \nused and the mother sent home if, in fact, we were dealing with an \nemergency. Nevertheless, even abortionists say that the vast majority \nof partial-birth abortions are elective. Dr. Haskell, the Ohio \nabortionist, stated as follows: ``And I'll be quite frank; most of my \nabortions are elective in that 20-24 week range.''\n  Why? Why? Why does the baby have to be killed?\n  Opponents of this bill say that this procedure is necessary when a \nfetus is abnormal. Now, I do not believe the condition of the fetus \never warrants killing it. But, even abortionists and some opponents of \nthis ban agree that most partial-birth abortions involve healthy \nfetuses. The inventor of this procedure himself, the late Dr. James \nMcMahon, said ``I think, `Gee, it's too bad that this child couldn't be \nadopted.' ''\n  So, again, the question: Why does the baby have to be killed?\n  Opponents of this bill say that this partial-birth procedure is rare. \nBut, again, that is not true either. Even the director of the National \nCoalition of Abortion Providers admitted that there are up to 5,000 \npartial-birth abortion procedures in the United States.\n  Why? Why does the baby have to be killed?\n  Opponents say that this ban violates Roe v. Wade, and so it is \nunconstitutional. But, anyone who has read the case knows that Roe \ndeclined to consider the constitutionality of the part of the Texas \nstatute banning the killing of a child who was in the process of \ndelivery. And, the Supreme Court again declined to decide this issue in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  Again, we must ask, why does the baby have to be killed?\n  Opponents say this bill is unconstitutional because it doesn't have a \n``health exception.'' First, the ``health exception'' is defined by Doe \nv. Bolton so broadly as to make the ban unenforceable--effectively \ngutting the bill. We know that is how the courts have defined the \n``health exception'' in abortion legislation. Both sides of this debate \nfully understand that.\n\n  The American Medical Association itself has stated:\n\n       There is no health reason for this procedure. In fact, \n     there is ample testimony to show that all of the health \n     consequences are more severe for this procedure than any \n     other procedure used.\n\n  Further, the AMA concluded:\n\n       The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of \n     killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most \n     Americans and physicians. (New York Times, May 26, 1997).\n\n  I ask my colleagues who wish to continue to allow this heinous \nprocedure by upholding the President's veto, why? Why does the baby \nhave to be killed? Why do babies, inches away from their first breath, \nhave to die? Something is terribly wrong in this country when these \nbabies continue to be killed.\n  With the advent of modern technology, we can sustain young life in \nways we could not have just a few short years ago. Those of us who have \nhad the privilege of going into neonatal intensive care units in our \nStates have seen the miracles being worked today with precious, tiny \nchildren. Medical science can keep babies alive who are only 22 weeks, \n23 weeks, children who before would simply not have survived.\n  While we have this great technology, while we have made such great \nadvances, while we are saving so many innocent children, at the same \ntime we have also perfected and created more and more savage ways of \nkilling other children, other babies who are the same level of \ndevelopment.\n  I think we are destroying ourselves by not admitting as a society \nthat partial-birth abortion is an evil against humanity. I believe \nthere will be more and more horrible consequences for our Nation if we \ndo not ban this cruel procedure. As a friend of mine reminded me, no \nculture can be demolished without the voluntary cooperation of at least \na number of its own members. We must stop and ask, to what depths has \nthe American conscience sunk? When it comes to abortion, is there \nnothing to which we will say no? Is there nothing so wrong, so cruel \nthat we will not say, as a society, we will not tolerate this; we will \nnot put up with this; this is going simply too far?\n  Partial-birth abortion is a very clear matter of right and wrong, \ngood versus evil. It is my wish that there will come a day when my \ncolleagues and I no longer have to come to the floor, to debate this \nissue. I hope we have the votes this year to not only pass the partial-\nbirth abortion ban, but also to override the President's veto. We have \nto do it. It is the right thing to do, because innocent children are \ndying every day in America because of this horrible, barbaric \nprocedure.\n  Let us ban this procedure which kills our partially born children, \nand let's do it for our children.\n  I thank the Chair, and thank my colleagues. I congratulate Senator \nSantorum for bringing this matter to the floor, and Senator Smith, who \nhas so long been a proponent of doing away with partial-birth abortion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine for his eloquent remarks that were delivered in such a way as to \ntouch the conscience of all of us. I join him in also thanking Senator \nSantorum for his insightful, intelligent, and passionate commitment to \nending this horrible procedure which, by any definition, is not good \nfor this country.\n  I also appreciate the leadership of Senator Bob Smith, who is here \ntonight. Senator Smith started this debate a number of years ago. I \ndon't know if people thought he was even telling the truth about it or \nnot. They didn't know it was really going on. But as time has gone by, \nwe have seen more and more that this procedure is horribly true and \nmuch more common than we knew.\n  This is a bipartisan effort, Republicans and Democrats. We have \njoined together, and I think it is important we work together to not \njust talk about this problem but to end it.\n\n[[Page S12906]]\n\n  Some, I think, would prefer not knowing about it. They do not want to \nbe told the gruesome details of this procedure; how a child, a baby, \njust 3 inches from birth, is deliberately and systematically killed. \nThat is not something people want to talk about. They cringe and wish \nit would go away. I wish the procedure would go away. Unfortunately, it \nhas not. It is so cruel, so inhumane, and so unnecessary, I believe \nthis legislation is justified and necessary to prevent it.\n  A number of people during this debate have expressed concern about \nthe life of the mother. I have heard this argument during my time on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, serving with Senator DeWine and others. \nWe have had a number of hearings on this subject.\n  The bill, crafted by Senator Santorum, provides for this contingency. \nIt would permit this procedure, partial-birth abortion, but only ``to \nsave the life of a mother whose life is endangered by physical \ndisorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-\nendangering physical condition caused by or arising from pregnancy \nitself.''\n  These are the kinds of exceptions that are in this bill. Some may \nsay, as most physicians do, that these exceptions are not necessary. It \nis never the kind of occurrence that would justify this procedure. But \nit is in this bill. It makes me wonder why those who are concerned \nabout the health of the mother are not able to read those words and \nunderstand them. The truth is clear. This bill will not endanger the \nlife of the mother.\n  The fact is, the American Medical Association has noted that this \nprocedure is never medically necessary. It is not the kind of procedure \nwe need to use. It is a convenient procedure that abortionists have \nfound they like to use. I don't think it is necessary and it should be \noutlawed.\n  So there is broad bipartisan support for the bill from both pro-life \nand pro-choice people. I think that shows what we are debating goes \nbeyond the traditional debate on abortion. This support exists because \nthe partial-birth abortion procedure deeply offends our sensibilities \nas human beings and as a people who care for one another, who know that \nlife is fragile and believe that people need to be treated with respect \nand dignity and compassion. The Declaration of Independence notes life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, those are ideals of American \nlife. A child partially born has those rights ripped from them in a \nmost vicious way.\n  This is a dangerous policy. It is a thin line, a thin thread that we \nare justifying a procedure that is so much and, I think, in fact is \ninfanticide. It is an unjustifiable procedure we are dealing with.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of debate on the number of \npartial-birth abortions performed each year. The pro-abortion groups \nand others have emphatically insisted that the total number of partial-\nbirth abortions performed was small, and they were only performed in \nextreme medical circumstances. Therefore, they say the Federal \nGovernment should not pass laws about it. But now we know the truth. It \nhas come out in dramatic form. Their issue, that this procedure is rare \nand only for extreme circumstances, has plainly been established to be \nfalse.\n  These claims were either manufactured or disseminated in an attempt \nto minimize the significance of the issue.\n  As reported in a 1997 front-page article in the Washington Times, Mr. \nRon Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers--let me say that again, the executive director of \nthe National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who has been traveling \nthe country and saying these procedures were rare--admitted, that he \nhad ``lied through his teeth'' about the numbers of partial-birth \nabortions performed. Mr. Fitzsimmons estimated ``that up to 5,000 \npartial-birth abortions are performed annually and that they're \nprimarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses.''\n  That is a fact. That is what we are dealing with today. Those who \nwould oppose this procedure, I believe, are not as concerned--or at \nleast are not thinking clearly--when they suggest their opposition is \nbased on their concern for the health and safety of the mother. I say \nto my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, how can we answer to our \nchildren, our constituents, and others if we allow children to be \ndestroyed through this brutal partial-birth abortion procedure? So I \nthink if we are a nation that aspires to goodness, that aspires to be \nabove the course and to reach minimum standards of decency, this \nlegislation is needed.\n  I find it very puzzling that there is such resistance to the banning \nof just this one brutal procedure. I ask myself, what is it? I have \nheard it said that, well, the people who oppose partial-birth abortions \ndo so for religious reasons, as if that is an illegitimate reason. Was \nit illegitimate for Martin Luther King to march for freedom based on \nhis belief in the Scriptures? It is not an illegitimate reason if you \nhave a religious motivation. But that has been a complaint about those \nwho would question this.\n  I have analyzed the opposition to this partial-birth abortion bill \nand I can't see that it can be founded on law. I can't see that it can \nbe founded on science; the AMA says it is not necessary. I can't see \nthat it can be founded on ethics. Certainly, it seems to me that it is \nso close to infanticide--if not in fact infanticide--that it is \ndifficult to see how it could be argued ethically. Why is it? The only \nthing I can see is that there is a sort of secular religious opposition \nto any control whatsoever on abortion--we will never agree to anything, \nany time, anywhere, no matter what you say. We are going to allow these \nprocedures to go forward just as long as the abortionists wish to \nperform them and you, Congress, should never intervene in any aspect of \nit.\n  I don't believe that is a rational argument. It is not justified. \nThis legislation is specific; it is directed to a procedure that all \ngood and decent people, I believe, if they knew the facts and studied \nit, would know to be an unacceptable procedure. It would ban one \nprocedure and it would not affect other abortions. I think all good \nAmericans should be for it. I will be deeply disappointed if the \nPresident of the United States insists once again on vetoing this \nlegislation, which has the overwhelming support of the Members of \nCongress and the American people. I don't see how it is possible that \nwe continue to come back to this floor again and again over this issue. \nBut it is going to continue because the procedure continues. Lives are \nbeing eliminated in a way that is unhealthy and not good for America. \nIt is below the standards to which we ought to adhere. I thank Senator \nSmith, who is here, and Senator Santorum for their leadership and \ndedication to this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I offer my support today of S. 1692, the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999, introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Santorum. Congress has twice passed legislation outlawing \npartial-birth abortion, only to have it vetoed by the President for \nfallacious reasons. It is time that we close this shameful chapter in \nour nation's history during which we have permitted the destruction of \nfully-formed, viable human beings in a most gruesome and shockingly \ncold-hearted manner. If there is a meaningful distinction between this \nabortion procedure and infanticide, it escapes me.\n  I know that there is a certain numbing fatigue that sets in when we \nare forced to once again review the details of the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. But we must not let our aversion to the particulars \nof the procedure cause us to turn away from addressing the cruel \ninjustice of it. I commend Senator Santorum for his persistence in \npursuing this legislation. Congress must keep the pressure on President \nClinton to stop opposing the bill and sign it into law.\n  It is time for President Clinton to abandon the false claim that \nsomehow this bill would jeopardize the health of a mother unless a so-\ncalled health exception permitting the procedure is not added to the \nbill. President Clinton knows that the term ``health'' in the context \nof abortion has become so broadly defined by the Supreme Court that it \nwould strip this bill of any force, and would render the entire bill \nmeaningless. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has denounced this \nfalse argument, asserting that ``partial-birth abortion is never \nmedically\n\n[[Page S12907]]\n\nnecessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility. On the \ncontrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.'' The \nAmerican Medical Association has also expressed support for the \npartial-birth abortion ban, noting that the Santorum bill ``would allow \na legitimate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, \nthereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically \nnecessary steps to save the life of the mother.''\n  The bottom line is, the alternative bill that has been offered by the \nminority leaders in the past, and which we will likely see again, \nextends no real protection at all to unborn children. Again, the so-\ncalled health exception it adopts essentially renders the bill \nmeaningless, and offers opponents to the Santorum bill only a cosmetic, \npublic relations cover to veil their commitment that abortion should be \nfree of any reasonable restrictions.\n  To allow this partial-birth procedure to continue to be performed \nacross our land cheapens the value of life at all stages, for the \nunborn, the physically handicapped, and the feeble elderly. Our \ngovernment must affirm life and not let our civil society decay into a \nmentality that only the strong and self-sufficient should survive and \nthe weak can be considered expendable.\n  President Clinton once said that he wanted abortion to be ``safe, \nlegal, and rare.'' He has worked very hard to keep it ``legal,'' in the \nsense of being completely free of any restrictions. It is now time for \nCongress and the President to make the partial-birth method of abortion \ntruly rare by passing and signing S. 1692.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I rise today to oppose the so-called \n``Partial Birth'' Abortion Ban.\n  In 1973 the Supreme Court held that women have a constitutional right \nto an abortion. That decision--Roe v. Wade--was carefully crafted to be \nboth balanced and responsible while holding the rights of women in \nAmerica paramount in reproductive decisions. This decision held that \nwomen have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after viability, \nstates could ban abortions as long as they allowed exceptions for cases \nin which a woman's life or health is endangered.\n  The legislation before us today is in direct violation of the Court's \nruling. It does not ban postviability abortions as its sponsors claim, \nbut it does ban an abortion procedure regardless of where the woman is \nin her pregnancy. And this legislation, as drafted, does not provide an \nexception for the health of the mother as required by law, and provides \na very narrow life exception. In fact, the legislation's exception only \nallows that the ban, and please let me quote from the bill here, \n``shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save \nthe life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, \nillness, or injury.'' Not her health, but only her life.\n  There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching \ndecision for a woman. No one would debate this. And when a woman must \nconfront this decision during the later stages of a pregnancy because \nshe knows the pregnancy presents a direct threat to her own life or \nhealth, the ramifications of such a decision multiply dramatically.\n  We stand on the floor of this body day after day and pontificate on \nlaws, treaties, appropriations bills, and budget resolutions. But how \noften do we really, truly consider how a piece of legislation will \naffect someone specific . . . a wife or a husband . . . a mother or a \nfather? And I don't mean knowing how the budget numbers or \nappropriations will generally help our constituents, I mean considering \nthe very, very personal lives of our constituents.\n  This last March the Lewiston Sun Journal, a paper in my home state of \nMaine, ran an article about a woman in Maine, one of the women that I \nwas elected to represent, who had faced the heartbreaking decision of a \nlate-term abortion. Before I tell my colleagues her story, I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Barbara and her husband had been ecstatic \nwhen they discovered that they were expecting a child--an unborn \ndaughter they would name Tristan. But this anticipation and delight \nturned to profound sorrow when, at 20 weeks into the pregnancy Tristan \nwas diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Edwards' syndrome. An \nextra chromosome in Tristan's DNA had caused lethal abnormalities.\n  The Sun Journal reports that ``Their daughter would have severe heart \nand gastrointestinal problems, they were told. In an ultrasound image, \nthey could already see cystic tissue forming on top of Tristan's brain \nand partly outside of the skull tissue. The shape of her stomach and \ndiaphragm muscle were abnormal. Her diaphragm was perforated. Her \nstomach was growing in her heart and lung cavity. In all likelihood \nTristan wouldn't be born alive. She probably would suffocate before \nthat because her lungs would be so underdeveloped. Barbara and her \nhusband were told that no surgery could or would be possible.'' In \nfact, doctors predicted that Tristan would probably die before she was \nborn. And if not, she had a 95 percent chance of dying before her first \nbirthday.\n  Barbara told the Sun Journal that ``It seemed to us that it would be \ncruel, that it would be absolute torture to put our little girl through \nthe pregnancy. . . . With her heart and her lungs being crushed by her \nstomach and her diaphragm. We were worrying what it would feel like. \nWhat sensation she might be experiencing as the cystic tissue continued \nto grow on her brain.'' And as Barbara and her husband consulted other \nmedical specialists and prayed over the fate of their daughter, Barbara \nremembers that ``I was so afraid for my baby. I didn't want her to feel \nany pain in the last hours of her life. . . . It wasn't really life \nyet. She wasn't born.''\n  Barbara remembers that ``Loving the baby was never part of the \ndiscussion. . .. Of course you would love the baby no matter what was \ngoing on, disability or healthy. I think sometimes there's a \nmisperception about that, that love might be conditional based on \nwhether it's a perfect fetus or not.''\n  This family in Maine is what the debate today is really about--when \ndoes the State have the right to tell Barbara and her husband that they \ncannot have the abortion they believe to be the best medical procedure? \nA procedure that will protect her health and her future fertility? At \nthe very end of her story, Barbara tells the Sun Journal that women who \nhave abortions are unfortunately ``portrayed as some kind of careless \nmonsters without any kind of moral direction. The people who know me \nwould be aghast that that's how I'm seen by people who don't even know \nme.''\n  I stand before this body today and I am saddened that there are those \nout there who would so judge Barbara and her husband. Because I do \nbelieve they have moral direction--and I don't believe that I or my \nfellow Senators should be able to tell them when a decision such as \nthis is wrong or medically inappropriate. I don't believe that I have \nthe medical training necessary to decide when one type of medical \nprocedure is best used over an alternative procedure.\n  And let there be no doubt about it, this legislation does nothing but \ncreate an inflammatory political issue. This legislation does nothing \nto end postviability abortion--nothing--or to prevent unwanted \npregnancies. And courts around the country have recognized this.\n  In fact, of the 30 states that have enacted legislation banning so-\ncalled ``partial birth'' abortions, there have been 21 court challenges \nand 19 of these challenges have been either partially or fully enjoined \nwhile their constitutionality is considered. Four U.S. Courts of Appeal \nhave ruled on the issue--and just this September, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed three trial court injunctions \non partial birth abortion bans in Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska.\n  When the Kentucky District Court overturned its State's ban on these \nso-called ``partial birth'' abortions this year, the author of the \ndecision, the Honorable John G. Heyburn, II, said ``By adopting a \nconsiderably less precise definition of a partial birth abortion, the \nlegislature not only defined the terms of its prohibition, but also \nsaid a lot about its own collective intent. Though the Act calls itself \na partial birth abortion ban, it is not. The\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\ntitle is misleading, both medically and historically. . . . A few \n[legislators] seem to disregard the constitutional arguments and push \nfor language which they believed would make abortions more \ncontrollable.''\n  And though proponents of this legislation claim that these bans \naddress only one abortion procedure, courts have disagreed. Last year, \nthe Honorable Charles P. Kocoras, a U.S. District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois, also struck down an Illinois law banning \nthese so-called partial birth abortions. In his opinion Judge Kocoras \nstated that, ``[The Act] has the potential effect of banning the most \ncommon and safest abortion procedures. . . . To ensure that her conduct \ndoes not fall within the statute's reach, the physician will probably \nstop performing [all] such procedures. . . . Because the standard in \n[the Act] effectively chills physicians from performing most abortion \nprocedures, the statue is an undue burden on a woman's constitutional \nright to seek an abortion before viability.''\n  And this year, the Honorable G. Thomas Porteous, writing for U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana said that the \nLouisiana ``Partial Birth'' Abortion ban ``advances neither maternal \nhealth nor potential life and clearly would create undue burdens on a \nwoman's right to choose abortion. At most, the Act may force women \nseeking abortions to accept riskier or costlier abortion procedures \nwhich nevertheless result in fetal death.''\n  Riskier or costlier? At what price? Can you ask Barbara and her \nhusband to risk that? They desperately wanted their baby--and though \nthey were faced with losing her they knew that they would want to try \nagain. Four years later they have a beautiful 2\\1/2\\-year-old daughter. \nBut they would not have this daughter nor even had the chance to try \nagain had Barbara been forced to have a procedure that threatened her \nability to have another child. What if the riskier or costlier \nprocedure Judge Porteous referred to had been a total hysterectomy?\n  Is this what we really want? To put Barbara's health and life at \nrisk? To put women's health and lives at risk? Shouldn't these most \ncritical decisions be left to those with medical training, and not \npoliticians?\n  I believe so. I believe that a decision such as this should only be \ndiscussed between a woman, her family, and her physician. I am \nabsolutely and fundamentally opposed to all post-viability abortions \nexcept in the instances of preserving the life of or preventing \ngrievous physical injury to the woman. This legislation neither \nprovides for those exceptions nor does it prevent post-viability \nabortions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n           [From the Lewiston (ME) Sun Journal, Mar. 7, 1999]\n\n                      Abortion: One Woman's Story\n\n                       (By Christopher Williams)\n\n       For weeks Barbara and her husband had consulted medical \n     experts and researched scientific journals. They meditated \n     and prayed.\n       To the visible mound protruding above her waist Barbara \n     spoke quietly, lovingly. She sang to it. She sometimes felt \n     the light flutter of kicks.\n       The day before final tests had confirmed the diagnosis, \n     Barbara and her husband had named their unborn daughter \n     Tristan, which means tears and sadness.\n       Then the time came for Barbara's decision.\n       It's not the kind of choice that any mother ever wants to \n     have to make.\n       She would have an abortion.\n       ``I didn't feel like I was taking my baby's life away,'' \n     she says ``I felt like it had already been taken away from \n     her. And all that was left for me to have any control over \n     was what was going to be the least painful for her.''\n\n\n                            quality of life\n\n       It was the last day of summer.\n       Barbara made the 2\\1/2\\-hour trip from her Camden home to \n     Portland. She rocked all night in a motel room, crying, \n     unable to stop.\n       At 20-weeks, Tristan had been diagnosed with a rare genetic \n     disease called Edwards' syndrome. An extra chromosome had \n     caused ``lethal'' abnormalities.\n       Doctors said Tristan would probably die before she was \n     born. If not, she had a 95 percent chance of dying before her \n     first birthday. No surgical options could correct the \n     multiple birth defects.\n       ``It seemed to us that it would be cruel, that it would be \n     absolute torture to put our little girl through the \n     pregnancy,'' Barbara recalls. ``With her heart and her lungs \n     being crushed by her stomach and her diaphragm. We were \n     worrying what it would feel like. What sensation she might be \n     experiencing as the cystic tissue continued to grow on her \n     brain.''\n       As Barbara continued rocking in her motel room, cramps from \n     medicine preparing her for the abortion gripped her insides.\n       ``I was so afraid for my baby. I didn't want her to feel \n     any pain in the last hours of her life,'' she says adding, \n     ``It wasn't really life yet. She wasn't born.''\n       She also was ``grateful'' that she didn't live in a state \n     that would ``force me to carry her to term because I knew at \n     that moment, in those hours, that if I had, I probably would \n     have cracked up.''\n       The strain would likely have landed end of the process. To \n     have done that, feels to me, like it would have been the \n     epitome of selfishness.''\n       The last few days, Barbara had been jolted awake by \n     nightmares, including ``ghastly images.'' In one of the \n     dreams, a python had devoured her youngest niece.\n       The dishes had piled up in the sink. Housework was \n     forgotten. Tristan was the only thing they talked about.\n\n\n                              the abortion\n\n       The abortion was scheduled for Sept. 23, the first day of \n     fall.\n       There was only one place in Maine where an abortion could \n     be performed in the 20th week of a pregnancy.\n       Barbara would have a procedure called a dilation and \n     extraction. Her cervix was slowly dilated. Then the fetus was \n     extracted. The method would be less damaging to her uterus \n     and therefore to her future fertility.\n       Rain poured down. By noon the sky had darkened, turning an \n     eerie greenish yellow. Barbara imagined it was ``crying as \n     deeply as I was because that day I was losing Tristan.''\n       She wandered around the halls of the hospital guided by her \n     husband's hand on her elbow. She remembers staring at signs, \n     but not understanding their meaning. Studying the words, she \n     didn't know what she was reading.\n       In the waiting room, she shook uncontrollably and kept \n     breaking into sobs, consoled by her husband.\n       ``I couldn't stop them. I kept trying to think of anything \n     to shut down the tears. Sitting in that waiting area. Just \n     kept crying and waiting.''\n       A nurse's clipboard recorded Barbara's demeanor as \n     ``appears emotional.''\n       The abortion took 45 minutes. She asked for general \n     anesthesia. Then she spent about an hour recovering before \n     she was allowed to leave the hospital.\n       Driving back to Camden, she reclined in the seat, putting \n     her feet on the dashboard. It was raining even harder.\n       ``The sky was so dark. And it was only mid-afternoon, early \n     evening. It was much darker than it should have been.''\n\n\n                                 grief\n\n       But that was just the beginning, Barbara says.\n       For the next two years, she cried every day. The first \n     year, several times a day.\n       ``I don't mean light crying, where you can sort of keep it \n     back. I mean it would kind of well up from my center and it \n     just didn't seem to stop. It seemed to be bigger than the \n     person who's doing the crying. There was so much grief over \n     the baby I'd hoped for,'' she says.\n       She wasn't grieving her decision to have the abortion, \n     Barbara says, ``That's a very important distinction,'' That \n     decision was the ``most humane choice possible for Tristan.''\n       Instead, she was grieving for the child she didn't have.\n       ``I had so much grief for the baby that I had fantasized \n     about. A vibrant, healthy little girl.\n       For the two years following her abortion, Barbara was \n     treated by a therapist who helped her to work through the \n     grief.\n       She decided not to join the support groups for parents who \n     suffered the loss of babies due to stillbirth, miscarriage or \n     ``other means,'' as if it's a ``dirty phrase'' to say \n     abortion.\n       Yet, Barbara says she is ``very careful'' about revealing \n     the details of how her pregnancy ended.\n       ``By and large most of the people I'm close with I would \n     describe as moral, ethical people and without exception they \n     were all supportive about the decision we had made, which is \n     not to say they would have done the same thing,'' she says.\n       ``But they seemed to inherently understand that if you're \n     not in the situation, how could you possibly know all the ins \n     and outs of the circumstances and come up with the universal \n     which is right and which is wrong, a cookie-cutter answer for \n     someone else's baby.''\n\n\n                                  fear\n\n       Four years later, Barbara sits on the couch in her cottage \n     overlooking the water. Her legs are tucked under her and her \n     2\\1/2\\-year-old daughter is asleep on her breast.\n       Outside, in the garden, a dark gray angel cherub perched on \n     the edge of a scallop shell keeps watch.\n       A week after the abortion, Barbara and her husband bought \n     the sculpture, which doubles as a bird bath. Each summer, \n     they plant marigolds around it and a bleeding heart behind \n     it.\n       On the first day of November every year, they sprinkle \n     marigold petals from the garden to the steps of the house. \n     It's a Catholic\n\n[[Page S12909]]\n\n     tradition in Mexico performed during the day of the dead, she \n     explains. The petals are intended to lead Tristan back to \n     hearth and home. Barbara learned of the ceremony when she \n     lived in New Mexico and made frequent trips over the border.\n       Their daughter knows about Tristan. Sometimes she wanders \n     over to the angel, talking to the statute and stroking its \n     smooth stone surface.\n       ``She knows there was a baby named Tristan who wasn't born, \n     who was in mommy's tummy,'' Barbara says.\n       Barbara asked that her last name not be used, fearing \n     harassment or intimidation by those who disagree with her \n     decision to seek an abortion.\n       She sees a growing threat to abortion access around the \n     state. A citizens' petition aimed at ``partial birth'' \n     abortions is clearly an attempt to further erode reproduction \n     rights, she says.\n       Although she and her husband collected all of the \n     information about Tristan and discussed the options for \n     weeks, Barbara says he recognized who had to make the final \n     choice.\n       ``He was being very clear that ultimately it was my body \n     that we were talking about.''\n       But others don't.\n       ``Today, we're portrayed as some kind of careless monsters \n     without any kind of moral direction. The people who know me \n     would be aghast that that's how I'm seen by people who don't \n     even know me.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity to state \nmy position on S. 1692, and to explain the reasons why I will again \noppose this legislation.\n  I respect the deeply held views of those who oppose abortion in any \ncircumstances. I have always believed that the decisions in this area \nare best handled by the individuals involved, guided by their own \nbeliefs and unique circumstances, rather than by government mandates.\n  Second, like most Americans, I would prefer to live in a world where \nabortion is unnecessary. I support efforts to reduce the number of \nabortions through family planning and counseling to avoid unintended \npregnancies.\n  I support Roe v. Wade, but I also understand that some restrictions \non abortion can be constitutional when there is a compelling State \ninterest at stake. I have previously voted to ban post-viability \nabortions unless the woman's life is at risk or the procedure is \nnecessary to protect the woman from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. That is why I will vote for the Durbin alternative to S. 1692. \nI conduct a Listening Session in every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties \nevery year. In 1997 and 1998, hundreds of Wisconsin citizens came to \ntalk to me about their serious and sincere concerns that, in some \nnearby states, abortions are being performed very late in pregnancy for \nreasons that they believe are not medically indicated. I support \nlegislation that will actually reduce the total number of late-term \nabortions while providing reasonable exceptions when necessary to deal \nwith serious medical situations. I am disappointed that the proponents \nof S. 1692 have steadfastly refused to accept any amendment, no matter \nhow tightly crafted, which would include provisions to protect women's \nphysical health. This intentionally polarizing approach is the reason \npeople suspect that the objective of the bill is to further a political \nissue rather than change the law.\n  I am concerned that S. 1692 will not stop a single abortion late in \npregnancy. The bill, by prohibiting only one particular procedure, \ncreates an incentive for an abortion provider to switch to a different \nprocedure that is not banned. The Durbin alternative amendment would \nstop abortions by any method after a fetus is viable, except when \nserious medical situations dictate otherwise.\n  I am supporting the Durbin amendment because it recognizes that, in \nsome circumstances, women suffer from severely debilitating diseases \nspecifically caused or exacerbated by a pregnancy or are unable to \nobtain necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition while \ncarrying a pregnancy to term. The exceptions in the Durbin amendment \nare limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy is \nmedically indicated. It retains the option of abortion for mothers \nfacing extraordinary medical conditions, such as: breast cancer, \npreeclampsia, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, for which \ntermination of the pregnancy may be recommended by the woman's \nphysician due to the risk of grievous injury to the mother's physical \nhealth or life. In contrast, S. 1692 provides no such exception to \nprotect the mother from grievous injury to her physical health. At the \nsame time, by clearly limiting the medical circumstances where post-\nviability abortions are permitted, this legislation prohibits these \nprocedures in cases where the mother's health is not at such high risk.\n  I also feel very strongly that Congress should seek to restrict \nabortions only within the constitutional parameters set forth by the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I would have preferred that S. 1692 had been \nreviewed by the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, rather than \nhaving been placed straight on the Senate calendar. I believe S. 1692 \nraises significant constitutional questions, and with court decisions \nin 19 of the 21 states where state legislation similar to S. 1692 has \nbeen challenged, the Judiciary Committee should have reviewed this bill \nprior to its consideration on the Senate floor.\n  S. 1692, by prohibiting a procedure whenever it is used, breaches the \nCourt's standard that the government does not have a compelling \ninterest in restricting abortions prior to fetal viability. However, I \nam also aware that some of the recent decisions on state legislation \nsimilar to S. 1692 raises questions about whether an exception for \ngrievous physical injury may be too narrow. To date I have supported \nthis very narrow definition of the exception necessary to protect the \nphysical health of the woman while balancing concerns that abortion \nlate in pregnancy should only be used in rare circumstances. I have \nspecifically voted for the Daschle amendment last Congress, legislation \nwhich exactly reflects this position. The Durbin amendment contains \nsimilar language.\n  The Durbin amendment goes farther than the Daschle amendment in \nensuring that the exceptions to the ban on post-viability abortions are \nproperly exercised. It requires a second doctor to certify the medical \nneed for a post-viability abortion. The second doctor requirement is \nintended to ensure that post-viability abortions take place only when \ncontinuing the pregnancy would prevent the woman from receiving \ntreatment for a life-threatening condition related to her physical \nhealth or would cause a severely debilitating disease or impairment to \nher physical health.\n  The Durbin alternative amendment strikes the right balance between \nprotecting a woman's constitutional right to choose abortion and the \nright of the state to protect future life. It protects a woman's \nphysical health throughout her pregnancy, while insisting that only \ngrievous, medically diagnosable conditions could justify aborting a \nviable fetus. Both fetal viability and women's health would be \ndetermined by the physician's best medical judgement, as they must be, \nin concurrence with another physician.\n  I hope, as we vote today, we do so in full knowledge of the strong \nfeelings about this issue on all sides. We should respect these \ndifferences, avoid efforts to confuse or trick each other and the \npublic, and maintain a level of debate that reflects the importance of \nascertaining the truth about this issue and finding responses that are \nsensitive and constitutionally sound.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Hampshire \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat immediately following my remarks there be a period for the \ntransaction of routine morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the \nSenators from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and Alabama, Mr. Sessions, for their \nkind remarks. It has been a long, long struggle, and we are still not \nthere yet. It is very frustrating to this Senator, who initially came \nto the floor in the mid-1990s, the early 1990s, in 1994 and 1995, where \nI found out these kinds of procedures were occurring, the so-called \npartial-birth abortions. I was shocked and I could not believe that in \nAmerica we would be doing anything like this. This is America, I \nthought, we can't be killing children inches from birth. It makes no \nsense.\n  So I sought answers and talked to a number of people, including a \nnurse who had witnessed them. After getting all of that information \ntogether, I decided to write a bill banning partial-\n\n[[Page S12910]]\n\nbirth abortions. Here we are. Each time we have passed it here, it has \nbeen vetoed by the President of the United States, regretfully. I think \nit has been two or three times now. There will be another veto coming \nif we pass it again. But initially, when we started, we only had 25 to \n35 votes on the floor because we were told it was only four or five \ntimes a year. Then we were told it was maybe 15 times a year. As the \nyears progressed, we found out this is on demand and is not strictly \nfor abnormalities at all but, rather, on demand, for any reason, if a \nwoman chooses to have such a procedure.\n  So it has been a long struggle. As I listened to the debate--and I \nhave been on the floor all day listening to my friend, Rick Santorum, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, who has done such an outstanding job on \nthis issue. He is very passionate. You need to be passionate on this \nissue. I don't know how anybody can come down on the floor of the \nSenate and talk about this issue and not be passionate. We are killing \nunborn children who are in the process of exiting the birth canal. That \nis what needs to be understood. I ask my fellow Americans and my \ncolleagues, don't we have better things to do than that here in \nAmerica?\n  I am proud to say that I, to some extent, exposed this horrible \nprocedure, establishing that it did take place. I am proud to say that \nI exposed it for what it is--infanticide, or murder. That is what it \nis. We are killing children as they exit the birth canal, and we are \nputting all kinds of labels on this process. We are saying all kinds of \nthings to cover up what is happening. I remember--how well I remember--\nthe incredible amount of flack I got for standing on the Senate floor \nwith a plastic medical doll. The liberal press called it a plastic \nfetus. There is no such thing. It was a medical doll. And with a pair \nof scissors, I demonstrated how this process worked because I thought \nthe American people needed to know what was happening.\n  I was terrorized, if you will, by the press, bashed, called a \n``right-wing extremist,'' and ``out of the mainstream.'' Of course, \nthose people who commit these acts of violence against these children \nare not extreme in the eyes of the media, which is fascinating.\n  President Bill Clinton personally came to my State, as did Vice \nPresident Gore, as did Mrs. Clinton, and campaigned against my \nreelection in 1996 on this issue. It was ugly; it was nasty; it was \nbrutal. But, you know, for every one of those arrows that I took, I \nsaid to myself, it is all worth it because these children can't speak \nfor themselves. They do not have the opportunity to stand here on the \nSenate floor. They don't have a representative here unless we do it for \nthem. They don't get a chance to say I would like to be born. They \ndon't have that opportunity.\n\n  So I am proud to take every arrow they can throw, shoot, or whatever \nthey want to do. I take it as a badge of honor. And I am glad to do it.\n  I got an incredible amount of flak from the media on this to the \nextent that they have distorted what I said. It is interesting to read \n``mainstream'' respectable papers such as the New York Times and find \nthat they cannot get it right. We called a number of times to correct \nthese papers and reporters to tell them that the things they were \nsaying I did I didn't do.\n  For example, they said, as I indicated earlier, that I waved a \nplastic fetus around on the floor of the Senate when it was a little \nmedical doll. They did get the scissors right. They also then said I \nshowed pictures of aborted children on the floor of the Senate, \nphotographs, which was not true. I showed a photograph of a child who \nhad been born prematurely and had lived. That, I did show. In fact, \nsome of them went so far as to say that I actually showed photographs \nof an actual abortion, which, again, was not true. They had a heyday at \nmy expense. I lived through it all. I am proud of it.\n  People said, well, you know you made a mistake, Senator, that almost \ncost you your election last time. You know you did all of this on the \nSenate floor.\n  I would do it again. I am going to do it again right now for whatever \ntime it takes for me to make the point that I want to make tonight.\n  There are several points that I want to make.\n  One of them that I want to make is that this is a disgusting, dark, \nhorrible game we are in, this abortion industry. And somebody needs to \ntake a flashlight or, bigger than that, a searchlight and shine it into \nthis industry so that we find out exactly what is going on in this \nabortion industry. It is not just partial-birth abortion. It is \nabortion in general.\n  It is a dirty business. It is a profitable business. There are people \nmaking money out there at the expense of young women, young mothers, \nwho are in a terrible dilemma. They are making money on them.\n  We are going to find out, as I move through my presentation tonight, \nthat we are going to be talking about some things in this industry that \naren't too pleasant. It is not just that they are making money on the \nwomen. We will get into that a little bit further in a moment.\n  But I think most Americans, if they knew what was going on, would be \ndisgusted, appalled, sickened, and angry that such a brutal act as \nkilling a child with scissors to the back of the head, with no \nanesthesia, in the act of birth, would go on in this America--\ndefenseless in America, a defenseless little unborn child. We do it at \nrandom. We do it 4,000 times a day, every day--not just partial birth \nbut abortions in general, 4,000 of them every single day. We don't know \nhow many partial births. It doesn't matter; it is still the killing of \na child.\n  I ask my colleagues and those who may be watching out across America \ntonight: If you saw an article in your local paper tomorrow that said \nthat all of the puppies and all of the kittens in your local SPCA that \nno one adopted were going to be killed tomorrow with no anesthetics, \nwith a needle to the back of the head to suck out the brains of those \nanimals, what would be your reaction? I guarantee you there would be \npeople marching down in front of the SPCA, and it wouldn't happen. But \nthat is what we are doing to our children.\n\n  I know it is not pleasant to talk about. I don't like to talk about \nit.\n  I wish I didn't have to stand on the floor of the Senate as some of \nthe great orators and great Senators of all time have stood and debated \nthe issues of the day. Think about it, the issues of the Civil War, the \nissues of federalism, and civil rights, all of the great issues of the \nday that have been debated right here with some of the greatest \npeople--John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, at whose desk I sit--the great \ndebates that have taken place in here. Yet because this President \nrefuses to stop this procedure, we are down here now again for the \nfifth or sixth time debating this again trying to stop this horrible, \nhorrible procedure that kills unborn children.\n  Why are we surprised, my fellow Americans, when we pick up the \nnewspaper and read somewhere that a mother flushes her child down the \ntoilet or that somebody shoots somebody in school? Why should that \nsurprise you? What message are we giving to our children? We are \ntelling them every day: Children, you are expendable. You are not \nimportant. Go to school today, Johnny. You be a good boy. While you are \nin school doing your class work, and then you come home to do your \nhomework, we are going to abort your sister.\n  Kids understand. They know what is going on. They are smarter than \nyou think they are. They know what is going on. They read about this \nstuff. They hear it. Some of them are listening to this debate right \nnow. They know what is happening.\n  Yet as horrible as this procedure is, and as many times as so many \npeople have been down on this floor, as my two colleagues a moment ago \ndid, eloquently discussing this issue and talking about how horrible it \nis, as I have done, as Senator Santorum has done in great detail over \nthe years, as many times as we talk about it, we still can't get enough \nvotes to override the veto of the President of the United States.\n  It is frustrating. I tried one time to meet with the President of the \nUnited States personally on this issue. I asked him for 15 minutes of \nhis time. I said, I will go on the record, off the record, with staff, \nwithout staff, personally, with just you and me, whatever you want. \nJust give me 15 minutes. I couldn't get it. He wouldn't deal with me. \nHe wouldn't talk with me about it.\n\n[[Page S12911]]\n\n  This procedure that kills a child, as you have seen it described--I \nwill not go through the description again--is legal in all 50 States of \nthe United States of America.\n  In addressing the controversy over the partial-birth abortion method, \nthe National Abortion Federation has written to its membership and said \ndon't apologize for this process. Do not be on the defensive for \nkilling children this way because it is a legal procedure. It is legal \nto do this. So don't apologize for it. When somebody says, oh, you \nknow, you took scissors to the back of a head and you killed a little \nbaby coming out of the birth canal, don't apologize for that, they say. \nIt is right in their literature because it is legal.\n  This is America. America, America, we sure need help. If we ever \nneeded God to shed his grace on this great country, it is now. We are \nkilling the posterity that the Founding Fathers talked about--our \nposterity, our children. We are killing them every single day--not just \nwith partial-birth abortion but with all abortions--4,000 a day. Think \nof it: 4,000 abortions a day in this country; 4,000 children--children. \nLet's use the correct term.\n\n  Many of my opponents argue that this procedure is necessary to \npreserve the health of the mother. I am going to dispel that myth in \ngreat detail in a little while. I hope you are listening because it is \na myth. It is not done for the health of the mother; it is done for the \nprofit of the abortionist.\n  President Clinton twice vetoed this legislation with false and \ndeceptive information and justification.\n  How does partially delivering a living child and then restraining it \nfrom exiting the birth canal so that only the head remains in the womb \npossibly enhance the health of a mother?\n  I have asked that question on the floor 100 times, and I can't get an \nanswer. You have to understand now. The child is exiting the birth \ncanal. The abortionist is holding the child--actually holding that \nchild--in his or her hands and forcefully stopping the head from \nexiting the birth canal because once the head exits the birth canal, it \nis a birth. It is a birth.\n  What is he holding? Is that not a child? What is that part of the \nbody? The feet, the legs, the torso, the shoulders, the hands, what is \nthat? That is not supposed to be a child? If the baby turned around and \nexited headfirst, you couldn't do it because then it is born.\n  That is a pretty fine line. That is a pretty fine line. They do that \nin the name of the mother's health? You have got to be kidding me.\n  What is wrong with this country? Where are we going? We have to stand \ndown here on the floor of this Senate and protect and fight to protect \nthe lives of children, our children, killed in this way every day in \nAmerica, every day. We can't win because the President will veto what \nwe pass with about 63 or 64 votes. He will veto it. We need 67 votes.\n\n  President Clinton's claim that partial-birth abortions are only \nundertaken to protect the mother from serious injury to her health has \nbeen conclusively proven to be false. When he says that--and he will \nwhen he vetoes it--he is not telling the truth. In fact, the vast \nmajority of partial-birth abortions are performed on perfectly healthy \nwomen with perfectly healthy babies--that is the truth--80 to 90 \npercent, perfectly healthy women, mothers and babies.\n  The Nation's leading practitioner of partial-birth abortion, Dr. \nMartin Haskell of Ohio, has been quoted extensively today. He said in \nthe American Medical Association's American Medical News:\n\n       I'll be quite frank. Most of my abortions are elective, in \n     that 20 to 24 week range. In my particular case, probably 20 \n     percent are for genetic reasons and the other 80 percent are \n     purely elective.\n\n  That is the abortionist speaking. That is not me. It is not some pro-\nlife organization. That is the abortionist.\n  He said 20 to 24 weeks; 24 weeks is a 6-month fetus.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a phone call I received in my \noffice a few months ago from a 9-year-old girl. She said to me: \nSenator, I heard you were very much pro-life. I want to give a message \nthat I would like you to share with your colleagues and with the \nAmerican people as you travel around the country.\n  She said: I want them to know that I'm now 9 years old but my Mommy \ngave birth to me at 5 months; she was 5 months pregnant, and I lived \nand am here to tell you and tell America that babies at 5 or 6 months \nin the womb can survive. I'm glad my Mommy didn't pick that option.\n  When somebody says we are not taking the lives of unborn children, we \nare not taking the lives of people who have an opportunity to be \nproductive members of our society, they are wrong.\n  At the White House veto ceremony Mr. Clinton hosted the last time he \nvetoed the partial-birth abortion ban, he presented five women at a \npress conference whom the President said ``had to make a lifesaving, \ncertainly health saving but still tragic decision, to have the kind of \nprocedure that would be banned by H.R. 1833.'' That is, the ban of \npartial-birth abortions.\n  The President around this town and around America doesn't have the \ngreatest reputation for telling the truth, and he didn't tell the truth \nthere either. Despite saying those five women had health-saving \npartial-birth abortions, one of the women involved in the press \nconference later publicly admitted neither her abortion nor those of \nany of the other four women was actually medically necessary.\n  Two days after the ceremony, one of the five women, Claudia Ades, \nappeared by telephone on a radio show in Mobile, AL, and quotations \nfrom the interview appear in the May-June 1996 edition of the newspaper \nHeterodoxy. During the course of the radio show, she told Mr. Malone, \nthe MC: This procedure was not performed in order to save my life. This \nprocedure was not performed in order to save my life.\n  This procedure was elective. That is considered an elective \nprocedure, as were the procedures of all the other women who were at \nthe White House veto ceremony.\n  Here again, President Bill Clinton is using people and not telling \nthe truth.\n  The health-of-the-mother exception is so broadly defined, it would \ninclude the mother's emotional health, let alone physical health.\n  I don't enjoy talking about this stuff on the Senate floor. I don't \nenjoy standing here and talking about the fact we are killing our \nchildren. Who does? If we don't, it will keep on happening. Some in \npolitics, some even in the Republican Party, the pro-life party in \nAmerica supposedly, said we shouldn't talk about this issue; it is too \ncontroversial; let's sweep it under the rug and try to be less \nconfrontational, be more together.\n  I don't believe we ever would have ended slavery or segregation or \nany of the other great issues we resolved in American history if we \nhadn't talked about it, if we hadn't faced it. Suppose Lincoln had \nsaid: I'm totally opposed to slavery, but my neighbor wants to own a \ncouple of slaves; that is OK with me; I will not make a big deal out of \nit.\n  So we can take that approach on abortion and say, I'm personally \nopposed to abortion but my neighbor wants to have an abortion; that is \nOK with me.\n  Somebody has to stand up for 4,000 babies a day who are being killed \nin this country by all abortions. I don't mind being that person, I \nwill be very honest. If that means I lose an election somewhere, that \nis fine with me. I am not here to compromise my views to win elections. \nI am here to lead, to stand up on principle. Otherwise, I don't want to \nbe here. Anybody who stands here and says they are afraid to discuss \nthis issue or won't come down here and discuss this issue because they \nare afraid they might leave ought to resign because they are not \nbringing dignity to this body. They should stand up and passionately \nfight for what they believe.\n\n  I will review in a few moments some very dirty, disgusting little \nsecrets about the abortion industry in this country. It doesn't apply \nstrictly to any one type of abortion; it applies to abortions in \ngeneral. It is not pleasant. It is not pretty. It is pretty graphic. \nBut I am going to talk about it because the American people need to \nunderstand what is going on. These children don't have a voice. They \ncan't ask for the opportunity to be born.\n  Imagine, since Roe v. Wade passed--and we will have a vote on that \nvery shortly, tomorrow, this infamous Roe v. Wade decision in 1973--40 \nmillion babies have died in this country. I don't want anyone to \nmisunderstand me lest\n\n[[Page S12912]]\n\nI be accused of misusing facts. All abortions, including partial-birth \nabortions--40 million babies.\n  Have you ever stopped to think what some of those babies might have \ngrown up to be had they had the chance? I wonder if there is a \nPresident in that group. How about a doctor? How about a cure for \ncancer? Maybe there is a scientist who would cure breast cancer--\nwouldn't that be ironic--or cure any type of cancer, or perhaps \ndiscover some big secret in the universe, maybe even a Senator. Never \nto have a chance to live their dream, never to have a chance to grow \nup, have a family, to pursue their dreams--gone, down the drain. They \ndidn't have a chance to talk about it, didn't have a chance to even ask \nfor mercy; they were just eliminated.\n  Do the math. We have about 260 million Americans. We have killed 40 \nmillion of them in the years since Roe v. Wade, and we have people on \nthis floor bragging about Roe v. Wade, what an important decision it is \nand has been in American history. You bet it is important; they are \nright about that.\n  We took the lives of 40 million of our fellow citizens, 40 million \npeople who never get a chance to pay Social Security taxes or pay any \ntaxes or build any bridges or buy any products or contribute any money \nto the U.S. Treasury, if you want to put it in those terms, never, \nnever had a chance. Mr. President, 40 million children, one-seventh of \nthe entire U.S. population, one-seventh, and we are killing them.\n  You do not think we have some cultural problems in America? \nUnbelievable. I would like to ask all of you listening to answer this \nquestion silently to yourself: If you knew a woman who had three \nchildren born blind, two children born deaf, and one child born \nretarded, she was pregnant again and she had syphilis, would you \nrecommend she have an abortion? Answer to yourselves out there. I will \ngive you a second.\n  Guess who you just killed? Beethoven. That was Beethoven's mother, a \npretty fair contributor, I would say, to the arts of the world, and \nthis country. Who are we, Roe v. Wade? Who are we to do that to the \nBeethovens, the potential Beethovens of the world? This is a sick \nsociety, for people to stand down here and defend that, and that is \nwhat we are doing.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent or more of all abortions are used for birth \ncontrol, 1 or 2 percent of all abortions performed are done because the \nlife of the mother was threatened or she was raped or sexually abused \nby a member of her family--a small minority. That means over 38 million \nabortions occurred for a variety of reasons that boil down to one \nword--convenience. It is convenient. That is what it is, convenience. \nThe mother was too old, maybe too young, in high school, maybe in \ncollege, had to work, didn't have a husband, didn't have a boyfriend; \nit wasn't in her best interests to have the baby; she had her \nwhole life ahead of her. Pick any excuse, pick any reason. Pick the one \nyou like, but that is the reason--convenience. It is a little \ninconvenient, isn't it? I have raised three children. Sure, it is \ninconvenient. But they are beautiful and I am sure glad I have them, \nand I am sure glad nobody made the decision to end their lives.\n\n  I know many of these desperate young mothers myself. I serve on the \nboard of a home for unwed mothers. I have raised money for homes for \nunwed mothers. I have compassion for these mothers and for those who \nhave gone through a horrible experience of having an abortion, or \nstruggling in terms of whether to have the abortion or not, or whether \nto give the child up for adoption or to keep it.\n  I must say to any woman out there listening to me tonight, any \nmother, there are people out there who will help you. There are people \nout there who will help you. You do not have to have an abortion and \nyou don't have to listen to one side of the argument. Ask. If you want \nhelp, call my office; I will put you in touch with people who will help \nyou. It would be my honor and privilege to do that. Don't have an \nabortion; have your child like I did, my wife and I. You will be glad \nyou did when you get down the road. You will be very glad you did.\n  You have other options available, options that will benefit you, that \nwill benefit your child. Choose adoption or choose to keep your child. \nThere are people out there who want to love that child. In either case, \nadoption or keep your baby, choose life. I beg you to do that, please. \nDo it for yourself; don't do it for me. Do it for yourself and for your \nbaby. You will be glad you did. I promise you will. It will be tough \nfor awhile but you will.\n  All across the fruited plains of America runs a river of abortion--\nblood. School shootings, we blame guns for that. After all, it could \nnot possibly be our fault. Babies born alive left in trash cans: A \nyoung woman who goes into a restroom, gives birth to a child and throws \nit in the trash can can be prosecuted for murder. If she had a partial-\nbirth abortion 5 minutes before that happened, it is all legal. Is \nthere any difference in terms of the result, the child? It is still a \nchild, isn't it?\n  Why are we here today? I just told you a few moments ago. It is to \noutlaw a cruel, inhuman procedure used for late-term abortions, a \nprocess so barbaric and so inhuman we would not even do it to animals. \nWe wouldn't even think of it, I promise you. It is not being done to \nanimals anywhere in the country.\n  We fell three votes short last time to override this President. I \nwould give anything to have this President change his mind and not veto \nthis. Do you realize how many children died since then? We don't really \nknow. We know there are thousands who die from partial-birth abortions \nevery year. If you multiply that by 4 or 5 years, we know it is \nprobably in the vicinity of 15,000. I don't know what the number is. \nWhatever it is, it is too many. But hundreds, if not thousands, of \nyoung children are gone, just because the President of the United \nStates refused to sign that bill; three votes short of an override. You \ntalk about whether one vote means something or two votes mean \nsomething? You bet they do. If you are out there somewhere in America \nand you think I am right, you ought to take a look at who your Senators \nare and see how they are voting on this because those votes are going \nto cost lives. We are not talking about budgets. We are not talking \nabout taxes. We are not talking about things such as that. We are not \ntalking about anything other than lives, American lives, little babies.\n  Generically, without singling anybody out, let me speak to those \nSenators out there who might be wavering. I know some of you have been \nstruggling with this vote for 4 years. You know in your heart it is \nwrong to kill unborn children this way. You know it, but you have \nconnections to the abortion industry, the National Abortion Rights \nLeague, and others. I know they pressure you. I know I get pressured on \nthe other side, too. I know what pressure is. We all do. But in your \nheart you know it is wrong. You can stop it. Three more votes or four \nmore votes here can stop this. We can save thousands of lives down the \nroad--thousands.\n  Imagine, if you could, all those children who have died from just \npartial-birth abortion in the last 25 years coming here today. If they \nhad the opportunity to live, what do you think they would say? I don't \nthink they would be with those who say, no, we ought to have this \nprocess. I don't think so. Maybe I am wrong. I have been wrong before.\n  Hold your grandchild in your arms, or your child, and ask yourself: \nHow far removed is that grandchild or child from the process that you \nare voting to allow? A year? A month? Maybe you have a newborn. Think \nabout it. I have.\n  According to the American Medical Association, the partial-birth \nabortion method is never medically necessary--never medically \nnecessary. According to the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, \npartial-birth abortion is likened to infanticide and is considered an \nextremely dangerous procedure.\n  Let me quote from these physicians:\n\n       The prolonged manipulation of the cervix introduces a \n     serious risk of infection and excessive bleeding. Turning the \n     child inside the womb using forceps risks rupture or puncture \n     of the uterus, infection, and hemorrhage from displacing the \n     placenta. Inserting the scissors--a blind procedure--risks \n     cutting the cervix.\n\n  That is one doctor.\n  Another one says:\n\n       Beyond the immediate risks, partial-birth abortion can \n     undermine a woman's future fertility and compromise future \n     pregnancies.\n\n  Many pro-abortion advocates have publicly stated their opposition to \nthe\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\npartial-birth-abortion technique. Warren Hern, the author of the \nNation's most widely used textbooks on late-term abortions, said:\n\n       You really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement \n     that this is the safest procedure to use.\n\n  This leads me to another dirty little secret about the industry which \nis that abortion clinics are losing doctors who are willing to perform \nabortions. Do you know what happens when you lose the ability to \nperform abortions? You lose the ability to make money.\n  My colleagues on the left will assert that they are afraid they are \ngoing to get killed by a pro-life activist. That has happened seven \ntimes, and it is seven times too many, but it has happened. I have \nstatements from the media, the abortion industry, and the doctors \nthemselves that say the reason abortion clinics cannot find doctors is \nbecause they are considered losers in the medical field.\n  Those of us who have been pro-life who have been talking about this \nare making a difference in some of these abortions. Abortionists are \nlosers. They are having such a tough time recruiting abortionists. They \nare actively lobbying right now to force medical students to perform \nabortions. What happened to choice? It is very interesting, isn't it?\n  Listen to these quotes from the abortion industry. I am making these \npoints because I want to lead you into the next issue of what is \nhappening in the industry and why these things are occurring and what \nyou will see where I am leading you in terms of another ugly little \nsecret, dirty little secret about what is happening in addition to the \nabortionists. Here is what Morris Wortman, abortionist, Democrat and \nChronicle, 1992, said:\n\n       Abortion has failed to escape its back-alley associations . \n     . . [it is the] dark side of medicine . . . Even when \n     abortion became legal, it was still considered dirty.\n\n  That was the abortionist.\n  Joe Thompson, retired abortionist, South Bend Tribune, December 26, \n1992:\n\n       In obstetrics and gynecology, the term abortionist is a \n     dirty word.\n\n  Jean Hunt, former executive director, Elizabeth Blackwell Center, \nPhiladelphia, PA, Westchester Daily Local News, November 26, 1992:\n\n       Doctors today see abortion as a mud puddle not worth \n     jumping into.\n\n  David Zbaraz, abortionist, Washington Post, 1980:\n\n       [Abortion is] a nasty, dirty, yukky thing and I always come \n     home angry.\n\n  Another:\n\n       . . . some residents are concerned about being stigmatized \n     for performing abortions and feel they are likely to perform \n     abortions once in practice.\n\n  Abortionist Trent MacKay and Andrea Phillips MacKay, Family Planning \nPerspectives, May and June, 1995.\n\n       Organized medicine has been sympathetic to abortion--not \n     abortionists.\n\n  Carol Joffe, pro-abortion author, 1998.\n  A couple more:\n\n       [Abortion] is a difficult field from an emotional aspect. \n     Some of us, and all of us, I suspect, to some degree or \n     another, have emotional isolation and separation and distance \n     from some of our social friends, certainly from the community \n     and from our professional colleagues.\n\n  George Tiller, abortionist, St. Louis, MO.\n  On the status of abortionists, Warren Hern says.\n\n       . . . status of [abortionists] is somewhere well below the \n     average garage mechanic . . . patients do not value what we \n     do.\n\n  Richard Hausknecht, abortionist, January 1998:\n\n       It's true that abortion providers are perceived as not very \n     good doctors--that they have no alternative so they \n     do abortions, that they cannot earn a living any other \n     way.\n  Is that the kind of person you want to send a woman to because you \nwant to protect her health?\n  Another one. Merle Hoffman, president, Choices Women's Medical \nCenter, Queens, NY, 1995:\n\n       The medical establishment has yet to welcome in abortion \n     providers . . .\n\n  Tom Kring, director, California Planning Clinic:\n\n       Abortion has a stigma attached to it that is increasingly \n     scaring doctors and clinics.\n\n  I think, I say to my colleagues, one of the reasons clinics are \nclosing is because of the doctors. You cannot get a good doctor.\n  Eileen Adams, former administrator for Park Medical Center in \nIllinois which closed after 13 years of operation:\n\n       You cannot get a good doctor.\n\n  Then she said:\n\n       I hate to have that in the paper so the anti-abortionists \n     would say they've won--but they did.\n\n  That is what Eileen Adams said.\n  A 1993 Boston Globe article had this so say:\n\n       Opponents of abortion in New England may have lost the \n     battle of public opinion, but they appear to be winning the \n     war . . . there are no longer enough doctors and hospitals in \n     some areas to provide abortions.\n\n  With all that testimony from within the industry--dirty, yucky, not \nprotecting the health of the mothers--why is it still going on? Because \nthere is another dirty little secret, and it is called fetal tissue \nmarketing. We will take a look at this chart.\n  I want everybody to see what happens in this dirty little secret of \nthe abortion industry. I want my colleagues to know this is the \nabortion industry in general, but abortion is abortion. There are \ndifferent types of abortion. Partial-birth abortion is what is on the \nagenda today. But fetal body parts marketing is what I am talking \nabout.\n  A woman comes into an abortion clinic. It could be Planned \nParenthood. She goes into the clinic, and she is talked to, advised to \nhave an abortion. But what she may or may not know is that inside that \nclinic in a little room somewhere or some office that is not \nnecessarily visible to her, is the harvester, the wholesaler, the \nperson who is going to take her baby, cut it into pieces and sell it.\n  They are going to say: Oh, no, no, no, nobody is selling any babies. \nListen to what I have to say, and then you tell me.\n  The wholesaler and the harvester is in the clinic. This poor woman, \nthis mother, this woman who has probably gone through unimaginable \ntrauma, is now faced with this little secret because she has to sign a \nwaiver that allows them to do it.\n  You have the harvester now who is in that building. Anatomic Gift \nFoundation, Opening Lines--those are the names of a couple of the \nwholesalers.\n  What happens? We will get into that in a few moments.\n  But here is the buyer over here. If you are pro-life, you will be \npleased to know, I am sure, that maybe a university in your State, \nGovernment agencies to which you are paying taxes, pharmaceutical \ncompanies, private researchers, and research organizations are buying \nbody parts.\n  How does this work?\n  Here is step 1. The buyer orders the fetal body parts from the \nwholesaler/harvester. The buyer says: We need a couple of eyes, or \nwhatever. The abortion clinic provides space for the wholesaler and \nharvester in the clinic where that woman goes to procure fetal body \nparts. The wholesaler/harvester faxes an order to the abortion clinic, \nfaxes an order to the clinic, and says: We need this, and we need this, \nand we need this. The wholesaler's technician harvests the organs: \nSkin, limbs, whatever, from aborted babies.\n  Now, bear in mind how gruesome this really is. This is the abortion \nindustry, ladies and gentlemen. Here is a woman coming into that \nclinic, thinking she needs an abortion. She is advised to have it. And \nthese people are sitting around the room, the harvesters. When they are \nlooking at that woman, there is a living child there that has not been \naborted yet, and they are placing orders for body parts--placing orders \nfor body parts--before the child is even dead.\n  The wholesaler's technician harvests the organs. Then the clinic \n``donates'' fetal body parts to the wholesaler/harvester, who in turn \npays the clinic a ``site fee'' for access to the aborted babies. Then \nthe wholesaler/harvester ``donates'' the fetal body parts to the buyer. \nThe buyer then ``reimburses'' the wholesaler/harvester for the cost of \nretrieving the fetal body parts. We are going to get into a little more \ndetail on this.\n  You might say: This is a debate about partial-birth abortion. What \ndoes the sale of fetal tissue have to do with partial-birth abortion?\n  First, like partial-birth abortions, the selling of fetal tissue is \nimmoral and unethical. It is illegal. And it is a reprehensible, dirty \npractice that is\n\n[[Page S12914]]\n\ngoing on in the shadows of the industry. It is a practice I had never \neven heard of. Again, I could not believe this was going on. But it is.\n  Second, it is a practice that very graphically shows how this \nindustry has gone far beyond the ethical boundaries that even most pro-\nchoice Americans would find repugnant.\n  Third, like partial-birth abortion, the industry has taken the \npractice of selling fetal body parts, which is illegal under Federal \ncriminal law, and created a loophole to allow them to do it.\n  In partial-birth abortion, they use the head loophole. In other \nwords, what I mean by that is: Arms, feet, body, neck, heart, toes. \nThat is not birth. That is not the baby--until the head comes into the \nworld. Then it is a baby. Really? It is a legal mumbo jumbo, as Senator \nSantorum talked about. It is a bunch of garbage. It makes lawyers \naround the country very rich, and it allows these clinics to kill our \nchildren.\n  I am sure the legal team that came up with the head loophole is very \nproud of themselves, just as we have the fetal harvesting loophole. In \na sense, we call it ``donations'' or ``reimbursements'' rather than \nselling parts. They are both loopholes to hide the facts.\n\n  Stabbing a baby in the back of the head and sucking its brains out is \nillegal; it is murder; it is infanticide--whether that child is sitting \nin a play pen or whether that child is trying to exit the birth canal \nto become a member of this world. But its head is conveniently, under \nthis stupid legal definition, ``stuck'' in the womb. And it is not \nstuck; it is held there. And they call it medicine. We have people \nstanding down here saying: This is medicine. We're doing this for the \nhealth of the mother. Really?\n  Let's go back to the sale of fetal body parts. I have here the United \nStates Code. Here is what the United States Code says:\n\n       Prohibitions Regarding Human Fetal Tissue.\n\n  That is the topic. That is the heading right here in the United \nStates Code.\n\n       Purchase of tissue. It shall be unlawful for any person to \n     knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any fetal \n     tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects \n     interstate commerce.\n       Criminal penalties for such violations.\n       In general, any person who violates subsection--\n\n  The one I just referenced--\n\n     shall be fined in accordance with title 18, U.S. Code, \n     subject to paragraph 2, or imprisoned for not more than 10 \n     years, or both.\n       The term ``valuable consideration'' does not include \n     reasonable payments associated with the transportation, \n     implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or \n     storage of human fetal tissue.\n\n  It is against the law, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, and \ncolleagues, it is against the law to do this. And they are doing it \nevery day to our children--every day. So 10 years in jail if you sell \nhuman fetal tissue. That was signed into law, ironically, by President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton. It took effect on June 3, 1993.\n  But the lawyers went to work, as only lawyers can do. They found a \nloophole: How can we sell this tissue, make a profit at the expense of \nthis poor woman victim, and get it to research, and hide it all by \ncalling it research? How do we do that without getting caught and \ngetting our tails thrown in jail?\n  That was the question. So they found it in section D(3) which:\n\n       . . . allows reasonable payments associated with the \n     transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, \n     quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.\n\n  That is the loophole I just read out of the book.\n  But because there is no documentation, no disclosure, no government \noversight, this section has become a gigantic loophole to allow this \nindustry to engage in the illegal trafficking of body parts of fetal \ntissue without any prosecution.\n  Mr. President, we need a big beam of light to shine into this \nindustry, to get into the darkness and find out what is going on in \nthis for-profit industry. We need some sunshine. We need it so badly. I \nam not looking to get into the medical records of individuals. That is \nnot what I am about. But I believe if we are going to allow the use of \nfetal tissue from aborted fetuses --I mean aborted fetuses for \nresearch, which I believe we should not--if we are, we need at least a \nminimum of documentation to ensure this tissue is not being sold in \nviolation of Federal criminal law.\n\n  Is partial-birth abortion used for this? I don't know. Why not find \nout? Let's shine the light in. Let's talk about a few things that might \nmake you think, however, that there is a link here. Your call. You \nlisten. You make your own determination.\n  Let us talk about dilation and evacuation, the so-called D, for a \nmoment. This method, which is performed during months 4 to 6, 6 months, \nis particularly gruesome in that the doctor must tear out the baby \nparts with a pliers-like instrument. Literally disassembles it in the \nwomb. It is horrible. No wonder they are angry when they get home and \nsick, sick before they start. Then the nurse gruesomely has to take all \nthese body parts of this child who was torn apart in the womb and \nreassemble them in a pan to be sure they got it all. That is the first \nmethod.\n  I will just ask you to think, as we go through this, if you are in \nthe business of selling body parts, how is that going to work with your \nbuyer, if all the body parts are torn apart? I think you would say, \nwell, probably it isn't going to be much good. There might be some \ntissue, but if you need intact organs, disassembling the organs ought \nto lead you to believe, reasonably, I think, they are probably not very \ngood. If you need a liver and it is all chopped up in this procedure, \nit is probably not going to do you much good. So the D method is not \nreal good for selling body parts. But that is one type of abortion.\n  The next is the saline abortion. This occurs after the first \ntrimester. The abortionist injects a strong salt solution into the \namniotic sac and, over a period of an hour, the baby is basically \npoisoned and burned to death in her mother's womb. That is the saline \nsolution. So now I ask you again, if you are selling body parts, and \nthe buyers want good body parts, good condition, that is not going to \ndo a lot of good. That is not going to make your product very \nmarketable. That is probably not a good method either.\n  The next one is a little more grotesque, if you can imagine that. \nThis is called the dig method, or digoxin method. It is called \nharpooning the whale inside the industry. You see, even in the industry \nthey can't even be respectful to the child or even the woman in some \ncases, the mother. They use terms such as that, ``harpooning the \nwhale.'' The abortionist inserts a needle containing digoxin into the \nabdomen of the woman. In order to make sure the doctor hits the baby \nand not the woman, which would be lethal for her as well, he must watch \nto see the needle begin moving wildly. And when it does move wildly, he \nknows he has harpooned the whale and can push his needle all the way \nthrough and kill the baby. This abortion procedure is probably the \nleast desired method for the body parts people because the baby's \norgans are, in essence, liquefied by this horrible poison. They are \nbasically worthless to the body parts market.\n  Those are three types of abortions. They have nothing to do with \npartial-birth abortion. I use these examples of three types of \nabortions to show you they basically make the sale of body parts \nworthless for the most part. Some tissue I am sure they can use.\n  So where are they getting these things? Ask yourself, what have we \nbeen talking about all day? How can we get a good specimen, a baby \nwhose organs are intact, a good cadaver? You can do it two ways. You \ncould have a live birth and kill it, or you could have a partial-birth \nabortion, kill it that way, and damage only the brain so the rest of \nthe body is good for research.\n  Now, is this happening? Shine the light in. There are going to be \npeople who say that I have made this link. I will tell you right now, I \nhaven't. I am asking you to shine the light into this industry. Bring \nin the sunshine. Let's look in the clinics. Let's find out what is \ngoing on. Are they being used? We will take a look in a few moments at \nsome of the things going on here. I ask you whether or not you think \nthey might be getting these parts from some other source of abortion \nother than partial-birth abortions. I don't know. I know one thing. It \nis a black market. It is illegal. It is unreported, and it is \nunregulated. If it is the last thing I do before I leave this body, I \nwill change that. I am going to change that.\n\n[[Page S12915]]\n\n  The good news is abortion rates are down. That is good. But the \nproblem is, because they are down and because the doctors aren't doing \nthem, they have to make it up somewhere. The industry has to make up \nthe money. They have to make it up. Where do they do that? By selling \nbody parts. That is where they make it up. It is really the dark side \nof the industry.\n  This is the testimony of a woman who calls herself Kelly, a \nfictitious name. Kelly was working and received a service fee from the \nAnatomic Gift Foundation, which is the wholesaler, the harvester, of \nthese organs.\n  Listen to what Kelly had to say. Kelly fears for her life. That is \nwhy Kelly is a fictitious name and why Kelly is not being identified.\n  ``We were never employees of the abortion clinic,'' Kelly explains.\n  That is when they would sit in the clinic, in this room, and the lady \ncomes in pregnant.\n  ``We would have a contract with the clinic . . . .''\n  Listen very carefully to what I am saying. A woman comes in. I am \nsorry. I am confusing the stenographer. I will go through the quote \nfirst and then explain it.\n\n       We were never employees of the abortion clinic. We would \n     have a contract with an abortion clinic that would allow us \n     to go in to procure fetal tissue for research. We would get a \n     generated list each day to tell us what tissue researchers, \n     pharmaceuticals and universities were looking for. Then we \n     would go and look at the particular patient charts. We had to \n     screen out anyone who had STDs or fetal anomalies. These had \n     to be the most perfect specimens we could give these \n     researchers for the best value that we could sell for. \n     Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for \n     anomalies. The rest were healthy donors.\n\n  To capsulate, a woman is in the abortion clinic, and basically they \nare eyeing up the source. It is like a hunter going out and seeing, I \nguess in this case, a trophy doe rather than a trophy buck, and saying, \nthere is a good specimen there. I hope that baby is fairly normal so I \ncan sell the body parts. And they looked at the patients' charts while \nthis child was alive in the womb. This girl might change her mind on \nwhether to have this abortion, and nobody is helping her change her \nmind or asking her if she would like to change her mind. Oh, no, we \nhave a contract here. We have a patient chart here. We have somebody \nlooking at her, looking at the trophy and then saying: Hey, this chart \nlooks real good, this gal has what we want; she has a normal baby \nthere. My goodness, a perfect specimen, the most perfect specimen we \ncould find. So give the researchers the best value we could sell for. \nHer words. Probably only 10 percent of fetuses were ruled out for \nanomalies; the rest were healthy donors. So said Kelly.\n\n  Let's look at a work order. This is a work order. Mailing address, \nshipping address, everything. OK. Tissue, fetal lung; one or both from \nthe same donor, 12 to 16 weeks. Preservation: Fresh. Gestation: 12 to \n16. Shipping: Wet ice. Constraints: No known abnormalities. We don't \nwant any babies who have any problems. Obtain tissue under sterile or \nclean conditions.\n  Let me ask you a question, colleagues. In this filthy, dirty, \ndisgusting business we are talking about, do you really think you can \nget a perfect lung, with no cuts and no abnormalities, by chopping up \nthe child in the womb or putting all of this poison in the body, in the \nwomb, in the embryonic sack? Or do you think it might be possible that \nthe best way to get a normal lung is to bring a child through the birth \ncanal in perfect condition, damaging only the brain, or perhaps even a \nlive birth? Oh, you think that would not happen? Well, we will talk \nabout that in a little while. Oh, yes, it happens.\n  Look here: ``Normal fetal liver.'' A normal fetal liver is not one \nfilled with poison. It is not a liver that has been chopped up. It is a \nnormal fetal liver. There aren't too many ways you can get a normal \nfetal liver in an abortion clinic. ``Dissect fetal liver and thymus and \noccasional lymph node from fetal cadaver within 10 minutes of the time \nit is extracted, and ship within 12 hours.'' ``No abnormal donors.''\n  There is a whole lot of money in this business, folks. With abortions \ndown, they will charge a woman anywhere from $300 to $1,000 for an \nabortion and make several thousand dollars on the parts of her child. \nBut she doesn't get any of that money, you can bet on that.\n  Let's look at another work order. The National Institutes of Health \ngets the delivery here. If you are pro-life, you will be ``pleased'' to \nknow they are getting some of this stuff. ``I would prefer tissues \nwithout identified anomalies; in particular, bone anomalies.''\n  Let's look at another one. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I \ncould give you hundreds of these work orders. I am picking a few of \nthem.\n  Now, this one is particularly disturbing--as if the others weren't. \nHere is the donor criterion on this. We are talking about whole eyes. \nNow, the donor criterion is that the child be ``brain dead.'' Think \nabout that for a minute. Why would you put that on there? Are we to \nassume this child is going to be delivered to them live?\n  I assume if a child has been aborted and it is being sold, or \nprovided, or donated, or whatever it is, to some research center, we \nought to assume it is dead. Well, they are not assuming it. They are \nnot assuming it at all. They are directing it: Make sure it is ``brain \ndead.'' If anything else is moving, that is OK. Maybe the heart is \nbeating, and that is OK. But make sure it is brain dead, noncadaver, \nand post 4 to 6 hours, any age. Again, no contagious diseases. ``Remove \neye with as much nerve''--they go into that. Federal Express--send it \nout. That is against the law.\n  So let's say a girl walks into a clinic and sits down to wait. I want \nto try to paint you a picture of what happens. A girl walks into a \nclinic and sits down to wait. A fax comes in, and the fax contains a \nlist of what body parts are needed for that day. So here she comes. She \nstill hasn't had the abortion. But they now have this list--the \nabortionist perhaps, but I don't know; I have not seen this. Perhaps he \nlooks through the glass window, and maybe there is a one-way glass. He \nlooks out into the waiting room and stares at her stomach and knows \nthis is the very same child who is very much alive now, perhaps even \nmoving and kicking; he knows that child will be dead in a few moments, \nand they already have the work order. They have already checked the \ncharts, already know it is normal; they already know what they need. \nThey are already planning it all.\n  If that is not sick, if that doesn't bother you, then, man, there is \nsomething wrong with the people in this country--big-time wrong.\n  After her abortion, in a matter of 10 minutes, if it is done then, \nthat baby can be shipped on wet ice to researchers across the country, \njust like going into a supermarket and buying a piece of meat.\n  There are four illegal and immoral things happening with this issue. \nFirst, as I said before, current law prohibits receiving any \nconsideration, valuable consideration, from the tissue of aborted \nchildren for research purposes. This is happening. So that is wrong. \nViolation No. 1.\n  Secondly, it has been reported that, in fact, live births are \noccurring at these clinics. Oh, that is a dirty little secret we don't \nwant anybody to talk about. Let's not talk about that. It doesn't \nhappen a lot, but in 100 abortions it could be as few as 5, 6, maybe 7, \nmaybe 10 times--live births. Oh, boy, that is a real problem. What \nbetter way to get a good sample than a live birth?\n\n  It is the law of every State to make every medical effort to save the \nlife of that child. I am going to show you proof that that isn't done. \nIt is not happening in every case.\n  Thirdly, our tax dollars are being used to fund Planned Parenthood on \nthe one end to kill the children, and NIH on the other end to do \nresearch on them. If you are pro-life, as I am, you won't like it; I \ndon't like it. I am going to do something about it if it is humanly \npossible.\n  In 1996, Planned Parenthood received $158 million in taxpayer \ndollars. Who knows how much in addition is being funneled through the \nvaluable consideration loophole from NIH research labs. The taxpayers \nand Congress deserve an answer. The chart shows Federal funds \nsupporting Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliates, \nin fiscal year 1994, $120 million; in 1995, $120 million; in 1996, $123 \nmillion. Add it all together. It is $158 million.\n  The fetal body parts industry is a big business, ladies and \ngentlemen, and it is not being honest. Mothers are not being given \ntheir consent forms sometimes. Sometimes they are. And the\n\n[[Page S12916]]\n\nwholesalers are not forthright about how they ship the babies, among \nother things. These people are in the business of selling dead humans, \nso I guess maybe we should not expect too much in terms of ethics.\n  There are two statutes that govern fetal tissue research, and both \nstatutes were passed as part of S. 1 in 1993, the National Institutes \nof Health and Revitalization Act of 1993. I was one of four Senators \nwho voted no, as usual, because I don't believe Government should be \ndoing any research on induced abortions, aborted fetuses. Up until \n1992, we had a President, George Bush, who agreed. But Bill Clinton \nchanged all of that. But even President Clinton, who signed the fetal \ntissue research Executive order as one of the first acts of his \nPresidency, was unwilling to accept the sale of fetal tissues.\n  Prior to 1993, there was a moratorium prohibiting Federal funding of \nfetal tissue research. That was overturned by President Clinton by \nExecutive order on January 22, 1993. And Senator Kennedy introduced S. \n1 to codify Clinton's Executive order. Part of that was because this \n``statute permits the National Research Institutes to conduct support \nresearch on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic \npurposes.'' The source of the tissue may be from an abortion where the \ninformed consent of the donor is granted. This statute allows for \nFederal money to be used in fetal tissue research. And you will see \nthat NIH is involved in this.\n  The second statute made it unlawful to transfer any human fetal \ntissue for valuable consideration. I talked about this statute. In \nother words, it is illegal to give monetary value to the various body \nparts being sold. And it is illegal to profit from the sale. The guilty \nreceive fines and imprisonment for not more than 10 years. As long as \nthe tissue is donated, it is OK. But large amounts of cash are changing \nhands.\n  Again, abortion clinics and the wholesalers are making a killing--\nthat is a sick pun, a killing--literally with the abortion and with the \nsale of human baby parts.\n  Listen to what one of the leaders of fetal body parts marketing said \nin an interview with a pro-life publication: ``Nearly 75 percent of the \nwomen who chose abortion agree to donate the fetal tissue.''\n  Granted, this organization claims to only operate out of two abortion \nclinics. But if you apply their statistic nationwide, for theoretical \npurposes, you are talking about a lot of aborted babies being sold for \ncold, hard cash.\n\n  In addition, the consulting firm of Frost & Sullivan recently \nreported that the worldwide market for sale in tissue cultures brought \nin nearly $428 million in 1996, and they predict that market will \ncontinue to expand and will grow at an annual rate of 13.5 percent a \nyear, and by 2002 will be worth nearly $1 billion. That is a whole lot \nof money at the expense of these unfortunate women.\n  In a taped conversation with the wholesaler, she says they do not buy \nthe tissue. That is the way it works. That is really what happens.\n  In a taped conversation with another marketer of fetal body parts, \nthey admit to try to get abortion clinics to alter procedures to get \nbetter tissue, which is a violation of Federal law. This person then \noffers discounts for being a ``high volume'' user, and that the buyer \ncan save money by purchasing their cost-effective, lower-range product.\n  Let's look now at a chart offered by Opening Lines, and you tell me \nif this isn't a business transaction for profit. Bear in mind the sale \nof body parts is illegal. You are not supposed to receive any \nconsideration. Well, then maybe you could tell me why--this is one of \nthose wholesalers, Opening Lines. Maybe you could tell me why they have \na price list. Has anybody ever done any marketing before?\n  Look. You can get a kidney for $125. You can get a spinal cord for \n$325. Then down at the bottom, it says prices in effect through \nDecember 31, 1999. That is a price list, ladies and gentlemen. I \nsuppose there will be somebody who will come down here and say, ``Well, \nSenator, that is not a price list. That is fee-for-service.''\n  That is what it says at the top.\n  What is the service? You say: Well, you know it is expensive. You \nhave to take the brain out, or you have to take the spinal cord out. \nOK. We take the spinal cord out. I am not a doctor. I am not going to \npretend to be. I am not going to make any reference to how difficult \nthat might be.\n  But let's assume to remove a spinal cord from a child is a difficult \noperation. They are charging $325 for the spinal cord. I would think it \nwould be safe to assume--I am not a doctor, but if you want to send an \nintact cadaver, that doesn't involve any research at all. Does it? They \ndon't have to cut anything. We will just ship that along. But it cost \n$600. It doesn't have anything to do with what the service is in terms \nof finding the spinal cord and getting it out. It has nothing to do \nwith it at all.\n  I will tell you why this is $600--the cadaver. Because when they get \nthe cadaver; they can get the spinal cord; they can get the eyes; they \ncan get the nose; they can get the ears; they can get the liver; they \ncan get the thyroid, whatever they want. That is why it is $600. That \nis why the price list is there. You can even get a discount if you buy \nenough.\n  This is a dirty business. It is bad. It stinks.\n  The brochure boasts that it offers researchers ``the highest quality, \nmost affordable and freshest tissue prepared to your specifications and \ndelivered in the quantities you need when you need it.''\n  Here is the copy of the brochure. I didn't make it up. This is their \nbrochure, Opening Lines. This is what they said.\n  Think about it. ``We are professionally staffed and directed,'' it \nsays. ``We have over 10 years of experience in harvesting tissue and \npreservation. Our full-time medical director is active in all phases of \nour operation. We are very pleased to provide you with our services. \nOur goal is to offer you and your staff the highest quality, most \naffordable, and freshest tissue prepared to your specifications.''\n  Please tell me how you can do that if it is simply a matter of taking \nan aborted child and sending it off to a research laboratory somewhere.\n  My colleagues and American people, I don't know what is going to \nhappen to this country. But I just want to recap for you what has \nhappened here.\n  A woman comes into a clinic, an abortion clinic. She is pregnant. She \nis in trouble. She needs help. They already have somebody who has read \nher charts. They know her baby is normal. They know it has no abnormal \nfunctions. They know they need to get that baby out of there quickly. \nThey know they can't do damage to the cadaver. They cannot do damage to \nthe fetus. They can't poison it. They can't cut it because, to their \nspecifications, they need perfect eyes, or they need perfect skin, or \ngood lungs, even the gonads, the ultimate. The poor little child just \nhas no privacy here. Limbs, brains, spinal, spleen, liver, all of it, \nprice list, all the way down--they have it all figured out.\n  And they have the gall to stand out here and tell you these clinics \ncare for the women. They care for the profit. They cannot make it \nbecause abortions are going down. They can't charge these women any \nmore because they are too poor to pay. So they take it from their \nbodies, from the children. It is a filthy, disgusting, dirty business, \nand it needs to be exposed and eliminated.\n\n  How much more should we tolerate in this country? How much more \ndegradation must these children absorb and endure?\n  Look at that list. Look at it and tell me that is fee-for-service--to \nyour specifications, your specifications. You give us the order, and we \nwill make sure you get perfect eyes that weren't hurt by any \nabortionist's knife, or they weren't poisoned by digoxin, or saline. \nOh, we will make sure. We will get you a live birth, if we have to, or \na partial birth, if we have to. We will get it for you because there is \na lot of money in it. That is why we will get it.\n  This is a filthy, disgusting, dirty business.\n  People say: Oh, you are antiresearch. I am not antiresearch. If a \nwoman has a miscarriage and wishes to donate that miscarried child to \nresearch, she has every right to do that. I am proresearch.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services under President Bush \ndetermined there was plenty of tissue available through spontaneous \nabortions and ectopic pregnancies to satisfy\n\n[[Page S12917]]\n\nresearch needs--plenty. But oh, no, we have to get into this. We have \nto make up for the loss of revenue because, thank God, abortions are \nstarting to go down in this country. We have to make it up. Doctors \ndon't want to do them anymore. It is a dirty business, they say. I'm \nsick when I go home. We are going down a slippery slope, my fellow \nAmericans.\n  I used to teach history. I used to tell my kids in those classes: If \nyou forget everything else I said, I want you to remember you have a \nresponsibility to pass on America to your children, hopefully in better \nshape than we gave her to you. If you do that, America will always be \nhere; if you fail, we could lose it.\n  What message are we giving to our children when we tolerate this--an \norder form before the woman even has the abortion.\n  Henry Hyde said: I deplore any medical procedure that treats human \nbeings as chattel, personal property, as a subject fit for harvesting. \nThe humanity of every fetus should be respected and treated with \ndignity and not like some laboratory animal.\n  Is that dignity? Is that respect?\n  Let me tell a story about a girl name Christy. This is not a pleasant \nstory. These are the abortion clinics, there to protect the mother and \nmake her healthy again. She went in to have her safe, healthy, legal \nabortion. Something went wrong. On July 1, 1993, Christy--fictitious \nname--underwent an abortion by John Roe, abortionist. After the \nprocedure, Roe looked up to find Christy pale with bluish lips and no \npulse or respiration. Christy's heart had stopped and there were no \nrecords that her vital signs were monitored during the procedure. \nAdditionally, Roe was not trained in anesthesia and the clinic had no \nanesthesia emergency equipment or staff trained to handle a \ncomplication. Paramedics were able to restore Christy's pulse and \nrespiration, but she was left blind and in a permanent vegetative \nstate. Today, she requires 24-hour-a-day care and is fed through a tube \nin her abdomen. She is not expected to recover and is being cared for \nby her family. Christy had a legal abortion on her 18th birthday.\n  They took good care of her, didn't they? I have in my hand a consent \nform that Christy signed. Do you know what they tell you in the \nindustry? Ask them; don't believe me. Ask them. They say: We know the \nwoman is in a terrible emotional condition when she comes in, so we \ndon't always ask her to sign these forms. We wait until after the \nprocedure.\n  Is that so? Well, you have to do it within 10 minutes if you want to \nget some of these buyers for organs because they say they need them in \n10 or 15 minutes from the time they exit the birth canal; otherwise, \nthey are no good in some cases. They have to do it quickly. So the poor \ngirl is just coming out of the anesthetic. I know she is not coming out \nin 10 minutes. ``Here, Christy, want to sign this? We want to send your \n6-month old boy to be chopped up for medical research. Would you sign \nthis?''\n  They say we don't bother the women before. OK, can a woman who is in \na 24-hour-a-day coma sign a consent form? Can she? Here is the form. It \nis signed and she didn't sign it after the procedure. She signed it \nbefore the procedure and she signed it because they needed the body \nparts of her fetus and they wanted to make doggone sure they got them. \nThey didn't want anything to get in the way of that. They didn't want \nanything to interrupt that little profit they had coming, so they just \nsaid we will get this signed by Christy.\n  Maybe they should have taken a little time to counsel her. ``Would \nyou like to have some other discussion perhaps about adoption?\"\n  We gave her that. OK, fine.\n  How about the anesthesiologist. Did someone know what in the hell \nthey were doing when they put this poor woman under?\n  Oh, no, we have to get this, because this is money.\n  Here is what Christy signed:\n\n       I grant permission to one of these agencies and each of its \n     authorized agents and representatives to distribute and \n     dispense tissue from the surgery. I release all my property \n     and financial interests therein and any product or process \n     which may result therefrom. I read and I understand this \n     document and I have been given the opportunity to ask \n     questions. I am aware I may refuse to participate. I \n     understand I will receive no compensation for consenting to \n     this study.\n\n  As I said, if anybody thinks she signed it after the surgery, I will \nsell you some ocean-front property in Colorado. They say they don't \nbother them beforehand because they are too distraught, they are too \nemotional, or they don't want to bring all this up.\n  That is Christy.\n  I saw a bumper sticker once that said:\n\n       Abortion: One dead; one wounded.\n\n  Can't sum it up any better than that. One dead and one wounded. And \nthe people who were in charge of the health and safety of the mother in \nthese cases are more interested in the dead than the wounded because \nthey are going to make a big profit.\n  Let's talk about the dirtiest most disgusting secret of all. This is \nnot pleasant. I had somebody from the National Right to Life tell me \ntoday, believe it or not--I won't mention names-- that we don't have \nany evidence of any link here. Fine. I am not asking anyone to tell me \nwhether they think this is evidence or not. I am asking everyone to \nmake their own decisions. I am not making any links. I am giving facts. \nMake your own links.\n  There is a little complication called ``live birth.'' Uh-oh. Live \nbirth. It happens. When it does, what happens?\n  I was at an award dinner several years ago when a young woman who is \nknown by many in the right-to-life movement by the name of Gianna \nJessen, who then was about 21, so she is probably 25, 26, maybe a \nlittle older now. She had been aborted. She was a beautiful girl. She \nwas aborted. There were 1,000 people at this event. She stood up and \nsang ``Amazing Grace.'' There wasn't a dry eye in the place, including \nmine. When it was all over she said: I want all of you to know \nsomething. My mother made a terrible mistake because I wanted to live. \nIf I had had my choice, if I could have said, spare me, I would have \nsaid that. I didn't, but I survived, and I am meaningful. I just sang \nto you. And she said: I love my mother and I forgive her.\n  There is a lot more power in that than these people that run these \nclinics that do this.\n  Why can't we bring this debate to that level? There is no way to know \nhow many live births actually occur. It happens in partial-birth \nabortions because they are alive until they are executed as they come \nthrough the birth canal. Feet first, they are executed; headfirst, they \nare born. Any difference? Maybe somebody can explain it.\n  Many of you may have heard of a gentleman by the name of Eric Harrah. \nAbout 10 years ago he left the abortion business. One night Eric and \nhis staff were called to the clinic-- remember, he was an abortionist \nthen--because a pregnant girl had given birth in a motel room. The baby \nwas wrapped in a towel. She had been given medication to begin the \nprocess of dilation. So it was wrapped in a towel and they thought it \nwas dead, so she came from the motel room carrying this little child in \nthe towel.\n  Eric, the abortionist, saw the baby's arm fly up and he screamed, \n``My God, that baby is alive.''\n  The doctors sent Rick and the nurse out of the room. When he came \nback in the baby was dead. A live birth? You might ask yourself, did \nthey take any means to save the child? Or did they kill the child? Who \nknows? In either case, they let it die.\n  I have been in this business of doing research on this issue since \n1984. I have been involved in the pro-life movement. I have read, I \ndon't know how many thousands of pages. What I am going to read to you \nnow is the worst I have ever come across in everything and anything \nthat I have read. I have never seen anything to equal it. I do not \nunderstand how we can tolerate this in this country, but it shows you \nhow sick we really are. We are sick. Oh, we are sick, collectively, \nbelieve me. This is a story from Kelly. A short paragraph, what she \nsaid. It is very difficult for me even to read it, but you need to hear \nit.\n\n  The doctor walked into the lab. This is in an abortion clinic. Kelly \nis the wholesaler for the fetal tissue. She is the person who has to \ntake this fetus and do what has to be done to it to get it to the \nsupplier.\n\n       The doctor walked into the lab and set a steel pan on the \n     table. ``Got you some good\n\n[[Page S12918]]\n\n     specimens,'' he said. ``Twins.'' The technician looked down \n     at a pair of perfectly formed 24-week-old fetuses, moving and \n     gasping for air. Except for a few nicks from the surgical \n     tongs that had pulled them out, they seemed uninjured.\n\n  This is pretty difficult. I have witnessed the birth of my three \nchildren, so forgive me if I have a little trouble.\n\n       The wholesaler, Kelly, said, ``There is something wrong \n     here. They are moving. I don't do this. That's not in my \n     contract.''\n       She watched the doctor take a bottle of sterile water and \n     fill the pan until the water ran up over the babies' mouths \n     and noses. Then she left the room. ``I couldn't watch those \n     fetuses moving. That's when I decided it was wrong.''\n\n  So the abortionist, twin live births, 6 months--the little girl I \nspoke to you about earlier who wrote to me was born prematurely at 5 \nmonths. Two little twins drowned in a pan so their body parts could be \nsold because they had an order for the body parts. America.\n  Many of you may have heard about Jill Stanek, the nurse at Chicago's \nChrist Hospital who has openly admitted that live births occur at her \nhospital. We are going to have some testimony from Jill. She will be up \nhere on the Hill very soon so you do not have to believe me; you can \nlisten to her. The hospital staff, when it happens, offer comfort care, \nwhich amounts to holding the child until it dies. If they are lucky, \nthey get a little love on the way out. Perhaps it is better than being \ndrowned in a dish.\n  Jill Stanek says:\n\n       What do you call an abortion procedure in which the fetus \n     is born alive, then is left to die without medical care? \n     Infanticide? Murder?\n       Most people would recoil at just the thought of such a \n     gruesome, uncaring procedure, but it is practiced at least \n     one Chicago suburban hospital. When I called Christ Hospital, \n     the Medical Center at Oak Lawn, I frankly expected a denial \n     that it uses the procedure, but instead the spokeswoman \n     explained it is used for ``a variety of second-trimester'' \n     abortions when the fetus has not yet reached viability. \n     That's up to 23 weeks of life, when a fetus is considered not \n     yet developed enough to survive on its own.\n       Instead of medical care, the child is provided ``comfort \n     care,'' wrapped in a blanket and held when possible.\n\n  This is very interesting.\n\n       The procedure is chosen by parents and doctors instead of \n     another method in which the fetus is terminated within the \n     womb by, for example, injection with a chemical that stops \n     the heart.\n\n  She says further: One day there was a newborn who survived the \nabortion with no one around to hold it. It was left to die in a soiled-\nlinen closet.\n  The hospital denies it. She says it happened. Interesting, the \nhospital says abortions are elective, but they are done only to protect \nthe life or health of the mother or when the fetus is nonviable due to \nextreme prematurity or lethal abnormalities.\n  The nurse, Jill Stanek, said she has seen some elective abortions \ndone on newborns whose physical or mental defects are deemed \nincompatible only with the ``quality of life.''\n  That is pretty heavy stuff. This is going on in America. People come \ndown here on this floor, year after year, and defend it. That is what \nthey are doing, defending it: A woman's right to choose. The bassinet \nor the hospital sterile bucket, which is it? Right--right to choose. \nPut the child in the bassinet or throw it in the garbage or send it off \nto some research lab.\n  Here is a headline, a transcript from the WTVN-TV in Columbus, OH, 20 \nApril, 1999:\n\n       Partial-Birth Abortion Baby Survives 3 Hours.\n       A woman 5 months pregnant came to Women's Medical Center in \n     Dayton, Ohio, to get a partial-birth abortion. During the 3 \n     days it takes to have the procedure she began to have stomach \n     pains and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Within minutes she \n     was giving birth.\n       Nurse Shelly Lowe in an emergency room at the hospital was \n     shocked when the baby took a gasp of air. [Lowe] ``I just \n     held her and it really got to me that anybody could do that \n     to a baby. . .I rocked her and talked to her because I felt \n     that no one should die alone.'' The little girl survived 3 \n     hours.\n       Mark Lally, Director of Ohio Right to Life, believes this \n     is why partial birth abortions should be banned. [Lally] \n     ``This shows what we've have been trying to make clear to \n     people. Abortion isn't something that happens just early in \n     pregnancy, it happens in all stages of pregnancy. It's legal \n     in this state any time.''\n\n  Like it is in any State.\n  Warren Hern is the author of the most widely used textbook on \nabortion procedures. Dr. Hern says, in this article:\n\n       A number of practitioners attempt to ensure live fetuses \n     after late abortions so that genetic tests can be conducted \n     on them.\n\n  There is a link. They say there is no link? There is one.\n\n       It is his position that practitioners do this without \n     offering a woman the option of fetal demise before abortion \n     in a morally unacceptable manner since they place research \n     before the good of their patients.\n\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the Chair.)\n  Here is an admission from the industry itself that when they want \nto--I am not saying all do it, I am saying some do it--when they want \nto, practitioners can do this. They can ensure a live birth to fall \nwithin that 10-minute window, to get that child chopped up quickly and \non ice so those limbs are better for the researcher and worth more \nmoney. You don't want any abnormalities, don't want any problems.\n  There was an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer a few years ago \ncalled ``Abortion Dreaded Complication.'' The patient had been admitted \nfor an abortion, but instead of a stillborn fetus, a live 2\\1/2\\-pound \nbaby boy appeared. A dismayed nurse took a squirming infant to the \ncloset where dirty linens are stored. When the head nurse telephoned \nthe patient's physician at home, he said: ``Leave it where it is. He \nwill die in a few minutes.''\n  I used a term in a speech over the weekend referring to doctors such \nas that. I said they took a hypocritic oath. Someone corrected me and \nsaid: ``Don't you mean Hippocratic oath?''\n  I said: ``No, hypocritic; they are total hypocrites because they are \nnot protecting the lives of unborn children. They should not even be \ntaking the oath.''\n  In this article, there are some very interesting headlines in this \ndreaded complication. Listen to what some of the people in the industry \nsay:\n\n       Reporting abortion livebirths is like turning yourself into \n     the IRS for an audit. What is there to gain?\n\n  Another article says:\n\n       How things sometimes go wrong.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       You have to have a fetus--\n\n  Whatever; I can't pronounce the word--\n\n     dose of saline solution. It is almost a breach of contract \n     not to. Otherwise, what are you going to do, hand her back a \n     baby, having done it questionable damage?\n\n  What a bunch of insensitive, uncaring individuals.\n  Then they say:\n\n       If a baby has rejected an abortion and lives, then it is a \n     person under the Constitution. . . .\n\n  I think it is a person under the Constitution before it is born, not \nunder Roe v. Wade but under the Constitution. Roe v. Wade did not let \nthe Constitution get in its way when it made that terrible decision.\n  Then another guy says:\n\n       I find [late-term abortions] pretty heavy weather, both for \n     myself and for my patients.\n       I stood by and watched that baby die.\n\n  They are real caring people, aren't they? They are compassionate, \ncaring people. I think I have made my point on that.\n  You will notice from these charts I have been putting up that many of \nthe highlights suggest the baby be put on ice within 10 minutes of \nexiting the womb. I mentioned that earlier.\n  Stop and think about this. If you do any of the other types of \nabortions--saline, digoxin, and these other procedures, D are \nyou going to get? You are going to get something that is going to be an \nabnormality. No abnormal donors. Within 10 minutes, we want it on ice.\n\n  The point I am trying to make is, there are only two ways you can get \na baby, a fetus, on ice that quickly. One is a live birth; you \ninstantly kill it. Another is partial-birth. If there is another \nmethod, I am open-minded. I would like to hear about it. Maybe somebody \nhas it.\n  Let me read a letter I received today. This letter is pretty \ndevastating. I want you to think about this 10 minutes on these charts. \nWithin 10 minutes, we need to be able to ship it to give you no \nabnormal donors, to make sure the fetus is in good shape:\n  This is from Raymond Bandy, Jr., M.D., Dallas, TX:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: As a physician and pastor in the Dallas \n     Texas suburb of\n\n[[Page S12919]]\n\n     Lewisville, I was shocked and outraged several months ago \n     when my friend Mark Crutcher invited me to the offices of \n     Life Dynamics to review for him from a medical perspective of \n     several requisitions for fetal tissue and body parts.\n       There were 2 areas particularly disturbing: No. 1, It was \n     almost unfathomable to be reading requests for arms, legs, \n     brains, etc., from aborted babies. Leading institutions in \n     our country with research scientists requesting in mail-order \n     catalog format, body parts from babies killed in abortion \n     clinics.\n\n  Leading institutions were requesting these parts.\n\n       No. 2, My attention was drawn to the fashion in which the \n     requests were made. Over and over again the requests would \n     mention that the tissue must be ``fresh''--\n\n  It says ship on wet ice. Another one says fresh, remove specimen and \nprepare within 15 minutes.\n  This is the process, a doctor talking now:\n\n       (a) The baby must in some fashion be killed in its mother's \n     womb. (b) The baby must then be extracted from the womb. (c) \n     It must then be delivered in some fashion to a technician who \n     would then proceed to amputate limbs; extract eyes, brains, \n     hearts, and then process them; (d) all within 10 minutes. I \n     am not an abortionist, nor have I performed an abortion, but \n     to require these procedures to be accomplished in 10 minutes, \n     means of necessity that the baby be extracted as close to \n     life as possible, and would lead to in many cases babies. . \n     .being born living, in order to be able to have them on ice, \n     or otherwise processed within this short period of time.\n       As a community physician, I find this barbaric, cruel, \n     evil, and intolerable to the greatest degree. This is a \n     return to the medical practices of the [Nazis] of 1940s. . . \n     .\n       Can anyone with even the most remote conscience, or moral \n     decency, tolerate this practice?\n\n  He closes with that.\n  Here is a doctor. He is telling us and he is reinforcing everything I \nhave said. Fresh, wet ice, no known abnormalities; get it on the ice. \nHow do you get a fetus that is not chopped up, that is not poisoned? \nThere are only two places. I talked to you about both of them: Live \nbirths, partial births.\n  The dirty little secret is that Planned Parenthood takes Federal \ntaxpayers' dollars. American workers, especially pro-life workers, all \nof us--but those especially who are pro-life, I am sure, would be \nopposed to it--are having money taken out of their paychecks to pay for \nthe marketing of babies' body parts. I talked about the $158 million \ngrant from the Federal Government for Planned Parenthood, NIH, $17.6 \nbillion in this year's labor bill--not all for that but just in the \nbill.\n  I am not against the funding of the National Institutes of Health, \nbut I think when research is being conducted by the Government, where \ntaxpayer dollars are involved, there is a much higher ethical standard \nto meet.\n  In addition, universities receive Federal funding, lots of it. In \nfact, there are some universities that receive Federal funding \nspecifically for fetal tissue research.\n  I want to point out one chart that I did not highlight before because \nthis really drives the point home in terms of whether or not there is \nany particular reason to believe that in the industry they are looking \nfor live births or partial births.\n  Look what it says on this memo: ``Please send list of current frozen \ntissues.'' And they go down the list: Liver and blood and kidney and \nlung, and all this down here. And then what does it say? No digoxin \ndonors. ``No DIG.'' That is the term for digoxin donors.\n  I want you to understand this and think about this: This is an order \nform. They are saying here: We don't want any digoxin babies.\n  Well, why don't they want them? Because they cannot sell them. The \nparts are no good. It is in their own writing. They are incriminating \nthemselves. They are violating the law, and they ought to be \nprosecuted.\n  Shine in the light. Bring in the sunshine. Live births are a big \nproblem, but DIG is not good for research. Abortion clinics and \nharvesters are also deliberately hiding the fact that they are shipping \nthese parts all over the United States. They even use vague language to \ntrick and deceive shippers such as Federal Express who will not do it, \nto their credit. But they are not told. They are hidden. One marketer \nsays: ``We've learned through the years of doing this'' how to avoid \nproblems with shippers like Federal Express.\n  But they have. If you are violating the law, you do everything you \ncan.\n  As I have gone through this now for I don't know how long here on the \nfloor, you probably say to yourself: Could it get any worse? Can it be \nany more humiliating?\n  We have covered pretty well what is happening to the child. \nRecapping: A woman, pregnant--abortions are down, the industry is \nlosing money, and they can only charge so much. So they find a buyer of \nthe body parts of the fetus. There it is: ``Fee For Services.'' As I \nsaid before, $600 for a cadaver, $125 for this, $75 for that. The lower \nnumbers are probably so common that they are not worth much. So they \nsell the body parts. Then they do unimaginable things to the emotional \nlife of this unfortunate woman who is in so much need of help and \ncounseling.\n  But there is another dirty little secret, which isn't very well \ntalked about; that is, untold numbers of women in some clinics are \nbeing sexually assaulted, harassed, physically harmed, and sometimes \nkilled, as I said before, in these ``safe'' and ``legal'' clinics.\n  I will give you two examples.\n\n       Two months later, [fictitious Dr.] Roe was performing a \n     first-trimester abortion on 23-year-old ``Lucy'' when she \n     began to hemorrhage from a perforation he had made. Still \n     operating without a back-up supply of blood, Roe gave her a \n     transfusion of his own blood. . .\n\n  The only problem was, it was not her blood type. He did not bother to \ncheck that out.\n       Lucy then went into cardiac arrest. . . . In Texas, private \n     ambulances are limited to transfers of stable patients and \n     are prohibited from responding to emergency calls. Therefore, \n     they do not respond with any sense of urgency. When the \n     ambulance crew finally arrived and discovered the case was a \n     life-and-death emergency, they transported Lucy immediately \n     rather than call for a fire department ambulance. \n     Unfortunately, Lucy was not as lucky as Claudia [another \n     girl] and she bled to death--\n\n  She bled to death--\n\n     on November 4, 1977.\n\n  That was a long time ago, so I will probably be criticized for \nbringing something up that long ago.\n\n       On June 2, 1989, ``Margaret'' went to [an abortion clinic] \n     to have an abortion performed. . . . After she was dismissed, \n     she started experiencing pain and bleeding, and called the \n     facility about her symptoms. They did not advise her to seek \n     medical care. Two days later, she sought medical treatment on \n     her own and was told that she had a perforated uterus and \n     retained fetal tissue. A D was performed to complete the \n     abortion and, due to infection, a hysterectomy was also \n     necessary. Unfortunately, despite all efforts to save her \n     life, Margaret died of the complications of her abortion, \n     leaving behind her husband and one-year-old son.\n\n  Taking good care of mom, aren't they? They really are.\n  And more recently in 1997, in San Diego:\n\n       An abortion doctor is being charged with murder by the \n     district attorney of Riverside County, east of Los Angeles.\n       Dr. Bruce Steir faces a February hearing on a murder charge \n     stemming from the December 1996 death of Sharon Hamptlon, 27, \n     following an abortion at A Lady's Choice Clinic in Moreno \n     Valley, near Riverside.\n       Miss Hamptlon died from internal bleeding as the result of \n     a perforated uterus. The pathologist in the case found \n     ``gross negligence'' and recommended that the death be \n     considered a homicide.\n\n  You see, it is getting more serious because the better trained \ndoctors in all types of abortions are not doing them anymore. So they \nwant to go where the money is: Body parts. I am not going to go into \nthe gory details and some of the sick things that have been done by \nsome in terms of the humiliation of patients, in terms of sexual abuse, \nand so forth.\n  Tomorrow, at some point, I intend to offer an amendment that shines \nthe light into the industry. I intend to push for a full investigation \ninto this industry. I intend to find out whether live births are, in \nfact, used for the sale of body parts. I intend to find out whether in \nfact partial-birth abortions are used for the sale of body parts. I \nintend to find out whether laws are being violated in this country and, \nif so, who is violating them.\n  This amendment will provide for the light to shine into these clinics \nso we can get these answers. We deserve these answers. If you are pro-\nwoman, and you are pro-child, you ought to be for my amendment. If you \ndo not like the fact that women die horrible deaths, that children are \nbeing chopped up and sold illegally, I don't care which side of the \ndebate you are on, if you wonder whether or not and you are not sure \nwhether or not partial-birth abortions are used for the sale of body \nparts\n\n[[Page S12920]]\n\nin some cases, if you want to know whether they are, then let's find \nout. Let's look into it. Let's see if we can get the answers. And that \nis what my amendment does.\n  This has been a long, difficult speech for me to make. But I want my \ncolleagues to know that just about everything in America is regulated--\nunfortunately, in some cases. There is no reason why this industry \nshould not be regulated. Let's find out what is going on. Let's shine \nthe light in. Let's bring the sunshine in. And let's get answers. And \nlet's find out about the sale of body parts. Let's find out what the \nsource of those body parts are. Let's shine the light in on the \nindustry.\n  Tomorrow, I will have an amendment on that subject. I truly hope all \nAmericans will be supportive--pro-life, pro-abortion. If you want to \nsee to it that women are not abused, if you want to see to it that \nwomen are treated with respect and dignity, if you want to see to it \nthat if an abortion occurs and there is a live birth, that that child \nshould get help, should be allowed to live, if you want all that, and \nyou care, then you should support this amendment because all it does is \nshine the light in. It is a disclosure amendment. That is all it is. It \nrequires disclosure to shippers for any package containing human fetal \ntissue. It also contains language to limit the payment of a site fee \nfrom the transferee entity to the abortionist to be reasonable in terms \nof reimbursement for the actual real estate or facilities used by such \nan entity.\n\n  We are going to find out whether these people are in the business of \nselling body parts or abortions or both. What is the percentage? How \nmuch are they making on each? Shine in the light.\n  I have been on the floor year after year and in the House before \nthat, for 15 to 16 years, trying to end this horrible industry, this \ndisgusting exploitation of children and women, to no avail. If we just \nhad a President who would pick up his pen and say, ``I don't want to \nsee another few thousand people die in the next 5 years; I am willing \nto sign the ban on one type of abortion,'' we could get a good start. \nBut he won't do it. We are going to lose again.\n  So let's win with this amendment. Let's try to get an amendment \npassed that will shine the light in so we can find out what goes on in \nthe industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12920-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I will speak briefly. The Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, is here. I know he is planning to come and talk \nabout this issue. Under our agreement, I agreed I would yield the floor \nwhen he gets here to make a speech.\n  I, first, thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I did not catch all \nof his remarks. I caught the last 45 minutes or so. He is talking about \na very difficult issue. It is an amendment we will have to vote on \ntomorrow. It is not a difficult issue. It is a difficult issue to talk \nabout. I think it is a rather simple issue. I am hopeful, again, this \nwill be an issue where we put the politics of abortion aside and \nunderstand this kind of action should at least be looked into by some \nsort of study to determine whether this activity occurs and how \npervasive this is.\n  What I would like to do tonight is share some thoughts in response to \na discussion today about the anecdotes of cases that were presented in \ndefense of partial-birth abortions. We heard about cases of women who \nneeded this procedure to save the mother's health or the mother's life. \nI would like to review what the medical evidence is, again, and also \nbring up some cases where people took a different option and show how \nthat option, as humane as the other side, with their wonderful pictures \nof husbands and wives and in some cases children, as warm and fuzzy as \nthey would make it out to be, the fact is, in every one of those cases \na child was killed. A baby was killed. That is a tragedy.\n  In many cases the baby would not have lived long, but the baby was \nkilled before its time. Many of the people I am going to talk about \ntonight understood their baby was not going to live long or might \nsuffer from severe abnormalities, but they were willing to take their \nchild's life for what it was, as we all do when we are confronted with \nit in our own lives. We find out a son or daughter is afflicted with a \nhorrible illness. Our immediate reaction is, well, how can I put my \nchild out of its misery? Or my child isn't going to live very much \nlonger; how can I end it sooner?\n\n  I don't think that is the immediate reaction of mothers and fathers \nin America. But yet, when it comes to the baby in the womb, we have \nmany people who believe that is the logical thing to do. I argue that \nit is not the logical thing. It is not the rational thing. It is not \nthe humane thing. It is not in the best interest of the health of the \nmother. All those other things, in fact, in this debate don't matter.\n  What does matter in this debate is, is it in the best health interest \nof the mother? I will talk tonight about cases where people made a \ndifferent choice and, I argue, from a health perspective, a better \nchoice. When I say ``health,'' I mean not only the physical health of \nthe mother but also the mental health of the mother.\n  We will talk about some of those cases. I will talk about some of the \ncases that were brought up today and explain why those cases, again, \nwere not medically necessary to protect the health of the mother. There \nwere other options available, even if they wanted to choose abortion.\n  Then I will share with you some things that have happened to me as a \nresult of this debate and provide to my colleagues that, while we may \nnot win all the votes, at times there are things even more important \nthan that.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, is here. I yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to continue the debate on the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999. I rise to follow the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, who has taken a leadership position and a moral \nposition. I am delighted to hear he will tonight concentrate on an \nissue that I think has been for far too long overlooked in this debate; \nthat is, the effects of this procedure, which is a barbaric procedure, \non women. Those women are our sisters, our mothers, our daughters. That \nhealth effect is something that gets lost too often in the debate, \nwhich is not the politics. It is not the rhetoric. It is not the \nemotion. It is the health of the woman involved.\n  This is the third time I have had the opportunity to come to the \nfloor and participate in this debate on the issue of partial-birth \nabortion. Each time I come, as a physician, I take the time to review \nthe recent medical literature to see what the facts are, what the \nclinical studies are, what is the information and the medical \narmamentarium, the literature that is out there. That is where the \nmedical profession, that is where the scientists involved in medicine, \nthat is where the surgeons publish their experience, where you talk \nabout indications, you talk about the side effects, you talk about \nrisk, you talk about complications. That is where you share it with \nyour colleagues.\n  Each time before coming to the floor to debate this issue and discuss \nthis issue, I talk to my colleagues at the various institutions where I \nhave trained and have been, on the east coast, the west coast in \ntraining. I picked up the phone and talked to several of them today, \ncolleagues who are obstetricians directly involved in the surgical \naspects of this procedure.\n\n  Each time this issue comes to the floor of the Senate, I step back \nand look at what studies, what developments there have been since we \nlast discussed this issue. I rise tonight to talk about this procedure \nas a medical procedure. It has been interesting to me because over the \ncourse of today I have heard again and again that there is no \nobstetrician in this body of the Senate. I am not an obstetrician. I am \na surgeon, which means I am trained to perform surgical procedures.\n  I am trained. I spent 20 years in both training and engaged in \nsurgery to make surgical diagnoses, to perform\n\n[[Page S12921]]\n\ntechnical operations, to evaluate the risk of these operations, and to \nassess the outcome of these operations. No, I am not an obstetrician, \nand I don't pretend to be. I call obstetricians. I call people who are \non the frontline. But I am a surgeon. I know something about surgical \nprocedures. That is what I did before coming to the Senate. I am board \ncertified in surgery. I am board certified in two different \nspecialties.\n  When people talk about this medical procedure, I want to make it \nclear I am not an obstetrician. But I am board certified in general \nsurgery. I am board certified in cardiothoracic surgery. I have spent \n20 years studying and performing surgical procedures.\n  This is background. A lot of what I did is publish and research \nsurgical procedures. But this is background. I have focused not, as I \nmentioned earlier, on the politics or the rhetoric, but on the medical \nuse of this specific procedure, partial-birth abortion. As my \ncolleagues know by now--but I want to restate it because I have gone \nback and reviewed the medical literature and have talked to colleagues \nat other institutions, and I have looked at developments since last \nyear--I conclude partial-birth abortion is a brutal, barbaric procedure \nthat has no place in the mainstream practice of medicine today.\n  Again, partial-birth abortion is a brutal, barbaric procedure that \nhas absolutely no place in the mainstream practice of medicine today. \nPartial-birth abortion is a procedure that is rarely, if ever, needed \nin today's practice of medicine. Alternative methods of abortion, if \nabortion is necessary, are always available--even when the abortion is \nperformed very late in pregnancy.\n  Now, we have had the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists quoted on the floor, and they will continue to be, which \nI think is appropriate. A number of their statements, I think, are \ntaken out of context and put forward. Ultimately, their recommendation \nis, I believe, against the procedure; but for a lot of different \nreasons they are against passage of what is being proposed. I will come \nback to that. But it is interesting, when it comes back to answering \nthe question, ``Are there always alternative procedures available,'' \ntheir answer would be yes.\n  Again, I refer to a number of documents, but this is the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association of August 26, 1996, volume 280, No. 8. \nIn an article this quotation is made:\n\n       An ACOG policy statement emanating from the review declared \n     that the select panel ``could identify no circumstances under \n     which this procedure would be the only option to save the \n     life or preserve the health of the woman.''\n\n  There are always alternative procedures available. This is important \nbecause the procedure of partial-birth abortion, as we have described \nand laid out--a procedure in which the fetus is manipulated in the \nuterus, partially evacuated from the uterus, scissors inserted to \npuncture the skull or the cranium with evacuation of the contents of \nthe cranium, the brain--that procedure has not been studied. We know \nthere are certain risks, but the alternative procedures that are \navailable in every case have been studied. You can go to a medical \ntextbook and look up those alternative procedures, and you can go to \nthe clinical literature and read the studies. It has been peer reviewed \nand presented at meetings. Debate has been carried out. There are \ncomparisons between one surgeon's results and another's. You can \nidentify the risks for the alternative procedures, but you cannot for \nthe partial-birth abortion.\n  Now, ACOG, as has been mentioned on the floor, does take the position \nthat the procedure ``may'' be superior to other procedures, as its \nbasis for justifying opposition to this legislation. But with \neverything I have read, ACOG did not identify those specific \ncircumstances under which partial-birth abortion would be the preferred \nprocedure. And thus, as a scientist, where you want to look at \noutcomes, risks, and results in determining whether or not to use a \ncertain procedure or recommend such a procedure, the data is clearly \nnot there. It is not there. Thus, you have a procedure which, as I have \nsaid, is a brutal, barbaric procedure, with no data substantiating it \nor identifying the risks, compared to alternative procedures that have \nbeen defined, where we know what those risks are. Thus, this use of the \nword ``may,'' I would flip around and say ``may not.'' I would say the \nburden of proof is to go to the literature and present the clinical \nstudies that show this barbaric procedure, in any case, is the best or \nmost appropriate. The data, I can tell you, is not there.\n  So I think the next question to ask is: Are we talking about a \nprocedure, partial-birth abortion, which this legislation would \nprohibit, which is a part of mainstream medicine? Is it part of the \nsurgical armamentarium out there that is talked about in textbooks, in \nthe literature, or in medical schools?\n  The answer is, no, it is not. It is a fringe procedure. It is out of \nthe mainstream. This procedure is not taught. This procedure is not \ntaught in the vast majority of medical schools in the United States of \nAmerica. Yet we will hear some medical schools talk about some types of \ndilatation and extraction, and they will talk about it at 16 weeks, at \n14 weeks, and even 18 weeks. I think we need to make very clear we are \ntalking about a procedure that requires manipulation in the uterus, \npartial delivery; thus, the partial-birth aspects of this procedure, \nwith the insertion of the scissors and the evacuation of the contents. \nI can tell you, that procedure is not taught in medical schools today. \nWhen an obstetrician says, ``Oh, yes, but we teach late-term \nabortions,'' some do, but they don't teach this procedure.\n  Surgical training. Again, I am not an obstetrician, but I did spend 7 \nyears in surgical training learning every day. What do you learn as \npart of that? You learn the specific indications for a particular \nprocedure. In your surgical training, you learn the various surgical \ntechniques that have been described on the floor. Although it is very \ndifficult for people to talk about and listen to on the floor of the \nSenate, that is part of it, that is the barbarism, the brutality of the \nway this procedure has evolved. In your surgical training, you look at \nthe complications, outcomes, and risks of these accepted surgical \nprocedures.\n\n  The indications for a partial-birth abortion, for the surgical \ntechniques as described, the complications, the outcomes, and the risks \nare not taught in medical schools today. The procedure of partial-birth \nabortion is not routinely part of the residency programs today. Why? \nBecause it is dangerous, because it is a fringe procedure, because it \nis outside of the mainstream of generally accepted medical practice. It \nhas not been comprehensively studied or reviewed in the peer-reviewed \nliterature. There are no clinical studies of it in the medical \nliterature.\n  As I said, when this debate comes to the floor and you want to make \nthe case, you look at the medical literature, which I have done, and \nthen you want to say: What about the textbooks? Surely, it is in the \ntextbooks if people are out there doing this procedure on women, which \nI contend is harmful to women; surely, it is written in the medical \nobstetric textbooks. That is what you study. That is the foundation.\n  So what I have done over the last couple of days is I have gone to \nthe medical textbooks and reviewed 17 of those textbooks. I can tell \nyou, after reviewing those 17 textbooks, only 1 of the 17 even \nmentioned partial-birth abortion, and that 1 of the 17 mentioned it in \none little paragraph. It mentioned the fact there have been vetoes of \nthe partial-birth abortion legislation from last Congress and the \nCongress before.\n  The textbooks that I reviewed were Williams Obstetrics, which is one \nof the foundations of obstetrical education today by Cunningham and \nWilliams.\n  I reviewed the manual of obstetrics by Niswander and Evans.\n  I reviewed the Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynecology by Hacker and \nMoore.\n  I reviewed the Practice Guidelines for Obstetrics and Gynecology by \nSkoggin and Morgan.\n  I reviewed the Blueprints in Obstetrics and Gynecology by Callahan \nand Caughey.\n  I reviewed Novak's Gynecology by Novak and others.\n  I reviewed Operative Gynecology by Te Linde, Rock, and Thompson.\n  I reviewed Mishell Comprehensive Gynecology;\n\n[[Page S12922]]\n\n  And Textbook of Women's Health by Wallis.\n  And the list goes on.\n  Again, I think it is important because it demonstrates that this \nprocedure is outside of the mainstream. It is a fringe procedure, and, \ntherefore, any defense of this procedure, which we know has \ncomplications, which we know affects women in a harmful way, should be \njustified in some way in the medical literature, where it is not.\n  The fringe nature of this procedure is also underscored by the fact \nthat there are no credible statistics on partial-birth abortion.\n  Throughout the course of today--and really has been put forward on \nboth sides--people cited certain numbers of how many are performed. We \nwent through this again in the last Congress. Some say that there are \n500 of these procedures performed annually. The more realistic estimate \nI believe is that there is somewhere--again, it is truly so hard to \nestimate to even mention specific numbers--between 3,000 and 5,000 of \nthese partial-birth abortions performed every year.\n  The numbers do not matter, I don't think, because what we are talking \nabout is this barbaric procedure. It is harmful to women. So 1 is too \nmany, or 5 is too many, or 10, or even 500--any is too many.\n  What data do we have that this procedure can be performed safely? \nAbsolutely none. Part of the problem is the absence of accurate data \nwith which to judge the safety of this procedure, and because of, in \npart, the incomplete data that is accumulated, and the way we \naccumulate data on abortions. Although the CDC collects abortion \nstatistics every year, not all States provide that information to the \nCDC, and the ones that do lack information on as many as 40 to 50 \npercent of the abortions performed in that particular State.\n  But I think most importantly the categories that the CDC, Centers for \nDisease Control, uses to report the method of abortion does not split \nout partial-birth abortions from the other procedures. So it gets mixed \nin with all of the other procedures.\n  It is this lack of data on this procedure that I think is especially \ntroubling because of the grave risk, as the Senator from Pennsylvania \npointed out earlier, of complications the grave risk that this \nprocedure poses to women.\n  In the debate, we have opponents of abortion on the one hand, \nproponents of a right to choose on the other, and we have the debates \nthat come forth with the tint of emotion and rhetoric. But the thing \nthat gets lost is what the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned, and \nthat is that this procedure is terrible for women. He outlined some of \nthe ways in terms of the physical and mental health.\n\n  But I would like to drop back and look at this safety issue because \nin all of the arguments for rights, we need to have this procedure out \nthere.\n  It is critically important, I believe--I say this as a physician--\nthat we recognize that this procedure is dangerous and hurts women.\n  There are ``no credible studies'' on partial-birth abortions ``that \nevaluate or attest to its safety'' for the mother.\n  I take that from the Journal of American Medical Association, August \n26, 1998.\n  There are ``no credible studies'' on partial-birth abortions ``that \nevaluate or attest to the safety'' for the mother.\n  The risk: I can tell you as a surgeon--again, I drop back to the fact \nthat I am a surgeon and I spent 20 years of my adult life in surgery--\nthat patients who undergo partial-birth abortion are at risk for \nhemorrhage, infection, and uterine perforation.\n  I can say that. And I can say it and be absolutely positive about it \nbecause these are the risks that exist with any surgical midtrimester \ntermination of pregnancy.\n  The partial-birth abortion procedure itself involves manipulation of \nthe fetus inside of the uterus, turning the fetus around, extracting \nthe fetus from the uterus, and then punching scissors into the cranium \nor the base of the skull; requires spreading of those scissors to make \nthe opening large enough to evacuate the brain.\n  That procedure has two additional complications than what would be \nwith a trimester abortion, and that is uterine rupture, No. 1; and, No. \n2, latrogenic laceration. That means the cutting of the uterus with \nsecondary hemorrhage or secondary bleeding.\n  Uterione rupture: What does it mean? It means exactly as it sounds--\nthat the uterus ruptures. And that can be catastrophic to the woman.\n  It may be increased during a partial-birth abortion because the \nphysician in this procedure must perform a great deal of it blindly \nwhile reaching into the uterus with a blunt instrument and pulling the \nfeet of the fetus down into the canal. Thus, you have uterine rupture.\n  I should also add that this type of manipulation is also associated--\nwe know this from the medical literature because there are very few \ncases where you have to manipulate the fetus. That manipulation is also \nassociated with other complications of abruption, amniotic fluid \nembolus, where the fluid goes to other parts of the body and other \ntrauma to the uterus.\n  All of these are serious, potentially life-threatening complications \nfrom this fringe procedure that has not been studied, is outside the \nmain stream medicine, not in the medical textbooks, not in the peer-\nreview literature for which we have alternative procedures available.\n  The second complication is latrogenic laceration, an accidental \ncutting of the uterus, occurs because, again, much of this procedure is \ndone blindly. The surgeon has scissors that are inserted into the base \nof the fetal skull. It is not just the insertion of the scissors, but \nit takes a spreading of the scissors to establish a real puncture large \nenough to evacuate the brain.\n  An another example, an article dated August 26, 1998, another \nquotation. Let me open with the quotation marks.\n  ``This blind procedure risks maternal injury from laceration of the \nuterus or cervix by the scissors and could result in severe bleeding \nand the threat of shock or even maternal death.''\n  ``Could result in severe bleeding and the threat of shock or even \nmaternal death.''\n  These risks, which I just outlined, have not been quantified for \npartial-birth abortions.\n  Would you want this untested procedure performed on anyone that you \nknow? The answer, I believe, is absolutely not because there is always \nan alternative procedure available.\n  Mr. President, we are discussing a fringe procedure with very real \nrisks to a woman's health. The lack of data on this procedure \nunderscores my opposition to it. Just as we cannot ignore the risk to \nthe mother, let's also look at the risk a little bit further down the \nline.\n  It leads me to a conclusion that partial-birth abortion is inhumane, \nand offends the very basic civil sensibilities of the American people. \nThe procedure itself, yes. But what about the treatment of the \nperiviable fetus? I say that because at what point in the gestation \nperiod viability actually is realized is subject to debate. It shifts \nwith technology and with our ability to intervene over time.\n  Most of these procedures are performed today in what is called the \nperiviable period--somewhere between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation, and \nbeyond.\n  The centers for pain perception in a fetus develop very early in that \nsecond trimester period. We cannot measure fetal pain directly, but we \ndo know that infants of similar gestational age after delivery--28 \nweeks, 30 weeks, or 24 weeks--those babies, those fetuses that are \ndelivered, do respond to pain. Again, we are talking about a procedure \nperformed on an infant, a fetus, at 24, 26 weeks.\n  With partial-birth abortions, pain management is not provided for the \nfetus at that gestational age. That fetus, remember, is literally \nwithin inches of actually being delivered. Pain management is given for \nprocedures if those 2 or 3 inches are realized and the baby is outside \nof the womb, at the same gestational age; if the fetus is in the womb, \npain management is not given.\n  I say that again because we have to at least think of the fetus and \nthink of the procedure, taking scissors and inserting them into the \ncranium, into the skull, and the spreading of those scissors. What is \nthat doing? Is that humane?\n  Therefore, to my statement that this is a barbaric procedure, I say \nit is an inhumane, barbaric procedure regarding the woman--and I just \nwent\n\n[[Page S12923]]\n\nthrough those complications--and regarding the fetus.\n  Because of the ``fringe'' nature of this practice, because of the \nlack of peer review and study of this procedure, I have strong feelings \nabout this issue. I have taken too much time walking through the \nmedical aspects, but I think it is important to free up a lot of the \nintensity of the debate earlier in the day. I think it is important to \nhave a discussion so the American people and my colleagues know at \nleast one surgeon's view of this surgical procedure.\n  I close by saying that because of this lack of peer review study of \nthis procedure, because of the fringe nature of this procedure, because \nof the grave risk it poses to the woman, because I believe it is \ninhumane treatment of that infant, that fetus, and because even as \nACOG, the gynecologic society, concedes partial-birth abortion is never \nthe only procedure that has to be used, I strongly support this \nlegislation by the Senator from Pennsylvania to outlaw this barbaric \nand this inhumane practice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I know the hour is late, and I will not take a lot of \ntime. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Kansas for his \nmarathon stay on the floor and the Chair tonight.\n  First, let me thank the Senator from Tennessee for his expert \ntestimony. We hear a lot from those who oppose this procedure and the \nfact there is no obstetrician here. I think someone with the surgical \nskills and the international reputation of Dr. Frist, combined with the \nobstetricians who, in fact, are Members of Congress on the other side \nof this Capitol who oppose this procedure, who support this bill--I \nthink we have the medical community of the Congress clearly on our \nside. I think as I stated before, we have the medical community \ngenerally on our side, hundreds and hundreds of obstetricians who have \ncome forward and talked about it.\n  I want to talk tonight about a few cases. I do that for a couple of \nreasons. I want to articulate again that there are alternatives \navailable to a partial-birth abortion. We heard Dr. Frist talk about \nother abortion techniques that are available in the medical literature, \ntechniques available for later in pregnancy if a mother decides to have \nan abortion. I want to share with people, because I think it is \nimportant and this transcends the partial-birth abortion debate, but I \nthink it is relevant to discuss that there are other ways to deal with \nthis that are as healthy, and, I argue, even more healthy, for the \nmother involved.\n  We heard the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, today talk about Viki \nWilson, Coreen Costello, and Vikki Stella. I entered into the Record \nthose three cases. All these women came to the Congress. They testified \nthemselves. They brought their own stories forward. They are now being \nused by Members of Congress and have been used by Members for several \nyears to support the claim this was the only method available to them \nand this saved their health and their future fertility. I will take \nthem one by one very quickly, but I want to reemphasize that this was \nnot the only option available to them. There were, in fact, more \nhealthy procedures.\n\n  That does not mean if a certain procedure is performed--I am sure the \ndoctor would affirm this--there is more than one procedure that can be \nused. Even if it is not the proper procedure, it may turn out OK with a \ngood result. The point I am trying to make and I think the point the \nmedical community is trying to make: It is not the best medicine, it is \nnot proper, and it certainly isn't the only procedure available.\n  In the case of Viki Wilson, according to her own testimony, she \ndidn't have a partial-birth abortion. She says in her testimony that \nthe death of her daughter Abigail was induced inside the womb.\n\n       My daughter died with dignity inside my womb, after which \n     the baby was delivered head first.\n\n  Partial-birth abortion, as we heard Dr. Frist describe, is when the \nbaby is delivered in a breach position alive, that all of the baby is \ntaken out of the mother except for the head, and then a sharp \ninstrument is inserted in the base of the skull, the baby is killed, \nand the brains are suctioned out.\n  That is not what happened. Yet we know that from her testimony, we \nhave known that for several years, since 1995. Yet year after year \nafter year, as we debate this bill, people come to the floor and hold \nup this case and say: Here is someone who was saved from health \nconsequences by partial-birth abortion. It didn't happen. It didn't \nhappen.\n  Let's take the cases where it did happen. I have two letters, one \nfrom a Dr. Pamela Smith who is at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and \nanother from Dr. Joseph DeCook who is at Michigan State University, \ndiscussing two different cases: First the Vikki Stella case, and second \nCoreen Costello.\n  It is very comfortable for me to stand here and talk about the very \npersonal and tragic cases. I am sure it is very painful for those \ninvolved to hear their case being brought up by someone they disagree \nwith in a very vociferous way. But if they are going to bring their \ncase to support a conclusion that this procedure is medically \nnecessary, then their story, their records, have to be examined to \ndetermine whether, in fact, it does support this medical determination, \nwhich has been arrived at by some, that this is a medically necessary \nprocedure.\n  In the case of Miss Stella, she has proclaimed that this is the only \nthing that could be done to preserve her fertility.\n  This is what Dr. Pamela Smith writes:\n\n       The fact of the matter is that the standard care of that is \n     used by medical personnel to terminate a pregnancy in its \n     later stages does not include partial-birth abortion. \n     Caesarean section, inducing labor with petosin or proglandins \n     or, if the baby has excess fluid in the head, as I believe \n     was the case with Miss Stella, draining the fluid from the \n     baby's head to allow a normal delivery, all are techniques \n     taught and used by obstetrical providers throughout this \n     country. These are techniques for which we have safe \n     statistics in regard to their impact with regard to the \n     health of both the woman and the child. In contrast, there \n     are no safety statistics on partial-birth abortion.\n\n  We heard Dr. Frist say that. This is not a peer-reviewed procedure. \nWe do not know from any kind of peer-reviewed study as to whether this \nis proper.\n\n       There is no reference on this technique in the National \n     Library of Medicine database, and no long-term studies \n     published to prove it does not negatively affect a woman's \n     ability to successfully carry a pregnancy to term in the \n     future. Miss Stella may have been told this procedure was \n     necessary and safe, but she was sorely misinformed.\n\n  We all want to believe what our doctor tells us. We all put faith in \nour doctor. When our doctor says this is the only thing that could have \nhelped you, I am not surprised that that is repeated by people who had \nthe service performed on them. But what this doctor is saying, what 600 \nobstetricians have said, what Dr. Frist has said, what Dr. Coburn in \nthe House has said, what Dr. Koop has said--Dr. C. Everett Koop--what \nthe AMA has said, is that this is not good medicine. So she was sorely \nmisinformed.\n  One of the complicating factors here that Senator Durbin brought up \nwas that Vikki Stella had diabetes. And Dr. Smith addresses that. She \nsays:\n       Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that tends to get \n     worse over time, and it predisposes individuals to infections \n     that can be harder to treat. If Miss Stella was advised to \n     have an abortion, most likely this was secondary to the fact \n     that her child was diagnosed with conditions that were \n     incompatible with life. The fact that Ms. Stella is a \n     diabetic, coupled with the fact that diabetics are prone to \n     infection and the partial-birth abortion procedure requires \n     manipulating a normally contaminated vagina over a course of \n     3 days, a technique that invites infection, medically I would \n     contend that of all the abortion techniques currently \n     available to her, this was the worst one that could have been \n     recommended for her. The others are quicker, cheaper, and do \n     not place a diabetic in such extreme risk of life-threatening \n     infections.\n\n  Again, for all of the argument that we need this procedure to protect \nthe health of the mother, and here are cases in which it was used to \nprotect the life and health of the mother, the fact is it was not the \nbest thing. The evidence is it was not the best thing. So the very \ncases we are to rely upon to make a judgment that this was in fact a \ncase in point as to why this procedure is necessary do not substantiate \nthe claim. These are their best cases. You don't bring out your worst \ncases. This is the best evidence.\n\n[[Page S12924]]\n\n  This goes back to what Dr. Frist just mentioned, what I have \nmentioned earlier in the day. We are still waiting to hear what case is \nnecessary: In what case is this the best procedure? Give us the set of \nfacts and circumstances where this is, in fact, a preferable option, \nwhere it has been peer reviewed, where there is consensus in the field \nthat this problem with the child and problem with the mother, that \ncombination, requires partial-birth abortion as the preferred method.\n  Organizations have said this may be the best. If you say ``may,'' \nthen you have to come forward saying where can it be the best; tell me \nwhat circumstances. They have not. Yet, incredibly, with all of the \nevidence we have presented on our side of this issue, of how it is bad \nmedicine, how it is not peer reviewed, how it is rogue medicine, how it \nwas developed by an abortionist who was not an obstetrician, how it is \nonly done in abortion clinics, how it is not taught in medical schools, \nit is not in any of the literature--all of this information is \noverwhelming that this is a bad procedure--the only thing they hold \nonto on the other side is, it may be necessary, with no instance, no \nhypothetical.\n  Pull out your worst set of facts for me, put them on paper, and tell \nme what it is. They will not do it. You have to wonder, don't you, if \nthis is the evidence they want to use to claim that health is a \nnecessary provision. It is bogus. It is bogus.\n  Coreen Costello--again, this is based on what she has revealed of her \nmedical history of her own accord. Again, Dr. DeCook states that a \npartial-birth abortion is never medically indicated. In fact, there are \nseveral alternative standard medical procedures to treat women \nconfronting unfortunate situations such as what Miss Costello had to \nface.\n  According to what she presented to us, the Congress, Miss Costello's \nchild suffered from at least two conditions, polyhydramnios secondary \nto abnormal fetal swallowing and hydrocephalus.\n       In the first the child could not swallow the amniotic fluid \n     and an excess of the fluid, therefore, collected in the \n     mother's uterus.\n       The second condition, hydrocephalus, is one that causes an \n     excessive amount of fluid to accumulate in the fetal head. \n     Because of the swallowing defect, the child's lungs were not \n     properly stimulated, and underdevelopment of the lungs would \n     likely be the cause of death if abortion had not intervened. \n     The child had no significant chance of survival, but also \n     would not likely die as soon as the umbilical cord was cut.\n       The usual treatment for removing the large amount of fluid \n     in the uterus is called amniocentesis. The usual treatment \n     for draining excess fluid from the fetal head is a process \n     called cephalocentesis. In both cases, the excess fluid is \n     drained by using a thin needle that can be placed inside the \n     womb through the abdomen, transabdominally or through the \n     vagina. The transvaginal approach, however, as performed by \n     Dr. McMahon on Miss Costello, puts a woman at an increased \n     risk of infection because of the nonsterile environment of \n     the vagina. Dr. McMahon used this approach most likely \n     because he had no significant experience in obstetrics and \n     gynecology.\n\n  Again, using a higher risk procedure. Why? This man was not an \nobstetrician; he was an abortionist.\n\n       In other words, he may not have been able to do as well \n     transabdominally in the standard method used by OB/GYNs \n     because that takes a degree of expertise he did not possess.\n       After the fluid has been drained and the head decreased in \n     size, labor will be induced and attempts made to deliver the \n     child vaginally. Miss Costello's statement that she was \n     unable to have a vaginal delivery or, as she called it, \n     natural birth or induced labor, is contradicted by the fact \n     that she did indeed have a vaginal delivery conduct by Dr. \n     McMahon. What Miss Costello had was a breach vaginal delivery \n     for purposes of aborting the child, however, as opposed to a \n     vaginal delivery intended to result in a live birth. A \n     cesarean section in this case would not be medically \n     indicated, not because of any inherent danger but because the \n     baby could have been delivered safely vaginally.\n\n  We have heard testimony after testimony from hundreds of \nobstetricians saying there may be cases where separation has to occur \nbetween the mother and the child because of the health of the mother, \nbecause of the life of the mother. There may be a case--there are cases \nwhere the baby within the mother's womb is a threat to the mother's \nlife and health. But what these doctors have said over and over and \nover again is, just because we have to separate the mother from the \nchild does not mean you have to kill the child in the process.\n  In the case of partial-birth abortion--take Coreen Costello--fluid \nwas drained. The baby could have been delivered. The baby could have \nbeen delivered and given a chance to survive. By killing the baby, you \nincrease the risk to the mother. When you do a procedure inside of the \nmother that causes the destruction of the child through shattering the \nbase of the skull, you are performing a brutal procedure, a very \nbloody, barbaric procedure inside of the mother that could result in \nlaceration, and bony fragments or shards perforating that birth canal \narea. That is much more dangerous to the health of the mother than \nsimply delivering the baby intact.\n  It seems almost incredible to me that in the overwhelming--\noverwhelming--status of the medical evidence presented on the floor we \nwould have any question as to whether this is really necessary to \nprotect the health of the mom.\n  My argument goes a little further because I think these doctors are \nsaying that you may need to deliver the child prematurely, but you \nnever need to kill the baby to protect the health and life of the \nmother. There is always a way to deliver the child. At least give this \nchild the dignity of being born.\n  Remember, most of these abortions are done on healthy mothers and \nhealthy babies. I think everyone looks at this debate and says: Oh, \nthis is a debate; about sick moms and sick kids. It is not a debate \nabout sick mothers and sick kids. This is a debate primarily about \nhealthy mothers who decide late in pregnancy not to have a child, and \nthe child is healthy. The child would be born alive if it were not \nkilled by the partial-birth abortion. The child, in many cases, would \nnot only be born alive but would survive that birth. We in the Senate \nsay too bad; too bad.\n  I am going to talk now about the small percentage of cases where \nthere are the difficult choices because that is the real powerful \nargument. That is why they make it because they believe it is the most \npowerful argument they have to keep this procedure legal. They do not \nwant to talk about the 90 percent of the cases because they cannot \ndefend that. You cannot defend a 25-week abortion with a healthy mother \nand a healthy baby where that baby would be born alive, survive, \ndevelop, and live normally. You cannot defend that.\n  And guess what. Surprise, surprise, nobody does. They do not talk \nabout those cases. That is the norm here. That is the norm. That is \nwhat goes on out there. They do not talk about that. They want to bring \nin the sick kids and the sick moms and say: We need this for these \nsmall percentage of cases.\n  Again, let's get to the argument again. In every one of those cases \nwhere there is a maternal health issue, there is overwhelming evidence \nthis procedure is not in the best interest of the mother, but they want \nto bring in the sick kids.\n  That bothers me because it assumes that you, the American public, out \nthere listening to what I am saying, somehow look at sick children as \nless important, as less worthy of life, as disposable, as a burden, as \na freak, as pain and suffering, not as a beautiful, wonderful gift from \nGod. That is why they argue these cases, and they argue these cases \nbecause there are millions of Americans who, when they hear about this \nchild who is deformed or not going to live long, see this child as a \nburden, as unwanted, as imperfect.\n  It is a sad commentary on our country if we look at God's creations \nand see only what their utility is to our country, to our lives, to our \nworld. And if their utility is not how we can quantify it in terms of \nwhat kind of job they can have, how smart they will be or how beautiful \nthey will be, what they will add to the value of life in America, they \nare seen as less useful, less needed, less wanted, a burden.\n\n  The fact that the people who make this debate, oppose this bill, \nbring this up and talk about just these cases sends a chill down my \nspine, because they are appealing to the darker side of us when they do \nthat. They are appealing to our prejudice against people who do not \nlook like us, who do not act like us, who are not perfect like us, and \nyet they are the very people who will fight heroic fights. And I give \ncredit to many who will fight the heroic fights to give rights to that \ndisabled child after it\n\n[[Page S12925]]\n\nsurvives. But once the child is delivered and once it is alive, then \nthey will fight the battle to make sure it gets a proper education \nunder IDEA.\n  The Senator in the Chair, Dr. Frist, was a great leader on that and \nworked with some of the opponents of this bill on ensuring disabled \nindividuals have rights. But I wonder how they can justify using these \ncases to appeal to this dark side of us, the cultural phenomenon in \nthis country that demands perfection, that is poisoning our little \ngirls with what perfect little girls must look like, that is leading to \ndisorder after disorder as a result of the striving for perfection that \nhas permeated our culture, what you have to look like, what you have to \nsmell like, what you have to wear.\n  They feed into that by saying these poor children are not quite \nworthy of life. While we will fight for them once they are born, I \nthink what they are actually saying is: But we really hope they are not \nborn in the first place.\n  That is very disturbing because I am going to share with you tonight \nsome stories about parents who made a different choice, who, when they \nheard about the child inside, decided they were going to look at that \nchild the way God looks at that child, as a beautiful, wonderful \ncreature of God, perfect in every way in His most important eyes, and \naccepted children for as long or as short a time as their life was to \nbe.\n  I am going to share with you a story first of Andrew Goin.\n  Last time we debated this issue on the override of the President's \nveto last year--it was last fall--I had this picture up here. We talked \nabout Andrew. And I will do so again. But I have a little addendum to \nthis story.\n  First, let me tell you about Andrew. That is Andrew. Andrew's mother \nis Whitney Goin. She had a feeling something was wrong 5 months into \nher pregnancy. When she went in for her first sonogram, a large \nabdominal wall defect was detected. She described her condition after \nlearning there was a problem with the pregnancy:\n\n       My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother \n     arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely \n     deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other \n     defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He \n     went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect \n     are often stillborn, live very shortly, or could survive with \n     extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence \n     of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The \n     complications and associated problems that a baby in this \n     condition could suffer include but are not limited to: \n     bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, \n     diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular \n     malformations . . . .\n\n  And so on.\n  A perinatologist suggested she strongly consider having a partial-\nbirth abortion. The doctor told her it may be something that she \n``needs'' to do--that she ``needs'' to do. He described the procedure \nas ``a late-term abortion where the fetus would be almost completely \ndelivered and then terminated.''\n  The Goins chose to carry their baby to term. But complications \nrelated to a drop in the amniotic fluid level created some concerns. \nDoctors advised the Goins that the baby's chances for survival would be \ngreater outside the womb. So on October 26, 1995, Andrew Hewitt Goin \nwas delivered by C-section. He was born with an abdominal wall defect \nknown as omphalocele, a condition in which the abdominal organs--\nstomach, liver, spleen, small and large intestines--are outside of the \nbaby's body but still contained in a protective envelope of tissue. \nAndrew had his first of several major operations 2 hours after he was \nborn.\n  Andrew's first months were not easy. He suffered excruciating pain. \nHe was on a respirator for 6 weeks. He needed tubes in his nose and \nthroat to continually suction his stomach and lungs. He needed eight \nblood transfusions. His mother recalled:\n\n       The enormous pressure of the organs being replaced slowly \n     into his body caused chronic lung disease for which he \n     received extensive oxygen and steroid treatments as he \n     overcame a physical addiction to the numerous pain killers he \n     was given.\n\n  It broke his parents' hearts to see him suffering so badly.\n  Andrew fought hard to live. In fact, Baby Andrew did live. On March \n1, 1999, Bruce and Whitney Goin welcomed their second child, Matthew, \ninto the family.\n  Here is a picture of the two of them.\n  Contrary to the misinformation about partial-birth abortion that has \nbeen so recklessly repeated, carrying Andrew to term did not affect \nWhitney's ability to have future children.\n  This is that little boy who ``needed'' to be aborted, who was not \n``perfect'' in our eyes. It is one of these ``abnormalities'' that we \nneed to get rid of. What a beautiful little boy. What a gift he is to \nhis parents. What a gift he is to all of us for his courage and \ninspiration. What inspiration we get as a society from those who \novercome the great odds and pain and strife. How ennobled we are by it.\n\n  Are we ennobled by partial-birth abortions? Would we be ennobled in \nthis country today if Whitney Goin did what she ``needed'' to do \naccording to the doctor?\n  Andrew Goin touched more than one life directly.\n  When I had this previous picture up of Andrew last year, I was here \nat about this time of night. At that time, Senator DeWine was in the \nChair. I was thinking, and I called my wife about an hour before, as I \ndid tonight, and I said: Honey, I just have to get up and talk some \nmore. I just feel it in me. I have to say more. I know it's not going \nto change anybody's vote, but I have to say it. I know there is nobody \non the floor other than Mike DeWine--at that time; and now Bill Frist \nat this time--who will be listening to what I'm going to say, but I \nhave to say it.\n  So here I am again. I remember finishing that night a little after 10 \no'clock. And it was after 10 o'clock, because the pages always \nencourage me, when I speak late at night, to speak until after 10 \no'clock so they don't have to go to school in the morning. So \ncongratulations, you are 3 minutes away from it.\n  So it was after 10 o'clock. And I remember closing down the Senate \nand Mike coming up here, and I just felt this sense that this was all \nfor nothing--as much as I care about this issue and as wrong as I \nbelieve this is for our country--that all that was said that night was \nfalling on deaf ears.\n  In fact, the next day we lost the override vote. So my feeling of \nfutility, if you will, was compounded--until a few days later when I \nreceived an e-mail from a young man who said:\n\n       Recently my girlfriend and I were flipping through the \n     channels, and we came across C-SPAN, and were fortunate \n     enough to hear your speech regarding the evils of partial-\n     birth abortion. We saw the picture of the little boy with the \n     headphones on, who was lucky enough to have had parents who \n     loved him and brought him into this world instead of ending \n     his life prenatally. Both of us were moved to tears by your \n     speech.\n       And my girlfriend confessed to me that she had scheduled an \n     appointment for an abortion the following week. She never \n     told me about her pregnancy because she knew that I would \n     object to any decision to kill our child. But after watching \n     your emotional speech, she looked at me, as tears rolled down \n     her cheeks, and told me that she could not go through with \n     it.\n       We're not ready to be parents. We still have a couple years \n     left at college. And then we will have a large student loan \n     to pay back. But I am grateful that my child will live. It is \n     a true tragedy that the partial-birth abortion ban failed to \n     override Clinton's veto. But please take some comfort in \n     knowing that at least one life was saved because of your \n     speech. You have saved the life of our child. May God \n     bless you and keep you.\n\n  Fortunately for me, the writer of this e-mail stayed in touch. I \nreceived an e-mail a couple of weeks ago that reported back what had \nhappened over the previous year. He says:\n\n       We reevaluated our ability to raise a child at this point \n     in time in our lives, and we finally decided to put our baby \n     up for adoption. I know that she is being raised by a loving \n     couple that cares deeply for her. I often wonder if we did \n     the right thing by putting her up for adoption, but I know we \n     did the right thing by bringing her into the world. Every now \n     and then I think that one day she is going to grow up and be \n     a part of the lives of many people. Then I wonder what would \n     have happened if I had just kept on clicking through the \n     channels and not stopped to see you speaking on C-SPAN. A \n     terrible thing might have happened and I probably would never \n     have known about it. I will always have in my mind the \n     thoughts about her life that she is living and the people \n     that she is important to. Once again, thank you so much for \n     your speech on C-SPAN that day. It is a terrible tragedy that \n     you were unable to override Clinton's veto, what it meant to \n     us, of course, our daughter and her adopted parents.\n\n  There is something ennobling about that story, something that touches \nall\n\n[[Page S12926]]\n\nof us, something that gives us hope. What I am saying is, I don't think \npartial-birth abortion does that to anyone. I don't think it is \nennobling to kill a child 3 inches away from being born. I don't think \nit is inspiring. I don't think it is the better angels of our nature. I \ndon't think it is going to go down in the annals of the Senate as one \nof our great compassionate civil rights votes or constitutional votes.\n  It doesn't lift up our spirits. It doesn't make us walk with that \nlonger stride, with our head held high. It is sanctioning the killing \nof an innocent baby who is 3 inches away from constitutional \nprotection, and it blurs the line of what is permissible in this \ncountry. If we can kill a little baby that would otherwise be born \nalive, 3 inches away from being born, what else are we capable of?\n  Unfortunately, we are answering that question every day, with the \nviolence we see reported on television, with the insensitivity to life \nthat we see occurring in our daily lives, with the calls for assisted \nsuicide, with the calls for mercy killings, even with this debate, with \nthe argument the Senator from California made earlier. She wants to \nmake sure that every child is wanted.\n  Mother Teresa said it best at the National Prayer Breakfast a few \nyears ago. ``Give me your children,'' she said. Give me your children. \nIf you don't want your children, give them to me; I want them.\n  Tens of thousands of mothers and fathers who cannot have children \nwant those children and will love those children. There is not a \nshortage of wanting in America when it comes to children. The most \ndebilitating thing to think about is that the life of a child can be \nsnuffed out, a life that could include 90 or 100 years. A little girl \nborn this year has a 1-in-3 chance to live to be 100. So for those \nlittle girls who are aborted through partial-birth abortion, 100 years \nof loving and making a contribution to our society, finding the cure to \ncancer, of enriching our lives is snuffed out because for a period of \ntime, a short period of time, your mother didn't want you. How many of \nus in our lives today would be snuffed out or could be snuffed out \nbecause someone doesn't want you?\n\n  We have a chance to make a statement tomorrow in the Senate. We have \na chance to stand as a body for these little children, these imperfect \nlittle children who the world and, unfortunately, Members of the Senate \nbelieve are somehow less worthy of being born because they may not live \nlong or they may be in pain and it would be merciful to put them out of \ntheir misery. I am sure Andrew Goin would say, please don't show me \nthat kind of mercy. In fact, we have lots of other children who were \nborn who I am sure would say, please don't show me that kind of mercy.\n  A picture here of Tony Melendez. Tony was born with no arms, 11 toes, \nand severe clubfoot. That is little Tony. I am sure what he would say \nto you today is, please don't show me that kind of mercy because I am \nnot perfect like you would like me to be. Tony didn't let all the \nprejudice that comes with having no arms, a clubfoot, 11 toes stop him \nfrom being one of the greatest inspirations we have had in our time. \nTony is now a musician. Tony plays the guitar with his feet. He has \nperformed for the Pope on three occasions, has traveled to 16 foreign \ncountries, played the national anthem in game 5 of the 1989 World \nSeries, on and on and on.\n  If you would listen to the debate today on the floor of the Senate, \nyou would think it might be more merciful to let him die before he gets \nthe chance to prove that he is worthy.\n  Donna Joy Watts. Donna Joy was here a couple of years ago. Donna Joy \nis an amazing story. It has been put in the Congressional Record for a \nlong time. We had it in here several times. Lori Watts, her mom, found \nout that her child had hydrocephalus, an excessive amount of cerebral \nfluid, water on the brain. She was told her daughter would virtually \nhave no brain, that most of her brain would be gone. So the \nobstetrician, when she found out on the sonogram, said Donna Joy should \nbe aborted, that a partial-birth abortion should be performed--yes, a \npartial-birth abortion. Mr. Watts said, ``No, we don't want to do an \nabortion.'' So they sent the Wattses to see a high-risk obstetrics \ngroup. They went to three hospitals in the Baltimore area. All three \nhospitals said they would abort Donna Joy, but they would not deliver \nher. Let me repeat that. They would perform an abortion, but they would \nnot deliver her. So people are worried about safe access to abortion. \nWe are getting to the point where we need safe access to birth. \nFinally, she found a team that would deliver her. Again, this group \nalso advised an abortion but then agreed to deliver. She was born with \nsevere health problems.\n  What the Wattses expected was that, as soon as the baby was born, a \nteam would go into action to see what they could do to help save this \nlittle girl. They found out that they did nothing. They did nothing. \nThey put the baby in a neonatal unit and kept it warm and they said to \nthe Wattses, your baby is going to die. We are not going to do \nanything. This baby is so sick, has such a little brain, so many \ncomplications, we are not going to deal with it. Guess what. She didn't \ngive up. She kept living. So now the doctors had this baby, now alive \nthree days, and they don't know what to do with her. This baby \nkeeps living and she should have been dead.\n\n  Finally, three days later, they implanted a shunt to drain off the \nexcess fluid. Of course, the shunt should have been in as soon as \npossible to minimize the damage, but they waited three days. What has \nhappened ever since then has been remarkable. Yes, there were \ncomplications. The shunts haven't worked. They have had to go back in \nseveral times to fix that. They had trouble feeding her. And so her \nmother came up with an ingenious way of fixing a mixture of baby food \nand giving it by syringe, one drop at a time, because that is all she \ncould handle eating. She had other complications.\n  Meningoencephalocele is another complication, and I can go on with \nepilepsy, sleep disorders, digestive complications. She has had a lot \nof problems. But she has survived them all. She has survived them all.\n  Donna Joy is about to celebrate, next month, her eighth birthday. \nAnd, yes, I have met her. She has been in my office. She walks and \ntalks and plays with my kids. She takes karate and she goes around with \nher mom to various places. We are fortunate to have the Watts living in \nPennsylvania. She provides living testimony to hope and to the horrors \nof partial-birth abortion, because she should not be alive today. She \nshould not be in this picture. If you accept the arguments on the other \nside, it is probably better if she wasn't there.\n  I don't accept those arguments. I don't accept the arguments that \nbecause a child may not have the kind of life that you want, she cannot \nhave a life worth living, because all life is worth living.\n  There are several other cases here that I would like to put in the \nRecord. One I want to talk about, finally, is the case of Christian \nMatthew McNaughton. I talk about this because this is somewhat personal \nbecause I know the McNaughtons. They are a wonderful family. Mark is a \nState legislator up in Pennsylvania. Christian was born in 1993. Before \nhe was born, the McNaughtons found, when Dianne went in for a sonogram, \nthat Christian had hydrocephalus, water on the brain. By the way, in \nseveral of the stories we heard about why we need to have partial-birth \nabortion, the abnormality was hydrocephalus. So these are parallel \ncases. The radiologist said the baby seemed to have more fluid on the \nbrain than tissue. They cautioned that it was possible the baby had no \nbrain at all. They were told their prospects were dim, and they were \nadvised that they could have an abortion. It would be preferable to \nhave an abortion. In fact, they were offered a partial-birth abortion.\n  Again, as the doctor explained it, the baby would be partially \ndelivered, the surgical instrument inserted into the base of the skull, \nthe brains would be extracted, or what there was of the brain, and the \nrest of the body would be delivered. Of course, they rejected that \noption. One of the doctors said, after they rejected the option, that \nshunt surgery to relieve the pressure, the fluid on the baby's brain, \nwould not be performed if the child's quality of life prospects did not \nwarrant it. That goes back to the Donna Joy situation.\n  Christian was born in June of 1993. He required special medical care. \nA CAT\n\n[[Page S12927]]\n\nScan revealed he suffered a stroke in utero, which caused excess fluid \nto build up in his brain. It showed that the lower level quadrant of \nhis brain was missing. Within a week of his birth, he had the first \nshunt surgery to drain fluid, and he had a follow-up procedure in three \nmonths. He exceeded everybody's expectations. So a baby, which doctors \ninitially believed was blind, had no capacity for learning, grew to a \nlittle boy who talked, walked, ran, sang, enjoyed playing baseball and \nbasketball. He attended preschool. His heroes were Cal Ripken, Jr., \nBatman, Spiderman, and the Backstreet Boys. He loved whales and \ndolphins. His favorite movie was Angels in the Outfield. And he \nespecially loved his baby sister, who was two years younger than he. \nChristian brought joy to all who were fortunate enough to know him.\n  In August, Christian began experiencing head pains. Here is little \nChristian in this photo, and this is his little baby sister. His shunt \nwas malfunctioning, and it had to be replaced.\n  After surgery, Christian experienced cardiac arrest respiratory \ndistress. He slipped into a coma. Fluid continued to accumulate on his \nbrain. He fought hard to live. But he didn't. He died 2 years ago on \nAugust 8 at the age of 4.\n  If you think these kids don't matter, if you think this option is \njust all pain, ask Mark and Dianne whether they would trade the 4 \nyears. They have those wonderful memories--difficult, sure; painful, \nsure. But they believed in their child. They loved him. They nurtured \nhim. And he returned much more than they ever gave--not just to them \nbut to all of us.\n  Do you want to know how they felt about their little brother?\n  Last year, on his anniversary, these are little ads taken out in the \nHarrisburg Patriot News by his sisters, his brother, his mom and dad.\n  His sister said:\n\n       Christian, we love you, we miss you, we wish we could kiss \n     you just one more time.\n\n  His brother, Mark:\n\n       I have a poem for you.\n       Blue jays are blue, and I love you; robins are red, and I \n     miss you in bed; sparrows are black, I wish you were back; I \n     am sorry for the bad things I did to you, you are the best \n     and the only brother I ever had, please watch over us and \n     take care of us. Love Mark.\n\n  His mom and dad:\n\n       Our arms ache to hold you again. Our hearts are forever \n     broken, but we thank God we had a chance to love you. We know \n     your smile is brightening up the heavens, and that Jesus \n     loves the little children. Please help us to carry on until \n     the day we can all play together again.\n\n  What would be missed, as some would suggest, if we just take all of \nthis pain away, and kill this baby before it would suffer through this \nhorrible life?\n  The McNaughtons would not trade a minute. I think it is obvious they \nwouldn't trade a minute.\n  All of the stories are not happy ones. All of the sad stories do not \nhave a bright side. Some are just tragic and tragic and tragic.\n  But I can tell you as a family who has gone through the loss of a \nchild, and what we thought was a normal pregnancy didn't go the way we \nhad hoped, accepting your child, loving your child, taking your \nchildren as they are, for as long as they are to be may be the hardest \nthing you can do. But it is the best that we can do--not just for the \nchild whose life you have affirmed and accepted but in your life.\n  In the case of Mark, the little boy knew he was loved. He lived a \ncouple of hours. Karen and I and our family have the knowledge that for \nthose hours we opened up our arms to him, and during those 2 hours he \nknew he was loved.\n  What a wonderful life we could all have if that is all we had.\n  We have a chance tomorrow to draw a bright line. A bright line needs \nto be drawn for this country. If there is a time in our society and in \nour world when we need a bright line separating life and death, I can \nthink of no better time.\n  This debate today and tomorrow is drawing that line, affirming that \nonce a baby is in the process of being born and there is a partial-\nbirth abortion outside of the mother, the line has been crossed. It is \nnot a fuzzy line. If we perform that kind of brutality to a little baby \nwho would otherwise be born alive, it is beneath us as a country.\n  History will look back at this debate, I am sure, and wonder how it \ncould have ever occurred. How we could ever have done that to the most \nhelpless among us? How did we ever cross the line?\n  But tomorrow those Members of the Senate will have a chance to tell a \ndifferent story for history, to say that the greatest deliberative body \nin the world will strike a clear blow for the right to life for little \nchildren during the process of being born.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask.

Mr. President, we have now set aside--until the next \ntime!--the McCain-Feingold legislation on campaign finance reform. I \ndid not speak during this most recent debate. The third in three years, \nand for certain not the last as Senator Feingold made clear last \nevening on the ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' I supported the reform \nwith only a faint sense of familiarity. Here we are, reforming the \nresults of the last reform. A not infrequent task of Congress. But now \nit might be useful to offer a few related observations.\n  The first is to state that raising money for political campaigns has \nnever been a great burden for this Senator, and for the simple reason \nthat I\n\n[[Page S12928]]\n\nhardly do any. One dinner a term, perhaps two. Some receptions. Lots of \nmail. Not surprisingly the results are not exactly spectacular. In \n1994, my last campaign, and which will be my last campaign, the Federal \nElections Commission records our having raised $6,100,147. This is for \nthe State of New York, the third most populous in the nation. But it \nsufficed. For practical purposes, all the money went to television, \nwith the incomparable Doug Schoen keeping an eye on the numbers lest \ntrouble appear unexpectedly. Our campaign staff never had ten persons, \nwhich may sound small to some, but I believe was our largest ever. Even \nso, we have done well. In 1988, I received some 4,000,000 votes and won \nby more than 2,000,000 votes, the largest numerical margin of victory \nin any legislative election in history. I say all this simply to note \nthat just possibly money isn't everything. But if we think it is, it \nmight as well be. And so we must persevere.\n  This July, in his celebrated Wall Street Journal column, Paul Gigot \nreferred to me as an ``old pol'' and an ``ever loyal Democrat.'' I \nwrote to thank him, for this is pretty close to the truth. If I have \nspent time in universities it was usually seeking sanctuary after a \nfailed election, my own or others. I go back before polling, and before \ntelevision. (Although in 1953 I did write a 15-minute television speech \nfor the Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York City, Robert F. \nWagner, Jr. It might have been seen by 10,000 people.) But of course \npolling caught on, as the mathematics got better, and television has \nnever stopped. And these, of course, are the technologies that \nseemingly confound us today. But this subject has been with us the \nlongest while.\n  Congress first placed restrictions on political spending with the \nNaval Appropriations Bill of 1867 which prohibited Navy officers and \nFederal employees from soliciting campaign funds from navy yard \nworkers.\n  Faced with allegations that corporations had bought influence with \ncontributions to his campaign, President Theodore Roosevelt called for \ncampaign finance reform in his 1905 and 1906 State of the Union \naddresses. In response, Congress passed the Tillman Act of 1907, \nbanning corporate gifts to Federal candidates. And during World War II, \nthe War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, known as the Smith-Connally Act, \ntemporarily prohibited unions from making contributions in Federal \nelections. In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act made this wartime measure \npermanent. As my colleagues well know, these bans have been made \nvirtually irrelevant with the advent of so-called ``soft money.''\n  Requirements for the disclosure of donors originated in the so-called \nPublicity Act of 1910 which required the treasurer of political \ncommittees to reveal the names of all contributors of $100 or more. \nCongress expanded the disclosure rules with the 1925 Federal Corrupt \nPractices Act, requiring political committees to report total \ncontributions and expenditures. The Court upheld this Act in Burroughs \nv. United States, declaring that Congress has the prerogative to ``pass \nappropriate legislation to safeguard (a Presidential) election from \nthe improper use of money to influence the result.'' We continue to \ndebate how to exercise that prerogative today.\n\n  But may I focus on one particular aspect of campaign funding, which \nis relatively new? Money for television. Ease this by providing free \ntelevision time--those are public airways--and as much about the \nproblem goes away as will ever be managed in this vale of toil and sin.\n  Max Frankel, the long-time and venerable editor of the New York Times \nand a wise and seasoned observer of American politics, addressed this \nissue in the October 26, 1997 New York Times Magazine:\n\n       The movement to clean up campaign financing is going \n     nowhere for the simple reason that the reformers are aiming \n     at the wrong target. They are laboring to limit the flow of \n     money into politics when they should be looking to limit the \n     candidates' need for money to pay for television time. It is \n     the staggering price of addressing the voters that drives the \n     unseemly money chase.\n\n  To run effectively for major office nowadays one needs to spend \nmillions for television commercials that spread your fame, shout your \nslogans, denounce your opponents, and counteract television attacks. A \ncampaign costing $10 million for a governorship or seat in the Senate \nis a bargain in many states. The President, even with all the \nadvantages of the White House at his command, appears to have spent \nmore than $250 million on television ads promoting his reelection in \n1996. $250 million!\n  The problem of so-called ``issue advocacy'' is only fueling the \namount of money going into television ads and further distorting our \nelectoral system. On February 10, 1998, Tim Russert delivered the fifth \nannual Marver H. Bernstein Symposium on Governmental Reform at \nGeorgetown University. In his address, he asserted that ``television \nads paid for by the candidates themselves are (not) going to be the \nproblem in future election cycles. That distinction will be earned by \nso-called `issue advocacy' advertising by ideological and single issue \ngroups.'' He made the point that, unlike candidates, these groups are \nnot subject to campaign contribution limits or disclosure requirements.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme court held that these ads are \nprotected speech under the First Amendment. We are told that requiring \nsuch groups to disclose their list of contributors might be a violation \nof the First Amendment under NAACP v. Alabama. Mr. Russert contends \nthat ``unless the Fourth Estate is able to identify these groups and \nferret out their funding, and explain their agenda, many elections \ncould very well be taken hostage by a select band of anonymous donors \nand political hit men.'' There must be a better way.\n  Might I suggest that the way to reduce the influence of these \n``select band of anonymous donors and political hit men'' and to reduce \nthe ungodly amount of money being used in campaigns is free television \ntime for candidates. Frankel writes:\n\n       It would be cheaper by far if Federal and State treasuries \n     paid directly for the television time that candidates need to \n     define themselves to the public--provided they purchased no \n     commercial time of their own. Democracy would be further \n     enhanced if television stations that sold time to special \n     interest groups in election years were required, in return \n     for the use of the public spectrum, to give equal time to \n     opposing views. But so long as expensive television \n     commercials are our society's main campaign weapons, \n     politicians will not abandon the demeaning and often corrupt \n     quest for ever more money from ever more suspect sources.\n\n  The version of the McCain-Feingold bill we have been considering \nrestricts so-called ``soft money''--contributions that national, state, \ncounty, and local party organizations may collect and spend freely \nprovided only that the television messages they produce with the funds \nare disguised to appear ``uncoordinated'' with any candidate's \ncampaign. This is a good first step. But it is not enough. Even if soft \nmoney and slimy variants were prohibited, political money would \nreappear in liquid or vaporous form. If we want to make significant \nchanges with regard to how we conduct campaigns, we must--to repeat \nFrankel--look beyond limiting the flow of money into politics and \nrather look to limiting the candidates' need for money to pay for \ntelevision time. Frankel concludes his piece on campaign finance reform \nby stating that ``there is no point dreaming of a law that says `you \nmay not' so long as the political system daily teaches the participants \n`you must.' Until candidates for office in America are relieved of the \ncostly burden of buying television time, the scandals will grow.'' He \ncould not be more right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12928-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12928-S12929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT \n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                VERMONT RURAL FIRE PROTECTION TASK FORCE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Bond for all of \nhis hard work on the FY 2000 Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, and the attention he \npaid to priorities in my home State of Vermont. I would like to briefly \ndiscuss with the Senator from Missouri the $600,000 provided in the \nConference Report for the Vermont Rural Fire Protection Task Force.\n  It is my understanding that the funds provided are for the purchase \nof personal safety equipment that includes, but is not limited to the \nfollowing: self-contained breathing apparatus, fire resistant turn out \ngear (helmets, coats\n\n[[Page S12929]]\n\npants, boots, hoods, gloves, and the like), personal pagers, personal \naccountability system to fulfill requirements of OSHA's two in two out \nrule, portable radios and personal hand lights. The need for new \nfirefighting equipment is great in Vermont, because of the new OSHA \nregulations. I hope that the funds provided in this bill will be \nmatched 50 percent with non-federal funds.\n  Further, it is my understanding that the funds will be administered \nby the Vermont Rural Fire Protection Task Force supported by the George \nD. Aiken and the Northern Vermont Resource Conservation and Development \nCouncil.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Vermont has accurately described the \nintentions of the Conference Report accompanying the FY 2000 \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12929-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The levels of these block grants were \n     guaranteed for a five-year period as a means to help in the \n     transformation of the nation's approach to welfare and \n     helping people help themselves; and\n       Whereas, A proposal has surfaced in Washington to have the \n     states return unobligated balances from the TANF block grant \n     funding. The proposal has raised the concerns and opposition \n     of state policymakers around the country who do not want the \n     success of welfare reform to be derailed or threatened by \n     reductions in this funding. This funding, as well as the \n     flexibility to administer federal programs, is critical to \n     genuine, meaningful, longstanding welfare reform; and\n       Whereas, Discussions on altering or reducing block grant \n     programs for needy families also include proposed changes in \n     Medicaid options, social services block grants, child support \n     initiatives, and efforts to secure health insurance coverages \n     for children. The possibility of bringing new conditions for \n     the expenditure of funds or cuts in the amounts of block \n     grants has generated considerable concern across the country; \n     and\n       Whereas, The reforms brought to the country's approach to \n     welfare in 1996 also represented a significant step in the \n     relationship between Washington and the states. This new \n     partnership allowed and even encouraged the ``laboratories of \n     democracy'' to find solutions that account for the unique \n     resources and needs of each state. Michigan's success and the \n     similar achievements across the nation should not be \n     jeopardized by Washington reclaiming money promised to the \n     states; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United Stats to reject any \n     reduction in block grant amounts to the states through the \n     Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program or any \n     changes in conditions or requirements that reduce the \n     flexibility of the states, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12930-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12930-S12931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5707.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Coastal Barrier \nResources Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the coastal barrier resources reauthorization act of 1999\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce a bill \nto reauthorize the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). Most people do \nnot realize that coastal barriers are the first line of defense \nprotecting the mainland from major storms and hurricanes, and this \nextremely vulnerable area is under increasing developmental pressure. \nFrom 1960 to 1990, the population of coastal areas increased from 80 to \n110 million and is projected to reach over 160 million by 2015. \nContinued development on and around coastal barriers place people, \nproperty and the environment at risk.\n  To address this problem Congress passed CBRA in 1982. This extremely \nimportant legislation prohibits the Federal government from subsidizing \nflood insurance, and providing other financial assistance such as beach \nreplenishment within the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Nothing in \nCBRA prohibits development on coastal barriers, it just gets the \nFederal government out of the business of subsidizing risky \ndevelopment.\n  The law proved to be so successful that we expanded the Coastal \nBarrier System in 1990 with the support of the National Taxpayers \nUnion, the American Red Cross, Coast Alliance and Tax Payers for Common \nSense, to name just a few. The 1990 Act doubled the size of the System \nto include coastal barriers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, \nthe Great Lakes and additional areas along the Atlantic and Gulf \ncoasts. We also allowed the inclusion of areas that are already \nprotected for conservation purposes such as parks and refuges. \nCurrently the System is comprised of 3 million acres and 2,500 \nshoreline miles.\n\n  Development of these areas decreases their ability to absorb the \nforce of storms and buffer the mainland. The devastating floods of \nHurricane Floyd are a reminder of the susceptibility of coastal \ndevelopment to the power of nature. The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency reports that 10 major disaster declarations were issued for this \nhurricane, more than for any other single hurricane or natural \ndisaster. In fact, 1999 sets a record for major disaster declarations--\na total of 14 in this year alone. As the number of disaster \ndeclarations has crept up steadily since the 1980's, so has the cost to \ntaxpayers. Congress has approved on average $3.7 billion a year in \nsupplemental disaster aid in the 1990's, compared to less than $1 \nbillion a year in the decade prior.\n  Homeowners know the risk of building in these highly threatened \nareas. Despite this taxpayers are continually being asked to rebuild \nhomes and businesses in flood-prone areas. The National Wildlife \nFederation came out with a study that found that over forty percent of \nthe damage payments from the National Flood Insurance Program go to \npeople who have had at least one previous claim. A New Jersey auto \nrepair shop made 31 damage claims in 15 years.\n  At a time when climatologists believe that Floyd and other major \nhurricanes signal the beginning of a period of turbulent hurricane \nactivity after three decades of relative calm, safety factors of \ncontinuing to develop coastal barrier regions must also be considered. \nAs roadway systems have not kept up with population growth, it will \nbecome increasingly difficult to evacuate coastal areas in the face of \na major storm.\n  Beyond the economic and safety issues, another compelling reason to \nsupport the Coastal Barrier Resources Act is that it contributes to the \nprotection of our Nation's coastal resources. Coastal barriers protect \nand maintain the wetlands and estuaries essential to the survival of \ninnumerable species of fish and wildlife. Large populations of \nwaterfowl and other migratory birds depend on the habitat protected by \ncoastal barriers for wintering areas. Undeveloped coastal barriers also \nprovide unique recreational opportunities, and deserve protection for \npresent and future public enjoyment.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today would reauthorize the \nAct for eight years and make some necessary changes to improve \nimplementation. A new provision would establish\n\n[[Page S12932]]\n\na set of criteria for determining whether a coastal barrier is \ndeveloped. Codifying the criteria will make it easier for homeowners, \nCongress and the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine if an area \nqualifies as an undeveloped coastal barrier. The legislation would also \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to complete a pilot project to \ndetermine the feasibility of creating digital versions of the coastal \nbarrier system maps. Digital maps would improve the accuracy of the \nolder coastal barrier maps, and make it easier for the Department of \nInterior and homeowners to determine where a structure is located. \nEventually, we hope that the entire System can be accessed by the \nInternet.\n  I believe that Congress should make every effort to conserve barrier \nislands and beaches. This legislation offers an opportunity to increase \nprotection of coastal barriers, and at the same time, saves taxpayers \nmoney. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1753. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide that an adopted alien who is less than 18 years of age may be \nconsidered a child under such Act if adopted with or after a sibling \nwho is a child under such Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  keeping immigrant siblings together\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \ncorresponding to one introduced by Congressman Horn of California and \npassed the House of Representatives this week. The intent of this bill \nis to allow immigrant orphan siblings to stay together when being \nadopted by U.S. citizens.\n  Under current law, a U.S. citizen may bring an immigrant child they \nhave adopted to the United States if the child is under the age of 16. \nThis bill would allow U.S. citizens to adopt immigrant children ages \n16-17 if the adoption would keep a group of siblings together.\n  Mr. President, I agree with Mr. Horn's conclusion that family unity \nis a frequently cited goal of our immigration policy, and this proposal \nwould promote that goal. Under current law, if children are adopted by \nU.S. citizens and the oldest sibling is 16 or 17, the oldest sibling \ncannot come to the United States with his or her brothers and sisters \nunder current law. It seems clear to me that siblings of these young \nages ought not to be separated.\n  Further, foreign adoption authorities in some cases do not allow the \nseparation of siblings. In such cases, if a U.S. citizen wanted to \nadopt a group of siblings and one of them is 16 or older, the citizen \nwould lose the opportunity to adopt any of them under current law.\n  As Mr. Horn's analysis of the consequences of this bill confirm, this \nbill is unlikely to cause a significant increase in immigration levels \noverall. During fiscal year 1996, a total a 351 immigrant orphans older \nthan age 9 were adopted by U.S. citizens, out of 11,316 immigrant \norphans adopted by U.S. citizens overall that year.\n  I thank Congressman Horn for his leadership in this issue. I \ncertainly hope that we can act of this measure before we adjourn.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1753\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROVIDING THAT AN ADOPTED ALIEN WHO IS LESS THAN \n                   18 YEARS OF AGE MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHILD UNDER \n                   THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT IF ADOPTED \n                   WITH OR AFTER A SIBLING WHO IS A CHILD UNDER \n                   SUCH ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (E)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) subject to the same proviso as in clause (i), a \n     child who (I) is a natural sibling of a child described in \n     clause (i) or subparagraph (F)(i); (II) was adopted by the \n     adoptive parent or parents of the sibling described in such \n     clause or subparagraph; and (III) is otherwise described in \n     clause (i), except that the child was adopted while under the \n     age of eighteen years; or''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (F)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(i) after ``(F)'';\n       (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) subject to the same provisos as in clause (i), a \n     child who (I) is a natural sibling of a child described in \n     clause (i) or subparagraph (E)(i); (II) has been adopted \n     abroad, or is coming to the United States for adoption, by \n     the adoptive parent (or prospective adoptive parent) or \n     parents of the sibling described in such clause or \n     subparagraph; and (III) is otherwise described in clause (i), \n     except that the child is under the age of eighteen at the \n     time a petition is filed in his or her behalf to accord a \n     classification as an immediate relative under section \n     201(b).''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments Relating to Naturalization.--\n       (1) Definition of child.--Section 101(c)(1) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(c)) is amended \n     by striking ``sixteen years,'' and inserting ``sixteen years \n     (except to the extent that the child is described in \n     subparagraph (E)(ii) or (F)(ii) of subsection (b)(1)),''.\n       (2) Certificate of citizenship.--Section 322(a)(4) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1433(a)(4)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``16 years'' and inserting ``16 years \n     (except to the extent that the child is described in clause \n     (ii) of subparagraph (E) or (F) of section 101(b)(1))''; and\n       (B) by striking ``subparagraph (E) or (F) of section \n     101(b)(1).'' and inserting ``either of such subparagraphs.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n\n  S. 1754. A bill entitled ``Denying Safe Havens to International and \nWar Criminals Act of 1999; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   denying safe havens to international and war criminals act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Leahy of Vermont, a bill titled ``Denying Safe Havens to \nInternational and War Criminals Act of 1999.'' This is an important \nmeasure that I hope can move promptly through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and through the Senate. The provisions contained in this bill \nare crucial in combating crime internationally. I believe that it will \ngive law enforcement critical tools in more effectively pursuing \nfugitives and ware criminals.\n  I thank my ranking member for his work on this matter. This bill \nincorporates in title III, his own bill dealing with war criminals and \nit is an important component of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the bill in the \nRecord.\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nwith Senator Hatch a bill to give United States law enforcement \nagencies important tools to help them combat international crime. The \n``Denying Safe Haven to International and War Criminals Act of 1999'' \ncontains a number of provisions that I have long supported.\n  Unfortunately, crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American \ninterests abroad are part of our modern reality. Furthermore, organized \ncriminal activity does not recognize national boundaries. With \nimprovements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with \nease. They can transfer funds with the push of a button, or use \ncomputers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and \nbusinesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at Americans \nhere and abroad. They can commit crimes abroad and flee quickly to \nanother jurisdiction or country. The playing field keeps changing, and \nwe need to change with it.\n  This bill would help make needed modifications in our laws, not with \nsweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at \nspecific problems faced by law enforcement. We cannot stop \ninternational crime without international cooperation, and this bill \ngives additional tools to investigators and prosecutors to promote such \ncooperation, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international \ncriminals and terrorists now enjoy.\n  I initially introduced title I, section 4 of this bill, regarding \nfugitive disentitlement, on April 30, 1998, in the ``Money Laundering \nEnforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998,'' S. 2011, with \nSenators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, \nI introduced with Senator Biden, on behalf of the Administration, the \n``International Crime Control Act of 1998,'' S. 2303, which contains \nmost of the provisions set forth in this bill. Virtually all of the \nprovisions in the bill were also included in\n\n[[Page S12933]]\n\nanother major anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and \nSecure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, that I introduced on September \n16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, \nKerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, and \nTorricelli. In addition, Senator Hatch and I included title II, section \n1 of this bill regarding streamlined procedures for MLAT requests in \nour ``International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998'', S. \n2536, which passed the Senate last October 15, 1998.\n  We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete \nimprovements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions \nmay be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law \nenforcement priority.\n  Title I sets forth important proposals for combating international \ncrime and denying safe havens to international criminals. In \nparticular, section 1 would provide for extradition under certain \ncircumstances for offenses not covered in a treaty or absent a treaty. \nTreaties negotiated many years ago specified the crimes for which \nextradition would be allowed. Developments in criminal activity, \nhowever, have outpaced the ability of countries to renegotiate treaties \nto include newly developing criminal activity. Under the bill, \nextradition would nevertheless proceed as if the crime were covered by \na treaty for ``serious offenses,'' which are defined to include crimes \nof violence, drug crimes, bribery of public officials, obstruction of \njustice, money laundering, fraud or theft involving over $100,000, \ncounterfeiting over $100,000, a conspiracy to commit any of these \ncrimes, and sex crimes involving children. The section sets forth \ndetailed procedures and safeguards for proceeding with extradition \nunder these circumstances.\n\n  Section 2 contains technical and conforming amendments.\n  Section 3 would give the Attorney General authority to transfer a \nperson in custody in the United States to a foreign country to stand \ntrial where the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, determines that such transfer would be consistent with the \ninternational obligations of the United States. The section also allows \nfor the transfer of a person in state custody in the United States to a \nforeign country to stand trial after a similar determination by the \nAttorney General and the consent of the State authorities. Similarly, \nthe Attorney General is authorized to request the temporary transfer of \na person in custody in a foreign country to face prosecution in a \nfederal or state proceeding.\n  Section 4 is designed to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other \ninternational fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the \nproceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should \nnot be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our \nlaws.\n  Section 5 would permit the transfer of prisoners to their home \ncountry to serve their sentences, on a case-by-case basis, where such \ntransfer is provided by treaty. Under this section, the prisoner need \nnot consent to the transfer.\n  Section 6 would provide a statutory basis for holding and \ntransferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign country to another \nthrough United States airports, preventing them from claiming asylum \nwhile they are temporarily in the United States.\n  Title II of the bill is designed to promote global cooperation in the \nfight against international crime. Specifically, section 1 would permit \nUnited States courts involved in multi-district litigation to enforce \nmutual legal assistance treaties and other agreements to execute \nforeign requests for assistance in criminal matters in all districts \ninvolved in the litigation.\n  Section 2 outlines procedures for the temporary transfer of \nincarcerated witnesses. Specifically, the bill would permit the United \nStates, as a matter of reciprocity, to send persons in custody in the \nUnited States to a foreign country and to receive foreign prisoners to \ntestify in judicial proceedings, with the consent of the prisoner and, \nwhere applicable, the State holding the prisoner. A transfer may not \ncreate a platform for an application for asylum or other legal \nproceeding in the United States. Decisions of the Attorney General \nrespecting such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the \nSecretary of State.\n  Title III of the bill is the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' \nS. 1235, which I introduced on July 15, 1999, with Senator Kohl and is \ncosponsored by Senator Lieberman. This bill has also been introduced in \nthe House with bipartisan support as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058. This \ntitle of the bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nexpand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens \nwho have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already \ndefined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340, in a law \npassed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention \nAgainst Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an \naffirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries \nregardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2340A \n(1994).\n\n  This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, \nwhich currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and \nwould expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, \nprosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and \ngenocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI in hunting Nazi war \ncriminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and \nexpertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its \nmission. The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of \nparticular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often \nnecessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be \naccomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather \nthan in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have \nmore diverse missions.\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from \nthe OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the \nbill for OSI's expanded duties.\n  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. \nThey are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. \nWorking together, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will \naccomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure \nplace.\n  I ask that the attached sectional analysis of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n  Denying Safe Havens to International and War Criminals Act of 1999--\n                      Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n        title i--denying safe havens to international criminals\n\n    Section 1. Extradition for Offenses Not Covered by a List Treaty\n\n       This section allows the Attorney General to seek \n     extradition of a person for specified crimes not covered by a \n     treaty. Treaties negotiated many years ago specified the \n     crimes for which extradition would be allowed, and \n     developments in criminal activity have outpaced the ability \n     of countries to renegotiate treaties to include newly \n     developing criminal activity. Extradition would proceed as if \n     the crime were covered by treaty, and the section sets forth \n     detailed procedures and safeguards. Applicable crimes include \n     crimes of violence, drug crimes, obstruction of justice, \n     money laundering, fraud or theft involving over $100,000, \n     counterfeiting over $100,000, conspiracy to commit any of \n     these crimes, and sex crimes involving children.\n\n             Section 2. Technical and Conforming Amendments\n\n       This section amends related statutes to conform with \n     Section 1.\n\n  Section 3. Temporary Transfer of Persons in Custody for Prosecution\n\n       This section allows a temporary transfer of a person from \n     another country to the United States to stand trial where the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State \n     determines that such transfer would be consistent with the \n     international obligations of the United States. The section \n     also allows for the transfer of a person in custody in the \n     United States to a foreign country to stand trial after a \n     similar determination by the Attorney General.\n\n Section 4. Prohibiting Fugitives From Benefiting From Fugitive Status\n\n       This section adds a new section 2466 (Fugitive \n     Disentitlement) to Title 28 to provide that a person cannot \n     stay outside the United States, avoiding extradition, and at \n     the same time participate as a party in a civil action over a \n     related civil forfeiture claim. The Supreme Court recently \n     decided that a previous judge-made rule to the same effect \n     required\n\n[[Page S12934]]\n\n     a statutory basis. This section provides that basis.\n\nSection 5. Transfer of Foreign Person to Serve Sentences in Country of \n                                 Origin\n\n       This section permits transfer, on a case-by-case basis, of \n     prisoners to their home country where such transfer is \n     provided by treaty. Under this section the prisoner need not \n     consent to the transfer.\n\n  Section 6. Transit of Fugitives for Prosecution in Foreign Countries\n\n       This section would provide a statutory basis for holding \n     and transferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign \n     country to another through United States airports, at the \n     discretion of the Attorney General. The temporary presence in \n     the United States would not be the basis for a claim for \n     asylum.\n\n\n      title II--promoting global cooperation in the fight against \n                          international crime\n\n    Section 1. Streamlined Procedures for Execution of MLAT Requests\n\n       This section permits United States courts involved in \n     multi-district litigation to enforce mutual legal assistance \n     treaties and other agreements to execute foreign requests for \n     assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved in \n     the litigation or request.\n\n        Section 2. Temporary Transfer of Incarcerated Witnesses\n\n       This section permits the United States, as a matter of \n     reciprocity, to send persons in custody in the United States \n     to a foreign country and to receive foreign prisoners to \n     testify in judicial proceedings, with the consent of the \n     prisoner and, where applicable, the State holding the \n     prisoner. A transfer may not create a platform for an \n     application for asylum or other legal proceeding in the \n     United States. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting \n     such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the \n     Secretary of State.\n\n\n               title III--anti-atrocity alien deportation\n\n    Section 1. Inadmissibility and Removability of Aliens Who Have \n                    Committed Acts of Torture Abroad\n\n       Currently, the Immigration and Nationality Act provides \n     that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during the time \n     period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens \n     who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the United \n     States and deportable. See 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and \n     Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). The bill would amend these sections of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the grounds \n     for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have \n     engaged in acts of torture abroad. The United Nations' \n     ``Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment'' entered into force with \n     respect to the United States on November 20, 1994. This \n     Convention, and the implementing legislation, the Torture \n     Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2340 et seq., \n     includes the definition of ``torture'' incorporated in the \n     bill and imposed an affirmative duty on the United States to \n     prosecute torturers within its jurisdiction.\n\n    Section 2. Establishment of the Office of Special Investigations\n\n       Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within \n     the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, \n     consolidating within it all ``investigative and litigation \n     activities involving individuals, who prior to and during \n     World War II, under the supervision of or in association with \n     the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other \n     affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     persecution of any person because of race, religion, national \n     origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-\n     79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that \n     Attorney General Order.\n       This section would amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1103, by directing the Attorney General to \n     establish an Office of Special Investigations within the \n     Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, \n     remove, denaturalize, or prosecute any alien who has \n     participated in torture or genocide abroad. This would expand \n     OSI's current authorized mission. Additional funds are \n     authorized for these expanded duties to ensure that OSI \n     fulfills its continuing obligations regarding Nazi war \n     criminals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1755. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to regulate \ninterstate commerce in the use of mobile telephones; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               the mobile telecommunications sourcing act\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Dorgan, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act \nof 1999. This legislation is the product of more than a year's worth of \nnegotiations between the Governors, cities, State tax and local tax \nauthorities, and the wireless industry.\n  The legislation represents an historic agreement between State and \nlocal governments and the wireless industry to bring sanity to the \nmanner in which wireless telecommunications services are taxed.\n  For as long as we have had wireless telecommunications in this \ncountry, we have had a taxation system that is incredibly complex for \ncarriers and costly for consumers. Today, there are several different \nmethodologies that determine whether a taxing jurisdiction may tax a \nwireless call.\n  If a call originates at a cell site located in a jurisdiction, it may \nimpose a tax. If a call originates at a switch in the jurisdiction, a \ntax may be imposed. And if the billing address is in the jurisdiction, \na tax can be imposed.\n  As a result, many different taxing authorities can tax the same \nwireless call. The farther you travel during a call, the greater the \nnumber of taxes that can be imposed upon it.\n  This system is simply not sustainable as wireless calls represent an \nincreasing portion of the total number of calls made throughout the \nUnited States. To reduce the cost of making wireless calls, Senator \nDorgan and I are introducing this legislation.\n  The legislation would create a nationwide, uniform system for the \ntaxation of wireless calls. The only jurisdictions that would have the \nauthority to tax mobile calls would be the taxing authorities of the \ncustomer's place of primary use, which would essentially be the \ncustomer's home or office.\n  By creating this uniform system, Congress would be greatly \nsimplifying the taxation and billing of wireless calls. The wireless \nindustry would not have to keep track of countless tax laws for each \nwireless transaction. State and local taxing authorities would be \nrelieved of burdensome audit and oversight responsibilities without \nlosing the authority to tax wireless calls. And, most importantly, \nconsumers would see reduced wireless rates and fewer billing headaches.\n  The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is a win-win-win. It's a \nwin for industry, a win for government, and a win for consumers. I \nthank Senator Dorgan for working with me in crafting this bill. And, \nmost of all, I thank government and industry for coming together and \nreaching agreement on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator \nBrownback and I are introducing legislation that is designed to address \na highly complex issue with respect the taxation of mobile \ntelecommunications service. Although the issue is complex, the solution \nhas a simple goal: to create a reliable and uniform method of taxation \non wireless telecommunications services that works best for consumers.\n  Currently, the mobility of wireless telecommunications services makes \nthe taxation by state and local jurisdictions a complicated and \nexpensive task for carriers and consumers because questions arise as to \nwhether the tax is levied in the location in which the call is placed \nor where the user resides. Because this situation is difficult to \nmonitor, state and local jurisdictions the prospects of non-compliance \nand double taxation are also of concern. For example, a person driving \nbetween Baltimore, Maryland and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania can pass \nthrough 12 separate state and local taxing jurisdictions. In the two \nhours it would take someone to make that 100 mile drive, several phone \ncalls could be made under a cloud of tax ambiguity that works for no \none, not the consumer, not the carrier, and not the taxing \njurisdictions. This scenario presents us with challenge to the \ntraditional method of taxation in the face of the growing popularity of \nmobile communications systems. It is a case that needs to be changed.\n  The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is, in itself, an \nachievement. This legislation was developed through 3 years of \ndedicated, good faith negotiations between the industry and state and \nlocal government organizations. Rather than allow an unworkable \nsituation to continue unresolved and rather than ignite a polemical \npolitical debate over a special interest solution, the industry and \nseveral state and local government organizations sat down and worked \nout a solution that satisfies all the stake holders. I extend my \ncongratulations and gratitude to the leaders and staff members of the \norganizations that participated in the development of this consensus \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S12935]]\n\n  Under this legislation, a consumer's primary place of residence would \nbe designated as the taxing jurisdiction for the purposes of taxing \nroaming and other charges that are subject to state and local taxation. \nThis legislation does not impose any new taxes nor does it change the \nauthority of state and local governments to tax wireless services. It \ndoes, however, provide consumers with simplified billing, reduce the \nchances of double taxation, preserve the authority of state and local \njurisdictions to tax wireless services, and reduce the costs of tax \nadministration for carriers and governments. In the end, the consumer \nwill benefit through this tax clarification legislation that is badly \nneeded.\n  As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, I have been involved in \nmany battles over the years where state and local governments have \nattempted to preserve their taxation authority as Congress has sought \nto preempt that authority on behalf of some special interest. I am very \npleased to be in a position today to sponsor legislation which \naddresses a legitimate need to clarify and simplify state and local \ntaxation in a manner that works for consumers, industry, and state and \nlocal governments alike.\n  I also want to express my gratitude to my colleague Senator Brownback \nfor his work on this measure. I hope that our colleagues will take note \nthat Senator Brownback and I stand together on this consensus, \nbipartisan legislation and join us to advance this bill \nexpeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1756. A bill to enhance the ability of the National Laboratories \nto meet Department of Energy missions and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to be joined by \nSenator Murray in introducing the ``National Laboratories Partnership \nImprovement Act of 1999''. This bill will make it easier for our \nnational labs to collaborate and build strong technical relationships \nwith other technical organizations, particularly universities and \ncompanies right near the labs. That will yield two major benefits. It \nwill improve the labs' ability to do their missions, and it will \npromote high tech economic growth around the labs, thus, helping the \nlabs as it helps the labs' communities.\n  Many of you know that making it easier to work with our national labs \nis a cause I've pursued for many years. And we've made solid progress. \nThe labs are now involved in an array of technical collaborations, \nusually under cooperative research and development agreements or \nCRADAs, that would have been impossible a decade ago. In 1989, there \nwere no CRADAs with the Department of Energy's national labs; in 1998, \nthe number was over 800.\n  So, we've come a long way. But there's still work to be done. It's \nstill not as easy to collaborate with the national labs as it should \nbe, nor are collaborations as common as they need to be to keep our \nlabs on the cutting edge of science and technology. This legislation \ntakes the next steps in that direction.\n  There are three fundamental ideas running through this bill. The \nfirst is that scientific and technical collaboration with the national \nlabs is good for our economy and essential to the future of the labs. \nThe labs will be unable to succeed in their missions unless they can \neasily work with other technical institutions. Why? Because that's \nwhere the bulk of cutting edge technology is today. Consider the \nfollowing. Real federal spending on R peaked in 1987, but from 1987 \nto 1997, national R grew by 20%. The federal government was \nresponsible for none of that growth, and now accounts for only about a \nquarter of national R spending. In the same period, industrial R \ngrew by over 50% and accounted for around 95% of the growth in national \nR As Nobel laureate Dr. Burt Richter stated during his testimony on \nDOE's reorganization, ``All of the science needed for stockpile \nstewardship in not in the weapons labs.'' That's why I was so concerned \nwith the ability of the labs to collaborate during the reorganization \ndebate.\n  I emphasize how collaboration helps the labs because it's a point \nthat's often missed in our discussions of tech transfer, CRADAs, and \nother such things. When legislation making it easier to work with the \nlabs was passed in 1989, we were in the midst of a ``competitiveness \ncrisis'' and looking for ways to use technology to improve our economic \nperformance. After all, innovation is responsible for 50% or more of \nour long term economic growth. With these roots, people usually focus \non how collaborating with the labs helps US industry by giving it \naccess to a treasure trove of technology and expertise. For example, \nover a 100 new companies were started around DOE technology in the last \nfour years. And, the fact that industry has been collaborating with the \nlabs and recently paying for a greater share of those partnerships is \ngood evidence that its getting something of value. The economic \nbenefits from these collaborations are real and a primary reason I've \npushed them for many years.\n  But the benefits back to the labs are real too. A recent letter from \nLos Alamos to me stated, ``Working with industry has validated our \nability to predict . . . changes in materials . . ., improved our \nability to manufacture . . . replacement parts with greater precision \nand lower cost, and enhanced our ability to assure the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile without testing.''\n  As an example, Sandia's collaboration with Goodyear Tire has helped \nGoodyear produce computer simulations of tires--an extremely complex \nproblem--and helped Sandia improve its modeling and production of \nneutron generators, a critical component of nuclear weapons. Technical \ncollaborations with our labs that have a clear mission focus by the lab \nand a clear business focus by the company are good for our economy and \ngood for the labs' missions.\n  The second fundamental idea flows from the first. If collaborations \nwith the labs are beneficial, we should keep working to make them \nbetter, faster, and more flexible--much like the collaborations we see \nsprouting throughout the private sector. Hence, this bill includes \nprovisions to:\n  Establish a small business advocate at the labs charged with \nincreasing small business participation in lab procurement and \ncollaborative research;\n  Establish a technology partnership ombudsman at the labs to ensure \nthat the labs are known as good faith partners in their technical \nrelationships;\n  Authorize DOE to use a very flexible contracting authority called \n``other transactions,'' which was successfully pioneered by the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency to manage some of its collaborative \nprojects in innovative ways; and\n  Significantly streamline the CRADA approval process for government \nowned, contractor operated laboratories like Sandia, allowing the labs \nto handle more of the routine CRADAs themselves, and allowing more \nflexibility in the negotiation of intellectual property rights--all to \nmake CRADA's more attractive to industry.\n  The third fundamental idea that runs through this bill is that if \ncollaboration is important to our economy and to the success of the \nlabs, then the local technical institutions near the lab--the \nuniversities and companies that might work with the lab--matter a great \ndeal. We know that the environment inside an institution, how it's \nmanaged, will help determine how innovative it is. Managing innovation \nis more art than science, and that's why people are always visiting \nplaces like 3M.\n  Well, just as the internal environment affects how innovative an \norganization is, its external environment, the organizations near it \nthat might collaborate with it, also help determine how innovative it \nis. When the technical institutions in a region form a high quality, \ndynamic network, they can meld into what's been called a ``technology \ncluster'' that dramatically boosts innovation and economic growth \nthroughout the region. We see this most famously in places like Silicon \nValley, or Route 128, or Austin, TX. In most of these places, there is \na large research university that serves as the anchor innovator seeding \nthe cluster.\n  With that phenomena in mind, this bill seeks to harness the power of \ntechnology clusters for the benefit of the labs' missions and the labs' \ncommunities, with the labs as the anchor innovator. The bill authorizes \nthe labs to\n\n[[Page S12936]]\n\nwork with their local communities to foster commercially oriented \ntechnology clusters that will help them do their job. Projects under \nthis ``Regional Technology Infrastructure Program'' would be cost \nshared partnerships between a lab and nearby organizations with the \nclear potential to help the lab achieve its mission, leverage \ncommercial technology, and commercialize lab technology. This is not \nabout outsourcing a lab's functions, but about promoting technical \ncapabilities near the lab that are commercially viable and useful to \nthe lab. Thus, the lab gets highly competent collaborators nearby and \nthe region gets high tech economic growth.\n  Let me give an example. Imagine a lab that does research in optics \nthat has optics companies nearby. The lab and the companies discover \nthey both need better training for their machinists and skilled \nworkers. So they agree to set up and share the cost of an advanced \ntraining program for their workers at the local community college. This \nis good for the workers, good for the companies, good for the lab. \nOther types of projects this program might fund include:\n  Local economic surveys and strategic planning efforts;\n  Technology roadmaps for local industry;\n  Personnel exchanges among local universities, firms, and the lab;\n  Lab based small business incubators or research parks; and\n  Joint research programs between a group of local firms and the lab.\n  We have some real life examples of this kind of thinking in the \nresearch parks Sandia and Los Alamos are setting up to collaborate with \nindustry and promote economic growth. And Argonne, Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, and Sandia have programs to \nlink their technology with venture capital, to get it into the \nmarketplace, which can only help advance the lab's mission. This bill \nwill encourage the labs to systematically experiment with more projects \nlike those.\n  Now, some might think that the Internet will make proximity \nirrelevant to collaboration. But that's not the case, as simple \nobservation of Silicon Valley shows; it's not been dissipating, it's \nbeen growing. Close collaboration will remain easier among close \nneighbors, because it partly depends on people who know each other and \nare rooted in a community--which is why one provision of this bill is a \nstudy on how to ease employee mobility between the labs and nearby \ntechnical organizations. The Internet complements and strengthens \ncollaborations, but is not a complete substitute for having \ncollaborators nearby. Thus, even as the Internet grows in influence, it \nwill still make sense to harness the power of technology clusters to \nhelp our labs do their jobs and to promote high tech economic growth in \ntheir communities.\n  Mr. President, for many years I've pushed for and supported efforts \nto make it easier for our national labs to work with industry, \nuniversities, and other institutions. I've done this because I think \nit's good for the science and security missions of our labs, good for \nour economy, and good for my home state of New Mexico. I think this \nbill is a comprehensive package that will yield more of those benefits, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a \nsummary, and letters of support for this bill from the Technology \nIndustries Association of New Mexico and the City of Albuquerque be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  [The text of the bill was not available for printing.]\n\n       National Laboratories Partnership Improvement Act of 1999\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The National Laboratories Partnership Improvement Act of \n     1999 will build stronger technical relationships between the \n     Department of Energy's national laboratories and other \n     institutions, particularly those near the labs. These \n     relationships will help the labs achieve their missions by \n     leveraging the scientific and technical resources of the \n     private sector and universities and will also promote high \n     tech economic growth around the labs.\n\n\n                         Background/Discussion\n\n       More and more of our nation's innovation occurs outside the \n     federal sector. Since 1987, around 95% of the real growth in \n     our national R has come from the private sector, and none \n     from the federal government. Industry now funds almost 70% of \n     our national R\n       Scientific and technical collaborations between our \n     national labs and other technical institutions improve the \n     lab's access to the huge pool of science, technology, and \n     talent outside their gates. Technical collaboration with the \n     national labs is both good for the companies that do it and \n     essential for keeping the labs on the cutting edge of \n     research.\n       This bill takes the next step in making it easier for our \n     national laboratories to work with other institutions. In \n     addition to improving the CRADA process, the bill also \n     focuses on improving the ``regional technology \n     infrastructure'' around the labs. This refers to things like \n     the companies, universities, labor force, and non-profit \n     organizations near a lab that are not formally part of it but \n     that nonetheless contribute to its technical success.\n       Places like Silicon Valley show that when these technical \n     institutions form a high quality, dynamic network, they can \n     develop into a ``technology cluster'' that dramatically \n     improves innovation and economic growth throughout a region. \n     This bill will promote the development of technology clusters \n     around the national labs both to help the labs harness the \n     power of technology clusters to achieve their missions and to \n     stimulate high tech economic growth around the labs.\n\n\n                     Section by Section Description\n\n       Sec. 1-3--Titles, findings, and definitions.\n       Sec. 4--Regional Technology Infrastructure Program--\n     Authorizes the Department of Energy to promote the \n     development of technology clusters around the national labs \n     that will help them achieve their missions. The idea is to \n     foster commercially oriented, dynamic networks of local \n     institutions, broadly analogous to that in Silicon Valley, \n     that will improve innovation and economic growth around the \n     labs--thereby helping the labs as they help the labs' \n     communities. Projects under this program will be \n     competitively selected, cost shared partnerships between a \n     lab and nearby organizations. Projects with the clear \n     potential to help a lab achieve its mission, leverage \n     commercial innovation, and commercialize lab technology will \n     be selected. The program begins with $1M of funding at each \n     of the nine, large multiprogram labs. Examples of the kinds \n     of projects that might be funded are: local economic surveys \n     and strategic planning efforts; technology roadmaps for local \n     industry; personnel exchanges and specialized workforce \n     training programs among local universities, firms, and the \n     lab; lab based small business incubators or research parks; \n     and joint research programs between a group of local firms \n     and the lab.\n       Sec. 5--Small Business Advocacy and Assistance--Establishes \n     a Small Business Advocate charged with increasing small \n     businesses' participation in procurements and collaborative \n     research at each of the nine, large multiprogram labs. \n     Authorizes the labs to give small businesses advice to make \n     them better suppliers and general technical assistance. For \n     example, a lab could point them to venture capitalists or \n     technical partners that would strengthen their ability to \n     work for the lab. Or, a small business could get technical \n     advice from a lab on how to fix a product design problem. \n     Complements Sec. 4, but is focused directly on small \n     businesses.\n       Sec. 6--Technology Partnership Ombudsman--Establishes an \n     ombudsman at the nine, large multiprogram labs to quickly and \n     inexpensively resolve complaints or disputes with the labs \n     over technology partnerships, patents, and licensing.\n       Sec. 7--Mobility of Technical Personnel--Requires DOE to \n     remove any disincentives to technical personnel moving among \n     the national labs. Creates a study to recommend how to ease \n     the movement of technical personnel between the labs and \n     nearby industry with the long term goal of promoting start-\n     ups and stronger networks of technical collaboration near the \n     labs.\n       Sec. 8--Other Transactions--Standard government contracts, \n     grants, or cooperative agreements can be ill-suited to \n     collaborative projects that have a variety of actors and \n     equities. This section gives DOE ``other transactions,'' an \n     exceptionally flexible contracting authority that allows a \n     ``clean sheet of paper'' negotiation with non-federal \n     organizations. Other transactions were successfully pioneered \n     by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency to manage \n     many of its innovative relationships with industry; more \n     recently they've been adopted by the military services and \n     Department of Transportation.\n       Sec. 9--Amendments to the Stevenson-Wydler Act--The current \n     law governing CRADAs can make them slower to negotiate and \n     less attractive to industry than they should be. This section \n     amends that law to make the negotiation process faster, more \n     flexible, and more attractive to industry. More specifically, \n     this section: shortens the time federal agencies have to \n     review, modify, and approve CRADAs with government owned, \n     contractor operated (GOCO) labs, making it the same as that \n     for government owned, government operated labs; allows more \n     negotiation over the allocation of intellectual property \n     rights developed under a CRADA; and allows federal agencies \n     to permit routine CRADAs to be\n\n[[Page S12937]]\n\n     simply handled by a GOCO lab by eliminating extra steps now \n     required for CRADA with them.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Technology Industries\n\n\n                                    Association of New Mexico,\n\n                                Albuquerque, NM, October 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the board of directors \n     of the Technology Industries Association of New Mexico (TIA), \n     I am sending this letter to express our support of \n     legislation you are introducing, the National Laboratories \n     Partnership Improvement Act of 1999.\n       Members of our organization are well aware of the benefits \n     that already have occurred via the ``technology transfer'' \n     process begun with the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980 and \n     continuing since with various improvements and changes to the \n     original measure. Although most of the member companies in \n     TIA do not engage in direct sales to or contracting with the \n     Federal government or military a number of these companies \n     have benefited due to the technology transfer process.\n       At least one of our TIA members was created as a spin-off \n     of Sandia National Laboratories. Some of the larger \n     multinational companies with divisions in New Mexico have \n     benefited via CRADA arrangements. And some of our other \n     smaller member companies have been greatly aided through the \n     simple but effective mechanism of the technology assistance \n     program run by Sandia.\n       After reviewing draft versions of your proposed \n     legislation, we particularly like two features:\n       The provision that the national laboratories can link with \n     private companies, rather than the other way around. We think \n     this is important, because, as much as private companies can \n     and have been aided via access to the vast R capabilities \n     of the national labs, it is also important that the \n     government institutions learn from private companies those \n     skills necessary to succeed in the intensely competitive \n     international free-market economies.\n       The section which promotes the development of technology \n     clusters in the local economies where national laboratories \n     are located. This strategic approach to economic development \n     is beginning to emerge in central New Mexico with the help of \n     your office and others. We think the development of \n     technology clusters provides a focus for issues and for \n     building vertical infrastructure that often has been lacking \n     in the previous well-meaning, but scattergun approach to \n     economic development.\n       TIA thanks you for your effort and is hopeful the \n     legislation will be enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John P. Jekowski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          City of Albuquerque,\n\n                                Albuquerque, NM, October 13, 1999.\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the citizens of \n     Albuquerque, I want to state my strong support of your \n     proposed legislation, ``The National Laboratories Partnership \n     Improvement Act of 1999.'' For the past 50 years the synergy \n     among our scientific, civic, and educational communities and \n     the Department of Energy's national laboratories has helped \n     to build and enhance our modern city. While we welcome these \n     working partnerships, we recognize that stronger technical \n     relationships between the labs, private businesses, and other \n     nearby institutions are needed to leverage additional \n     resources, both public and private, and promote high tech \n     economic growth at the local, regional, and national levels.\n       Your leadership in the past and your thorough understanding \n     of the complex issues involving tech transfer has deeply \n     benefited Albuquerque's economic diversification, job growth, \n     and stability. This legislation provides an important and \n     timely framework for the future, and we look forward to \n     working with you and your staff in whatever way necessary to \n     implement it. To this end, we would hope that monies \n     generated by the legislation might come directly to the \n     community, and not go to existing or proposed lab tech \n     transfer programs. This will enable our business, \n     institutional and civic leadership to develop the \n     infrastructure required by this well-crafted, thoughtful, and \n     far-reaching proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jim Baca,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1758. A bill to authorize urgent support for Colombia and front \nline states to secure peace and the rule of law, to enhance the \neffectiveness of anti-drug efforts that are essential to impending the \nflow of deadly cocaine and heroin from Colombia to the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the current situation in Colombia is a \nnightmare. Embroiled in a bloody, complex, three decade-long civil war, \nColombia is spiraling toward collapse. Since the early 1990s, more than \n35,000 Colombians have lost their lives at the hands of two well-\nfinanced, heavily-armed guerrilla insurgency groups, along with a \ncompeting band of ruthless paramilitary operatives, hell bent on \ncrushing the group of leftist guerrillas. Sadly, many of those killed \nso far have been innocent civilians caught in the constant cross-fire.\n  The American drug habit is at the core of the Colombian crisis, with \ndrug users and pushers in this country subsidizing the anti-democratic \nleftists. Americans want drugs. The drug traffickers want money. To \nensure their prosperity and to maintain a profitable industry, the \ntraffickers essentially hire the guerrillas and, increasingly, the \nparamilitary groups to protect their livelihoods. Violence and \ninstability reign. Democracy is crumbling.\n  That's why, Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nCoverdell, we are introducing the Anti-Drug Alliance with Colombia and \nthe Andean Region Act of 1999. This comprehensive bill is designed to \npromote peace and stability in Colombia and the Latin American region. \nOur colleague, Senator Grassley also joins us as a co-sponsor. We \nbelieve it is time that our government work in conjunction with the \ngovernment and the people of Colombia to help lessen the growing crisis \nin the region.\n  The problems in Colombia run deep. There are no easy ``overnight'' \nsolutions. If we are to assist in creating and sustaining long-term \nstability in Colombia, we must commit the resources to achieving that \nend. It is in our national interest to support Colombia in its effort \nto thwart further destabilization. Without a strong Colombia, narco-\ntraffickers will flourish, an abundant and steady flow of illicit drugs \nwill head for the United States, one of our largest export markets in \nthe western hemisphere will continue to falter, and a democratic \ngovernment will further erode.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago, I met with Colombian President Pastrana \nduring his visit to Washington. We discussed how our two countries can \nwork together--in cooperation--to eliminate drugs from our hemisphere \nand to begin restoring democracy and the rule of law in Colombia.\n  For more than three decades, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia, otherwise known as the FARC, and the National Liberation Army \n(ELN) have waged the longest-running guerrilla insurgency in Latin \nAmerica. Both rebel groups have a combined strength of between 15,000 \nand 20,000 full-time guerrillas. These armed terrorists control or \ninfluence up to 60% of rural Colombia. At present, the Colombian \nmilitary does not appear to have the strength and resources to counter \nthese menacing forces.\n  Well over a decade ago, the biggest threat to stability from within \nour hemisphere was communism--Soviet and Cuban communists pushing their \nanti-democratic propaganda in Central America. We overcame that threat. \nUnder the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Democracy prevailed. Today, \nin our hemisphere, the communists have been replaced by drug \ntraffickers and the rebels they hire to protect their lucrative \nindustry. These drug traffickers also are financing the roughly 5,000 \narmed paramilitary combatants, whose self-appointed mission is to \ncounter the strength of the leftist guerrillas. If we hope to have any \nimpact at all in eliminating the drugs in our cities, in our schools, \nand in our homes, we need to attack drug trafficking head on--here and \nabroad. This is how we can help both the people of Colombia and the \npeople of our own country.\n\n  With the help of my colleagues, Senators Paul Coverdell, Bob Graham \nand Charles Grassley, last year we passed the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act. This was a much-needed step toward attacking the drug \nproblem at its core. This Act is a $2.7 billion, three-year investment \nto rebuild our drug fighting capability outside our borders. This law \nis about reclaiming the federal government's exclusive responsibility \nto prevent drugs from ever reaching our borders. This law is about \nbuilding a hemisphere free from the violent and decaying influence of \ndrug traffickers. This is a law about stopping drugs before they ever \nreach our kids in Ohio.\n  This bill was necessary because the Clinton Administration, since \ncoming\n\n[[Page S12938]]\n\ninto office, has slashed funding levels for international counter-\nnarcotics efforts. By turning its back for the better part of this \ndecade on the fight against drugs abroad, this Administration has \ncontributed inadvertently to the growing strength of drug trafficking \norganizations, as well as the narco-terrorists in the region.\n  If one principle has guided American foreign policy consistently \nsince the dawn of our nation, it is this: The peace and stability of \nour own hemisphere must come first. That certainly has been the case \nthroughout the last century. The Spanish-American War, the Cuban \nMissile Crisis, the democratization of Central America in the 1980s, \nand the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s--all of these \nkey events were approached with the same premise: A strong, free, and \nprosperous hemisphere means a strong, free, and prosperous United \nStates.\n  Consistent with that principle, the United States must take an active \nrole in seeking a peaceful, democratic Colombia. That is why Senator \nCoverdell, who just came back from Colombia, and I have developed a \ncomprehensive assistance plan for Colombia. The Alliance Act of 1999 \nwould authorize $1.6 billion over three years to support: 1. \nAlternative crop and economic development; 2. Drug interdiction \nprograms; 3. Human rights and rule of law programs; and 4. Military and \npolice counter-narcotics operations. Our plan also contains provisions \nfor counter-narcotics assistance and crop alternative development \nprograms for other Latin American countries, including Brazil, Bolivia, \nPeru, Panama, Venezuela, and Ecuador.\n  Our plan not only provides the means to eradicate and interdict \nillicit drugs, but it also provides the training and resources to \nstrengthen both the civilian and military justice systems to preserve \nthe rule of law and democracy in Colombia. A hemispheric commitment to \nthe rule of law is essential. When I visited with Americans living in \nColombia during a trip to the region last year, judicial reform was a \ncentral focus of our discussion on ways our nation can better assist \nColombia. With our plan, our government would take a leadership role in \npromoting a strong judiciary and rule of law in Colombia by providing \nour own technical expertise.\n  Our plan promotes the sanctity of human rights and provides \nhumanitarian assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people who have \nbeen displaced due to the violence and instability.\n  We not only focus on the economy of Colombia, but also on the \nstability of the region, as a whole. We provide support for the front-\nline states and call on them and the international community to assist \nand support the Government of Colombia. This is a cooperative effort to \nhelp Colombia begin to help itself.\n  Our plan would monitor the assistance to the Colombian security \nforces, so we can be sure that this assistance is used effectively for \nits intended purpose and does not fall into the hands of those who \nengage in gross violations of human rights and drug trafficking.\n  We urge the Colombian government to take a tough stance against the \noften over-looked paramilitaries. They are a growing part of the \nproblem in Colombia and should not be ignored.\n  Our plan is comprehensive. Our plan is balanced. It demonstrates our \ncommitment to assisting the Government of Colombia and our interest in \nworking together to bring peace and security to the hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, this is not an ``America Knows Best'' plan. We \nconsulted with those who are on the front-lines in Colombia--those who \nknow best what Colombia needs right now. We have talked with the \nColombian government, including President Pastrana, to inquire about \nColombia's specific needs. We also have consulted with U.S. government \nofficials, who have confirmed our belief that a plan for Colombia must \nbe balanced if we hope to address the complex and dangerous elements of \nthe current situation.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, it is my hope that the Administration will \npro-actively work with Congress--and most importantly, Colombia--to \nturn the tide against those seeking to undermine democracy in the \nregion. We must act now--too much is at risk to wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1758\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to prescribe proactive measures to confront the threat \n     to United States interests of continued instability in \n     Colombia;\n       (2) to defend constitutional order, the rule of law, and \n     human rights, which will benefit all persons;\n       (3) to support the democratically elected Government of the \n     Republic of Colombia to secure a firm and lasting end to the \n     armed conflict and lawlessness within its territory, which \n     now costs countless lives, threatens regional security, and \n     undermines effective anti-drug efforts;\n       (4) to require the President to design and implement an \n     urgent, comprehensive, and adequately funded plan of support \n     for Colombia and its neighbors;\n       (5) to authorize adequate funds to implement an urgent and \n     comprehensive plan of economic development and anti-drug \n     support for Colombia and the front line states;\n       (6) to authorize indispensable material, technical, and \n     logistical support to enhance the effectiveness of anti-drug \n     efforts that are essential to impeding the flow of deadly \n     cocaine and heroin from Colombia to the United States; and\n\n[[Page S12939]]\n\n       (7) to bolster the capacity of the front line states to \n     confront the current destabilizing effects of the Colombia \n     conflict and to resist illicit narcotics trafficking \n     activities that may seek to elude enhanced law enforcement \n     efforts in Colombia.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The armed conflict and resulting lawlessness in \n     Colombia present a clear and present danger to the security \n     of the front line states, to law enforcement efforts intended \n     to impede the flow of cocaine and heroin, and, therefore, to \n     the well-being of the people of the United States.\n       (2) Colombia is a democratic country fighting multiple \n     wars, against the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), paramilitary \n     organizations, and international narcotics trafficking \n     kingpins.\n       (3) With 34 percent of world terrorist acts committed \n     there, Colombia is the world's third most dangerous country \n     in terms of political violence.\n       (4) Colombia is the world's kidnapping capital of the world \n     with 2,609 kidnappings reported in 1998 and 513 reported in \n     the first three months of 1999.\n       (5) In 1998 alone, 308,000 Colombians were internally \n     displaced in Colombia. During the last decade, 35,000 \n     Colombians have been killed.\n       (6) The FARC and the ELN are the two main guerrilla groups \n     that have waged the longest-running anti-government \n     insurgency in Latin America.\n       (7) The FARC and the ELN engage in systematic extortion \n     through the abduction of United States citizens, have \n     murdered United States citizens, profit from the illegal drug \n     trade, and engage in systematic and indiscriminate crimes, \n     including kidnapping, torture, and murder, against Colombian \n     civilian and security forces.\n       (8) The FARC and the ELN have targeted United States \n     Government personnel, private United States citizens, and \n     United States business interests.\n       (9) In March 1999, the FARC murdered three kidnapped United \n     States human rights workers near the international border \n     between Colombia and Venezuela.\n       (10) The Colombian rebels are estimated to have a combined \n     strength of 10,000 to 20,000 full-time guerrillas, and they \n     have initiated armed action in nearly 700 of the country's \n     1,073 municipalities and control or influence roughly 60 \n     percent of rural Colombia.\n       (11) The Government of Colombia has recovered 5,000 new AK-\n     47s from guerrilla caches in 1 month, and the FARC has \n     plotted to use $3,000,000 in funds earned from drug \n     trafficking to buy 30,000 AK-47s.\n       (12) Although the Colombian Army has 122,000 soldiers, \n     there are no more than 40,000 soldiers available for \n     offensive combat operations.\n       (13) Colombia faces the threat of an estimated 5,000 armed \n     persons who comprise paramilitary organizations, who engage \n     in lawless acts and undermine the peace process.\n       (14) Paramilitary organizations profit from the illegal \n     drug trade and engage in systematic and indiscriminate \n     crimes, including extortion, kidnapping, torture, and murder, \n     against Colombian civilians.\n       (15) The conflict in Colombia is creating instability along \n     its borders with neighboring countries, Ecuador, Panama, \n     Peru, and Venezuela, several of which have deployed forces to \n     their border with Colombia.\n       (16) Coca production has increased 28 percent in Colombia \n     since 1998, and already 75 percent of the world's cocaine and \n     75 percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United \n     States is of Colombian origin.\n       (17) The first 900-soldier Counternarcotics Battalion has \n     been established within the Colombian Army with training and \n     logistical support of the United States military and the \n     Department of State international narcotics and law \n     enforcement program, and it will be ready for deployment in \n     areas of new illicit coca cultivation in southern Colombia by \n     November 1999.\n       (18) In response to serious human rights abuse allegations \n     by the Colombian military, the Government of Colombia has \n     dismissed alleged abusers and undertaken military reforms, \n     and, while the Colombian military was implicated in 50 \n     percent of human rights violations in 1995, by 1998, the \n     number of incidents attributed to the military plummeted to \n     4-6 percent.\n       (19) The Government of Colombia has convicted 240 members \n     of the military and police accused of human rights \n     violations.\n       (20) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and \n     Colombia was more than $11,000,000,000, making the United \n     States Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the \n     fifth largest market for United States exports in the region.\n       (21) Colombia is experiencing a historic economic \n     recession, with unemployment rising to approximately 20 \n     percent in 1999 after 40 years of annual economic growth \n     averaging 5 percent per year.\n       (22) The Colombian judicial system is inefficient and \n     ineffective in bringing to justice those who violate the rule \n     of law.\n       (23) The FARC continue to press for an exchange of detained \n     rebels, which, if granted, will enable the FARC to increase \n     its manpower in the short term by as many as 4,000 \n     combatants.\n       (24) The Drug Enforcement Administration has reported that \n     the Colombian irregular forces are involved in drug \n     trafficking and that certain irregular forces leaders have \n     become major drug traffickers.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING SUPPORT FOR \n                   DEMOCRACY, PEACE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN \n                   RIGHTS IN COLOMBIA.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to support the democratically elected Government of the \n     Republic of Colombia in its efforts to secure a firm and \n     lasting end to the armed conflict and lawlessness within its \n     territory, which now costs countless lives, threatens \n     regional security, and undermines effective anti-drug \n     efforts;\n       (2) to insist that the Government of Colombia complete \n     urgent reform measures intended to open its economy fully to \n     foreign investment and commerce, particularly in the \n     petroleum industry, as a path toward economic recovery and \n     self-sufficiency;\n       (3) to promote the protection of human rights in Colombia \n     by conditioning assistance to security forces on respect for \n     all internationally recognized human rights;\n       (4) to support Colombian authorities in strengthening \n     judicial systems and investigative capabilities to bring to \n     justice any person against whom there exists credible \n     evidence of gross violations of human rights;\n       (5) to expose the lawlessness and gross human rights \n     violations committed by irregular forces in Colombia; and\n       (6) to mobilize international support for the \n     democratically elected Government of the Republic of Colombia \n     so that that government can resist making unilateral \n     concessions that undermine the credibility of the peace \n     process.\n\n     SEC. 102.

LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Ineligibility of Units of Security Forces for \n     Assistance.--The same restrictions contained in section 568 \n     of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in section \n     101(d) of division A of Public Law 105-277) and section 8130 \n     of Public Law 105-262 that apply to the availability of funds \n     under those Acts shall apply to the availability of funds \n     under this Act.\n       (b) Additional Restrictions..--In addition to the \n     application of the restrictions described in subsection (a), \n     those restrictions shall apply with respect to the \n     availability of funds for a unit of the security forces of \n     Colombia if the Secretary of State reports to Congress that \n     credible evidence exists that a member of that unit has \n     provided material support to irregular forces in Colombia or \n     to any criminal narcotics trafficking syndicate that operates \n     in Colombia.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \ntremendous economic contributions made by women business owners in \nIllinois and to recognize the work of the Women's Business Development \nCenter, a woman's business training and technical assistance center \nthat has assisted over 30,000 women in realizing their dreams of \nbusiness ownership.\n  The newest statistics from the National Foundation for Women's \nBusiness Ownership confirm that women entrepreneurs now make up more \nthan 38 percent of all business and continue to be the most dynamic, \nfastest growing sector of our Nation's economy. I am proud to tell you \nthat there are now 384,700 women-owned businesses in Illinois, \nemploying 1.5 million workers and generating $195 billion in annual \nsales, a growth of 139 percent in 7 years.\n  Women business owners in Illinois area vibrant sector of our State \neconomy and strong advocates for women's business ownership nationwide. \nRecently one of Illinois's own, Sheila G. Talton, president and CEO of \nUnisource Network Services, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, was \nappointed to serve on the National Women's Business Council. Unisource \nNetwork Services provides network interrogation consulting, including \nvoice, data and multimedia consulting. Ms. Talton, who has 20 years of \nexperience in the information systems and telecommunications field, \nformed the company in 1986 and sales are projected at $17 million this \nfiscal year. The company services an elite class of Fortune 500 \ncompanies, major educational and health care institutions and public \nagencies.\n  Unisource Network Services exemplifies the type of high-growth \nbusiness that is attractive to investors in Illinois and around the \ncountry. In fact, Ms. Talton financed the growth of her technology \ncompany with venture capital investments. Unfortunately her story is \nusual; I'm told that most women entrepreneurs are having difficulties \nraising the capital they need to take their technology-based companies \nto the next level. Though women are starting high-growth business at \nunprecedented rates, they currently access less than 5 percent of all \nventure capital investments.\n  Mr. President, the strength of the economy of Illinois and the Nation \ndepends upon the success of enterprises like Unisource. The \nopportunities to launch and grow businesses and the demand for training \nand capital have never been greater. In order for these new businesses \nto flourish, we must ensure that their access to capital and markets is \nunimpeded and that they have information and resources they need to \ncompete at the speed of the Internet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12945-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12945-S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today in recognition of \n``National Women's Business Week'' and of the vital role women \nbusiness-owners play in our economy.\n  I would also like to recognize the appointment of Vivian L. Shimoyama \nto the National Women's Business Council. Ms. Shimoyama is the Founder \nand President of Breakthru Unlimited, a California company that designs \nand manufactures projects with a message: hand-made glass artwork of \njewelry, executive gifts, limited editions, and custom awards. A \nbrilliant sample of her work is her ``Breaking the Ceiling'' line of \njewelry that has adorned the lapels of Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth \nDole. Currently, she serves as the Chair of the National Association of \nWomen Business Owners--Los Angeles. In 1999, she was honored as the \nSmall Business Administration's ``Women Business Advocate of the \nYear''.\n  Ms. Shimoyama runs one of the 1.2 million women-owned businesses \nheadquartered in California. According to a study by the National \nFoundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO), these businesses employ \n3.8 million workers and generate $548 billion in annual sales, a growth \nof 164 percent in seven years.\n  Without a doubt, women entrepreneurs have played a crucial part in \nthe growth of our economy. NFWBO reports that between 1987 and 1999, \nthe number of women-owned firms increased by 103 percent nationwide, \nemployment increased by 320 percent, and sales increased by 436 \npercent. As of 1999, there are 9.1 million women-owned businesses in \nthe U.S., which employ 27.5 million people and generate over $3.6 \ntrillion in sales. To put the sales of these businesses into context, \nthey are twice the size of the Federal budget, and greater than the \nGross National Product of every country in the world but the United \nStates and Japan.\n  An increasing number of these businesses have focused on emerging \nindustries such as high technology. These businesses demand a greater \naccess to capital and information resources than ever before.\n\n[[Page S12946]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will do all I can to ensure that the women in my \nstate and all over the country have access to the opportunities and \nresources they need to start new business ventures. However it is also \nimperative that we invest in the business development resources that \nwill help women sustain and grow these new businesses. This small \ninvestment yields big returns in the form of job creation, revenues, \nand overall growth of the nation's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12946-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MEDICARE BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO QUALITY NURSING HOME CARE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on the 13th of October, I was \nproud to cosponsor S. 1500, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality \nNursing Home Care Act of 1999. When Congress worked with the President \nto craft and pass the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, it included a number \nof desperately needed cost-saving measures to ensure that Medicare did \nnot go bankrupt. At the time, Medicare was projected to be bankrupt by \n2001 with annual costs rising at three times the rate of inflation.\n  However, the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the \nadministration of Medicare, has far exceeded the scope of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, and gone beyond the intent of Congress in scaling \nback health care provider reimbursements. Driven by a philosophy that \nthe Federal Government knows best how to handle your health care \ndecisions, this administration has uniformly adopted policies that \nlimit Medicare beneficiary choice, obstruct critically needed market-\nbased reforms, and relentlessly pursued a strategy of reducing payments \nto providers as the prime method to reduce outlays.\n  Sometimes such a ``Washington-knows-best'' strategy just doesn't \nwork. The fact of the matter is, health care providers will bear costs \nthat cannot be overlooked or undervalued simply because HCFA wishes to \ndeclare it so. This has been especially prevalent in the area of \nSkilled Nursing Facility care. The recently implemented Prospective \nPayment System (PPS) fails to account for the full range of services \nrequired by most Medicare beneficiaries provided care in these \nfacilities.\n  Specifically, the PPS implemented by HCFA has a payment schedule \ncalled Resource Utilization Groups (RUGs) that are intended to account \nfor the needs of individual beneficiaries. However, these RUGs have \nfailed to account for the full range of needs of these beneficiaries, \nespecially for the medically complex patient. While private market \ninsurance is significantly better at recognizing the needs of the \nmedically complex patient, the failure of this administration to allow \nfor any type of market-based reform to move forward has forced us to \nrely upon the implementation of the PPS by HCFA, which, as I discussed \nbefore, seems to have a predisposition towards underpaying for \nnecessary services.\n  The result, Mr. President, is that beneficiaries are increasingly \ndenied access to lower-cost Skilled Nursing Facilities and are forced \nto continue care in higher-cost hospitals where they also may not be \nable to get the most appropriate level of rehabilitative care. S. 1500, \nintroduced by Senator Hatch, attempts to address the over-reaching of \nHCFA directly and swiftly. First, it would provide for payment ``add-\nons'' for the provision of additional treatment in the care of the \nmedically complex patient. Second, it restores one percentage point of \nthe reductions to the annual inflation adjustor mandated by BBA-97. \nAlthough the inflation adjustment reduction was directly written in the \nBBA-97 language, it's revision provides Congress the most direct and \nsimplest way to counteract the excesses of HCFA.\n  Mr. President, I am heartened that HCFA has recognized the flaws in \nthe current PPS system and is undertaking a review of this system. \nHowever, that review will not be completed until next year. Our Skilled \nNursing Facilities need these restorations now in order to continue to \nprovide our Medicare beneficiaries continued and uninterrupted care. \nThat is why I fully support this legislation, am cosponsoring it, and \ncall on my colleagues to do the same as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12946-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THIRD ANNUAL CAUCUS FOR POTOMAC HERITAGE NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL\n\n Mr. ROBB.

STRAIN\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize the \n55th anniversary of Electro Scientific Industries, Incorporated, ESI, \nand to honor the accomplishments of Mr. Douglas C. Strain, ESI's \nfounder and first president and chairman of ESI's board.\n  Established in Portland in 1944, ESI was among the first high-\ntechnology companies in Oregon. Since that time, ESI has grown into a \nglobal leader in the manufacturer of precision laser trimmers and \nmemory repair equipment, as well as a worldwide supplier of electronic \nproduction equipment. From humble beginnings, ESI has become a $200 \nmillion company, employing more than 900 individuals in Oregon and \naround the world, and helping to establish Oregon as one of this \ncountry's high-tech capitals.\n  Accomplishments such as these are often born of tough challenges. \nHaving overcome a devastating fire in the 1950's, ESI had to rebuild \nitself from the ground up, and has had to re-invent itself on a number \nof occasions since that time. The company has proven itself adept at \nadapting to the fast-pace that characterizes the high-technology \nsector. From test and calibration equipment, electron microscopy, and \nanalog computing to laser trimming, memory repair and vision, handling, \npackaging, and drilling technologies, ESI products have always been at \nthe leading edge of technology developments.\n  I especially pay tribute to a remarkable Oregonian, Electro \nScientific's founder, Mr. Douglas C. Strain. On October 24, Doug will \ncelebrate both his 80th birthday and his retirement from ESI's board of \ndirectors. Mr. Strain's vision and perseverance have brought the \ncompany successfully to the end of this century, and I believe that ESI \nwill continue on with equal success well into the next century. I \ncongratulate Doug on his accomplishments and wish him the very best as \nhe undertakes new challenges in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12946-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12946-S12947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN PRAISE OF METS OUTFIELDER BENNY AGBAYANI\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the boys of summer rarely disappoint \nus, and last night's final game of the National League playoffs once \nagain confirmed that baseball is truly America's pastime. The series \ncaptivated television audiences as the Mets and Braves went head to \nhead in extra innings in their last two games: Sunday's game was the \nlongest in playoff history--lasting more than five hours, and last \nnight's game was not decided until the bottom of the 11th--just past \nmidnight.\n  I want to single out Hawaii's own, Benny Agbayani, the star New York \noutfielder, who proudly wears number 50 for the 50th state. Benny had \nan illustrious playoff season and proved he is an invaluable addition \nto the Mets starting lineup. After playing in Triple A since 1993, the \nHawaii outfielder was called up by the Mets in early May to replace the \ninjured Bobby Bonilla. He secured his slot by batting .400 and hitting \n10 home runs by mid-June. The former St. Louis School and Hawaii\n\n[[Page S12947]]\n\nPacific University all-state athlete has made Hawaii proud and has \ncaptured the nation's attention with his strength at bat, agility on \nthe field, and grace in waiting for his place in baseball history.\n  My aloha to Benny, his recent bride Niela, and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/20/senate-section/article/S12947-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHANGE OF CONFEREE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
