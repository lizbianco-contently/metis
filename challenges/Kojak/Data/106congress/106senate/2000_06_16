Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to vote on the conference report accompanying S. 761, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The conference report on S. 761, an act to regulate \n     interstate commerce by electronic means by permitting and \n     encouraging the continued expansion of electronic commerce \n     through the operation of free market forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham, Senator McCain, \nand Chairman Bliley for their hard work in the conference on the \ndigital signatures bill, which grants online contracts and other \ntransactions the same legal force as those conducted with pen-and-ink. \nI should add that Senator Leahy and Senator Wyden made significant \npositive contributions to the bill. I am an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation and I am very pleased with the conference report before the \nSenate today.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor \nof the conference report by a vote of 426-4. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report, which is a bipartisan product that will \nallow businesses to\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\ntake advantage of the speed and efficiency of the Internet while also \nprotecting consumers. I have no doubt that the passage of this \nlegislation will help to make sure that electronic commerce can meet \nits full potential.\n  The issue of online authentication is one of the most important \nissues to the development of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce \nholds great promise, in particular, for states like my home state of \nMontana, where businesses and consumers have to deal with vast \ndistances. E-commerce is expected to continue its upward surge to about \n$1.6 trillion by 2003, up from $500 billion last year. The explosion of \ninformation technology has created opportunities undreamed of by \nprevious generations. In Montana, companies such as Healthdirectory.com \nand Vanns.com are taking advantage of the global markets made possible \nby the stunning reach of the Internet.\n  This bill allows for consumers to enter into binding contracts over \nthe Internet and eliminates the need to engage in needless, burdensome \nexchanges of paper documents. This bill will create a uniform system \nwhere contracts have the same validity across all 50 states.\n  The bill is also technology-neutral and does not impose government \nmandates on what formats or software businesses or consumers choose to \nuse to conduct online commerce.\n  Numerous consumer safeguards are included in the conference report, \nincluding the requirement that consumers confirm that they are able to \nread the format that companies use for online contracts. Also, \nsafeguards are contained in the bill that will still require that \ncritical notices such as insurance cancellation and mortgage \nforeclosure notices be sent on paper. Furthermore, consumers still have \nthe right to receive any documents on paper if they so choose.\n  The passage of the digital signatures bill is a critical step in \nensuring the continued growth of the Internet-driven economy. This \nlegislation grants additional choice and convenience to consumers and \nwill also translate into more efficient products and services.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the work of Senator Abraham \nand Senator McCain, Chairman Bliley in the other body, Senator Leahy, \nand Senator Wyden who had quite a lot to do with this. Of course, it \ncame out of the Subcommittee on Communications. This is just one more \nof the digital dozen we set our goals to pass during this Congress.\n  So far, we are up around the eighth or ninth bill out of that digital \ndozen that will probably lend greater credence to the Internet and the \nway we use it as a tool in business and in our personal lives. I thank \nthose Senators who were instrumental in passing this legislation. I \ncongratulate them and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      consumer consent provisions\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Michigan, who is the original sponsor of the electronic \nsignatures legislation, to discuss the consumer consent provisions in \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I welcome the chance to participate in a \ncolloquy about the consent provisions in the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it the Senator's understanding that pursuant to \nsubsection 101(c)(1)(C)(ii) of the conference report a consumer's \naffirmative consent to the receipt of electronic records needs to \n``reasonably demonstrate'' that the consumer will be able to access the \nvarious forms of electronic records to which the consent applies?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. The conference report requires a ``reasonable \ndemonstration'' that the consumer will be able to access the electronic \nrecords to which the consent applies. By means of this provision, the \nconferees sought to provide consumers with a simple and efficient \nmechanism to substantiate their ability to access the electronic \ninformation that will be provided to them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree. The conferees did not intend that the \n``reasonable demonstration'' requirement would burden either consumers \nor the person providing the electronic record. In fact, the conferees \nexpect that a ``reasonable demonstration'' could be satisfied in many \nways. Does the Senator agree with me that the conferees intend that the \nreasonable demonstration requirement is satisfied if the consumer \nconfirmed in an e-mail response to the provider of the electronic \nrecords that he or she can access information in the specified formats?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. An e-mail response from a consumer that confirmed \nthat the consumer can access electronic records in the specified \nformats would satisfy the ``reasonable demonstration'' requirement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator also agree with me that the ``reasonable \ndemonstration'' requirement would be satisfied, for instance, if the \nconsumer responds affirmatively to an electronic query asking if he or \nshe can access the electronic information or if the affirmative consent \nlanguage includes the consumer's acknowledgement that he or she can \naccess the electronic information in the designated format?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. A consumer's acknowledgment or affirmative response \nto such a query would satisfy the ``reasonable demonstration'' \nrequirement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the ``reasonable demonstration requirement'' be \nsatisfied if it is shown that the consumer actually accesses records in \nthe relevant electronic format?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. The requirement is satisfied if it is shown that \nthe consumer actually accesses electronic records in the relevant \nformat.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's willingness to \nparticipate in this colloquy to clarify the clear intent of the \nconference with respect to this provision.\n\n\n                           legislative scope\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe gentleman from Michigan, Senator Abraham, who is the original \nsponsor of the legislation on electronic signatures, to discuss the \nscope of the legislation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would welcome the chance to participate \nin a colloquy about the scope of the electronic signature legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Michigan that \nthe act is not intended to restrict the scope or availability of any \nother federal statute, regulation and other rule of law (whether \ncurrently in effect or becoming effective in the future) that requires, \nauthorizes or otherwise allows for the use of electronic signatures or \nelectronic records, to the extent such federal statute, regulation, or \nother rule of law is consistent with the provisions of the act? Any \nsuch other statute, regulation or other rule of law will continue to be \nfully and independently effective. Rather, this act is intended to \noperate as a uniform national baseline permitting electronic signatures \nand electronic records to be used with respect to certain activities \nnotwithstanding other inconsistent statutes, regulations or other rules \nof law. Am I correct in my statement regarding the intent of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, the Senator, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nis correct. This act is intended to facilitate e-commerce and to \nprovide legal certainty for electronic signatures, contracts and \nrecords where such certainty does not exist today. It is not in any way \nintended to limit the effectiveness of any other statute, regulation or \nother rule of law which permits the use of electronic records, \nelectronic delivery, and electronic signatures, and which is otherwise \nconsistent with the provisions of the act.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As to its coverage, does the Senator agree that this act \nis intended to operate very broadly to permit the use of electronic \nsignatures and electronic records in all business, consumer and \ncommercial contexts? This breadth is accomplished through the use of \nthe term ``transaction,'' which is defined broadly to include any \naction or set of actions relating to the conduct of business, consumer \nor commercial affairs between two or more persons. For example, a \nunilateral action or set of actions by one of the parties to the \nunderlying transaction, or by any other person with any interest in the \nunderlying transaction, or a response by one party to the other's \naction, all are covered by the act. In this regard, it is the nature of \nthe activity, rather than the number of persons or the identity or \nstatus of the person or entity involved in the activity, that \ndetermines the applicability of the act. Have I stated the matter \ncorrectly?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, this act applies to all actions or sets of actions \nrelated\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\nto the underlying business, consumer, or commercial relationship which \nis based on the nature of the activity and not the number of persons \ninvolved in the activity. The act is also intended to cover the related \nactivities of those persons or entities who are counterparties to, or \notherwise involved in or related to, the covered activity.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is my understanding that this act, for example, covers \nany activity that would qualify as a financial activity, an activity \nincidental to a financial activity, or a complementary activity, under \nsection 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, \nwhether or not such activity is conducted by, or subject to any \nlimitations or requirements applicable to, a financial holding company.\n  In addition, it would cover all activities relating to employee \nbenefit plans or any other type of tax-favored plan, annuity or account \nsuch as an IRA, a 403(b) annuity, or an education savings program, \nincluding all related tax and other required filings and reports. Is \nthis correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, and as a result, the act would apply to such \nactivities as the execution of a prototype plan adoption agreement by \nan employer, the execution of an IRA application by an individual, and \nthe waiver of a qualified joint and survivor annuity by a plan \nparticipant's spouse and the designation of any beneficiary in \nconnection with any retirement, pension, or deferred compensation plan, \nIRA, qualified State tuition program, insurance or annuity contract, or \nagreement to transfer ownership upon the death of a party to a \ntransaction.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's willingness to \nparticipate in this colloquy to clarify the clear intent of the \nconference with respect to the scope of this act.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, because the differences between the House \nand Senate passed bills required much careful contemplation on the part \nof the Conferees that may not be apparent in the final text of the \nConference Report, and because the Conference did not produce an \nofficial interpretive statement regarding the Conference Report, as the \nprimary author of S. 761, I have prepared an explanatory document that \nshould serve as a guide to the intent behind the following provisions \nof S. 761.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nexplanation of S. 761 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF S. 761, THE ``ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE IN GLOBAL \n                      AND NATIONAL COMMERCE ACT''\n\n\n                              Short Title\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 1 establishes the short title of the bill as the \n     ``Millennium Digital Commerce Act.''\n     House amendment\n       Section 1 establishes the short title of the bill as the \n     ``Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act.''\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts the House provision.\n\n             Electronic Records and Signatures in Commerce\n\n\n                        GENERAL RULE OF VALIDITY\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 5(a) of the Senate bill sets forth the general \n     rules that apply to electronic commercial transactions \n     affecting interstate commerce. This section provides that in \n     any commercial transaction affecting interstate commerce a \n     contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability \n     solely because an electronic signature or record was used in \n     its formation.\n       Section 5(b) authorizes parties to a contract to adopt or \n     otherwise agree on the terms and conditions on which they \n     will use and accept electronic signatures and electronic \n     records in commercial transactions affecting interstate \n     commerce.\n     House amendment\n       Section 101(a) of the House amendment establishes a general \n     rule that, with respect to any contract or agreement \n     affecting interstate commerce, notwithstanding any statute, \n     regulation or other rule of law, the legal effect, validity, \n     and enforceability of such contract or agreement shall not be \n     denied on the ground that: (1) the contract or agreement is \n     not in writing if the contract or agreement is an electronic \n     record; and (2) the contract or agreement is not signed or \n     affirmed by written signature if the contract or agreement is \n     signed or affirmed by an electronic signature.\n       Section 101(b) provides that with respect to contracts or \n     agreements affecting interstate commerce, the parties to such \n     contracts or agreements may establish procedures or \n     requirements regarding the use and acceptance of electronic \n     records and electronic signatures acceptable to such parties. \n     Further, the legal effect, validity, or enforceability for \n     such contracts or agreements shall not be denied because of \n     the type or method of electronic record or electronic \n     signature selected by the parties.\n       Nothing in section 101(b) requires a party to enter into \n     any contract or agreement utilizing electronic signatures or \n     electronic records. Rather, it gives the parties the option \n     to enter freely into online contracts and agreements.\n     Conference Substitute\n       The House recedes to the Senate with an amendment.\n       The general rule provides that notwithstanding any statute, \n     regulation, or other rule of law (other than titles one and \n     two) with respect to any transaction in or affecting \n     interstate or foreign commerce: (1) a signature, contract, or \n     other record relating to such transaction may not be denied \n     legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it \n     is in electronic form, and (2) a contract relating to such \n     transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or \n     enforceability solely because an electronic signature or \n     electronic record was used in its formation.\n       Section 101(a) establishes a basic federal rule of non-\n     discrimination with respect to the use of electronic \n     signatures and electronic records, including electronic \n     contracts. Subject to the Act's consumer consent requirement \n     (Sec. 101(c)) and specific exceptions (Sec. 103), this \n     federal rule of non-discrimination means that a State \n     generally cannot refuse to allow parties to use electronic \n     signatures and electronic records in lieu of paper records \n     and handwritten signatures. This federal rule also means that \n     if two parties agree with one another, electronically or \n     otherwise, on the terms and conditions on which they will \n     accept and use electronic signatures and electronic records \n     in their dealings with one another and the parties could have \n     entered into a comparable agreement regarding the use of \n     signatures and records in the paper world, the State cannot \n     refuse to give effect to the parties' agreement.\n       The term ``solely'' in section 101(a)(1) and 101(a)(2) is \n     intended to prevent challenges to the legal effect, validity, \n     or enforceability of an electronic signature, contract, or \n     other record that are based on objections to the \n     ``electronic'' quality of such signature, contract, or other \n     record. In addition, Section 101 should not be interpreted to \n     permit a challenge based on the combination of a signature, \n     contract, or other record being in electronic form (Section \n     101(a)(1)) and having an electronic signature or electronic \n     record used in its formation (Section 101(a)(2); in this \n     sense, solely truly means ``solely or in part''.\n       The conferees agreed to strike title III of the House bill \n     (HR 1714) with respect to electronic records, signatures or \n     agreements covered under the federal securities laws because \n     the title I provisions of the conference agreement are \n     intended to encompass the House title III provisions. The \n     reference in section 101(a) of the conference agreement to \n     ``any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce'' is intended to include electronic records, \n     signatures and agreements governed by the Securities Exchange \n     Act of 1934 and all electronic records, signatures and \n     agreements used in financial planning, income tax \n     preparation, and investments. Therefore, the conference \n     agreement did not need to single out or treat differently \n     electronic records, signatures and agreements regulated by \n     federal securities laws in a separate title.\n       In section 101(b), the conference report makes clear that \n     title I of the conference substitute does not (1) limit, \n     alter, or otherwise affect any requirements imposed by a \n     statute, regulation, or rule of law relating to the rights \n     and obligations of persons under such statute, regulation, or \n     rule of law other than requirements that contracts or other \n     records be written, signed, or in non-electronic form; or (2) \n     require any person, with respect to a record other than a \n     contract, to agree to use or accept electronic records or \n     electronic signatures.\n       Section 101(c) specifies consumer protections in e-\n     commerce. If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law \n     requires that a record relating to a transaction in or \n     affecting interstate or foreign commerce be provided or made \n     available to a consumer in writing, an electronic record \n     may be substituted if (1) the consumer affirmatively \n     consents to receive an electronic record and has not \n     withdrawn such consent, (2) the consumer, prior to \n     consenting, is provided with a clear and conspicuous \n     statement informing the consumer of rights or options to \n     have the record provided or made available on paper, and \n     the right of the consumer to withdraw the consent to \n     electronic records and of any conditions, consequences \n     (which may include termination of the parties' \n     relationships), or fees in the event of withdrawal of \n     consent. Further, the consumer is informed of whether the \n     consent applies only to the initial transaction or to \n     identified categories of records that follow the initial \n     transaction. Disclosure must also be made describing the \n     procedures the consumer must use to withdraw consent and \n     to update information needed to contact the consumer \n     electronically. The consumer must also be informed\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\n     of how after the consent, the consumer may, upon request, \n     obtain a paper copy of electronic records, and whether any \n     fee will be charged for such copy.\n       Section 101(c) honors the provisions of underlying law \n     (except as to the specifics of writing and consent \n     requirements); the Act does not create new requirements for \n     electronic commerce but simply allows disclosures or other \n     items to be delivered electronically instead of on paper. \n     This means that if a consumer protection statute requires \n     delivery of a paper copy of a disclosure or item to a \n     consumer, then the consent and disclosure requirements of \n     subsection (c)(1)(A-D) must be satisfied. Otherwise, \n     subsection (c) does not disturb existing law.\n       Section 101(c)(1) refers to writings that are required to \n     be delivered to consumers by some other law, such as the \n     Truth-in-Lending Act. The reference to consumers is \n     intentional: subsection (c) only applies to laws that are \n     specifically intended for the protection of consumers. When a \n     statute applies to consumers as well as to non-consumers, \n     subsection (c)(1) should not apply. In this way, the \n     subsection preserves those special consumer protection \n     statutes enacted throughout this Nation without creating \n     artificial constructs that do not exist under current law. At \n     no time in the future should these ``consent'' provisions of \n     101(c), which are intended to protect consumers (as defined \n     in this legislation), be permitted to migrate through \n     interpretation so as to apply to business-to-business \n     transactions.\n       Pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(C)(i), the consumer must be \n     provided, prior to consenting, with a clear and conspicuous \n     statement describing the hardware and software requirements \n     to access and retain electronic records.\n       Subsection (c)(1)(C)(ii) requires that the consumer's \n     consent be electronic or that it be confirmed electronically, \n     in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the consumer \n     will be able to access the various forms of electronic \n     records to which the consent applies. The requirement of a \n     reasonable demonstration is not intended to be burdensome on \n     consumers or the person providing the electronic record, and \n     could be accomplished in many ways. For example, the \n     `reasonable demonstration' requirement is satisfied if the \n     provider of the electronic records sent the consumer an e-\n     mail with attachments in the formats to be used in providing \n     the records, asked the consumer to open the attachments in \n     order to confirm that he could access the documents, and \n     requested the consumer to indicate in an e-mailed response to \n     the provider of the electronic records that he or she can \n     access information in the attachments. Similarly, the \n     `reasonable demonstration' requirement is satisfied if it is \n     shown that in response to such an e-mail the consumer \n     actually accesses records in the relevant electronic \n     format. The purpose of the reasonable demonstration \n     provision is to provide consumers with a simple and \n     efficient mechanism to substantiate their ability to \n     access the electronic information that will be provided to \n     them.\n       Subsection (c)(1)(D) requires that after the consent of a \n     consumer, if a change in the hardware or software \n     requirements needed to access or retain electronic records \n     creates a material risk that the consumer will not be able to \n     access or retain a subsequent electronic record that was the \n     subject of the consent, the person providing the electronic \n     record must provide the consumer with a statement of the \n     revised hardware and software requirements for access to and \n     retention of the electronic records, and the right to \n     withdraw consent without the imposition of any fees for such \n     withdrawal, and the right to withdraw without the imposition \n     of any condition or consequence that was not disclosed.\n       Subsection (c)(2) includes a savings clause making clear \n     that nothing in this title affects the content or timing of \n     any disclosure or other record required to be provided or \n     made available to any consumer under any statute, regulation, \n     or other rule of law. Further, subsection (c)(2) provides \n     that if a law that was enacted prior to this Act expressly \n     requires a record to be provided or made available by a \n     specified method that requires verification or acknowledgment \n     of receipt, the record may be provided or made available \n     electronically only if the method used provides verification \n     or acknowledgment of receipt (whichever is required).\n       Section 101(c)(3) makes clear that an electronic contract \n     or electronic signature cannot be deemed ineffective, \n     invalid, or unenforceable merely because the party \n     contracting with a consumer failed to meet the requirements \n     of the consent to electronic records provision.\n       Compliance with the consent provisions of section 101(c) is \n     intended to address the effectiveness of the provision of \n     information in electronic form, not the validity or \n     enforceability of the underlying contractual relationship or \n     agreement between the parties. In other words, a technical \n     violation of the consent provisions cannot in and of itself \n     invalidate an electronic contract or prevent it from being \n     legally enforced. Rather, the validity and enforceability of \n     the electronic contract is evaluated under existing \n     substantive contract law, that is, by determining whether the \n     violation of the consent provisions resulted in a consumer \n     failing to receive information necessary to the enforcement \n     of the contract or some provision thereof. For example, if it \n     turns out that the manner in which a consumer consented did \n     not `reasonably demonstrate' that she could access the \n     electronic form of the information at a later date, but at \n     the time of executing the contract she was able to view its \n     terms and conditions before signing, the contract could still \n     be valid and enforceable despite the technical violation of \n     the electronic consent provision.\n       Subsection (c)(4) provides that withdrawal of consent by a \n     consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, \n     or enforceability of electronic records provided or made \n     available to that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1) \n     prior to implementation of the consumer's withdrawal of \n     consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent shall be \n     effective within a reasonable period of time after receipt of \n     the withdrawal by the provider of the record. Failure to \n     comply with paragraph (1)(D) may, at the election of the \n     consumer, be treated as a withdrawal of consent for purposes \n     of this paragraph.\n       Subsection (c)(5) makes clear that this subsection does not \n     apply to any records that are provided or made available to a \n     consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of \n     this title to receive such records in electronic form as \n     permitted by any statute, regulation, or other rule of law.\n       Subsection (c)(6) provides that an oral communication or a \n     recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an \n     electronic record for purposes of this subsection except as \n     otherwise provided under applicable law.\n       It should be noted that Section 101(c)(6) does not preclude \n     the consumer from using her voice to sign or approve that \n     record. Proper voice signatures can be very effective in \n     confirming a person's informed intent to be legally \n     obligated. Therefore, the consumer could conceivably use an \n     oral or voice signature to sign a text record that was \n     required to be given to her ``in writing''. Moreover, the \n     person who originated the text record could authenticate it \n     with a voice signature as well. The spoken words of the \n     signature might be something like ``I Jane Consumer hereby \n     sign and agree to this loan document and notice of interest \n     charges.''\n       By way of clarification, the intent of this clause is to \n     disqualify only oral communications that are not authorized \n     under applicable law and are not created or stored in a \n     digital format. This paragraph is not intended to create an \n     impediment to voice-based technologies, which are certain to \n     be an important component of the emerging mobile-commerce \n     market. Today, a system that creates a digital file by means \n     of the use of voice, as opposed to a keyboard, mouse or \n     similar device, is capable of creating an electronic record, \n     despite the fact that it began its existence as an oral \n     communication.\n       Section 101(d) addresses statutory and regulatory record \n     retention requirements. It states that when a statute, \n     regulation, or other rule of law requires that a record, \n     including a contract, be retained that requirement is \n     satisfied by the retention of an electronic record, if two \n     criteria are met. First, the electronic record must \n     accurately reflect the information set forth in the contract \n     or record required to be retained. Second, that electronic \n     record must remain accessible to all parties who by law are \n     entitled to access the record for the period set out in that \n     law. Moreover, the electronic record must be in a form \n     capable of accurate reproduction for later reference. The \n     reproduction may be by way of transmission, printing or any \n     other method of reproducing records.\n       With respect to Section 101(d)(1)(B), this subsection only \n     requires retained records to remain accessible to persons \n     entitled to access them by statute. The subsection does not \n     require the business to provide direct access to its \n     facilities nor does it require the business to update \n     electronic formats as technology changes--the records must, \n     however, be capable of being accurately reproduced at the \n     time that reference to them is required by law.\n       Section 101(e) addresses statutory and regulatory \n     requirements that certain records, including contracts, be in \n     writing. The statute of frauds writing requirement \n     exemplifies one such legal requirement. The section states \n     that an electronic record or contract may be denied legal \n     effect and enforceability under section 101(a) of this Act, \n     if such an electronic record is not in a form that is capable \n     of being retained and accurately reproduced for later \n     reference by all parties entitled to retain that contract or \n     record. This provision is intended to reach two qualities of \n     ``a writing'' in the non-electronic world. The first such \n     quality of ``a writing'' is that it can be retained, e.g., a \n     contract can be filed. The second such quality of ``a \n     writing'' is that it can be reproduced, e.g., a contract \n     can be copied.\n       With respect to Section 101(e), the actual inability of a \n     party to reproduce a record at a particular point in time \n     does not invoke this subsection. The subsection merely \n     requires that if a statute requires a contract to be in \n     writing, then the contract should be capable of being \n     retained and accurately reproduced for later reference by \n     those entitled to retain it. Thus if a customer enters into \n     an electronic contract which was capable of being retained or \n     reproduced, but the customer chooses to use a device such as \n     a Palm Pilot or cellular phone that does not have a printer \n     or a disk drive allowing the customer to make a copy of the \n     contract at that particular time, this section is not \n     invoked. The record was in a form that was capable of being \n     retained and reproduced by the customer had it chosen to use \n     a device allowing retention and reproduction.\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\n       Subsection (f) clarifies that nothing in title I affects \n     the proximity requirement of any statute, regulation, or \n     other rule of law with respect to any warning, notice, \n     disclosure, or other record required to be posted, displayed, \n     or publicly affixed.\n       Subsection (g) provides that if a statute, regulation, or \n     other rule of law requires a signature or record to be \n     notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, that \n     requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the \n     person authorized to perform those acts, together with all \n     other information required to be included by other applicable \n     statute, regulation, or rule of law, is attached to or \n     logically associated with the signature or record. This \n     subsection permits notaries public and other authorized \n     officers to perform their functions electronically, provided \n     that all other requirements of applicable law are satisfied. \n     This subsection removes any requirement of a stamp, seal, or \n     similar embossing device as it may apply to the performance \n     of these functions by electronic means.\n       It is my intent that no requirement for the use of a stamp, \n     seal, or similar device shall preclude the use of an \n     electronic signature for these purposes.\n       Subsection (h) provides legal effect, validity and \n     enforceability to contracts and record relating to a \n     transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce \n     that were formed, created or delivered by one or more \n     electronic agents.\n       Subsection (i) makes clear that the provisions of title I \n     and II cover the business of insurance.\n       Subsection (j) provides protection from liability for an \n     insurance agent or broker acting under the direction of a \n     party that enters into a contract by means of an electronic \n     record or electronic signature if: (1) the agent or broker \n     has not engaged in negligent, reckless, or intentional \n     tortious conduct; (2) the agent or broker was not involved in \n     the development or establishment of such electronic \n     procedures; and (3) the agent or broker did not deviate from \n     such procedures.\n\n\n              authority to alter or supersede general rule\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 5(g) of the Senate bill provides that section 5 \n     does not apply to any State in which the Uniform Electronic \n     Transaction Act is in effect.\n     House amendment\n       Section 102(a) of the House amendment provides that a State \n     statute, regulation or other rule of law enacted or adopted \n     after the date of enactment of H.R. 1714 may modify, limit, \n     or supersede the provisions of section 101 (except as \n     provided in section 102(b)) if that State action: (1) is an \n     adoption or enactment of the UETA as reported by the NCCUSL \n     or specifies alternative procedures or requirements \n     recognizing the legal effect, validity and enforceability of \n     electronic signatures; and (2) for statutes enacted or \n     adopted after the date of enactment of this Act, makes \n     specific reference to the provisions of section 101.\n       Section 102(b) provides that no State statute, regulation, \n     or rule of law (including those pertaining to insurance), \n     regardless of date of enactment, that modifies, limits, or \n     supersedes section 101 shall be effective to the extent that \n     such statute, regulation, or rule of law: (1) discriminates \n     in favor of or against a specific technology, method, or \n     technique; (2) discriminates in favor of or against a \n     specific type or size of entity engaged in the business of \n     facilitating the use of electronic signatures and electronic \n     records; (3) is based on procedures or requirements that are \n     not specific and that are not publicly available; and (4) is \n     otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of section 101.\n       Section 103(c) provides that a State may, by statute, \n     regulation or rule of law enacted or adopted after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, require specific notices to be \n     provided or made available in writing if such notices are \n     necessary for the protection of the public health or safety \n     of consumers. A consumer may not, pursuant to section \n     101(b)(2) consent to the provision or availability of such \n     notice solely as an electronic record.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a substitute provision. \n     Section 102 of the conference report provides a conditioned \n     process for States to enact their own statutes, regulations \n     or other rules of law dealing with the use and acceptance of \n     electronic signatures and records and thus opt-out of the \n     federal regime. The preemptive effects of this Act apply to \n     both existing and future statutes, regulations, or other \n     rules of law enacted or adopted by a State. Thus, a State \n     could not argue that section 101 does not preempt its \n     statutes, regulations, or other rules of law because they \n     were enacted or adopted prior to the enactment of this Act.\n       Section 102(a) provides that a State statute, regulation or \n     other rule of law may modify, limit, or supersede the \n     provisions of section 101 only if that State action: (1) \n     constitutes an adoption or enactment of the Uniform \n     Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) as reported and \n     recommended for enactment by the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1999; or (2) \n     specifies alternative procedures or requirements (or both) \n     for the use or acceptance of electronic signatures or \n     electronic records for establishing the legal effect, \n     validity and enforceability of contracts or records.\n       It is intended that any State that enacts or adopts UETA in \n     its State to remove itself from Federal preemption pursuant \n     to subsection (a)(1) shall be required to enact or adopt UETA \n     as that document was reported and recommended for enactment \n     by NCCUSL.\n       Subsection (a)(1) places a limitation on a State that \n     attempts to avoid Federal preemption by enacting or adopting \n     a clean UETA. Section 3(b)(4) of UETA, as reported and \n     recommended for enactment by NCCUSL, allows a State to \n     exclude the application of that State's enactment or adoption \n     of UETA for any `other laws, if any, identified by State.' \n     This provision provides a potential loophole for a State to \n     prevent the use or acceptance of electronic signatures or \n     electronic records in that State. To remedy this, subsection \n     (a)(1) requires that any exception utilized by a State under \n     section 3(b)(4) of UETA shall be preempted if it is \n     inconsistent with title I or II, or would not be permitted \n     under subsection (a)(2)(ii) (technology neutrality). \n     Requirements for certified mail or return receipt would not \n     be inconsistent with title I or II, however, note that an \n     electronic equivalent would be permitted.\n       As stated above, subsection (a)(2) is designed to cover any \n     attempt by a State to escape Federal preemption by enacting \n     or adopting specific alternative procedures or requirements \n     for the use or acceptance of electronic signatures or records \n     except a strict enactment or adoption of UETA (which would be \n     covered by subsection (a)(1)). States that enact UETA in the \n     manner specified in (a)(1) may supercede the provisions of \n     section 101 with respect to State law. Thus, regulatory \n     agencies within a state which complies with (a)(1) would \n     interpret UETA, not section 101 of the federal act.\n       Further, some States are enacting or adopting a strict, \n     unamended version of UETA as well as enacting or adopting a \n     companion or separate law that contains further provisions \n     relating to the use or acceptance of electronic signatures or \n     electronic records. Under this Act, such action by the State \n     would prompt both subsection (a)(1) (for the strict enactment \n     or adoption of UETA) and subsection (a)(2) (for the other \n     companion or separate legislation).\n       Subsection (a)(2) contains two important conditions that \n     limit the extent to which a state could utilize it to opt-out \n     of the federal regime. Specifically, when interpreting \n     section 101, alternative procedures or requirements: (1) must \n     be consistent with this title and title II; and (2) shall not \n     require, or accord greater legal status or effect to, the \n     implementation or application of a specific technology or \n     technological specification for performing the functions of \n     creating, storing, generating, receiving, communicating, or \n     authenticating electronic signatures or records. It is not \n     intended that the singular use of technology or technological \n     specification in subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) allows a State to \n     set more than one technology at the expense of other \n     technologies in order to meet this standard, unless only one \n     form of the technology exists, in which case this act is not \n     intended to preclude a technological solution. Further, \n     inclusion of the `or accord greater legal status or effect \n     to' is intended to prevent a state from giving a leg-up or \n     impose an additional burden on one technology or technical \n     specification that is not applicable to all others, and is \n     not intended to prevent a state or its subdivisions from \n     developing, establishing, using or certifying a certificate \n     authority system.\n       In addition, subsection (a)(2)(B) requires that a State \n     that utilizes subsection (a)(2) to escape federal preemption \n     must make a specific reference to this Act in any statute, \n     regulation, or other rule of law enacted or adopted after the \n     date of enactment of this Act. This provision is intended, in \n     part, to make it easier to track action by the various States \n     under this subsection for purposes of research.\n       Section 102(b) provides a specific exclusion to the \n     technology neutrality provisions contained in subsection \n     (a)(2)(A)(ii) for procurement by a state, or any agency or \n     instrumentality thereof.\n       Section 102(c) makes clear that subsection (a) cannot be \n     used by a State to circumvent this title or title II through \n     the imposition of nonelectronic delivery methods under \n     section 8(b)(2) of UETA. Any attempt by a State to use \n     8(b)(2) to violate the spirit of this Act should be treated \n     as effort to circumvent and thus be void.\n\n\n                          SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 5(d) of the Senate bill excludes from the \n     application of this section any statute, regulation or other \n     rule of law governing: (1) the Uniform Commercial Code as in \n     effect in any state, other than sections 1-107 and 1-206 and \n     Articles 2 and 2A; (2) premarital agreements, marriage, \n     adoption, divorce, or other matters of family law; (3) \n     documents of title which are filed of record with a \n     governmental unit until such time that a State or subdivision \n     thereof chooses to accept filings electronically; (4) \n     residential landlord-tenant relationships; and (5) the \n     Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act as in effect in a State.\n     House amendment\n       Section 103(a) of the House amendment excludes from the \n     application of section 101 any contract, agreement or record \n     to the extent that it is covered by: (1) a statute, \n     regulation or rule of law governing the creation\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\n     and execution of wills, codicils, or testamentary trusts; (2) \n     a statute, regulation or other rule of law governing \n     adoption, divorce, or other matters of family law; (3) the \n     Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any state, other than \n     sections 1-107 and -206 and Articles 2 and 2A; (4) any \n     requirement by a Federal regulatory agency or self-regulatory \n     agency that records be filed or maintained in a specified \n     standard or standards (except that nothing relieves any \n     Federal regulatory agency of its obligation under the \n     Government Paperwork Elimination Act, title XVII of Public \n     Law 105-277); (5) the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act; or (6) the \n     Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act.\n       Section 103(b) excludes from the application of section \n     101: (1) any contract, agreement or record between a party \n     and a State agency if the State agency is not acting as a \n     market participant in or affecting interstate commerce; (2) \n     court orders or notices or official court documents \n     (including briefs, pleading and other writings) required to \n     be executed in connection with court proceedings; or (3) any \n     notice concerning: (A) the cancellation or termination of \n     utility services, (B) default, acceleration, repossession, \n     foreclosure or eviction, or the right to cure under a credit \n     agreement secured by, or a rental agreement for, a primary \n     residence of an individual or the cancellation or termination \n     of health insurance or benefits or life insurance benefits \n     (excluding annuities).\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a substitute provision.\n       Section 103(a) excludes from the application of section 101 \n     any contract, agreement or record to the extent that it is \n     covered by: (1) a statute, regulation or rule of law \n     governing the creation and execution of wills, codicils, or \n     testamentary trusts; (2) a statute, regulation or other rule \n     of law governing adoption, divorce, or other matters of \n     family law; (3) the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in \n     any state, other than sections 1-107 and 1-206 and Articles 2 \n     and 2A.\n       Section 103(b) excludes from the application of section \n     101: (1) court orders or notices or official court documents \n     (including briefs, pleading and other writings) required to \n     be executed in connection with court proceedings; or (2) any \n     notice of: (A) the cancellation or termination of utility \n     services, (B) default, acceleration, repossession, \n     foreclosure or eviction, or the right to cure under a credit \n     agreement secured by, or a rental agreement for, a primary \n     residence of an individual or the cancellation or termination \n     of health insurance or benefits or life insurance benefits \n     (excluding annuities).\n       The exclusion pertaining to utility services applies to \n     essential consumer services including water, heat and power. \n     This provision does not apply to notices for other broadly \n     used important consumer services, such as telephone, cable \n     television, and Internet access services, etc. Electronic \n     cancellation or termination notices may be used in \n     association with those other services, assuming all of the \n     other elements of Section 101 are met. To clarify further, \n     with respect to Section 103(b), the statement that ``the \n     provisions of section 101 shall not apply to'' the listed \n     items means only that Section 101 may not be relied upon to \n     allow an electronic record or electronic signature to \n     suffice. Section 103(b) does not prohibit use of electronic \n     records or signatures, however. Whether such can be used is \n     left to other law.\n       Section 103(c)(1) directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \n     through the Assistant Secretary for Communication and \n     Information, to review the operation of the exclusions in \n     subsections (a) and (b) over a period of three years to \n     determine if such exclusions are necessary for the protection \n     of consumers. The Assistant Secretary shall submit the \n     findings of this review to Congress within three years of the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       Section 103(c)(2) provides that a Federal regulatory \n     agency, with respect to matter within its jurisdiction, may \n     extend, after proper notice and comment and publishing a \n     finding that one or more of exceptions in subsections (a) or \n     (b) are no longer necessary for the protection of consumers \n     and eliminating such exceptions will not materially increase \n     the risk of harm to consumers, the application of section 101 \n     to such exceptions.\n\n\n             APPLICABILITY TO FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS\n\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contained no provision affecting the \n     authority of Federal regulatory agencies.\n     House amendment\n       The House amendment provided in Section 103 that the \n     authority of Federal regulatory agencies would be preserved \n     over records filed or maintained in a specific standard or \n     standards.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a substitute provision.\n       Section 104(a) provides that subject to section 104(a)(2), \n     a Federal regulatory agency, a self-regulatory organization, \n     or State regulatory agency may specify standards or formats \n     for the filing of records with that agency or organization, \n     including requiring paper filings or records. While the \n     conference report preserves such authority to such agencies \n     or organizations, it is intended that use of such authority \n     is rarely exercised. Section 104(b)(1) provides that subject \n     to section 104(b)(2) and section 104(c), a Federal regulatory \n     agency or State regulatory agency that is responsible for \n     rulemaking under any other statute may interpret section 101 \n     with respect to such statute through (1) the issuance of \n     regulations pursuant to a statute; or (2) to the extent such \n     agency is authorized by statute to issue orders or guidance, \n     the issuance of orders or guidance of general applicability \n     that are publicly available and published (in the Federal \n     Register in the case of an order or guidance issued by a \n     Federal regulatory agency).\n       The conference report provides for more limited Federal and \n     State interpretative authority over other functions related \n     to records. This Act grants no additional or new rulemaking \n     authority to any Federal or State agency. The conference \n     report provides that if Federal or State regulators possessed \n     specific rulemaking authority under their organic statutes, \n     they could use that rulemaking authority to interpret section \n     101 subject to strict conditions. Those conditions include \n     determinations that such regulation, order or guidance: (1) \n     is consistent with section 101; and (2) does not add to the \n     requirements of the section. Additionally, the conference \n     report requires that any Federal agency show conclusively \n     that: (a) there is a substantial justification for the \n     regulation and the regulation is necessary to protect an \n     important public interest; (b) the methods used to carry out \n     that purpose are the least restrictive alternative consistent \n     with that purpose; (c) the methods are substantially \n     equivalent to the requirements imposed or records that are \n     not electronic records; and (d) such methods will not impose \n     new costs on the acceptance and use of electronic records. \n     The conference report requires strict technological \n     neutrality of any Federal or State regulation, order or \n     guidance. Absent such technological neutrality, any such \n     regulation, order or guidance is void.\n       The conference report is designed to prevent Federal and \n     State Regulators from undermining the broad purpose of this \n     Act, to facilitate electronic commerce and electronic record \n     keeping. To ensure that the purposes of this Act are upheld, \n     Federal and State regulatory authority is strictly \n     circumscribed. It is expected that Courts reviewing \n     administrative actions will be rigorous in seeing that the \n     purpose of this Act, to ensure the widest use and \n     dissemination of electronic commerce and records are not \n     undermined.\n       Subsection (b)(3)(A) provides authority to a Federal or \n     State regulatory agency to interpret section 101(d) in a \n     manner to specify specific performance standards to assure \n     accuracy, record integrity, and accessibility of records that \n     are required to be retained. Subsection (b)(3) extends this \n     authority to override the technology neutrality provision \n     contained in subsection (b)(2)C)(iii) but only if doing so \n     (1) serves an important governmental objective; and (2) is \n     substantially related to the achievement of that objective. \n     Further, subsection (b)(3)(A) does not allow a Federal or \n     State regulatory agency to require the use of a particular \n     type of software or hardware in order to comply with \n     101(d).\n       Subsection (b)(3)(B) provides authority to a Federal or \n     State regulatory agency to interpret section 101(d) to \n     require retention of paper records but only if (1) there is a \n     compelling government interest relating to law enforcement or \n     national security for imposing such requirement, and (2) \n     imposing such requirement is essential to attaining such \n     interest. It is important to note that the test in subsection \n     (b)(3)(B) is higher and more stringent than in subsection \n     (b)(3)(A). This is intentional as it is an effort to impose \n     an extremely high barrier before a Federal or State \n     regulatory agency will revert back to requiring paper \n     records. However, this does not diminish the test contained \n     subsection (b)(3)(A). It, too, is intended to be an extremely \n     high barrier for a Federal or State regulatory agency to meet \n     before the technology neutrality provision is violated. It is \n     intended that use of either of these tests will be necessary \n     in only a very, very few instances. It is expected that \n     Federal and State agencies take all action and exhaust all \n     other avenues before exercising authority granted in \n     paragraph (3).\n       Subsection (b)(4) exempts procurement by a Federal or State \n     government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof from the \n     technology neutral requirements of subsection (b)(2)(C)(iii).\n       Subsection (c)(1) makes clear that nothing in subsection \n     (b), except subsection (b)(3)(B), allows a Federal or State \n     regulatory agency to impose or reimpose any requirement that \n     a record be in paper form.\n       Subsection (c)(2) makes clear that nothing in subsection \n     (a) or (b) relieves any Federal regulatory agency of its \n     obligations under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act.\n       Subsection (d)(1) provides authority to a Federal or State \n     regulatory agency to exempt without condition a specified \n     category or type of record from the consent provisions in \n     section 101(c) if such exemption is necessary to eliminate a \n     substantial burden on electronic commerce and will not \n     increase the material risk of harm to consumers. It is \n     intended that the test under subsection (d)(1) not be read \n     too limiting. There are vast numbers of instances when \n     section 101(c) may not be appropriate or necessary and should \n     be exempted by the appropriate regulator.\n       Subsection (d)(2) requires the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, within 30 days after date of enactment, to issue \n     a regulation or order pursuant to subsection (d)(1)\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\n     exempting from the consent provision any records that are \n     required to be provided in order to allow advertising, sales \n     literature, or other information concerning a security issued \n     by an investment company that is registered under the \n     Investment Company Act of 1940, or concerning the issuer \n     thereof, to be excluded from the definition of a prospectus \n     under section 2(a)(10)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933.\n       Section 104(e) provides that the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall not hold any contract for telecommunications \n     service or letter of agency for a preferred carrier change, \n     that otherwise complies with the Commission's rules, to be \n     legally ineffective, invalid or unenforceable solely because \n     an electronic records or electronic signature was used in its \n     formation or authorization.\n       The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been very \n     slow, even reticent, to clearly authorize the use of an \n     Internet letter of agency for a consumer to conduct a \n     preferred carrier change. As a result of the Commission's \n     repeated failure to act on this matter, the conference \n     report provides specific direction to the Commission to \n     recognize Internet letters of agency for a preferred \n     carrier change.\n\n\n                                STUDIES\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 7 of the Senate bill directs each Federal agency \n     shall, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, to provide a report to the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Commerce \n     identifying any provision of law administered by such agency, \n     or any regulations issued by such agency and in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, that may impose a barrier to \n     electronic transactions, or otherwise to the conduct of \n     commerce online or by electronic means, including barriers \n     imposed by a law or regulation directly or indirectly \n     requiring that signatures, or records of transactions, be \n     accomplished or retained in other than electronic form. In \n     its report, each agency shall identify the barriers among \n     those identified whose removal would require legislative \n     action, and shall indicate agency plans to undertake \n     regulatory action to remove such barriers among those \n     identified as are caused by regulations issued by the agency.\n       Section 7(b) requires a report to Congress by The Secretary \n     of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office \n     of Management and Budget within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and after the consultation required by \n     subsection (c) of this section, report to the Congress \n     concerning--\n       (1) legislation needed to remove barriers to electronic \n     transactions or otherwise to the conduct of commerce online \n     or by electronic means; and\n       (2) actions being taken by the Executive Branch and \n     individual Federal agencies to remove such barriers as are \n     caused by agency regulations or policies.\n       7(c) provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall consult \n     with the General Services Administration, the National \n     Archives and Records Administration, and the Attorney General \n     concerning matters involving the authenticity of records, \n     their storage and retention, and their usability for law \n     enforcement purposes.\n       7(d) If the report required by this section omits \n     recommendations for actions needed to fully remove identified \n     barriers to electronic transactions or to online or \n     electronic commerce, it shall include a finding or findings, \n     including substantial reasons therefor, that such removal is \n     impracticable or would be inconsistent with the \n     implementation or enforcement of applicable laws.\n     House amendment\n       Section 104 of the House amendment directs the Secretary of \n     Commerce (the Secretary), acting through the Assistant \n     Secretary for Communications and Information, to conduct an \n     inquiry regarding any State statute, regulation, or rule of \n     law enacted or adopted after enactment on the extent to which \n     such statute, regulation, or rule of law complies with \n     section 102(b). Section 104(b) requires the Secretary to \n     submit the report described in paragraph (a) at the \n     conclusion of the five year period.\n       Section 104(c) requires the Secretary, within eighteen \n     months after the date of enactment, to conduct an inquiry \n     regarding the effectiveness of the delivery of electronic \n     records to consumers using electronic mail as compared with \n     the delivery of written records by the United States Postal \n     Service and private express mail services. The Secretary \n     shall submit a report to Congress regarding the results of \n     such inquiry at the conclusion of the eighteen month period.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference adopts a substitute provision. Specifically, \n     the conference report retains subsection 7(a) of the Senate \n     amendment and redesignates it as section 104(a) of the \n     conference report. Further, the conference report includes a \n     new subsection (b) that requires the Secretary of Commerce \n     and the Federal Trade Commission, within one year after date \n     of enactment, to submit a report to the Congress analyzing: \n     (1) the benefits provided to consumers by the consumer access \n     test of the consent provision (section 101(c)(1)(C)(ii)); (2) \n     any burdens imposed on electronic commerce by the provision, \n     whether the benefits outweigh the burdens; (3) whether the \n     absence of such procedure would increase consumer fraud; and \n     (4) any suggestions for revising the provision. In conducting \n     the evaluation, the Secretary of Commerce and FTC shall \n     solicit the comments of the public, consumer representatives, \n     and electronic commerce businesses.\n\n\n                              DEFINITIONS\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 4 sets forth the definitions of terms used in the \n     bill: `electronic;' `electronic agent;' `electronic record;' \n     `electronic signature;' `governmental agency;' `record;' \n     `transaction;' and `Uniform Electronic Transaction Act.'\n     House amendment\n       Section 104 of the House amendment defines the following \n     terms: `electronic record;' `electronic signature;' \n     `electronic;' `electronic agent;' `record;' `Federal \n     regulatory agency;' and `self-regulatory agency.'\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a substitute provision \n     adopting definitions for the following terms: `consumer;' \n     `electronic;' `electronic agent;' `electronic record;' \n     `electronic signature;' `Federal regulatory agency;' \n     `information;' `person;' `record;' and `transaction.'\n       To clarify further the definition of ``consumer,'' the \n     definition is intended to be consistent with traditional \n     interpretations of such definitions. This means that the \n     party dealing with the consumer may rely on the consumer's \n     intended use for the product or service as indicated when the \n     transaction is entered into. Thus if an individual indicates \n     at the time of the transaction that the online purchase of a \n     heater is primarily for personal family or household use, \n     then that individual is a consumer; the fact that the \n     individual may later dedicate the actual use of the heater to \n     the individual's business is not relevant. The opposite is \n     also true: if an individual indicates that the intended use \n     is primarily for business purposes, then that individual \n     is not a consumer even if the individual later uses the \n     heater primarily for personal or family purposes.\n\n\n                            EFFECTIVE DATES\n\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contained no provision.\n     House amendment\n       The House amendment contained no provision.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report creates a general delayed effective \n     date for the bill, and creates specific delayed effective \n     dates for certain provisions of the bill. Subsection (a) \n     establishes that, except as provided in subsections (b), the \n     provisions of the bill are effective October 1, 2000. \n     Subsection (b) delays the effective date of the records \n     retention provision until March 1, 2001 unless an agency has \n     initiated, announced, proposed but not completed an action \n     under subsection 104(b)(3), in which case it would be \n     extended until June 1, 2001. Subsection (b)(2) delays the \n     effective date of this Act by one year with regards to any \n     transaction involving a loan guarantee or loan guarantee \n     commitment made by the United States Government. The one year \n     delay was granted to permit the federal government time to \n     institute safeguards necessary to protect taxpayers from risk \n     of default on loans guaranteed by the federal government.\n       Subsection (d) delays the effective date of section 101(c) \n     for any records provided or made available to a consumer \n     pursuant to title IV of the High Education Act of 1965 until \n     the Secretary of Education publishes revised promissory notes \n     under section 432(m) of such Act or one year after the date \n     of enactment, whichever is earlier.\n\n\n                          TRANSFERABLE RECORDS\n\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contained no provision.\n     House amendment\n       The House amendment contained no provision.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a new provision in recognition \n     of the need to establish a uniform national standard for the \n     creation, recognition, and enforcement of electronic \n     negotiable instruments. The development of a fully-electronic \n     system of negotiable instruments such as promissory notes is \n     one that will produce significant reductions in transaction \n     costs. This provision, which is based in part on Section 16 \n     of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, sets forth a \n     criteria-based approach to the recognition of electronic \n     negotiable instruments, referred to as `transferable \n     records' in this section and in UETA. It is intended that \n     this approach create a legal framework within which \n     companies can develop new technologies that fulfill all of \n     the essential requirements of negotiability in an \n     electronic environment, and in a manner that protects the \n     interests of consumers.\n       The conference report notes that the official Comments to \n     section 16 of UETA, as adopted by the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, provide a valuable \n     explanation of the origins and purposes of this section, as \n     well as the meaning of particular provisions.\n       The conference report notes that, pursuant to sections 3(c) \n     and 7(d) of the UETA, an electronic signature satisfies any \n     signature requirement under Section 16 of the UETA. It is \n     intended that an electronic signature shall satisfy any \n     signature requirement under this provision, as well. The \n     conference report further notes that the reference in\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\n     section 201(a)(1)(C) to loans secured by real property' \n     includes all forms of real property, including single-family \n     and multi-family housing.\n\n\n TREATMENT OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE\n\n     Senate bill\n       Section 6 of the Senate bill sets out the principles that \n     the United States Government should follow, to the extent \n     practicable, in its international negotiations on electronic \n     commerce as a means to facilitate cross-border electronic \n     transactions.\n       Section 6 lists the principles as follows: (1) advocates \n     the removal of paper-based obstacles to electronic \n     transactions. This can be accomplished by taking into account \n     the enabling provisions of the Model Law on Electronic \n     Commerce adopted by the United Nations Committee on \n     International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in 1996. Paragraph (2) \n     permits that parties to a transaction shall have the \n     opportunity to choose the technology of their choice when \n     entering into an electronic transaction. Paragraph (3) \n     permits parties to a transaction the opportunity to prove in \n     a court or other proceeding that their authentication \n     approach and transactions are valid. Paragraph (4) adopts a \n     nondiscriminatory approach to electronic signatures.\n     House amendment\n       Section 201(a) directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \n     through the Assistant Secretary for Communications and \n     Information, to conduct an annual inquiry identifying: (1) \n     any domestic or foreign impediments to commerce in electronic \n     signature products and services and the manner and extent to \n     which such impediments inhibit the development of interstate \n     and foreign commerce; (2) constraints imposed by foreign \n     nations or international organizations that constitute \n     barriers to providers of electronic signature products and \n     services; and (3) the degree to which other nations and \n     international organizations are complying with the principles \n     in section 201(b)(2).\n       Under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary is required to \n     report to Congress the findings of each inquiry 90 days after \n     completion of such inquiry.\n       Section 201(b) directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \n     through the Assistant Secretary for Communications and \n     Information, to promote the acceptance and use of electronic \n     signatures on an international basis in accordance with \n     section 101 of the bill and with designated principles. In \n     addition, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to take all \n     actions to eliminate or reduce impediments to commerce in \n     electronic signatures, including those resulting from the \n     inquiries required pursuant to subsection (a).\n       The designated principles are as follows: free-markets and \n     self-regulation, rather than government standard-setting or \n     rules, should govern the development and use of electronic \n     signatures and electronic records; neutrality and \n     nondiscrimination should be observed among providers of and \n     technologies for electronic records and electronic \n     signatures; parties to a transaction should be allowed to \n     establish requirements regarding the use of electronic \n     records and electronic signatures acceptable to the parties; \n     parties to a transaction should be permitted to determine the \n     appropriate authentication technologies and implementation \n     for their transactions with the assurance that the technology \n     and implementation will be recognized and enforced; the \n     parties should have the opportunity to prove in court that \n     their authentication approaches and transactions are valid; \n     electronic records and signatures in a form acceptable to the \n     parties should not be denied legal effect, validity, or \n     enforceability because they are not in writing; de jure or de \n     facto imposition of electronic signature and electronic \n     record standards on the private sector through foreign \n     adoption of regulations or policies should be avoided; paper-\n     based obstacles to electronic transactions should be removed.\n       Section 201(c) requires the Secretary of Commerce to \n     consult with users and providers of electronic signatures and \n     products and other interested parties in carrying out actions \n     under this section.\n       Section 201(d) clarifies that nothing requires the \n     Secretary or Assistant Secretary to take any action that \n     would adversely affect the privacy of consumers.\n       Section 201(e) provides that the definitions in section 104 \n     apply to this title.\n     Conference substitute\n       The House recedes to the Senate with an amendment. Section \n     301(a)(1) directs the Secretary of Commerce to promote the \n     acceptance and use of electronic signatures on an \n     international basis in accordance with section 101 of the \n     bill and with the set principles listed in subsection (a)(2). \n     In addition, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to take \n     all actions to eliminate or reduce impediments to commerce in \n     electronic signatures.\n       Section 301(a)(2) lists the principles as follows: (1) \n     Removal of paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions. \n     This can be accomplished by taking into account the enabling \n     provisions of the Model Law on Electronic Commerce adopted by \n     the United Nations Committee on International Trade Law \n     (UNCITRAL) in 1996; (2) Parties to a transaction shall have \n     the opportunity to choose the technology of their choice when \n     entering into an electronic transaction. Parties to a \n     commercial transaction should be able to chose the \n     appropriate authentication technologies and implementation \n     models for their transactions. Unnecessary regulation of \n     commercial transactions distorts the development and \n     efficient operation of markets, including electronic \n     markets. Moreover, the rapid development of the electronic \n     marketplace is resulting in new business models and \n     technological innovations. This is an evolving process. \n     Therefore, government attempts to regulate may impede the \n     development of newer alternative technologies; (3) Parties \n     to a transaction the opportunity to prove in a court or \n     other proceeding that their authentication approach and \n     transactions are valid. Parties should have the \n     opportunity to prove in court that the authentication \n     methods that they select are valid and reliable; and (4) \n     Adoption of a nondiscriminatory approach to electronic \n     signatures and authentication methods from other \n     jurisdictions.\n       Section 301(c) directs the Secretary to consult with users \n     and providers of electronic signature products and services \n     and other interested parties. Section 301(d) applies the \n     definitions of `electronic signature' and `electronic record' \n     in section 107 to this title.\n       Increasingly, online transactions are not just interstate \n     but international in nature and this creates a clear need for \n     international recognition of electronic signatures and \n     records that will not create barriers to international trade. \n     Title III directs the Secretary of Commerce to take an active \n     role in bilateral and multilateral talks to promote the use \n     and acceptance of electronic signatures and electronic \n     records worldwide. It is intended that the Secretary promote \n     the principles contained in this Act internationally. \n     However, it is possible that some foreign nations may choose \n     to adopt their own approach to the use and acceptance of \n     electronic signatures and electronic records. In such cases, \n     the Secretary should encourage those nations to provide legal \n     recognition to contracts and transactions that may fall \n     outside of the scope of the national law and encourage those \n     nations to recognize the rights of parties to establish their \n     own terms and conditions for the use and acceptance of \n     electronic signatures and electronic records.\n       There is particular concern about international \n     developments that seek to favor specific technologies of \n     processes for generating electronic signatures and electronic \n     records. Failure to recognize multiple technologies may \n     create potential barriers to trade and stunt the development \n     of new and innovative technologies.\n       Unfortunately, international developments on recognizing \n     electronic signatures are troubling. The German Digital \n     Signature Law of July 1997 runs counter to many of the widely \n     accepted principles of electronic signature law in the United \n     States. For example, the German law provides legal \n     recognition only to signatures generated using digital \n     signature technology, establishes licensing for certificate \n     authorities, and sets a substantial role for the government \n     in establishing technical standards. Further, a position \n     paper on international recognition of electronic signatures \n     released by the German government (International Legal \n     Recognition of Digital Signatures, August 28, 1998) seeks to \n     apply these principles internationally. This policy statement \n     reemphasizes the principle that uniform security standards \n     are necessary for all uses of digital signatures regardless \n     of their use, supports mutual recognition of digital \n     signatures only to those nations which have a similar \n     regulatory structure for certification authority, and fails \n     to provide legal effect to electronic signatures generated by \n     other technologies.\n       The European Community is considering a framework for the \n     use and acceptance of electronic signatures for its member \n     countries. `Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament \n     and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community \n     Framework for electronic signatures' lays out the European \n     Community's approach to electronic signature legislation. \n     Of particular interest is Article 7, International \n     Aspects, which recognizes the legal validity of digital \n     certificates issued in a non-European Community country. \n     While international recognition of electronic signatures \n     is important, there is concern that this approach will not \n     recognize non-certificate based electronic signatures, \n     such as those based on biometric technologies. The \n     conference report notes that negotiations with the \n     European Union on electronic signatures is a top priority.\n\n                 Commission on Child Online Protection\n\n\n                       authority to accept gifts\n\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate bill contains no similar provision.\n     House amendment\n       The House amendment contains no similar provision.\n     Conference substitute\n       The conference report adopts a provision to amend section \n     1405 of the Child Online Protection Act by adding a new \n     subsection (h), which allows the Commission on Online Child \n     Protection to accept, use and dispose of gifts, bequests or \n     devises of services or property for the purpose of aiding or \n     facilitating the work of the Commission.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to offer my strong support for the \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. This \nlegislation removes legal barriers to electronic commerce by \nestablishing important legal standards for electronic contracts and \nsignatures.\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\n  With the passage of this important legislation, businesses will have \nthe legal certainty that they require and consumers will have the \nassurance of safety and security that they need. The measure represents \na balanced approach. It ensures that protections in the digital world \nequal those in the paper world.\n  Mr. President, E-commerce offers tremendous benefits for businesses \nand consumers in terms of efficiency, choice, convenience, and lower \ncosts. The measure will ensure the continued expansion of electronic \ncommerce, the roots and future of which lie in Virginia. It will take \nelectronic business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce to \nthe next level.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to praise the hard work, \ncommitment and diligence of Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan. He \nnavigated truly treacherous legislative and political waters to bring \nthis legislation to shore. Were it not for his steadfast guidance of \nthis legislation, there would be no E-Sign bill before us today. From \nthe outset, Senator Abraham had the vision and initiative to call to \nlife a law which will allow American consumers and businesses to do \ntransactions over the Internet with a greater confidence in their legal \nrights and responsibilities. And let me say this to my colleague, \nSenator Abraham, this bill is much like the Internet in that almost \ninstantaneously all kinds of people will come out of the woodwork to \nclaim credit for your great achievement. Savor it, because those of us \nwho worked by your side know well that the credit lies with you.\n  Throughout the conference I kept one goal in mind. We must make every \neffort to have a digital signature be equal to a paper signature both \nin the ease of use and in the eyes of the law. And while we did not \nfully succeed in that regard, this legislation is clearly a worthwhile \nstep in the right direction and I intend to support its passage.\n  Mr. President, let me take one more moment to express, generally, \nsome of my concerns about provisions that were added in the name of \nproviding greater consumer protection and which were outside of the \nscope of the bills passed in the House and the Senate. I fear that the \nlack of clarity of several terms and phrases which were added in the \nconference and which are strewn throughout the bill will create the \nopportunity for misunderstandings and lawsuits. Greater consultation \namong the conferees could have resolved these issues, because I know \nthat we all share the same hopes for the success of this legislation. I \nsincerely hope that my concerns about the use of these terms is \nmisplaced and that they will not come back to haunt us.\n  Finally, Mr. President, pursuant to the Government Paperwork \nElimination Act passed by the previous Congress, the Office of \nManagement and Budget has adopted regulations to permit individuals to \nobtain, submit and sign government forms electronically. These \nregulations direct Federal agencies to recognize that different \nsecurity approaches offer varying levels of assurance in an electronic \nenvironment and that deciding which to use in an application depends \nfirst upon finding a balance between the risks associated with the \nloss, misuse or compromise of the information, and the benefits, costs \nand effort associated with deploying and managing the increasingly \nsecure methods to mitigate those risks.\n  The OMB regulations recognize that among the various technical \napproaches, in an ascending level of assurance, are (1) ``shared \nsecrets'' methods (e.g., personal identification numbers or passwords), \n(2) digitized signatures or biometric means of identification, such as \nfingerprints, retinal patterns and voice recognition, and (3) \ncryptographic digital signatures, which provide the greatest assurance. \nCombinations of approaches (e.g., digital signatures with bio-metrics) \nare also possible and may provide even higher levels of assurance. The \ntechnical competence and experience of the service provider should be \nof paramount concern as we step into this brave new world. A positive \nfirst step in this regard is the General Services Administration's \ndevelopment of the ACES, or Access Certification for Electronic \nServices, Program for all federal agencies.\n  Mr. President, in developing this legislation, we recognized that \ncertain technologies are more secure than others and that consumers and \nbusinesses must, just as the government, select and weigh which \ntechnology is most appropriate for their particular needs taking into \naccount the importance of the transaction and its corresponding need \nfor assurance.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nconference report accompanying S. 761.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate has taken a momentous step \nin promoting and facilitating the growth of electronic commerce with \nthe passage of the conference report to S. 761--the Electronic \nSignatures in Global and National Commerce Act.\n  It was a long and difficult road to get to this point, following the \nbill's introduction in the Senate last March by my colleague and \nchampion of E-signatures, Senator Abraham. Many roadblocks had to be \novercome along the way. In the end, many compromises were agreed to. \nThis bill could have been done months ago; however, some wanted to make \nthis a partisan issue. I am personally very pleased though that the \nsustained efforts of Congress resulted in a conference report supported \nby a meaningful majority of conferees, and by a majority of the \nbusiness world.\n  S. 761 will establish legal certainty and validity for electronic \nsignatures and electronic records. When engaging in business online, \nconsumers and companies should feel secure and confident that their \ncontracts and agreements will be honored. This bill recognizes and \naddresses those real needs now,\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\nrather than waiting for all 50 States to adopt uniform laws. S. 761 \nwill provide the basic foundation, or the rules of the road, for the \nfuture of electronic commerce in America. It will foster the continued \nexpansion of electronic commerce. More importantly, it will empower \nconsumers to take part in a vibrant segment of our economy. It will \nafford consumers from all across America the real opportunity, if they \nso choose, to take advantage of electronic commerce. This, to me, is \nthe crux of this legislation. The ability of our citizens in all 50 \nStates to improve the quality of their lives. S. 761 provides that \nability.\n  Some have expressed concern that this measure places a higher \nstandard and unnecessary burdens on the on-line world than those in \neffect for the off-line world. I hope it does not. I believe a good-\nfaith effort was made to provide the flexibility necessary for those \nwith that great entrepreneurial spirit and imaginative ability to \nadvance the Internet and electronic commerce. If, over time, \nbureaucracy does indeed impede the bill's intent, I expect that \nCongress will again assume responsibility and take corrective action.\n  The participation of several Members of Congress was integral to this \nbill's enactment. They include the chairmen of both the House and \nSenate Commerce Committees, Chairman Bliley and Chairman McCain, \nChairman Gramm of the Senate Banking Committee, and Chairman Hatch of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. I extend my thanks to them and to all \nof the members of the conference for their attentiveness and commitment \nto this important issue.\n  I also want to take a few moments to express my special appreciation \nto my colleague and good friend, Senator Abraham. Senator Abraham \nrecognized early on the extreme importance of electronic signatures. It \nwas his initiative that led to the 105th Congress' enactment of the \nGovernment Paperwork Elimination Act, a significant first step toward \nthe eventual broad use and acceptance of electronic signatures. Senator \nAbraham's continued stewardship, vision, and tireless efforts have led \nto the next logical step of now affording secure and accessible \nopportunities in electronic commerce for the private sector and \nmillions of consumers. I believe no other Senator worked as hard on, or \nknows as much about, this issue as Senator Abraham. Without his hard \nwork, keen judgment, and persistence, I do not believe we would be \nvoting on this conference report today. Senator Abraham is to be \ncommended for his leadership in this area, and I look forward to \nworking with him on other important technology issues facing Congress.\n  It goes without saying that Congress could not operate without the \ndedicated efforts of staff. I want to identify those Senate staffers \nwho worked hard to prepare this legislation for consideration: Renee \nBennett, Moses Boyd, Jeanne Bumpus, Cesar Conda, Robert Cresanti, Makan \nDelrahim, Geoff Gray, Martin Gruenberg, Carole Grunberg, Dave Hoppe, \nJack Howard, Jim Hippe, Kevin Kolevar, Chase Hutto, Jim Hyland, Julie \nKatzman, Maureen McLaughlin, Paul Margie, Mike Rawson, Dena Ellis \nRochkind, Lisa Rosenberg and Jim Sartucci, as well as my former \nCongressional Fellow, Steven Apicella. I thank them all.\n  Electronic signatures is an innovative technology whose time has \ncome. S. 761 will remove barriers to their use in a timely and useful \nmanner. S. 761 will make it easier for millions of Americans to use \nelectronic commerce. S. 761 will help stimulate our nation's economy. \nAnd S. 761 will preserve America's leadership in the global \nmarketplace. I am proud that the 106th Congress has taken this action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle for their work on the legislation which has just passed. This \nis an extraordinarily important bill which will essentially open up \nopportunities in e-commerce that have previously not been existent for \nAmericans. It will be a tremendous incentive to our economy. I express \nto all my colleagues my appreciation for their hard work on the \nlegislation. It is a significant accomplishment for the Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take a few minutes this morning to \ntalk about an industry that is very important to the State of \nMinnesota, and that is our dairy industry.\n  June is National Dairy Month, and I come to the floor today to pay \ntribute to the family farmers who rise early every morning to supply \nfresh milk to our Nation. We as consumers assume there will always be \ndairy products in our grocery stores, without considering the hard work \nthat is a daily requirement to get them there.\n  I grew up on a dairy farm myself, and I can remember those early \nmorning milkings before going to school and again, of course, when I \ngot home. I don't take for granted the hard work required of dairy \nfarmers to make a living. Unfortunately, for Minnesota dairy producers, \nit is becoming harder\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\nand harder just to make a living. The dairy compact in New England, \nwhich sets a price floor for that region, is spurring overproduction \nthat is spilling over into the Midwest and is depressing the price \nreceived by Minnesota farmers.\n  Previously, I have come to the floor to address the false claims that \ndairy compacts somehow are necessary to ensure a consistent supply of \nmilk to certain areas of the country, and also the assertion that dairy \ncompacts save small family farms. Today, I want to turn to the claim \nthat the overproduction that results from dairy compacts does not \nimpact producers in noncompact regions of the country.\n  It is basic economics that if you want more of a particular commodity \nproduced, then you should subsidize its production. And it follows that \nif you want more milk produced, you set a floor price for it, and the \nvolume of production will predictably expand. This may initially sound \nsomewhat harmless, but the overproduction from dairy compact States has \nto go somewhere. It is currently going into noncompact markets for \nmilk, cheese, butter, and powder, and that is mainly the Midwest. Dairy \nproducers within the Northeast Compact currently receive a floor price \nof $16.94 per hundredweight for beverage milk, and you could never run \nenough ``Got Milk?'' commercials to increase beverage consumption in \nthe Northeast Compact region sufficient to offset the excess production \nthat results from this minimum price. So the consequence is that the \nexcess flows into the markets traditionally served by noncompact \nproducers--or, basically, dairy farmers in the Midwest--driving down \nthe prices that our dairy farmers receive because of the oversupply of \nmilk.\n  To provide some context, upper Midwest dairy farmers largely produce \nfor cheese markets. Approximately 86 percent of the milk produced in \nthe Midwest goes into the production of cheese. I come from a State \nthat has a comparatively small population and, thus, only a small \nportion of the milk produced by dairy farmers in Minnesota is consumed \nas a beverage. Our dairy farmers' livelihood depends on the income they \nreceive in the cheese markets. The current price they receive is being, \nagain, driven down, depressed by the influx of milk coming in from New \nEngland, again, because of the compact and the floor price for milk \nthere that results from an artificially high compact price.\n  Following implementation of the compact back in 1997, New England \nmilk production and milk powder production has increased rapidly in \nresponse to these higher prices--just, again, basic economics. New \nEngland milk production actually rose more than three times the rate of \ngrowth in production in the United States as a whole. So dairy farmers \nin New England were producing milk at a rate three times faster in \ngrowth than the rest of the country. This increased production in New \nEngland, combined with falling milk consumption in the region due to \nthe higher consumer prices--again, basic economics; you drive the price \nup, you get less purchases--set in place by the compact, again, \nresulted in regional surpluses that have been converted to milk powder.\n\n  In fact, in the first year of the compact, New England powder \nproduction soared by 43 percent, which accounted for most of the \nincrease in U.S. powder production during that year. The combination of \nincreased production and lower milk consumption in the compact States \ndue to higher prices, again, has created milk surpluses. That drives \ndown milk prices for farmers outside of the New England compact. So it \nis directly hurting farmers in the Midwest. It also floods national \nmarkets with nonbeverage dairy products that compete with dairy \nproducts produced outside of the compact region.\n  A January 1999 University of Missouri study found that higher milk \nproduction and less milk consumption in an expanded Northeast Dairy \nCompact and a new Southern Compact would cost farmers outside of those \ncompact States a minimum of $310 million a year. So the dairy farmers \nwho are having a hard time making a living right now would find their \nmilk checks down $310 million a year.\n  A May 1999 University of Wisconsin study found that the cost to \nfarmers outside of the Northeast and proposed Southern Compact States \nwould be at least $340 million a year. Again, these are tough times for \nMinnesota dairy farmers, and they cannot afford to lose that kind of \nincome over and above what the compact States are already taking away \nfrom them. As I have said before, compacts are a zero-sum game, and all \nthe income benefits that the large producers in New England derive come \nout of the pockets of consumers--low-income consumers, of course, are \nhit the hardest--and also producers in the noncompact regions. The \nmailbox price--actual income farmers get for their milk--was $1.87 per \nhundredweight higher in December of 1999 in the compact region than in \nMinnesota.\n  The expansion of the compacts to the southern region of the country \nwould put the cartels in half of the States, exponentially magnifying \nwhat happened in New England, making the problem worse than what it is \ntoday. New England has only 3 percent of the U.S. milk production, and \nthe proposed Northeast and Southern Compacts would cover nearly 40 \npercent of U.S. milk production. The thought of how this unprecedented \nexpansion of the cartel would affect producers in my State and how it \nwould affect the prices consumers pay only increases my resolve to \nfight compact expansion and work for revocation of the current compact. \nIt would be a tremendous cost to taxpayers in the form of higher costs \nfor school lunch programs and other food nutrition programs. It could \nalso lead to higher Government storage costs and maybe even another \nround of a dairy buyout program--a cost that could run into the \nmillions, if not billions, of dollars.\n  If you are concerned about returning some sanity to our dairy \nmarkets, then I ask you to join me as a cosponsor of the Dairy Fairness \nAct, S. 916, which repeals the Northeast Dairy Compact. Compact \nsupporters can't win in an honest debate on the floor, so we are \ncontinually subjected to the end-of-the-session arm-twisting going on \nin conferences to keep this cartel alive. That is how the compact got \nstarted in the first place, when the 1996 farm bill was held hostage in \ncommittee until the compact was added.\n  We need to work for a national dairy policy that is fair to all \nproducers, not one that artificially expands production in one portion \nof the country, which directly impacts the price received in other \nareas of the country. Again, the notion that compacts don't adversely \nimpact producers outside the region is another dairy myth that must be \nput to rest if our country is to move toward a national dairy policy, \nagain, that is fair to all producers.\n  As we celebrate National Dairy Month, I hope Congress will gain new \nresolve to create a dairy policy that is not based on ``robbing Peter \nto pay Paul,'' which is what is done when you cut through the rhetoric. \nIt is the fundamental principle undergirding the concept of dairy \ncompacts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5291-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5291-S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to alert my \ncolleagues of the growing concern that we all have relative to climate \nchange and the developing technology associated with that change.\n  This week the U.S. Global Change Research Program issued a revealing \nand rather startling new report on the consequences of climate change. \nThis report affects a number of things. But the most significant \nportion of the report is the estimated effects of climate change on \nvarious regions of the country and various sectors of our economy. It \nis very important--agriculture, water resources, and so forth.\n  At the heart of this report are some ``potential scenarios'' of \nclimate change over the next 100 years predicted by two climate models: \nComputers models that were state of the art 3 years ago when the report \nbegan. These ``scenarios'' of climate change were then used to drive \nother models for vegetation, river flow, and agriculture. Each of these \nmodels had its own set of assumptions and limitations. The end result \nwas a 600-page report that paints a rather grim picture of 21st century \nclimate predictions.\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\n  Some in the environmental community in favor of the Kyoto Protocol \nare now using this report and shouting from the rooftops. They think \nthis study means we should go forward with drastic measures to limit \ngreenhouse gases.\n  But I want to caution my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric and \nto look to the science that underlies this assessment. What they are \ngoing to find is rather startling. The realization factually is that we \nare only just now beginning to conduct the kind of scientific research \nthat will allow us to determine impacts of climate change.\n  My point is obvious. These models were based on technology 3 years \nago. Technologies change. Interpretations change. But the basis for the \nevaluation and generalization is based on old information.\n  For example, a reasonable test of a climate model is whether or not \nit actually and accurately stimulates today's climate. The fact is that \nit doesn't. We found from the National Assessment's own science web \nsite a comparison of rainfall predicted by two climate models that \nmeasure actual rainfall. The area reflects twice what the model \npredicts. More than twice as much rainfall is actually observed as \nopposed to what the model suggests.\n  The emotional concern is coming from the model. Where you actually \nget 10 inches of rain, the model predicts that you actually get 20 \ninches, or more. Similarly, in the areas where the model predicts less \nthan half as much rainfall as is actually observed, you actually get 10 \ninches of rain. The model predicts that you would get 5, or less.\n  So the model is absolutely under question and under scrutiny and \ndoesn't represent reality.\n  The amount of rain or snow falling within a river basin determines \nthe river flow. We all know that determines the amount of water for \nirrigation of crops, the health of fish species, the generation of \nhydroelectric power, and the water available for human use.\n  Depending on what the climate models say, you can imagine some very \ndifferent impacts because the models are off by 50 or 100 percent in \neither direction. You can see it is going to change. The estimate of \nimpacts from climate change on these sensitive areas could also change.\n  Even with all of this, the assessment has been a very useful exercise \nbecause it shows the difficulty of estimating regional impacts of \nclimate change. It highlights the need for additional scientific \nresearch; namely, improved climate models; and it reminds us of the \npotential risk of climate change.\n\n  For just a moment I want to shift the talk about how our energy \npolicy will determine future emissions of greenhouse gases. As you \nmight imagine, further emissions will be extremely sensitive in the \nenergy choices we make. We now have an excellent opportunity to address \nour environmental concerns at the same time that we address our growing \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Yesterday, we conducted a hearing on the Republican energy strategy \nin S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act of 2000. It includes a \nbalanced portfolio of energy options that, amazingly enough, would \nproduce fewer greenhouse gases than the current administration plan. \nLet me repeat that. This legislation contains a methodology to generate \nfewer greenhouse gases than the administration's current energy plan. \nThat is not surprising because the administration's plan would increase \nour dependence on foreign oil to nearly 66 percent by the year 2020.\n  We would advocate increased use of natural gas for a wide range of \nenergy needs. We also provide tax incentives for renewables, such as \nwind and biomass, and make the relicensing process for nuclear and \nhydro power plants much easier. But to achieve these goals, we will \nneed some changes in the existing energy policies.\n  We need incentives to increase domestic production of oil and gas, \nparticularly on Federal lands where this administration has simply \nrefused to allow oil and gas exploration. About 64 percent of the \noverthrust belt has been determined to be over limits.\n  In my State of Alaska, where you are very likely to have a large \ndiscovery in a small sliver of the Arctic, about 1.5 million acres out \nof 19 million acres has been put off limits.\n  We need incentives and R funds to develop and promote clean fossil \nfuel technology.\n  We need to use more natural gas for end-use appliances and \ndistributed generation of electricity through fuel cells and \nmicroturbines in homes and businesses.\n  We need to eliminate barriers to our best sources of nonemitting \npower generation; namely, nuclear and hydro.\n  And we need to encourage and support renewable energy technologies.\n  Based on some simple calculations by my Energy and Natural Resource \nCommittee staff, we estimate that such a balanced energy plan could \nreduce our emissions by 11 percent, compared to the administration's \nplan, by the year 2020. We could do this without economic cost and \nwithout sacrificing our quality of life or our competitive situation \nwith little economic pain.\n  Our staff is working to refine these calculations further. But the \ndetails really do not matter much. Simply put, if we use more nuclear, \nmore hydro, and more natural gas, we emit fewer greenhouse gases and we \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil in the year 2020 from 68 percent, \nas projected under the administration's plan, to less than 50 percent \nunder the Republican plan. Clearly, that is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  With further R funding for climate-friendly energy technology, such \nas that proposed in our climate change bill, S. 882, we can do better. \nA balanced energy portfolio simply makes good sense for our economy, \nfor our environment, and for our national security. We have proposed \nlegislation that will take us there.\n  Let me close by noting that it seems ironic this administration has \nwasted no opportunity to talk about the dire predictions of climate \nchange. Yet the Republican energy plan offers a cleaner, more secure \nenergy future.\n\n  The risk of human-induced climate change is a risk we should \nresponsibly address. We should address it based on sound science, and \nnot emotion, as is often the case around here. A balanced, technology-\ndriven energy strategy offers the means to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on June 12, the administration's National \nAssessment Coordinating Office, established under the authority of the \nOffice of the President, released the first National Assessment on \nClimate Change. This report entitled ``Climate Change Impacts on the \nUnited States,'' is a political document. It is not a mainstream \nscience document. It has not been peer-reviewed.\n  The National Assessment attempts to predict in detail climate changes \nregion-by-region within the United States over 100 years. Yes, region \nby region for 100 years. The charade of this effort is criticized by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's web page. This morning I checked \nthe EPA's web page for its comments on computer climate model. It \nstates:\n\n       Virtually all published estimates of how climate could \n     change in the United States are the result of computer \n     models. . . . These complicated models . . . are still not \n     accurate enough to provide reliable forecasts on how the \n     climate may change; and the several models often yield \n     contradictory results . . . Scientists are unable to say \n     whether particular regions will receive more or less \n     rainfall; and for many regions they are unable to even state \n     whether a wetter or drier climate is more likely.\n\n  This is from this morning's web page.\n  The National Assessment does not highlight the large amount of \nuncertainty in long-term climate forecasting. It was released in draft \nform even though two of the five sectoral studies are incomplete and \nstill out in draft form for comment. The regional studies--which the \nEPA itself has warned are impossible to honestly conclude--are also \nincomplete. One might suspect that the priority was placed on releasing \nthe report for a political time-table rather than for a scientific \ntime-table.\n  It uses two foreign computer models: The Canadian Centre model and \nBritain's ``Hadley Centre'' model. These are considered among the most \nextreme of all climate models available.\n  As mentioned in an opinion piece Wednesday, June 14 in the New York \nTimes entitled ``Warming Earth, Heated Rhetoric'' by Gregg Easterbrook, \nsenior editor of The New Republic:\n\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\n\n       One [model] predicts a catastrophic drought that kills off \n     all trees in the American Southeast; the other forecasts \n     increased rainfall and forest expansion in the Southeast.\n\n  One of the country's most respected climate scientists, Dr. John \nChristy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville has also been \ncritical. Dr. Christy is the country's premier specialist on satellite \nmeasurements of atmospheric temperatures.\n  In a June 9 Associated Press story, Dr. Christy commented on a pre-\nrelease version of the National Assessment he had obtained. He stated,\n\n       I read the Executive Summary and the following sections \n     through page 9--``Looking at America's Climate.'' I stopped \n     at that point thinking, ``This must be some kind of joke.'' \n     It seemed to me that this document was written by a committee \n     of Greenpeace, Ted Turner, Al Gore and Stephen King.\n       I saw no attempt at scientific objectivity. This document \n     is an evangelistic statement about a coming apocalypse, not a \n     scientific statement about the evolution of a complicated \n     system with significant uncertainties. As it is, the document \n     will be easily dismissed by anyone with access to information \n     about the uncertainties of the issue.\n\n  The National Assessment declares that there is a direct connection \nbetween increased global temperatures and increases in man-made \ngreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. While there are many \ndisagreements in the scientific community, there is a consensus that it \nis impossible to make that connection.\n  Has the world been warming? Yes, the world has been warming for \n11,000 years, since the end of the last major ice age. In the last 100 \nyears, global temperatures have increased by about one degree.\n  Is this warming due to man-made greenhouse gas emissions? Let me \nquote from Dr. Marsh, a researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory, \nNew York Times, Sept. 8, 1999:\n\n       Carbon dioxide is a minor greenhouse gas that contributes \n     only about 3% of the greenhouse effect, and man-made sources \n     represent some 3% to 4% of carbon dioxide emissions, the rest \n     being from natural sources.\n       The major greenhouse gas is water vapor. . . . if all the \n     carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to vanish magically, it \n     would lead to a one degree centigrade decrease in global \n     temperatures.\n\n  These are the comments of a researcher at a U.S. Government national \nlaboratory.\n  Even the possible current moderate warming is not well understood. \nGround temperatures have risen slightly in the past two decades. But \nmore accurate--and truly global--satellite temperature measurements \nhave shown no warming in the 20 years those measurements have been \navailable. In fact, they have shown a slight cooling.\n  Is there fluctuation in the climate? Of course. Ice cores sampling \nhas shown wide fluctuations in the global climate long before the \nemergency of man, much less the industrial age. Are current \nfluctuations man made? The simple answer is that we do not know.\n  What do we know and what do we need to do to do more? We need more \nscientific research, honest scientific research. We need more \ntechnological development. We need to involve both the private and \npublic sectors in working on this issue.\n  Senator Murkowski, Senator Craig, Senator Byrd, and I have all \nintroduced legislation that would do exactly that. But most of all, we \nneed to restore a bipartisan, commonsense, science-based, market-driven \napproach to this important issue. We do not need more precooked \npolitical nonsense, political tracts, masquerading as unbiased science.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, earlier this week the Administration \nreleased, with much media fanfare, a draft document known as the \nclimate change ``National Assessment'' that purports to assess ``the \npotential consequences of climate variability and change'' in the \nUnited States. I have received several media requests for comments on \nthis document.\n  The document is of considerable length, Mr. President--approximately \n600 pages. Frankly, because of its length and the short time I've had \nto review it, I have been able to give it only a quick review.\n  My preliminary conclusion is that the National Assessment could \nprovide a useful contribution to the climate change debate if it \nstimulates more serious national interest in advancing climate science.\n  What is clear to me, even after only a quick read, is that the \nNational Assessment was produced in a style and method that is somewhat \nakin to writing good science fiction. The authors begin with a few \nbaseline assumption, then apply a vivid imagination to extrapolate \noutcomes based on those assumptions.\n  The literary application of science concepts makes the story \nintriguing to read, especially for readers with a scientific bent.\n  But the National Assessment is not the only current document that \ntalks about climate change science. The ``Pathways Report'' published \nlast Fall by the National Research Council of the National Academy of \nSciences, is also a stimulating read. But it takes an entirely \ndifferent approach.\n  One way you can tell that the National Assessment and Pathways Report \nare different in style is from the selection of punctuation. The \nNational Assessment uses lots of exclamation points. Perhaps, that is \none of the reasons why this document has gotten pretty good media \nattention already. The Pathways Report uses mostly question marks.\n  The National Assessment takes a single, linear approach to the \nclimate change question. It simply extrapolates continued worldwide \ngrowth in carbon dioxide emissions throughout the 21st century, and \nassumes that growth will correlate to steadily rising temperatures \naround the world. The implications of those increases in temperature \nand carbon dioxide concentrations supply the creative images that the \nNational Assessment's authors offer up.\n  The Pathways Report is dry by comparison. It is short on creative \nliterature and long on technical issue framing--not particularly \nsuitable for catchy media headlines, which may explain why many \nnewspapers showed little interest in its existence or import.\n  But its critical and thorough scientific analysis of the current \nstates of our climate change knowledge is what makes the Pathways \nReport so important to policy makers.\n  Now, if you are like me and you find out that America's National \nResearch Council has just published the most comprehensive report in \nhistory on the state of climate science--you don't want to read all 550 \npages! You want to cut to the chase and read the report's bottom line \nconclusion! And the last thing you want is a report that provides more \nquestions than answers.\n  But the Pathways Report authors are brutally honest. To best explain \nthe current state of climate science they had no choice but to lay out \na whole series of potentially show-stopping questions. Now, none of \nthese questions asks ``Is global warming for real?'' No, in fact, once \nyou begin to ponder the Pathway questions you realize that the climate \nchange issue cannot be resolved with any simple thumbs up or thumbs \ndown.\n  Here are some of the scientific questions that the Pathways Report \nfocuses on:\n  How much do we know about the earth's capacity to assimilate natural \nand man-made greenhouse gas emissions? Do we need to learn more? What, \nin particular, do we know about the oceans' capacity to absorb carbon \ndioxide? How much of this absorption occurs naturally? What can be done \nto increase ocean assimilation of carbon dioxide?\n  And these are just the opening round of questions.\n  What is the effect of the oceans on our climate? What is the state of \nour understanding of ocean cycles and of other changes in ocean \ntemperature and salinity, and of how those changes, in turn, affect \nclimate? How do we evaluate the natural variability of the climate, \nincluding such phenomena as El Nino and the North Atlantic oscillation? \nCan we improve our understanding here?\n  Mr. President, let me stop for a moment and reflect on a recent trip \nI made to Woods Hole, Massachusetts with the Senator from New \nHampshire, Bob Smith, and our colleague from Rhode Island, Lincoln \nChafee. We spent a day at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute \nexploring these questions with over 30 scientists. It was a real eye-\nopening experience.\n  Dr. Berrrien Moore, who coordinated the publication of the Pathways \nReport, helped lead a discussion on where\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nscience and public policy intersect. Dr. Bob Weller and Dr. Ray Schmitt \nalong with several other prominent ocean scientists of the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institute, gave us progress reports and fascinating \nexplanations of their work and its relevance to climate science.\n  For example, Mr. President, did you realize that for each one degree \nchange in the temperature of just the top three meters of ocean water, \nthere is a corresponding one degree change in the temperature of the \natmosphere above the surface of that water all the way to outer space? \nDid you know, Mr. President, that 80 percent or more of our climate \nvariation is influenced by the oceans?\n  Two themes came through clearly in those discussions, Mr. President:\n  There are significant gaps in scientific understanding of the way \noceans and the atmosphere interact to affect climate; and\n  Scientists need more data, especially from the oceans to better \nunderstand and predict possible changes.\n  Mr. President, it was humbling to get a glimpse of how much we don't \nknow.\n  Now let me continue with the rest of the questions the Pathways \nReport urges us to consider.\n  How accurately can we predict climate trends whose recurrences are \nmeasured in years? In decades? In centuries? In millennia? Are we \ncapable of plotting the effects, and counter effects, of these \ncomplexly interwoven trends on each other? Do we even have the \ncapability to observe these trends and counter-trends accurately? Do we \nhave the computational ability to integrate all these trends and \ncounter trends into one big equation?\n  How much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere emanates from the oceans? \nDoes this amount vary from place to place and time to time? Does such \nvariation matter?\n  Those are just some of the questions that we policymakers cannot \nanswer ourselves. But we need answers--and to get them, we will have to \nsupport the scientists on a more serious level than we have to date.\n  But there are more questions, Mr. President. These next ones we \nshould be thinking about ourselves and discussing with scientists and \nwith all of our concerned constituents.\n  Should U.S. policymaking on climate change rely primarily upon \nclimate modeling performed by others outside the U.S.? Or should the \nU.S. have the capability to marshal data and scientific conclusions \nindependent of foreign countries who may or may not share our domestic \npolicy concerns?\n  Again, Mr. President, let me pause for a moment and refer to the \nrecent National Research Council's Climate Research Committee's report \nentitled ``Capacity of U.S. Climate Modeling to Support Climate Change \nAssessment Activities.''\n  First, let me thank Dr. Maurice Blackmon from the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research, for his patience with me and my staff. He has \nhelped us have a balanced appreciation for these issues. That report \nprovides valuable guidance on this subject. On page 5 of that report, \nthe NRC's Climate Research Committee states:\n\n       Although collaboration and free and open information and \n     data exchange with foreign modeling centers are critical, it \n     is inappropriate for the United States to rely heavily upon \n     foreign centers to provide high-end modeling capabilities. \n     There are a number of reasons for this including the \n     following:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       2. Decisions that might substantially affect the U.S. \n     economy might be made based upon . . . simulations . . . \n     produced by countries with different priorities than those of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, the National Assessment depended on the use of foreign \ncomputer models only. The authors of that document are completely up-\nfront about that fact, and I commend them for their honesty. However, \nfor the reasons contained in the NRC's modeling report, I am \nuncomfortable relying on the conclusions in the National Assessment.\n  The pace of science is dynamic and unpredictable. For example, just \nlast month Science magazine reported on some intriguing experiments \nundertaken in the Indian Ocean. Those experiments raised the prospect \nthat certain assumptions about aerosols incorporated in the Canadian \nand British climate models that underlie the National Assessment were \nfundamentally flawed. This means that the warming predictions from even \nthese models are probably way too high.\n  Dr. Neal Lane, a White House spokesman, acknowledged this at Senator \nMcCain's hearing on May 17 and feels it may be several years before \nthis can be resolved. Unfortunately, the National Assessment's vivid \nscenarios were sent to the printer before this new discovery became \npublic.\n  This seems to give us as policymakers only two choices: Either \ndisregard the National Assessment and all the hard work that went into \nit, or re-do it with the assumptions corrected, this time using U.S. \nmodels.\n  Mr. President, when we make tough, historic policy decisions around \nhere on everything from multilateral defense strategies, to global \ntrade, to international farm output, we use our own intelligence and \nanalysis, we don't simply rely on the technical work of other countries \nwhich may not see the world through the American prism.\n  With continued regard to America's climate modeling capability, Mr. \nPresident, I must ask--What are our national objectives? Do we have a \nnational strategy in place to achieve those objectives? Is the strategy \nintegrated and coordinated across all relevant agenices? Are NASA and \nDOE and NOAA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, all \nbuilding the same model using a common blueprint?\n  Do we have adequate computational resources to fully exploit our \nevolving modeling capability? Do we have enough human talent dedicated \nto these tasks?\n  What is our confidence level in the integrity of all observational \ndata used to validate climate models? Are our measurements ``close \nenough for government work''?\n  How can we be sure that the scientists are even measuring the right \nclimate variables? Are there any important climate variables that are \ninadequately measured, or not measured at all?\n  Do we build climate observing requirements into existing, ongoing \noperational programs? At sea? In the atmosphere? In space? Should we do \nmore? How many ships at sea are measuring water temperature and \nsalinity? How many weather balloons and satellites are measuring and \ntransmitting data?\n  Oceanographers I've visited tell me that they don't know the \ntemperature or salinity of the ocean in most spots around the world \ntoday, much less ten or a hundred or a thousand years ago.\n  Do we need a discretely funded activity for the development and \nimplementation of climate-specific observational programs? Where are we \non the technology to monitor relevant national and global data? Is it \ndeveloped? Is it fully deployed? Will other countries fully support \nthis?\n  Have we assessed the capability and potential of U.S. and North \nAmerican carbon sequestration, includng carbon sequestration through \ncrops, forests, soils, oceans, and wetlands?\n  How do we ensure that the science that informs U.S. policy making is \nobjective and complete? Do scientists have unfettered access to each \nother's completed work, especially when that work is funded by the \ngovernment? Is the process of peer review adequate to assure all \nviewpoints are examined?\n  Regardless of politics, we in Congress share one tough job with our \nfriends at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Science must drive \npolicy and not vice versa. I don't know how else to make sure that \nhappens other than to guarantee that the science gets put out on the \ntable and is subject to public discussion and public scrutiny.\n  The American people have never been afraid of the truth. We'll deal \nwith that. What we can't hack is being kept in the dark or being lied \nto by our own government.\n  The National Research Council's Pathways and Climate Modeling Reports \nraise some profoundly important questions. Our best policy decisions \ncould turn on the answers to any of them. We owe to our constituents \nand to future generations to seek answers and not hide from whatever \nturns up.\n  The United States with its abundant resources, technological \nsuperiority, and economic power is in a unique position to provide \nleadership in scientific research that can lead to a more complete \nunderstanding of the natural and human influences currently at work in \nour oceans and atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\n  What is needed, Mr. President, is a national commitment embodied in a \ngovernment framework that provides a ``blue print'' for responsible \naction based on consensus. Chairman Murkowski and I have been working \non that legislative ``blue print.''\n  Taken together, our bills provide that ``blue print'' for consensus. \nWhile S. 882, Chairman Murkowski's bill, appropriately focuses on our \nnation's enormous technological abilities, S. 1776, the bill I \nintroduced last October constructs a complementary framework that \nensures:\n  A critical analysis, evaluation, and integration of all scientific, \ntechnological, and economic facts;\n  A ``blue print'' for coordinated action that is both practical and \nconscientious so that the government will not neglect an issue or back \nus into less than optimum policy choices;\n  The advancement of climate science by integrating and focusing it on \ncore questions;\n  Immediate actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ways we \nwill appreciate;\n  The encouragement of technology development;\n  No unnecessary burdens on citizens that can be caused by the \ngovernment prematurely picking winners and losers; and\n  Process for consensus for future government actions.\n  Without consensus, Mr. President, our nation will languish in \npolitical stalemate, causing us to fall behind other nations in key \ntechnological areas.\n  Some insist that we sharply reduce our reliance on carbon as an \nenergy source. Again, cost impact estimates vary widely--from little \neconomic impact to belief that such action will mortally wound our \neconomy. Yet, there has been no serious effort to systematically and \ncritically analyze this issue by our government.\n  The National Assessment does not provide it. S. 1776 does.\n  Another area of concern expressed in National Research Council \nReports, and mentioned prominently in recent NAS testimony before the \nSenate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is the lack of \ngovernmental structure with the primary mission of coordinating climate \nprograms.\n  S. 1776 directly addresses this concern by providing a structure for \ncoordination of all government action on climate change.\n  This is merely one approach to this very complicated problem. We in \nCongress need feedback from experienced leaders in science, economics, \nand government to help us design the optimum structure for coordinating \nclimate change policy.\n  It has been ten years, Mr. President, since Congress enacted the \nGlobal Change Research Act of 1990. We have learned much since then. \nMuch of the sensation generated by the National Assessment, stems from \nthe vivid worst case scenarios described in that document.\n  Let's not be provoked into rash action by these scenarios. Even the \nco-chairman of the National Assessment, cautions that:\n\n       We're not making a specific prediction about what the \n     future will be like. It would be farcical to try to do that.\n\n  Indeed, the National Research Council recently testified before the \nSenate that the ``jury is still out'' on whether Human influence is \neven a significant factor in climate change.\n  Instead, let's roll up our sleeves and pursue the more methodical \napproach:\n  Answer the core science questions;\n  Pursue the economic analyses;\n  Take immediate, risk-free actions that reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  The NRC, based on its study of the successes and failures of the U.S. \nGlobal Climate Research Program established by the 1990 act, has \nprovided Congress with excellent recommendations and pathways for \nfuture action. It would be irresponsible to ignore them.\n  Moreover, it has also been almost 8 years since the Senate ratified \nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. We cannot, nor \nshould we, roll back our ratification of the Framework Convention. \nInstead, we should ensure that the United States is thoroughly and \nconscientiously responding to the Framework Convention commitments. Our \n``blue print'' does precisely that.\n  For example, the Framework Convention says take flexible action now. \nSo does S. 1776. The Framework Convention says explore and integrate \nthe science. So does S. 1776. The Framework Convention says climate \nchange measures must be cost-effective. Every measure in S. 1776 stands \non its own two feet.\n  The Framework Convention says steps to mitigate climate change are \neffective if based on relevant science, technology, and economics, and \ncontinually evaluated. S. 1776 spells out how U.S. policy will--by \nlaw--be based on a combination of science, technology, and economics . \n. . and the President must reevaluate each of these factors each year.\n  Mr. President, our legislation provides a framework for national \nconsensus. Stalemate on the climate change issue should no longer be \ntolerated. We have the vehicle to move forward. We should do so \nexpeditiously, and with the constructive support of the administration.\n  I anxiously await the response to my April 3rd letter to the Chairman \nof the White House Climate Change Task Force, where I described how we \ncould get there. I ask unanimous consent that the April 3rd letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.\n     Roger S. Ballentine,\n     Chairman, White House Climate Change Task Force, The White \n         House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ballentine: Thank you for your recent letter \n     commenting on the two separate pieces of legislation that my \n     friend and colleague, Senator Murkowski and I have introduced \n     on the subject of climate change. Senator Murkowski and I \n     have been working together on this legislation for a year \n     now. We are both sponsors of both bills. I welcome the \n     opening you give us to work with the Administration as well.\n       Your letter was particularly helpful for two reasons. \n     First, it helped me appreciate how much the Administration \n     agrees with us. Secondly, it gives me a chance to clarify how \n     portions of S. 1776 work to complement, not contradict (as \n     your letter implies), so much of what the Administration is \n     already doing.\n       First, we agree (and see that we agree) on, in your words, \n     ``emphasis on promoting the research, development and \n     diffusion of technologies to reduce or sequester the \n     greenhouse gases. . . .'' Secondly, we both want to ``improve \n     voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.''\n       Now let's turn to the many additional points on which we \n     agree, even though your letter reflects a few gaps in \n     appreciating that agreement. Along those lines, you urge that \n     it be made clear that our legislation is not ``intended as a \n     substitute for more comprehensive action.'' Thank you for the \n     opportunity to reassure the Administration that it is not. \n     Here is that reassurance in detail.\n       To begin, you listed nine bulleted Administration \n     initiatives, repeating in each instance that our legislation \n     ``is no substitute for'' those Administrative initiatives. I \n     agree. Neither S. 1776 nor S. 1777 (my companion tax \n     incentive bill), is, nor is intended to be, a substitute for \n     any of the nine initiatives. If I had intended to substitute \n     my legislation for any of the nine, you would see provisions \n     in my legislation repealing or preempting those initiatives \n     that I meant to substitute with mine. You do not, because I \n     did not set out to do so. Let's take a closer look at each of \n     those nine bullets to help you appreciate how close we are:\n     1. Ongoing federal efforts to accelerate the research, \n         development, and deployment of efficient technologies and \n         renewable energy--\n       My bills only enhance those ongoing efforts. With regard to \n     federally funded R, we provide for some extra quality \n     assurance by calling for periodic independent critical \n     evaluations of ongoing projects so Congress and the Executive \n     Branch can be confident that deployment of finite R and \n     demonstration resources is current, optimum, and fully \n     accountable to the taxpayers.\n     2. The President's proposed package of tax incentives--\n       Nothing in my tax incentive bill, S. 1777, contradicts \n     anything in the President's package. My proposal to \n     permanently extend the R tax credit for projects addressing \n     climate change, and my provision providing a graduated scale \n     of tax credits for achieving increasingly challenging energy \n     efficiency benchmarks over a series of time periods would \n     complement the President's ideas in the short-term and long-\n     term.\n       Further, I call on Treasury and Energy to collaborate on a \n     set of meaningful tax incentives to directly spur voluntary \n     actions by ordinary citizens, and indirectly by entities that \n     are tax exempt such as municipal power agencies, \n     universities, and others.\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\n     3. The President's proposal to spur development of bioenergy \n         and bioproducts that can benefit farmers and rural areas, \n         reduce reliance on foreign oil, cut air pollution, and \n         reduce greenhouse gas emissions--\n       This program first surfaced, of course, in an article by \n     Senator Dick Lugar in Foreign Affairs magazine over a year \n     ago. It is embodied in his bill which recently passed the \n     Senate without dissent. Actually, in the early drafting \n     stages I contemplated adding the text of the Lugar \n     legislation to my bill, but did not do so out of deference to \n     Senator Lugar whose strategy was to move his bill separately. \n     Instead, in public speeches leading up to its approval by the \n     full Senate I helped promote his legislation as a stand-alone \n     proposition. Let's both hope that the House takes it up \n     quickly and sends it to the President for enactment!\n     4. An initiative to encourage open competitive markets and \n         promote the export of American clean energy technologies \n         into the multi-billion dollar market of developing \n         transition countries around the world--\n       Again, we are in harmony. My bill takes the \n     Administration's proposal a few steps further with an entire \n     title on technology transfer. Projects that replace older \n     machinery in other countries with more advanced energy-\n     efficient technologies will qualify for a suite of export \n     incentives. These will undoubtedly be deployed in developing \n     countries because the bill is crafted in a way to target \n     these projects where local hosts do not have the economic \n     clout to finance them on their own.\n     5. The ongoing Vision 21 Power Plant program to develop coal-\n         fired power plants that would be about twice as efficient \n         as current plants--\n       My approach to achieve this objective is by way of tax \n     incentive. S. 1777 spurs continuing efficiency breakthroughs \n     by offering incentives to reach increasingly challenging \n     efficiency benchmarks--achievable in the short-term, \n     improving in the long-term.\n     6. Nuclear energy plant optimization--advanced technologies \n         that can help ensure the longer term reliability and \n         efficiency of existing nuclear power plants--\n       While my bills do not specify nuclear power projects for \n     short- or long-term promotion, I am confident that nuclear \n     power will benefit from my legislation. First, the current \n     and future Presidents are called upon to recommend to \n     Congress legislation to respond to climate change. Any \n     comprehensive execution of this provision would have to \n     address the role of nuclear power. However, if a President \n     should overlook nuclear in the mandated report and \n     recommendation to Congress, I offer a back-up. My bill also \n     includes a statutory requirement for the General Accounting \n     Office to identify statutory or administrative barriers to \n     reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If any exist with regard \n     to nuclear power, I would expect GAO to find them and \n     highlight them, along with all others.\n       I considered folding into S. 1776 the most important step \n     toward securing long-term reliability of nuclear power's \n     contribution, namely, nuclear waste legislation. I did not do \n     so because of the President's repeated vetoes. My goal from \n     the beginning remains unchanged: to find consensus, not \n     division, on climate change.\n       On a separate complementary track, as a member of the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee I have strongly supported \n     DOE's Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program and Nuclear \n     Energy Research Initiative.\n     7. Law to give businesses protection against being penalized \n         down the road when they take real, tangible actions today \n         to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions--\n       Unlike some other proposals, my legislation actually \n     accomplishes this in hard currency immediately when such \n     actions are taken. My tax incentives, all of which are \n     available for the year in which the qualifying investments \n     are made, are all predicated on reporting the reductions \n     achieved by those investments under Section 1605(b) of EPAct, \n     as amended by S. 1776.\n     8. Help states and local communities undertake efforts to \n         encourage innovation and reduce greenhouse gases--\n       With the same stated purpose, but in contrast to the Clean \n     Air Partnership Fund's top-down approach, S. 1776 explicitly \n     preserves state-initiated climate change responses by \n     protecting them from future federal preemption. It works \n     as follows. If a state has a program that has as one of \n     its effects the reduction (or sequestration) of greenhouse \n     gas emissions, it remains in effect despite future federal \n     enactments to the contrary. The only exception: when a \n     future Congress recites in future legislation the specific \n     section number in my bill as either (1) being repealed \n     outright, or (2) as not applying to the specific state \n     program. I have been assured that this provision passes \n     Constitutional muster. I am confident that future \n     Congresses will look long and hard before deliberately and \n     conspicuously tampering with states' rights and climate \n     change programs.\n     9. Diplomatic effort to complete the unfinished business of \n         the Kyoto Protocol--\n       While our perspectives on this bullet in your letter to me \n     do not match, my legislation is silent on the subject. Again, \n     this is because my primary objective was to explore policies \n     on which consensus with the President and others is possible. \n     Let's not let our differing perspectives get in the way of \n     policies we can and do agree on.\n       However, as an aside, I do believe that both an \n     international and domestic consensus on Kyoto is achievable \n     and, in fact, emerging. As months and years pass since Vice \n     President Gore personally negotiated its terms and the \n     President signed it, several governments have distanced \n     themselves from--or, in Norway's case--impaled itself on \n     Kyoto. A sure way to resolve the issue once and for all here \n     in the United States is for the President to submit the \n     Treaty for Senate ratification. Sweeping in scope as my \n     legislation is, however, treaty ratification would not be \n     germane to my bill.\n       Finally, in the same spirit of sharpening our mutual \n     understanding, let's focus on an area where you seem to see \n     even more agreement between us than I do. Interpreting our \n     legislation as reflecting ``a shift in the terms of the \n     debate from whether there is a problem to what actions we can \n     take to address it,'' you take it one step further by quoting \n     Texaco: ``protracted debate about the adequacy of the science \n     is something [we need] to move beyond.''\n       On the question of the adequacy of the science, I side with \n     the National Research Council of the National Academy of \n     Sciences. In the March 30, 2000 hearing before the Senate \n     Energy Committee, Dr. Elbert W. (Joe) Friday, speaking for \n     the National Academy, stated plainly: ``the jury is still \n     out.'' What portion of the warming signal is attributable to \n     anthropogenic effects and what to natural variability he \n     declined to speculate on, except to explicitly refuse to say \n     that Mankind's contribution is primary. Nor did he, speaking \n     on behalf of the science community, indicate that any \n     proposed suite of climate change response policies would \n     appreciably alter global temperature trends. Instead, he \n     focused the Committee's attention on the milestone Pathways \n     Report published just last Fall by the National Academy of \n     Sciences.\n       The fundamental gaps in climate science underscored in that \n     report are the foci of the science title of S. 1776. Having \n     worked closely with leading U.S. climate scientists on these \n     issues, I am now convinced that the United States (and, \n     therefore the world) has the potential capability to solve \n     these riddles. However, resources and hard work will be \n     required to do so. The science community has consensus: \n     climate science has a long way to go. Instead of pretending \n     that we have learned everything we need to learn as many \n     advocates on both sides of the climate change issue do for \n     quite different reasons, I advocate aggressive exploration \n     and resolution of these uncertainties.\n       In the meantime, my bill does stand for the proposition \n     that we needn't wait for that resolution to take immediate, \n     no regrets, steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n     Additionally (and perhaps, even more importantly), I set out \n     the elements to put into place an inter-branch process by \n     which all relevant information--science, economics, and \n     technology--can be marshaled to guide conscientious, \n     contemporary public policy in a fast-changing world.\n       Should it turn out that sacrifice by American citizens--\n     even the stark sacrifices such as those portended by Kyoto--\n     are warranted, we must have confidence that all the \n     information is in, integrated, and understood, not only by \n     elected officials, but also by the people we are privileged \n     to serve.\n       I look forward to getting together soon to explore ways for \n     real progress--consensus action--this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Craig,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout a challenge the people of Washington State face. It is an \nenvironmental challenge, a legal challenge, and a moral challenge. That \nchallenge is to rescue a symbol of the Pacific Northwest.\n  That challenge is to recover our wild Pacific salmon.\n  As anyone who lives in Washington State can tell you, the salmon of \nour region are more than a symbol. They are part of our culture, our \nheritage, our recreation, and our economy.\n  Unfortunately, the salmon that were once so abundant in our rivers \nand along our shores are now in danger. In fact, today several species \nof salmon are threatened with extinction.\n  When it comes to saving salmon, solutions are not easy to find.\n  There are so many different viewpoints to consider. Everyone from \nrecreational and commercial fishermen to Native Americans and \nconservationists, to State, local, and Federal officials, along with \nprivate property owners have a role to play in helping us meet this \nchallenge.\n  In my time here in the Senate, I have always worked to bring people \ntogether, and to find solutions that help us meet this challenge while \nstill keeping our economy strong.\n  Today, I have come to the floor to share with my colleagues and the \nAmerican people some progress we have recently made in meeting this \nchallenge.\n  I am proud to report that just last week, we took a major step \nforward to save wild salmon. Seven days ago, the President designated a \nvital salmon spawning ground--known as the Hanford Reach--as a national \nmonument.\n  I was proud to stand on the banks of the Columbia River, beside the \nVice President, when this historic announcement was made. It was a \ndream come true. For a long time, many of us have dreamed of preserving \nthe Reach. There are few places in the world like it.\n  For me and my family, as for many families throughout the region, the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers hold deep personal meaning.\n  My grandfather settled in the Tri-Cities in 1916. My dad grew up \nthere. He watched his hometown become the home of a secret factory--a \nfactory now known as the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a factory that \nwould give America the tools to win World War II.\n  When my dad came back from his military service in the Pacific \ntheater, he was injured, and he had lost a lot of friends in combat. He \nwasn't the same. And the place he came back to wasn't the same either.\n  He knew that his hometown--perhaps more than any other--contributed \nto winning the war by producing the weapon that ended World War II. And \nhe took a lot of pride in that fact.\n  In my own life, I have spent a lot of time in the Tri-Cities. Growing \nup, I remember during my summer vacation getting in our car and driving \nto the Tri-Cities to see my Grandma--watching the hydros and swimming \nin the river with my six brothers and sisters.\n  When I was in college, I spent a great summer working at Sacajawea \nState Park at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers. I came \nto respect the history of the area, and the people who lived in the \ncommunity.\n  The first time I floated down the Hanford Reach of the Columbia \nRiver, I was with my daughter, Sara. We were so impressed with the \nbeautiful landscape, the fish and the wildlife, and the reminders of \nthe vibrant Native American culture that abounds along the Hanford \nReach.\n  As we floated along, we saw the reactors, and I told her about the \nrole the Tri-Cities played in helping America win World War II and \nabout her grandfather's part in that important piece of history. We \nwere both deeply affected by that day on the river, and it is a memory \nI cherish.\n  When I started fighting to protect the Hanford Reach, my dad told me \nhe thought it was great that I was working to give something back to a \ncommunity that had given so much to our family and to our country. So \nlast Friday, when Vice President Gore announced the designation of the \nHanford Reach of the Columbia River as a national monument, the \ntoughest part of that day for me was that I had lost my father a few \nyears ago and he was not there to see it happen.\n  The national monument designation doesn't just enable us to remember \nour past, it allows us to capture our future--in large part by saving \nwild salmon.\n  The Hanford Reach spans only 51 miles of the Columbia River's 1,200 \nmiles, but it spawns 80% of the wild fall Chinook produced in the \nentire Columbia Basin.\n  Thanks to the designation, this vital breeding ground has been \nprotected.\n  The designation also preserves the unique history of this area.\n  Generations of Americans will be able to learn about the sacrifices \nthat the people of the Tri-Cities made to help America win World War \nII, and generations more will be able to learn about the long Native \nAmerican history along the Columbia River.\n  In addition, the designation will ensure that families can use the \nriver for recreation for years into the future.\n  This is the right thing to do. And doing the right thing also means \nkeeping your promises.\n  The people of the Tri-Cities have been given too many broken \npromises. I do not intend to be another link in that chain.\n  The designation is not the end of the process, but the beginning.\n  As I told the people of the Tri-Cities last week, I will continue to \nwork with local leaders to ensure that their voices are heard. Working \ntogether--with an open dialogue--we can reach the best solution.\n  Over the years, a lot of people helped make the designation possible.\n  Mr. President, I want the Congressional Record to forever reflect the \ntireless work of people like Rick Leaumont, Rich Steele, Bob Wilson, \nLaura Smith, Mike Lilga, Jim Watts, and Dave Goeke.\n  I thank the person who worked side-by-side with me in the House as we \ndeveloped legislative solutions for how to protect the Reach, \nCongressman Norm Dicks, and also Jay Inslee, who has worked hard on \nthis issue.\n  I also thank the members of my advisory committee, the tribes, and so \nmany members of my staff who spent countless hours to save this \nvaluable resource.\n  I thank Governor Gary Locke for his leadership.\n  I thank Secretary Babbitt for recognizing the unique value of the \nHanford Reach, and Secretary Richardson for his help over the years on \nthis and other issues related to Hanford.\n  Of course, we owe a debt of thanks to the President and the Vice \nPresident.\n  Over the years, we have asked much of the Columbia River, and it has \nalways given generously. It has given us affordable energy, turned a \ndesert into a farming oasis, and provided a highway for international \ncommerce.\n  It is amazing how so very few times in our lives we are given the \nopportunity to truly give something to future generations. That is what \nwe are doing with the designation of the Hanford Reach as a National \nMonument.\n  Today, I take a moment to thank a person who deserves a tremendous \namount of credit for the progress we have made in the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  Time and again the Vice President has demonstrated his commitment to \nprotecting our Nation's natural resources while ensuring that we have \nthe strongest economy in our Nation's history.\n  He helped us develop habitat conservation plans that allow us to \nconserve our environment while providing stability to our economy. He \nmade our salmon treaty with Canada a priority for the U.S. Government, \nand for the past two years he has led the fight to save struggling \nsalmon runs.\n  To meet the challenges that we will undoubtedly face in the coming \nyears, we will need a strong partnership at every level--from the folks \non the ground to local, State, and Federal officials. There is no \nperson--no one--who is better qualified to provide the leadership to \nbring us together and to help us solve our toughest problems than Al \nGore. The people of Washington State are grateful for his leadership \nand appreciate the gift that this designation is to future generations.\n  Before I close, I believe it is important to address one final point \non this\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\nsubject. I understand Governor Bush plans to visit my State on Monday. \nI expect he will be impressed by what he sees, and he is always welcome \nin Washington. I am glad he is making the trip because, unlike \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore, I do not believe Governor \nBush has spent much time there.\n  Governor Bush, the people of Washington want to know three things:\n  First, will you make a commitment to protect the Hanford Reach \nNational Monument?\n  Will you commit to saving salmon?\n  And most importantly, what is your plan for saving salmon?\n  When you come to Washington State, Governor Bush, those are the \nquestions people will be asking.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, when it comes to the Hanford Reach, I \nbelieve that the Governor needs to know that those in Washington State \nwho are close to him opposed Federal protection of the Hanford Reach--a \ndesignation that will save the last free-flowing stretch of the \nColumbia River--and the best salmon spawning ground we have.\n  I believe the voters of Washington State deserve to know what \nGovernor Bush's intentions are.\n  And on the issue of preserving salmon on the Snake River, I have \nheard Governor Bush articulate what he won't do, but I have yet to hear \nwhat he would do to protect our region's economy while restoring wild \nsalmon runs.\n  His spokespeople attacked the Vice President on his latest visit to \nWashington State when the Vice President indicated his personal \ninterest in helping the region solve the tricky issues related to \nsalmon restoration. Bush's people offered no plan, they just attacked \nthe Vice President for having one.\n  The people of Washington want to hear plans for saving salmon--not \njust attacks, but credible, responsible plans.\n  Let me be clear: When it comes to helping the people of Washington \nState meet environmental challenges, just saying ``no'' doesn't cut it. \nThe people of my State deserve to know what the President would do to \nsave salmon.\n  When the Vice President was in Washington State recently he met this \nchallenge head-on. He very clearly committed to saving salmon. He said \nthat extinction was not an option. And he indicated that in his \nadministration, he would call a summit to bring together diverse views \nso we can work together to save salmon.\n  He faced the issue in a thoughtful, responsible way.\n  In fact, many of my constituents came up to me after the Vice \nPresident spoke to tell me how impressed they were with the Vice \nPresident's understanding of the issue and his commitment to protecting \nour natural resources, and to thank me for his leadership on this \ncritical challenge.\n  Mr. President, the ball is clearly in Governor Bush's court, and it \nis time for him to provide his own answers and vision.\n  When Governor Bush enters the State of Washington, residents will be \nlistening for his commitment to the Hanford Reach National Monument, \nlistening for his commitment to saving salmon, and listening for his \nplan to save salmon.\n  The people of my State care about this issue. They deserve to hear \nspecific answers.\n  I suggest that if Governor Bush leaves Washington State without \naddressing the concerns of Washington State voters on the issue of \nsalmon recovery, it would suggest that his trip was more about politics \nand photo-ops than addressing the concerns of Washington State voters.\n  I urge Governor Bush to respect the concerns of the people of my \nState, to address their concerns and to answer their questions.\n  I pledge to work with the next President to implement a plan that \nwill save salmon while keeping our economy sound.\n  My hope is for a President who is willing to work with me and the \nother citizens of Washington State in a constructive fashion to address \nthe complex issues related to recovering the once might runs of wild \nsalmon on the Snake and Columbia Rivers.\n  I believe the people of Washington State deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from the State of \nWashington. This is kind of a ``Washington hour.'' We not only have my \ncolleague who just spoke, but the Presiding Officer from the State of \nWashington. I commend her for her thoughtful comments. While I \nrepresent the State of Connecticut that is 3,000 miles away, we, too, \nbelieve it is in our interest to see that the wonderful wilderness \nareas and wild salmon of the Pacific Northwest be preserved and saved. \nI commend her for her efforts. She is not only representing her State \nwell, she is representing my State well when she speaks on this issue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, a number of weeks ago, the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, and others thought it might be \nworthwhile on a daily basis to remind our colleagues of the human \ntragedy that occurs every day in this country as a result of gun \nviolence.\n  We all remember very vividly the astounding events that occurred in \nLittleton, CO, at Columbine High School when we watched some 13 people \nlose their lives in that tragedy. It is hard to believe that that could \noccur; 13 people gunned down in a high school. Yet as the Democratic \nleader and others have pointed out, regrettably, every single day in \nthis country we suffer the same results as we did at Columbine High \nSchool--not in one setting, thank God. Across the country, on average, \n12 or 13 people die every day in the United States as a result of gun \nviolence.\n  I am not going to stand here and suggest to you there is a simple \npiece of legislation that is going to resolve the issue. There are a \nlot of reasons we see this continued violence in our country. But \ncertainly, responsible, thoughtful gun control legislation could make a \nsignificant contribution. We have already seen that in States and \njurisdictions that require waiting periods, require some notification \nahead of time as to who would be the purchaser of these weapons.\n  There was a decision made a number of weeks ago that it might be \nworthwhile to make the case--and we talk in abstractions so often \nhere--and to start talking about those people who lost their lives a \nyear ago on this very day, June 16, 1999. On that date, we didn't have \nthe average of 12 or 13; we lost 3 people in the United States on June \n16. There was one in Chicago, one in St. Paul, and one in Newark, NJ. \nThat was a day on which the numbers were way down from what the average \ndeath toll is.\n  I also point out that the names we have only come from the 100 \nlargest cities in the United States. Cities with populations of less \nthan 12,000 are not included in these numbers. In those 100 cities, on \nJune 16 last year, it was a far better day than most. Every one of the \nvictims was a unique human being. Many other gun violence victims in \nother cities on that day didn't necessarily die, but some did in \nsmaller towns.\n  In the name of all of those who have died across the Nation a year \nago today, and those who, regrettably, will lose their lives today in \ntoo many places across our country, I want to read the following names \nlisted by the Conference of Mayors who were killed by gunfire 1 year \nago in our country: Manuel Marcano, 18, Chicago; Antoine Watson, 19, of \nSt. Paul, MN; an unidentified female in Newark, NJ.\n  I know all Americans regret the loss of those lives. I hope that \nsomeday the national average will be something such as that, or even \nless, as a result of sensible, thoughtful proposals we might make to \nreduce the level of violence in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5298-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5298-S5300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S.-CUBA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, next Tuesday morning I will offer an \namendment that is not a radical idea, not something that ought to evoke \nmuch debate or dissension but the kind of proposal that might even \ncarry by a voice vote under normal circumstances. Because of the nature \nof the subject matter, it has become controversial, and I regret that. \nIt was my hope that the Senate would vote today on the Dodd amendment, \nwhich is currently pending to\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\nthe Defense authorization bill. Unfortunately, that vote was put off \nuntil next week.\n  Having said that, I want to take a few minutes to discuss this \nproposal and explain why I believe it makes sense to go forward to \nestablish a bipartisan commission to review U.S.-Cuban policy.\n  The amendment I will be offering provides for the establishment of a \nbipartisan 12-member commission to review United States policy with \nregard to Cuba and to make recommendations for the changes that might \nbe necessary to bring that policy into the 21st century.\n  On Wednesday of this week, the President of South Korea, Kim Dae-\njung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Chong-il, signed a broad \nagreement to work for peace and unity on the Korean peninsula. Needless \nto say, the level of hostility that has existed between these two \ngovernments for more than half of a century has been extremely high. \nThese two countries fought a bloody and costly war in which hundreds of \nthousands of Koreans lost their lives. More than 35,000 of our own \nfellow service men and women in this country lost their lives as well. \nYet these two leaders have been able to bring themselves to meet and \ndiscuss the future of their peoples and the possibility of \nreunification at some point down the road.\n  The Clinton administration, to its credit, has announced that, as a \nresult of these efforts, it will soon lift economic sanctions against \nNorth Korea, paving the way for American companies to trade and invest \nand for American citizens to travel. I support the administration's \ndecision and applaud them for moving forward in such an expeditious \nmanner to complement the efforts of the North and South Korean leaders.\n  Similarly, despite the fact that more than 50,000 American men and \nwomen in uniform lost their lives during the Vietnam conflict, the \nUnited States and Vietnam have full diplomatic and trade relations \ntoday. In large measure, this is due to our colleagues and veterans, \nSenators McCain, Kerrey, and others in this Chamber.\n  Even though we have a number of serious disagreements with the \nPeople's Republic of China, we are not imposing unilateral economic \nsanctions against that country; quite the opposite. I predict that the \nSenate of the United States, very shortly, will follow the House of \nRepresentatives and vote to support permanent normal trade relations \nwith China, which will pave the way for China to join the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  My point is this: Across the globe, we are seeing efforts to \nnormalize relations, to reconcile old grievances--the Middle East, the \nKorean peninsula, the Balkans, Northern Ireland. There isn't a place I \ncan think of where people are not trying to resolve the differences \nthat have existed for far too long.\n  The question I will pose by offering the amendment on Tuesday is: \nIsn't it about time we at least think about doing the same in our own \nhemisphere, when it comes to a nation that is 90 miles off our shore, \nless distance than from here to Hagerstown, MD, or Richmond, VA?\n\n  The reaction to my amendment would suggest that there is still strong \nresistance to doing in our own hemisphere what we are promoting \nelsewhere around the globe. The amendment I will offer would simply \nestablish a 12-member commission to review U.S. policy, to make \nrecommendations on how it might be changed or if it ought to be \nchanged. I am not even suggesting that the commission would come back \nwith changes. In fact, they may come back with quite the opposite \nresult.\n  This proposal is not new or revolutionary. The Senate has authorized \nestablishment of commissions to review many subjects--the Central \nAmerica Commission, the Kissinger Commission, Social Security, \nTerrorist Threats, and many other subject matters. Our colleague from \nVirginia, Senator John Warner, first proposed this idea of a bipartisan \ncommission on the subject of Cuba in a letter to President Clinton more \nthan 1 and a half years ago. One quarter of the Senate joined him in \nurging the President to take the politics out of United States-Cuba \npolicy and to look to the wisdom of some of our best and brightest \nforeign policy experts to make recommendations on what we should do \nwith respect to this issue.\n  I personally urged Secretary Albright to recommend that the President \nmove forward with this proposal. Regrettably, she believed that the \ntiming was not right for doing so. I was saddened by that decision. I \ndisagreed with the Secretary then, and I believe that a year and a half \nlater the arguments are even more compelling for establishing such a \ncommission today.\n  We are about to change administrations. What better time to use the \ninterval between the current one and the next one to take a fresh look \nat Cuba-related issues and be ready to make recommendations in the \nspring of the coming year as to what makes sense with regard to Cuban-\nU.S. relations?\n  We recently entered a new millennium. Yet U.S.-Cuban policy is still \nlocked in the old shibboleth of the last one. It is a policy that is 40 \nyears old. We have seen changes in South Africa. The Soviet Union \ndoesn't exist any longer. Eastern European countries have managed to \nfind reform and democracy. We now welcome Yasir Arafat to the White \nHouse, and the prospects of peace in the Middle East have never loomed \nmore large. We are watching reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. The \nBalkans are trying to resolve their difficulties. Northern Ireland is, \nhopefully, putting to bed years of hostility. Can we not at least find \nthe opportunity to get this issue of Cuba-United States relations out \nof politics and have a bipartisan commission make recommendations from \nwhich we might consider some different ways of approaching what has \nbeen a 40-year-old policy?\n  I should have said at the very outset of my remarks--and I apologize \nfor not doing so because it needs to be said--that I carry, nor does \nanyone who supports this commission, any grief for Fidel Castro or the \ndictatorship in Cuba. The conditions these people have to live in are \ndeplorable--the hardships, the denial of human rights, the economic \ndeprivation. I hold great respect for the Cuban exile community in this \ncountry. They have come to be great Americans and have contributed \nsignificantly to the economic well-being of our country. They have made \ncontributions as public servants and as patriots--men and women in \nuniform. But too often this issue has been dominated by how we deal \nwith one individual.\n  There are 11 million people living 90 miles off our shores. We need \nto think about the post-Castro period as well. How can we create a \nsofter landing? How can we try to at least frame issues that will allow \nfor a transition there and avoid the potential conflict in civil strife \nthat could occur on the island of Cuba?\n  I hope that the Cuban American Foundation will support the idea of a \nbipartisan commission--a commission that would incorporate and include \npeople of different points of view to try to come up with some common \nground on which they could recommend to a new administration and to \nthis Congress or the next Congress.\n  This proposal is not some radical or fringe idea. It is strongly \nsupported by the mainstream of our foreign policy establishment. People \nsuch as Dr. Henry Kissinger and Bill Rodgers support this effort. I \nappreciate their willingness to say so. I suspect they would be willing \nto serve as commissioners if they were asked to.\n  In light of the systemic changes that have transformed the globe over \nthe last 40 years, I believe a fundamental rethinking of the U.S.-Cuban \npolicy is in order. In fact, such a rethinking is long overdue and it \nis very much in our national interest to do it at this juncture.\n  The pending amendment that we offered on Tuesday deals with the \nproblem by broaching anything relating to Cuba in an election year or \nany year for that matter.\n  The sad reality is that the only way we are going to get this \ndispassionate review of our current policy and sensible recommendations \nwith respect to how that policy should change is by bringing together a \ncommission of respected outside experts to advise the executive and the \nlegislative branches on future policy options.\n  I said a moment ago that some 11 million people live less than 100 \nmiles from our shores. We owe it to the\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nAmerican people to seriously analyze the consequences to the United \nStates of a major civil upheaval on the island of Cuba and to devise a \npolicy that minimizes the possibility of such an event occurring.\n  Does anyone believe for one moment that a sea of humanity would not \nstream from the island toward U.S. shores if civil conflict erupts \nthere?\n  Two years have passed since Pope John Paul II made a historic visit \nto Cuba that called upon that country to open up to the world and for \nthe world to open up to Cuba.\n  Even after such an unprecedented event, the centerpiece of our policy \nremains the same--an embargo which seeks to restrict trade, travel, and \na low flow of information to Cuba and thereby strangle Cuba \neconomically.\n  This hard-line stance continues to hold sway in Washington today in \nlarge measure because successive administrations have been hamstrung by \ndomestic political considerations and have been fearful of provoking \nthe ire of those who are obsessed with the island of Cuba and its \npersonification in the person of Fidel Castro.\n  We have just entered a new millennium. Surely it is time to break \nwith the policy that is largely centered on the fate of one individual \nand replace it with one that is more future oriented--one that focuses \non the other 11 million individuals who also reside on the island of \nCuba, and on the millions of Cuban-Americans. Many of them believe we \nought to think differently today. They do not speak out on the issue \nbut would welcome the opportunity to see a commission created which \nwould give us a chance to look at other policy options.\n  The time has come to have a reasoned conversation regarding Cuba and \nU.S. policy, and about the effectiveness of our policy. I think the \nestablishment of a bipartisan commission would be the starting point \nfor just such a conversation and just such a debate. Hopefully, the end \npoint of that conversation would be the development of a national \nconsensus around a new Cuba policy--one that is compatible with \nAmerica's values and beliefs, one that truly serves our own national \ninterests.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree with this analysis. If so, I urge \nthem to support this amendment when it is voted on next Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are under a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at an appropriate time, I intend to offer \nthe Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the Department of \nDefense Authorization Act. It is essential for the Senate to deal with \nthis important issue.\n  Hate crimes are modern day lynchings, and this is the time and the \nUnited States Senate is the place to take a stand against them. We must \nfirmly and unequivocally say ``no'' to those who injure or murder \nbecause of hate. Every day that Congress fails to act, people across \nthe Nation continue to be victimized by acts of bigotry based on race, \nreligion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability.\n  Hate crimes are a national disgrace and an attack on everything this \ncountry stands for. These crimes send a poisonous message that \nminorities are second class citizens with fewer rights. And, sadly, the \nnumber of hate crimes continues to rise.\n  70,000 hate crime offenses have been reported in the United States \nsince 1991. In 1991 there were 4,500 hate crimes; 7,500 in 1993; 7,900 \nin 1995, and over 8,000 in 1997. There were 7,700 hate crimes reported \nin 1998, and although the numbers dropped slightly, the number and \nseverity of offenses increased in the categories of religion, sexual \norientation, and disability.\n  This is a serious and persistent problem--an epidemic that must be \nstopped.\n  All of us are aware of the most highly-publicized hate crimes, \nespecially the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and \nMatthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. But these two killings are just \nthe tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have \noccurred this year:\n  On January 28 in Boston, a group of high school teenagers sexually \nassaulted and attacked a 16-year-old high school student on the subway \nbecause she was holding hands with another young girl, a common custom \nfrom her native African country. Thinking the victim was a lesbian, the \ngroup began groping the girl, ripping her clothes and pointing at their \nown genitals, while shouting ``Do you like this? Do you like this? Is \nthis what you like?'' When the girl resisted, officials said, a teenage \nboy who was with the group pulled a knife on the girl, held it to her \nthroat and threatened to slash her if she didn't obey her attackers. \nThe girl was left unconscious from the beating. Three high school \nstudents were arrested in the attack and charged with civil rights \nviolations, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, and \nindecent assault and battery.\n  On February 6 Tuscon, Arizona, a 20-year-old gay University of \nArizona student was sitting at a cafe when a man came up behind him and \npunched and stabbed him with a large knife. Witnesses heard the \nperpetrator using vicious anti-gay epithets. The victim was treated at \na local hospial and survived. The attack spurred an anti-hate rally on \nthe campus a few days later, drawing over 1,000 people.\n  March 1 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, a black man was charged with a \nhate crime after going on a shooting rampage killing three white men \nand leaving two others critically wounded. Prior to the attack, he told \na black woman that he wouldn't hurt her because he was ``out to get all \nwhite people.'' The perpetrator was shouting racial epithets at white \nmaintenance workers, and shot only white men on his rampage. \nAuthorities found anti-white and anti-Jewish writings in his home.\n  On April 29 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Richard Scott Baumhammers, \n34, a white man was charged with murder and hate crimes in a shooting \nrampage targeting minorities that left five people dead and one \ncritically wounded. The first victim was a Jewish neighbor who was shot \nhalf a dozen times before her house was set on fire. The perpetrator \nthen went from shopping mall to shopping mall, shooting and killing two \nAsian Americans at a Chinese restaurant, an African American at a \nkarate school, and a man from India at an Indian grocery. He also fired \nshots at two synagogues, and the word ``Jew'' and two swastikas were \npainted in red on one of the buildings. According to press reports, \nattorney of the accused is raising an insanity defense.\n  On June 4 in Rapid City, South Dakota, press reports indicate that \npolice are baffled by a series of eight inexplicable drowning deaths \namong mostly Native Americans along Rapid Creek that have occurred over \nthe course of 14 months. Law enforcement officials initially thought \nthat the severely intoxicated men had drowned by accident. But local \nNative Americans believe an ``Indian-hater'' is waiting for the victims \nto become drunk and then dragging, rolling or pushing them into the \nwater. These incidents come on the heels of a March 2000 report from \nthe U.S. Civil Rights Commission that shows that racial tensions in \nSouth Dakota are high, and that Native Americans in the state feel that \nthe justice they received is unfair.\n  The most brutal and shocking hate crimes continue to make national \nheadlines. Yet this list highlights just a few of the many hate crimes \nthat afflict communities throughout the nation. This problem cannot and \nshould not be ignored.\n  We know that hate groups have increased in number in recent years. A \nstudy by the Southern Poverty Law Center reported last year that 474 \nhate groups exist nationwide. Clearly, the Internet has given them a \nlarger megaphone. In earlier years, hate groups would spread their \nmessages of hate by using bulletin boards, newsletters, cable \ntelevision, and occasional rallies. Now, the Internet gives them a \nvastly increased audience that can be reached\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nwith little effort. Hate sites have proliferated at distressing rates, \nand recruitment by hate groups has increased substantially. No minority \nis safe. African-Americans, Hispanics, Jews, gays, lesbians, Arab-\nAmericans, Native Americans--all are targeted by these hate groups, \nwhich hide behind the first amendment as they spread their hateful \nmessages. Unless we find better antidotes to the poison of high-tech \nhate, the problem of hate crimes in our free society will become \nincreasingly severe.\n  The federal government has a special role in protecting civil rights \nand preventing discrimination. We need to take two major steps. We need \nto strengthen current federal laws against hate crimes based on race, \nreligion or national origin. We also need to add gender, sexual \norientation, and disability to the types of hate crimes where federal \nprosecution is available.\n  Our goal is to make the Justice Department a full partner with state \nand local governments in investigating and prosecuting these vicious \ncrimes. We must find a way to act on this important issue and now is \nthe time to do it. The silence of Congress on this basic issue has been \ndeafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't \ncare--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state problem. It \nisn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that Congress \ncontinues to be A.W.O.L. in the national battle against hate crimes.\n  Recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the conscience of the \ncountry. It is clear that tolerance in America faces a serious \nchallenge. We cannot hide behind the nation's record economic \nprosperity or its tremendous technological advances, when issues that \ngo to the heart of the nation's founding ideals and basic values are at \nstake. When bigotry exists in America, we have to root it out.\n  Current federal laws are clearly inadequate. It's an embarrassment \nthat we haven't already acted to close the glaring gaps. For too long, \nthe federal government has been forced to fight hate crimes with one \nhand tied behind its back. Federal participation in civil rights \nprosecutions in nothing new. In fact, it is Federalism 101. Federal \ninvolvement in the prosecution of racial bigotry dates back to the \nReconstruction Era following the Civil War. These fundamental civil \nrights laws were updated in the 1960's, but now they are no longer \nadequate to meet the current challenge. Civil rights is still the \nunfinished business of America, and action we propose is in the best \ntradition of responsible federal legislation.\n  Our amendment addresses two serious deficiencies in the principal \nfederal hate crimes statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245, which currently \napplies to hate crimes committed on the basis of race, color, religion, \nor national origin.\n  First, in these cases, the statutes requires the government to prove \nthat the defendant committed an offense not only because of the victims \nrace, color, religion, or national origin, but also because of the \nvictim's participation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally \nprotected activities'' listed in the statute. These activities are:\n  (1) Enrolling in or attending a public school or public college;\n  (2) Participating in a service or activity provided by a state or \nlocal government;\n  (3) Applying for employment or actually working;\n  (4) Service on a jury in a state or local court;\n  (5) Traveling in interstate commerce; or using a facility in \ninterstate commerce; or\n  (6) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public \naccommodation.\n  In other words, even in these types of hate crimes, the prosecution \nmust prove that in addition to the bigotry, the attack was also made \nbecause the victim was engaged in one of these six specific activities. \nToo often, federal prosecutions are not possible, because this \nadditional burden of proof is too great.\n  Second, the federal statute provides no coverage at all for hate \ncrimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. \nIn the Matthew Shepard case in Wyoming, for example, no federal \nprosecution was possible because of this unacceptable gap in federal \nlaw.\n  Together, these limitations prevent the federal government from \nworking with state and local law enforcement agencies in the \ninvestigation and prosecution of many of the most vicious hate crimes.\n  Our legislation adds new provisions to Title 18 to remedy each of \nthese limitations.\n  In cases involving racial, religious, or ethnic violence, the \namendment prohibits the intentional infliction of bodily injury, \nwithout regard to the victim's participation in one of the six \n``federally protected activities.''\n  In cases involving hate crimes based on the victim's sexual \norientation, gender, or disability, the amendment prohibits the \nintentional infliction of bodily injury whenever the act has a \nconnection to interstate commerce.\n  In addition, when state and local officials request federal \nassistance, our amendment authorizes the federal government to lend its \npersonnel and its technical resources to local officials, and to award \ngrants of up to $100,000 to assist in the local investigation and \nprosecution of hate crimes. These provisions will permit the federal \ngovernment to work in partnership with state and local officials in all \naspects of the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.\n  This amendment has the support of the Department of Justice, \nconstitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and many \norganizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement in \ncombating hate crimes, including the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, the Anti-Defamation League, the Human Rights Campaign, the \nNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the National Organization for \nWomen's Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence, and the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities Rights Task Force.\n  This hate crimes amendment is not a full answer, but it will send a \nstrong signal from the President and Congress that violence against \nindividuals because of their membership in certain groups will not be \ntolerated, and that the federal government will now be a full partner \nin meeting this threat in the years ahead. It is time to stop \nabdicating our federal responsibility and start doing more to win this \nall-important battle against hate crimes. If we fail, America is not \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, to review for the Senate quickly, this chart indicates \nthe number of incidents, by bias motivation: Red being the race \nethnicity and national origin, green being religion, blue being sexual \norientation, and yellow being disability.\n  As you can see from these numbers, they have been virtually flat over \nthe period of these last couple of years. We have seen the increased \nnumbers that have taken place on the basis of sexual orientation and \nincreased numbers with regard to disability. The fact is, in examining \nthese cases, particularly in 1997 and 1998, we find that the incidence \nof violence has intensified dramatically and the viciousness in \nmanifestations of hatred has increased significantly, reflecting itself \nin these acts of violence against individuals.\n  One of our great leaders in this cause was our former colleague, Paul \nSimon of Illinois, who was a strong advocate on this legislation many \nyears ago. We settled at that time for just collecting information. \nPrior to a few years ago, we did not have accurate information. Now we \nhave the accurate information and it cries out for action. There is no \njustification for delay, given that we have the information and we do \nknow the cases that are taking place. We do not have to just rely on \nthe various ad hoc cases that all of us read about, tragically almost \nevery single day. We have accumulated these instances. We know from the \ndirect testimony and comments from local law enforcement officials of \nthe value and help and assistance that can be provided and that is \nneeded in the prosecution of these cases.\n  I will take the time of the Senate on Monday to go through a greater \ndescription of exactly what we are doing and what we are not doing; the \nlimitations that we have placed upon the prosecution. We will have a \nchance to review for the Senate what the other amendment, the Hatch \namendment that will be before the Senate will do, what it will do and \nalso what it will not do. We will have that opportunity on Tuesday next \nin the middle of the\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nafternoon. It is imperative to take a vote on whether we are going to \nbe serious here, with the Federal Government participating with States \nand local communities, trying to do something about the odious aspects \nof hate crimes.\n  Finally, as we know, these incidents of crime are not just acts \nagainst individuals. These acts really impact and affect a whole \ncommunity because they are based on such bigotry and hatred and reflect \nthat kind of hatred and viciousness, that the whole community is \ntainted by these kinds of activities. It cries out for appropriate \ninvolvement by the Federal Government to be a partner with local and \nState law enforcement officials. That is what this legislation does. \nNothing more, nothing less. It is a partnership using the full force of \nthe National Government to address these crimes.\n\n  My friend from Oregon is on the floor. He has been involved in this \nissue for a very long period of time. He has been indispensable as we \nhave tried to move this legislation in the Senate. He has a long record \nin this area in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I value \nhis counsel and strong support. It is a pleasure to see Senator Wyden \non the floor to speak on this issue this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts \nleaves the floor, I want to make clear that, in all the years of \nSenator Kennedy's championing the cause of civil rights, we have looked \nto him for his leadership. I believe this is a particularly important \ncause he champions today at a particularly important time. I hope my \ncolleagues will reflect carefully on what Senator Kennedy has said \ntoday. He will be leading us in the debate on this issue next week. I \nam honored to be working with him.\n  As Senator Kennedy said so eloquently, this is about one proposition \nand one proposition alone, and that is we are seeking to deter violent \ncrime borne out of prejudice and hatred. So often we hear discussions \nabout preferences for individuals, advantages that might in some way be \nbestowed with respect to civil rights statutes. That is not what this \nlegislation does at all.\n  This legislation is about deterring violence, deterring crime, \ndeterring these extraordinary acts of violence that, in my view, stain \nour national greatness. We are not going to be able to remove that \nstain completely. We are not going to be able to stop individuals from \nhaving hateful and prejudicial thoughts. Clearly, we can put the \nFederal Government in a position to be a stronger, more effective \npartner with local law enforcement officials in fighting this scourge \nthat has affected so many of our communities.\n  This is not a time for further study. This is not a time to say the \nFederal Government's response should only be to collect statistics. \nThis is a time for the Federal Government to work in partnership with \nState and local law enforcement officials so that we have the \nstrongest, most effective, most coherent mobilization against these \nacts of violence and prejudice that we possibly can muster.\n\n  Our bipartisan amendment, led by Senator Kennedy, does three things: \nIt removes the restrictions on the types of situations in which the \nJustice Department can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on \nrace, color, religion, or national origin.\n  Second, it will assure that crimes targeted against victims because \nof disability, gender, or sexual orientation that cause death or bodily \ninjury can be prosecuted if there is a sufficient connection to \ninterstate commerce.\n  Third, it requires the Attorney General to certify in writing that he \nor she has reasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivated by \nbias and that, in fact, the Federal Government had been in close \nconsultation with State and local law enforcement officials and that \nthey did not have any objection to Federal help or that they had asked \nfor Federal assistance.\n  This is not a question of the Federal Government coming in and \nsaying: We are going to call all the shots, and preempt the local \njurisdictions. In fact, we want to support those local jurisdictions. \nWe have 28 States in this country that have no authority to prosecute \nbias-motivated crimes based on disability or sexual orientation. We \nhave a substantial number of States in this country that lack the legal \nauthority to address these issues that are so important to the \nfundamental values of this country.\n  We are not saying that every single crime in America is a hate crime. \nWe certainly know that all crimes are tragic, and we grieve for the \nfamilies, but not all crimes are based on hate. A hate crime is one \nwhere the perpetrator intentionally chooses the victim because of who \nthe victim is. It is our view that a hate crime affects not only the \nvictim, but if it goes unaddressed, it cheapens all of us. It makes our \ncountry a little bit less special because it demeans an entire \ncommunity, it demeans all of us in our Nation.\n  This is not providing special protection to certain groups. It makes \nsure we stand up for the rights of those individuals who are singled \nout solely for reasons borne out of hatred and prejudice and we not \nallow those in our country who do wish to harm these individuals to \nperpetrate these brutal acts with no response from our communities.\n  Some argue that hate crime laws threaten free speech. In the law we \nare hoping the Senate will adopt, it does not punish beliefs or \nthoughts. We are not punishing those in this legislation; we are \npunishing violent acts. I know of no Member of the Senate who is pro-\nviolence. I do not think there is a single Member of the Senate who \nwants to be on the cause or in support of violent acts. Here we draw \nthe line in the sand and we say we are not going to get in the way of \npeople's thoughts and beliefs, lawful expression of one's deeply held \nreligious views, but we are saying that causing or attempting to cause \nbodily injury is not speech protected by the first amendment.\n  I am very hopeful that in the next few days the Senate will support \nthis legislation. We are not federalizing criminal activity that is \nbetter left to the States. I mentioned the fact that so many States in \nour country lack these laws, and we have gone beyond the time to just \nstudy this and collect further statistics. If one looks at what \nhappened in the brutal instance of Matthew Shepard and the horrific \nmurder of James Byrd, Jr., it is awfully hard to say as you look at \nthose brutal acts: We ought to study things a little bit more and \ncollect some statistics before the Federal Government, in effect, acts \nto be a better partner with State and local authorities in addressing \nthese issues.\n  It is time to correct the deficiencies in current law. A crime \nmotivated by race, religion, or ethnic origin can be prosecuted by \nFederal authorities because it occurred on a public sidewalk but not if \nit took place in a private parking lot across the street. This is just \none example of the gaps and the deficiencies in the current hate crimes \nstatute.\n  When we vote on this issue, there will be support from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. I commend my friend and colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Gordon Smith, who has stood with me again and again on this \nissue.\n\n  When we vote on this, it seems to me, this will be nothing short of a \nreferendum in the Senate on whether this body is going to continue to \ntolerate violent acts born of prejudice.\n  As I mentioned, I do not know of any Senator who is in favor of \nviolence. Violent acts, born of prejudice--acts that we all know are \nwrong--are taking place in too many communities in our country. They \nare a stain on our national greatness.\n  The evidence is in, and it is clear. It is time, through Federal \nlegislation, to send a strong and unequivocal message that we will not \nlook the other way in the face of these crimes, that they will not be \ntolerated, that the full force of Federal law enforcement will be \nbrought, and will be brought in conjunction with State and local \nauthorities, to ensure that these violent acts are prosecuted and we \nhave taken every step to deter them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment Senator Kennedy will offer on Monday, of which I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor.\n  One of the things we try to do in this Chamber, as lawmakers, is to \nadopt laws that express and encode our values as a society, to, in some \nsense, put into law our aspirations for the kind of people we want to \nbe.\n  Clearly, one of the bedrock values, one of the fundamental values, of \nAmerica is equality--equality of treatment before the law, equality of \nopportunity but, beyond that, a broader notion of tolerance in our \nsociety. It is part of what brought generations of immigrants to this \ncountry--the idea that they would be judged on their personal merit, \nnot on anything related to their personal status or characteristics.\n  Tolerance has been a hallmark of American society. I said before, \nwhen I talked about the law, that law sometimes tries to express the \naspirations we have for ourselves. Sometimes, obviously, we do not \nachieve those aspirations and we are intolerant toward one another. \nThen the law has not only the opportunity but the obligation to step in \nand to try to create incentives or deterrence toward the worst forms of \nintolerance, even hatred. That is what this amendment is about.\n  Clearly, over the decades our Nation has built a strong and proud \nhistory of protecting the civil rights of Americans who are subject to \nracial, religious, gender-based, or disability-based discrimination in \nthe workplace, in housing, in life.\n  In more recent times, there are a group of us here in the Chamber who \nhave worked to try to extend some of those protections to cover bias, \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation.\n  It seems to me this amendment and the law on which it builds are also \nright and proper because they take Federal criminal jurisdiction and \nextend it to the prosecution and punishment of those who are accused of \nhaving caused bodily injury or death based on an animus, a personal \nanimus, a hatred that comes from feelings about the victim's race, \nreligion, nationality, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. In \nother words, this is another way for our society to express our \ndisdain, to put it mildly, at acts of violence committed based on a \nperson's race, religion, nationality, gender, disability, or sexual \norientation.\n  It is also a way, as is traditionally the province of criminal law, \nnot just to speak to the common moral consensus of our society about \nwhat is right and what is wrong because that is what the law is all \nabout, but hopefully by pushing those who are proven to have committed \nthe wrongs, to deter others in the future from committing those same \nacts that society generally finds abhorrent.\n  Current law expresses this but in a way that is limited. It permits \nFederal prosecutions of hate crimes resulting from death or bodily \ninjury if two conditions are met: First, the crime must be motivated by \nthe victim's race, religion, national origin, or color; second, the \nperpetrator must have intended to prevent the victim from exercising a \nfederally protected right such as voting or traveling interstate. Of \ncourse, I support this law and the goals that it embraces: The Federal \nprosecution of people who inflict serious harm on others because of the \ncolor of the victim's skin, the sound of the victim's voice, a foreign \naccent, or the particular place in which the victim worships God. In \nshort, these are crimes committed because the victim is different in \nsome way from the perpetrator. Such crimes, I conclude, should be \nfederally prosecuted.\n  As we have had U.S. attorneys invoking these laws, carrying them out, \nwe have discovered some shortcomings and some ways in which we can make \nthem better, which is to say, ways in which we can more fully express \nsome of the principles I talked about at the outset: equality, \ntolerance, doing everything we can to stop the most abhorrent acts of \nviolence against people based on their characteristics. I think we \nought to add to the list of prohibited bases of these crimes, crimes \ncommitted against someone because of gender, because of sexual \norientation, and because of disability. That is what is provided in the \namendment the senior Senator from Massachusetts will offer on Monday \nand of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I suppose some people may hear these categories that I have mentioned \nand say: People commit crimes based on that basis? The fact is, they \ndo. Sometimes they become quite visible and notorious. Crimes such as \nthat committed against Matthew Shepard, who was killed because he was a \ngay man, are no less despicable and, of course, therefore no less \ndeserving of Federal protection and prosecution than are those \ncommitted against others based on a characteristic, a status of the \nperson, that are currently included in the Federal law. Adding these \ncategories--gender, sexual orientation, disability--seems to me to be \nan appropriate extension of the basic concept of equal protection under \nthe law. As the law now stands, it also imposes a requirement, a bar to \nprosecution relating to race, color, religion, and national origin that \nwe ought to change, which is that the law is only triggered if the \nvictim is prevented from exercising a specifically enumerated federally \nprotected activity.\n  There are obviously crimes that are committed based on hatred that \nare triggered in cases other than the simple prevention of the exercise \nof a federally protected activity, thus, the provision of this \namendment that would eliminate this obstacle and, therefore, broaden \nthe ability of Federal prosecutors to pursue crimes motivated by racial \nor religious hatred.\n  The amendment that will be introduced on Monday also includes new \nlanguage requiring the Justice Department, prior to indicting a \ndefendant in a hate crime based on the categories I have enumerated, \nincluding those added under this amendment, a prosecutor of the Justice \nDepartment will have to, prior to the indictment, certify either that \nthe State is not going to prosecute a hate crime, therefore avoiding \nboth an overlap and the opportunity for prosecution by those in law \nenforcement closest to the crime, the alleged crime, and will also have \nto certify that the State requested or does not object to Justice \nDepartment prosecution or that the State has completed prosecution. It \nseems that you wouldn't have to say that, but just to be sure to avoid \na kind of double exposure, double prosecution, that certification \nshould satisfy the concerns some of my colleagues may have who may fear \nthat Federal prosecutors will interfere with State efforts to bring \nperpetrators of hate crimes to justice. In other words, the State is \ngiven the first opportunity and the superior opportunity to prosecute \nthese cases. Only if the State does not will Federal prosecutors be \nable to proceed.\n\n  At a time when so much else is going on here in the Capitol with the \nhigh profile issues of this session--the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhether we are going to give Medicare coverage or other coverage for \nprescription drug benefits for seniors, campaign finance reform--this \namendment brings us back to America's first principles of equality and \ntolerance and challenges each of us to think about the appropriate and \nconstructive role that the law can play, understanding that the law \ncan't control the hearts of people in this country.\n  Ultimately, we have to count on people's own sense of judgment and \ntolerance and, hopefully, the effect that other forces in their lives \nwill have on them to make them fair and tolerant, such as their \nfamilies, their schools, their religions, their faith. But here is the \nlaw to say in the cases when all of those other sources of good \njudgment and values in society fail to stifle the hatred that sometimes \ndoes live in people's hearts and souls, to say that this is \nunacceptable in America and to attach to that statement the sanction of \nlaw, hoping that we thereby express the higher aspirations we have for \nthis great country of ours as it continues over the generations to try \nto realize the noble ideals expressed by our founders in the \nDeclaration and the Constitution, but also to put clearly into the \nforce of law the punishment that comes with law when one goes so far \nover the line to commit an act of violence based on hatred, hoping \nthereby that we will deter such heinous acts from occurring again in \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues over the weekend will have a chance to take a \nlook at this amendment, will come to the floor and talk about it, and \nperhaps question those of us who have proposed it. Then I hope a strong \nbipartisan majority will support it when it comes to a vote next \nTuesday.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5304-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5304-S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss an issue of considerable importance, one I feel very strongly \nabout and one that I think the Senate should address before the end of \nthis Congressional session, and that is Mr. President, the issue of the \ndigital divide. The digital divide is one of the key issues the \nCongress is currently facing--and will continue to face--in the \nforeseeable future. Right now we are wrestling with how to best \nencourage growth in this new economy, but at the same time, how to \nensure that growth is evenly spread, that everyone in our society has \nan opportunity to participate in this new economy and reap its economic \nrewards.\n  Mr. President, these are amazing times in which we live and the new \neconomy is responsible for much of this nation's unprecedented \nprosperity: the stock market is soaring to unimaginable heights. IPO's \nare occurring at a record pace and creating literally thousands of \nmillionaires in this country. The innovations of the new technologies \nare astounding: You can order a Saturn online and the very next day a \nnew car shows up in your drive-way. Each day 25,000 new E-BAY \nsubscribers sign up for the world's largest auction. The NetSchools \nprogram provides every child with a kid-proof laptop PC that is \nconnected to teachers and classmates using wireless infared technology \nand has had tremendous results improving academic achievement, \nattendance, and parental involvement in extremely disadvantaged \ncommunities. A surgeon in Boston can direct a doctor in the Berkshires \nto do a biopsy by using telemedicine equipment. These innovations and \nhundreds more like them are changing how we live.\n  The wealth creation--for those on the right side of the divide--\ngenerated by this New Economy is breathtaking, Mr. President: College \nstudents go from the dorm room to the board room as high tech moguls, \nlike Jerry Yang and Michael Dell. Starting salaries for high tech jobs \neven for students coming out of college can range from $70,000-\n$100,000--even more with stock options. Pick up the San Jose Mercury \nNews job section each day and--literally--you will find advertisements \nfor upwards of 10,000 high tech and information technology jobs. \nSilicon Valley has created more than 275,000 new jobs since 1992--and \nmedian family income has soared to $87,000 per year--the third highest \nin the country.\n  But as we all know Mr. President, the new economy has not evenly \nspread its wealth to all Americans and income disparity in this nation \ncontinues to grow. One of the greatest challenges we currently face is \nto connect those not participating in the new economy with the skills, \nresources, and support necessary for them to do so. A January 2000 \nstudy by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic \nPolicy Institute found that in two-thirds of the states, the gap in \nincomes between the top 20 percent of families and the bottom 20 \npercent of families grew between the late 1980s and the late 1990s. In \nthree-fourths of the states, income gaps between the top fifth and \nmiddle fifth of families grew over the last decade. By contrast, \ninequality declined significantly in only three states. Clearly Mr. \nPresident, the digital divide and the economic divide are closely \ninterrelated and must be responded to as such.\n  Mr. President, the new economy is more than the latest and greatest \ninnovations in information technology and the highest-flying Internet \ncompanies. It is a knowledge economy, with a large share of the \nworkforce employed in office jobs requiring some level of higher \neducation. It is a global economy--the sum of U.S. imports and exports \nrose from 11 percent of gross domestic product in 1970 to 25 percent in \n1997. This emerging economy is driven by innovation in every arena from \ntraditional manufacturing to health care, and even farming and fishing.\n\n  The new economy is powerful and exciting, but the digital divide is \nreal and cannot afford to be ignored. Let me describe to you what this \ndivide looks like.\n  The Digital Divide:\n  61.6% of those with college degrees now use the Internet, while only \n6.6% of those with an elementary school education or less use the \nInternet.\n  At the highest incomes ($75,000+), the White/Black divide for \ncomputer ownership decreased by 76.2% between 1994 and 1998.\n  Whites are more likely to have access to the Internet from home, than \nBlacks or Hispanics have from any location.\n  Black and Hispanic households are 2/5 as likely to have home Internet \naccess as White households.\n  Forty-four million American adults, roughly 22 percent, do not have \nthe reading and writing skills necessary for functioning in everyday \nlife. And an estimated 87 percent of documents on the Internet are in \nEnglish. Yet at least 32 million Americans speak a language other than \nEnglish and they are--again and again--left behind on the Internet.\n  Those with a college degree or higher are over eight times more \nlikely to have a computer at home than the least educated and nearly \nsixteen times more likely to have home Internet access.\n  The ``digital divide'' for Internet use between those at the highest \nand lowest education levels widened by 25% from 1997 to 1998.\n  Those with college degrees or higher are ten times more likely to \nhave Internet access at work as persons with only some high school \neducation.\n  Mr. President technology is changing our world. Technology is \nchanging our lives, how we work, and how we learn. But this is not just \na new economy, it is our economy. And ours is not a newly divided \nsociety. Mr. President, this country has always been a society of haves \nand have nots, and so although we must respond to the unique challenges \npresented by the changing economy and the changing world of work, we \nmust also understand that bridging the digital divide is about more \nthan just computers and the Internet. In order to meet the challenge of \nbridging the digital divide we must assist the have nots with basic \nnecessities, like a good public education system, a safe and clean \nplace to live, and adequate health care. We must recognize what I hear \nfrom business leaders, teachers, students, parents--everyone--the \nbiggest technology issue in the United States today is education. And \nwe need to make that connection.\n\n  Originally when we talked about technology and education--the earlier \ndays of our awareness that there was a growing digital divide--we were \nfocused on wiring schools and outfitting them with equipment. Now, \nthanks in large part to the success of the E-Rate program, which we \nworked hard on in the Commerce Committee and which we pushed through to \npassage, now technology and education is about so much more. In just a \nfew years most of our schools have gotten on-line. And now the focus is \non training teachers to effectively use the technology, to integrate \ntechnology into the classroom, and to improve parental involvement \nthrough technology.\n  What we can do and what we must do Mr. President, is work to harness \ntechnology to grow our economy and enlarge the winner's circle. What we \ncan do and what we must do is work to communicate this single reality: \nto keep the economic growth moving ahead, we need to work together to \nensure that we have a workforce and a generation of young people \ncapable of working with the best technology and the very best ideas to \nraise living standards and expand the economy--and that is why we must \nclose the digital divide.\n  The digital divide goes far beyond technology to encompass basic \nhuman needs. Mr. President, if we can ensure that there is a computer \nin every classroom--for every student--the technology will not be \neffectively used, learning will continue to be challenged if the child \ndoes not have a safe and secure home to go to at the end of the day. If \na child attends a school that is falling apart, does it matter how many \ncomputers are in the classroom and whether or not the school is wired? \nIf a child lives in a dangerous and violent\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\ncommunity--a reality for far too many of this nation's young people--\nthe fear of bullets and gangs is certain to triumph over the desire to \nconquer new technologies. If a child goes hungry, if school is the only \nplace that can be counted on for a good meal, that child cannot focus \non computing and learning.\n  Mr. President, these are the issues of the digital divide: adequate \nand affordable housing, safe and secure school buildings, adequate \nhealth care, qualified teachers, an increased minimum wage, strong \ncommunities, and affordable day care. We must understand that in order \nto seize upon this brilliant moment of technological advance and move \nour entire nation forward, we must address these basic needs. We must \nshore up the foundation, Mr. President and provide all our citizens \nwith opportunity as we march forward in the digital age.\n  I ask my colleagues to ponder this for a moment: change is nothing \nnew, technology is nothing new, the challenge is the same as it's ever \nbeen. But we can use these new technologies to extend opportunity to \nmore Americans than ever before--or, if we're not careful, we could \nallow technology to heighten economic inequality and sharpen social \ndivisions. By the same token, we can accelerate the most powerful \nengine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known--or allow that \nengine to stall. As every economics textbook will tell you, new \ntechnologies will continue to drive economic growth--but only if they \ncontinue to spread to all sectors of our economy and civic life. And \nthat's the challenge that faces this Congress and this nation.\n  Mr. President, we have a real opportunity here--and I urge my \ncolleagues to seize it--to close the divisions within our society that \nhave always existed and also to close the digital divide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5305-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, recently my colleagues, Senators \nGrassley, Kennedy, Jeffords, and Harkin introduced The Family \nOpportunity Act of 2000. I have proudly signed on to this important \npiece of legislation which will help hundreds of thousands of American \nfamilies who have children with disabilities get access to Medicaid as \nwell as obtain much needed support and information.\n  The Family Opportunity Act is modeled after last year's successful \nWork Incentives Improvement Act, which assures adults with disabilities \ncan return to work and not risk losing their health care coverage. This \nnew Act would create a state option to allow middle-income parents who \nhave a child with special health needs to keep working, while having an \noption to buy in to Medicaid coverage for their child.\n  In my own state of West Virginia, over 50,000 children are known to \nhave a disability. I have heard personally from many of these families, \nwho remind me about their daily struggles of sacrificing time, energy, \nand finances to provide the best environment for their child. In the \npast, this has meant that parents often refuse jobs, pay raises and \novertime just to keep their incomes low enough so that they can qualify \nfor services under Medicaid for their children with special health care \nneeds.\n  Medicaid coverage is so crucial to the child because many private \nplans do not offer essential services such as occupational, physical \nand speech therapy, mental health services, home and community-based \nservices, and durable medical equipment such as walkers and \nwheelchairs, which if uncovered, can be financially devastating to a \nfamily. Under the Family Opportunity Act, families would be required to \nfirst take employer-sponsored health coverage if available. The option \nto buy in to Medicaid would be used as a supplement to existing private \ninsurance or as stand alone coverage if employer-based coverage were \nnot an option.\n  In addition to creating Medicaid buy-in options for families, the \nFamily Opportunity Act proposes the establishment of Family to Family \nHealth Information Centers. These Centers, staffed by both parents and \nprofessionals would be available to help families identify and access \nappropriate health care for their children with special needs, as well \nas answer questions on filling out the necessary paperwork to establish \nhealth care coverage.\n  The Family Opportunity Act promises to promote early intervention, \nensures medically necessary services, offers support, and will help \nrestore family stability. I applaud my colleagues for proposing this \nimportant legislation, but even more important, I give a standing \novation to the dedicated families who give so greatly of themselves to \ncare for their children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5305-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nto recognize a fellow Arkansan, Blake Rutherford, for his \naccomplishments at Middlebury College in Vermont. Blake is a native of \nLittle Rock, attended Little Rock Central High School, and will be \ngraduating from Middlebury College with a degree in Political Science \nin August 2000. This fine young man is the first student ever chosen at \nMiddlebury College to give the Student Commencement Address. This is a \nwell deserved honor for Blake Rutherford and I whole heartily \ncongratulate him on his achievements. I ask that the text of his speech \nbe included following my remarks.\n\n                 Blake Rutherford's Commencement Speech\n\n       Today, we are fortunate to experience one of the great \n     accomplishments in life. Like thousands throughout America, \n     we are gathered at the beginning of a new millennium, a \n     unique time in our nation and in our world. But unlike \n     thousands we have come together in a very special place-\n     nestled between the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains--a \n     place where we worked hard, played hard, made lifelong \n     friends, and have spent some of the best years of our lives. \n     Paraphrasing the legendary Bob Hope, ``Middlebury: Thanks for \n     the Memories.''\n       I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Class \n     of 2000--individually and collectively--for your \n     achievements. I also want to thank the Board of Trustees, the \n     administration, faculty, and staff for providing us the very \n     best. And I especially want to thank our parents and families \n     for paying for it.\n       At our centennial celebration one hundred years ago, the \n     Middlebury Register characterized it as the ``day of days for \n     the undergraduate.'' Today, a century later, is most \n     certainly our day of days and one that we will celebrate and \n     remember forever with great pride, for as Emerson noted, \n     ``The reward of a thing well done, is to have done it.''\n       Middlebury College began in 1800 under the direction of \n     President Jeremiah Atwater in a small building with only \n     seven students. As we see almost 200 hundred years later, \n     more than 2000 students larger, under the direction of \n     President John McCardell, much has changed.\n       Built for only $8,000, Painter Hall, constructed between \n     1814 and 1816, is currently the oldest building on campus. \n     Although it stands the same today, the environment and the \n     atmosphere around it do not.\n       Admittance into Middlebury in 1815 used to consist of a \n     forty-minute oral examination in Latin, Greek and arithmetic. \n     Remembering back four years ago, I could only wish the \n     process was as simple.\n       But today, thanks to the efforts of many, Middlebury is \n     blessed with a stronger, more diverse student body than it \n     has ever had.\n       We have seen the number of applicants to Middlebury grow \n     steadily over the past four years.\n       We have seen the number of minorities on campus grow over \n     the past four years.\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\n       Most importantly, we have seen Middlebury's reputation grow \n     and spread all over the United States and to dozens of \n     countries across the world.\n       Our accomplishment and our experiences have taught us a lot \n     about ourselves and about Middlebury College. As we strive to \n     promote a more diverse environment, we find ourselves \n     struggling to come to terms with many difficult questions and \n     issues. In answering these, let us turn to the lessons taught \n     to us by three prominent Middlebury graduates.\n       Roswell Field graduated from Middlebury College in 1822. \n     Upon his departure from the College, he became a lawyer, and \n     is most famous for arguing to the Supreme Court on behalf of \n     a slave named Dred Scott. Although the Court did not rule in \n     his favor, his case has taught us that intolerance and \n     bigotry cannot and should not be permitted against any group, \n     at any level.\n       Alexander Twilight received his Middlebruy diploma in 1823, \n     and in turn became the first African-American to receive a \n     college degree. Today, several minority students will walk \n     across this stage as members of the class of 2000. No doubt, \n     Mr. Twilight would be encouraged.\n       Ron Brown graduated from Middlebury in 1962. Upon his \n     arrival here, which at the time was almost all white, one \n     campus fraternity objected, saying they only permitted \n     ``White, Christian'' members, Brown and other members of his \n     fraternity chose to fight. In time our local chapter was \n     expelled, but because of his efforts, Middlebury, more \n     importantly, made it college policy that no exclusionary \n     chapters would exist on campus.\n       Ron Brown had an exemplary professional career serving as \n     Secretary of Commerce until his death in a tragic plane crash \n     in 1996. Jesse Jackson once said of him, ``He learned to be a \n     bridge between the cultures.'' I hope we all can remember \n     that lesson here today. A lesson, no doubt, Ron Brown learned \n     at Middlebury College.\n       We've come a long way since these individuals were here, \n     but we still have a long way to go.\n       I am a son of the South. I came a far distance to go to \n     school here. Acceptance to Middlebury was my own impossible \n     dream.\n       I graduated from Little Rock Central High School where 43 \n     years ago nine African-American students were denied \n     admittance prompting a constitutional crisis our nation had \n     not seen since the Civil War.\n       While much progress has been made, today in parts of the \n     Mississippi Delta region of our own country--just a couple of \n     hours from my home--there is poverty at its very worst.\n       Several years ago the late Senator Everett Dirksen of \n     Illinois was speaking at a ceremony at the Gettysburg \n     Battlefield where he said, ``Men died here and men are \n     sleeping here who fought under a July sun that the nation \n     might endure: united, free, tolerant, and devoted to \n     equality. The task was unfinished. It is never quite \n     finished.''\n       He was right. It is never quite finished.\n       With our Middlebury foundation, we're now going to embark \n     on a world full of many wonderful opportunities and also of \n     many grave problems. If we can remember two important \n     lessons, our lives and certainly our world will be a much \n     better place. First, the future can always be better than the \n     present. And second, we have a responsibility to ensure that \n     that is the case. It is a responsibility we have to \n     ourselves, to our communities, to Middlebury and most \n     importantly to those who are not as fortunate to be here, \n     among us, today.\n       This afternoon we leave Middlebury with a greater knowledge \n     of various academic fields, the world and ourselves. We also \n     leave Middlebury young and energetic, bound closer to one \n     another more than we probably ever will be through our \n     friendships, our relationships, and our experiences. And with \n     that we now have the opportunity to help and serve others.\n       Robert Kennedy said, ``This world demands the qualities of \n     youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of \n     will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage \n     over timidity, of the appetite of adventure over the love of \n     ease.''\n       Today, we make history as the first graduating class of \n     Middlebury's third century. It is an accomplishment that I'm \n     sure makes our families, our friends, and those close and \n     important to us very proud as well. So let us always remember \n     this day, May 21, 2000 as our day of days--our historic day. \n     And very soon will all embark on separate journeys and begin \n     a new and exciting chapter in our lives.\n       In doing so, let us not forget the famous words of Tennyson \n     who wrote, ``That which we are, we are, one equal temper of \n     heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in \n     will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.''\n       And for the class of 2000, the world now awaits and the \n     best is yet to be.\n       Good Luck and Congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO EZRA KOCH\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the days of the \nOregon Trail, my state has been blessed with citizens dedicated to the \nspirit of ``neighbor helping neighbor.'' In every community in Oregon \nyou can find men and women who give their time, effort, and money to \nmaking that community a better place in which to live, work, and raise \na family. That is precisely what Ezra Koch has done in the community of \nMcMinnville, and I am proud to pay tribute to him today.\n  After over half a century of service as one of McMinnville's and \nYamhill County's most respected businessmen, Ezra is retiring as \nPresident of City Sanitary and Recycling. A native Canadian, who \nimmigrated to Oregon nearly eight years ago, Ezra and his family have \ntruly lived the American dream.\n  Under Ezra's leadership, City Sanitary and Recycling, and its parent \ncompany KE Enterprises, has become one of Oregon's leading sanitary \ncompanies--leading the effort to increase recycling long before it \nbecame a national cause. Ezra was the driving force behind the creation \nof the Oregon Refuse and Recycling Association, and served as president \nof the National Solid Waste Management Association.\n  Ezra's love of his community can truly be seen in his volunteer and \nphilanthropic efforts. The list of organizations and causes that have \nbenefitted from his leadership and generosity include Linfield College, \nthe McMinnville School District, Rotary International, the McMinnville \nChamber of Commerce, and the United Way.\n  Ezra credits his family with inspiring the values he has lived \nthroughout his life. And his words are ones we should all take to \nheart. ``Even though we were a big family with poverty everywhere, we \nnever lacked for enough to eat and share with others. A great tradition \nwas born in our family of sharing what we have with those that are less \nfortunate, and that continues today.''\n  I salute Ezra Koch for all he has done to strengthen the Oregon \ntradition of neighbor helping neighbor, and I wish him many more years \nof health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5306-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5306-S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOUR BEARS BRIDGE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the \nAppropriations Committee, and particularly subcommittee Chairman Shelby \nand Senator Lautenberg for their work on the Transportation \nappropriations bill that the Senate passed yesterday. However, I am \ngravely concerned about the omission of an item included in the \nPresident's budget request for Three Affiliated Tribes on the Fort \nBerthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. The President included $5 \nmillion for the design and preliminary engineering of the Four Bears \nBridge on Fort Berthold Reservation. This bill makes no reference to \nthis funding request. I am concerned that this will provide the federal \ngovernment with yet another excuse for not replacing a bridge that is \nclearly its responsibility to replace.\n  This bridge, originally constructed in 1934 on another part of the \nreservation, was erected at its current site by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers in 1952 during construction of the Garrison Dam. Because the \nGarrison Dam project created a permanent flood in the form of Lake \nSakakawea on the Fort Berthold Reservation, the bridge became necessary \nto connect the west and the east sides of the Reservation.\n  Mr. President, Senator Campbell, chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, shares my concerns that the Four Bears Bridge was not \nincluded in the bill as requested by the Administration. The reason \nthat this bridge is necessary is because the federal government created \na lake bisecting the Reservation. Now there's a situation on Fort \nBerthold where emergency vehicles, school buses, police and general \nlocal traffic are forced to cross a bridge that is only 22 feet wide. \nThis kind of a bridge was built for the small cars of the 1930s--not \nfor the large vehicles common today. It is also important to note that \nthis bridge is one of the few crossing points along the Missouri River \nin North Dakota, making it a vital connection for all traffic--\nincluding large truck traffic--moving across the state.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I, too, am concerned about the situation on the Fort \nBerthold Reservation. In the Indian Affairs Committee, my colleagues \nand I struggle with how to meet the many responsibilities that the \nfederal government has to Indian tribes across the nation. There is a \nmounting crisis in Indian country in a range of areas and \ntransportation is among the critical needs of tribes. Including the \nFour\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nBears Bridge in this bill as requested by the President is vital to \naddressing the emergency needs on the Fort Berthold Reservation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is clearly a Federal responsibility. \nA Federal project created Lake Sakakawea and flooded a significant \nportion of the reservation, thus creating the need for this bridge. In \n1992, Congress accepted the recommendations of the Joint Tribal \nAdvisory Commission, which studied the impact of the Garrison \nReservoir, created by the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Project, on the \nThree Affiliated Tribes. The Commission found that the Three Affiliated \nTribes are entitled to replacement of infrastructure lost by the \ncreation of the Garrison Dam and Lake Sakakawea. The Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to the Three Affiliated Tribes to play a major \nrole in providing for the infrastructure necessitated by the permanent \nflood created by this project.\n  Mr. President, will the Chairman of the Subcommittee also support \nfunding this bridge as recommended by President Clinton?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I recognize that the Four Bears Bridge is an important \npriority for my colleagues and I will work with Senator Dorgan, Senator \nConrad, Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Campbell and Indian Affairs \nCommittee Vice Chairman Inouye to identify funding for the bridge in \nthe Transportation appropriations bill when it goes to \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/16/senate-section/article/S5307-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE SAVANNAH STATE UNIVERSITY BASEBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmost successful college baseball regular season in history. This year, \nthe Savannah State University, SSU, Tigers set a new National \nCollegiate Athletic Association record for the most consecutive wins--\nan incredible 46. Led by their coach, Jamie Rigdon, a former Savannah \nState graduate, the Tigers played with all their heart despite the \nknowledge that they would not be able to participate in NCAA Regional \nPlayoffs because they are in the process of moving from NCAA Division \nII to Division I.\n  The historic season began with twelve straight victories over their \nfellow Division II rivals. In February, the Tigers defeated Florida A \nin what would become the first of many Division I opponents to meet \ntheir match in Savannah State. As the season wore on, the Tigers kept \nplaying hard each and every day and, on March 19 they were rewarded for \ntheir efforts with an amazing 34th consecutive victory, thereby \nbreaking the NCAA record. However, Savannah State's celebration was cut \nshort when it learned that a Division III school in Ohio reported that \nit won 40 consecutive games the season before but had failed to notify \nthe NCAA's official record keepers. While the media and officials \ndebated which team held the record, the Tigers kept winning. In the \nend, the Savannah State University baseball team had won an astonishing \n46 consecutive game, shattering every record in the books and laying \nindisputable claim to the most successful regular season in college \nbaseball history.\n  In addition to their consecutive win streak, the Tigers compiled many \nimpressive statistics this year. For example, each SSU starter batted \nover .330 for the season, the starters fielding average was .947, and \nthe team's earned run average was an incredible 2.30 for the entire \nseason.\n  I recognize each Tiger player from the record setting team: Brett \nHiggins, captain; Torrie Pinkins; Derron Street; Jarvis Johnson; Robert \nSettle; Roderick Ricks; Marcus Griffin; Mike Eusebio; Lamar Leverett; \nMarcus Johnson; Richard Castillo; Guy Thigpen; Chris Cesario; Charles \nBrown; Isaiah Brown; James Runkle; Jeremy Batayias; J.J. Stevens; James \nGreig; and Shantwone Dent.\n  Savannah State University President, Carlton E. Brown, spoke highly \nof the student athletes saying that, ``the members of the Savannah \nState University baseball team are not just extraordinary athletes, \nthey are exceptional students and model citizens. Even without the \nprospect of post-season play, the team put its heart and soul into each \ngame. The team exemplifies the Savannah State University motto, which \nis `You can get anywhere from here.' '' I agree with President Brown \nthat these young men can get anywhere with their education from \nSavannah State just as they went from the baseball diamond and into the \nrecord books.

A bill to expand the Federal tax refund intercept program to \ncover children who are not minors; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     CHILD SUPPORT FAIRNESS AND TAX REFUND INTERCEPTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Kohl, Graham, and Lincoln in introducing the Child Support \nFairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2000.\n  The Child Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2000 \ncloses a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the \neligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child \nsupport orders--that of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents \nwho are delinquent in paying their court-ordered financial support for \ntheir children.\n  Under current law, eligibility for the federal tax refund offset \nprogram is limited to cases involving minors, parents on public \nassistance, or adult children who are disabled. Custodial parents of \nadult, non-disabled children are not assisted under the IRS tax refund \nintercept program, and in many cases, they must work multiple jobs in \norder to make ends meet. Some of these parents have gone into debt to \nput their college-age children through school.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will address this inequity \nby expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program \nto cover parents of all children, regardless of whether the child is \ndisabled or a minor. This legislation will not create a cause of action \nfor a custodial parent to seek additional child support. It will merely \nassist the custodial parent in recovering debt that is owed for a level \nof child support that was determined by a court.\n  Improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that \nshould be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent Government statistics, \nthere are approximately twelve million active cases in which a child \nsupport order requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the \nsupport of his or her child. Of the $13.7 billion owed in 1998, only \n$6.9 billion has been collected. It is important to note that this data \ndoes not include reporting from many states, including Callifornia, New \nYork, Florida, and Illinois. In 1998, only 23 percent of children \nentitled to child support through our public system received some form \nof payment, despite Federal and State efforts. Similar shortfalls in \nprevious years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately \n$47 billion. We can fix this injustice in our Federal tax refund offset \nprogram by helping some of our most needy constituents receive the \nfinancial assistance they are owed.\n  While the administration has been somewhat successful in using tax \nrefunds as a tool to collect child support payments, more needs to be \ndone. The IRS tax refund interception program has only collected one-\nthird of tardy child support payments. The Child Support Fairness and \nTax Refund Interception Act of 2000 will remove the current barrier to \nfulfilling an individual's obligation to pay child support, while \nhelping to provide for the future of our Nation's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Fairness and \n     Tax Refund Interception Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\n       (1) Enforcing child support orders remains a serious \n     problem in the United States. There are approximately \n     12,000,000 active cases in which a child support order \n     requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the support \n     of his or her child. Of the $13,700,000,000 owed in calendar \n     year 1998 pursuant to such orders, $6,900,000,000, or 51 \n     percent, has been collected. However, this data does not \n     include reporting from many States, including California, New \n     York, Florida, and Illinois. Similar shortfalls in past years \n     have brought the combined total of child support owed to \n     $47,400,000,000 by the end of fiscal year 1997.\n       (2) It is an injustice for the Federal Government to issue \n     tax refunds to a deadbeat spouse while a custodial parent has \n     to work 2 or 3 jobs to account for the shortfall in providing \n     for their children.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) program to intercept \n     the tax refunds of parents who owe child support arrears has \n     been successful in collecting more than \\1/3\\ of such \n     arrears.\n       (4) The Congress has periodically expanded eligibility for \n     the IRS tax refund intercept program. Initially, the program \n     was limited to intercepting Federal tax refunds owed to \n     parents on public assistance. In 1984, Congress expanded the \n     program to cover refunds owed to parents not on public \n     assistance. Finally, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1990 made the program permanent and expanded the program to \n     cover refunds owed to parents of adult children who are \n     disabled.\n       (5) The injustice to the custodial parent is the same \n     regardless of whether the child is disabled, non-disabled, a \n     minor, or an adult, so long as the child support obligation \n     is provided for by a court or administrative order. It is \n     common for parents to help their adult children finance a \n     college education, a wedding, or a first home. Some parents \n     cannot afford to do that because they are recovering from \n     debt they incurred to cover expenses that would have been \n     covered if they had been paid the child support owed to them \n     in a timely manner.\n       (6) This Act would address this injustice by expanding the \n     program to cover parents of all adult children, regardless of \n     whether the child is disabled.\n       (7) This Act does not create a cause of action for a \n     custodial parent to seek additional child support. This Act \n     merely helps the custodial parent recover debt they are owed \n     for a level of child support that was set by a court after \n     both sides had the opportunity to present their arguments \n     about the proper amount of child support.\n\n     SEC. 3. USE OF TAX REFUND INTERCEPT PROGRAM TO COLLECT PAST-\n                   DUE CHILD SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO ARE \n                   NOT MINORS.\n\n       Section 464 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 664) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(A), by striking ``(as that term is \n     defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection \n     (c))''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) by striking ``(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     as used in'' and inserting ``In''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``(whether or not a minor)'' after ``a \n     child'' each place it appears; and\n       (B) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3).\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the \nChild Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act, with my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, as well as Senators Graham \nand Lincoln. This legislation is designed to increase child support \ncollections across the country by allowing more parents to secure \noverdue support payments through the tax refund offset program.\n  Child support enforcement is an issue that I care a great deal about. \nEvery day, far too many children in this country go without the \nresources they need to learn and grow in healthy, nurturing \nenvironments. Working to improve the lives and futures of these \nchildren in need should count amount our highest priorities, and we can \ndo just that by improving our system of child support enforcement.\n  This legislation that we are introducing today proposes one such \nimprovement by seeking to expand the use of an important enforcement \ntool. As my colleagues may know, under current law, custodial parents \nare eligible to use the tax refund offset program if their child \nsupport cases involve minors, adult disabled children, or parents on \npublic assistance. The offset program has played a key role in securing \noverdue support payments. In fact, along with wage withholding, the \noffset program counts as one of the most effective tools that custodial \nparents owed support have at their disposal. For the 1998 tax year, the \nfederal government collected a record $1.3 billion in overdue support \nthrough the tax offset program, an 18 percent increase over the \nprevious year and a 99 percent increase since 1992. These collections \nyielded benefits to approximately 1.4 million families.\n  Yet despite these admirable gains, under current law, the benefits of \nthe tax refund offset program are not available to other custodial \nparents, those who have adult children, who are rightfully owed past-\ndue support. Our legislation would address this issue by allowing all \nparents who are owed overdue court-ordered support to be eligible for \nthe offset program, regardless of whether their child is disabled or a \nminor. We believe that this straightforward change will both increase \nchild support collections and help ease the burdens of many custodial \nparents. It will assist those parents who may have worked multiple jobs \nand struggled to provide for their children but who may still have \ndifficulty recovering child support debt owed to them without the \nassistance of the offset program.\n  Our Nation's unacceptably low rate of child support enforcement is a \nnational crisis. Our public system collects only 23 percent of its \ncaseload, and over $47 billion in overdue support is owed to our \nnation's children. Clearly, we must do all we can to address this very \nserious problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senators Chafee, Graham, Lincoln, \nand myself is supporting this important legislation. It will expand one \neffective tool in the enforcement arsenal and help increase the \nresources available to families in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2748.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a common sense \npiece of legislation that would prohibit the rescheduling or \nforgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the United States \nby the Government of the Russian Federation until the President of the \nUnited States certifies to the Congress that Russia has ceased all \noperations and permanently closed its intelligence facility at Lourdes, \nCuba. Currently the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a \nsignals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba from which it conducts \nintelligence activities directed against the United States. The \nSecretary of Defense has reported that the Russian Federation leases \nthe Lourdes facility for an estimated $100 to $300 million every year. \nThis is several hundred million dollars flowing to support a brutal \ntyrant for the purpose of supporting espionage.\n  Mr. President, the United States should prohibit debt rescheduling \nand forgiveness for a country that is conducting espionage activities \nagainst America, while infusing Castro's despotic government with \nbetween $100 million and $300 million per year.\n  I am pleased to have my colleague from New Jersey as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nquickly pass this important bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2748\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the Russian Federation maintains an \n     agreement with the Government of Cuba which allows Russia to \n     operate an intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense has formally expressed \n     concerns to the Congress regarding the espionage complex at \n     Lourdes, Cuba, and its use as a base for intelligence \n     activities directed against the United States.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense, referring to a 1998 Defense \n     Intelligence Agency assessment, has reported that the Russian \n     Federation leases the Lourdes facility for an estimated \n     $100,000,000 to $300,000,000 a year.\n       (4) It has been reported that the Lourdes facility is the \n     largest such complex operated by the Russian Federation and \n     its intelligence service outside the region of the former \n     Soviet Union.\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\n       (5) The Lourdes facility is reported to cover a 28 square-\n     mile area with over 1,500 Russian engineers, technicians, and \n     military personnel working at the base.\n       (6) Experts familiar with the Lourdes facility have \n     reportedly confirmed that the base has multiple groups of \n     tracking dishes and its own satellite system, with some \n     groups used to intercept telephone calls, faxes, and computer \n     communications, in general, and with other groups used to \n     cover targeted telephones and devices.\n       (7) News sources have reported that the predecessor regime \n     to the Government of the Russian Federation had obtained \n     sensitive information about United States military operations \n     during Operation Desert Storm through the Lourdes facility.\n       (8) Academic studies assessing the threat the Lourdes \n     espionage station poses to the United States cite official \n     United States sources affirming that the Lourdes facility is \n     being used to collect personal information about United \n     States citizens in the private and government sectors, and \n     offers the means to engage in cyberwarfare against the United \n     States.\n       (9) It has been reported that the operational significance \n     of the Lourdes facility has grown dramatically since February \n     7, 1996, when then Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, issued \n     an order demanding that the Russian intelligence community \n     increase its gathering of United States and other Western \n     economic and trade secrets.\n       (10) It has been reported that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation is estimated to have spent in excess of \n     $3,000,000,000 in the operation and modernization of the \n     Lourdes facility.\n       (11) Former United States Government officials have been \n     quoted confirming reports about the Russian Federation's \n     expansion and upgrade of the Lourdes facility.\n       (12) It was reported in December 1999 that a high-ranking \n     Russian military delegation headed by Deputy Chief of the \n     General Staff Colonel-General Valentin Korabelnikov visited \n     Cuba to discuss the continuing Russian operation of the \n     Lourdes facility.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPORT ON THE CLOSING OF THE INTELLIGENCE FACILITY AT \n                   LOURDES, CUBA.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and every 120 days thereafter until the President \n     makes a certification under section 3, the President shall \n     submit to the Committee on International Relations and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate a report \n     (with a classified annex)
