The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce this amendment to the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill with my\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions. This \namendment is also cosponsored by Senator Grams of Minnesota, Senator \nBryan, Senator Lugar, Senator Reid, Senator Voinovich, and Senator \nBrownback. This amendment has one very important purpose: to ensure \nthat the rights of this Congress and all fifty states are not trampled \non by an unelected Cabinet official.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. It extends the current \nmoratorium on the Secretary of the Interior's ability to finalize the \nrules that were published on January 22d, 1998 until eight months after \nCongress receives the report of the National Gambling Impact Study \nCommission. Since the Commission is due to deliver its report to \nCongress no later than June 20th of this year, this moratorium would \ngive Congress until as late as next February to consider the findings \nand advice of the commission we established to study the impact of \ngambling. This amendment also prohibits the Secretary of the Interior \nfrom approving any tribal-state gambling agreement which has not first \nbeen approved by the tribe and the state in question during this \nmoratorium.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that the current moratorium, which \nexpires on March 31st, be extended. If it is not extended and the rules \nin question are finalized, the Secretary of the Interior would have the \nability to bypass all fifty state governments in approving casino \ngambling on Indian Tribal lands.\n  Mr. President, this is the fourth time in two years the Senate has \nhad to deal with this issue of Indian gambling, and I regret that an \namendment is once again necessary on this year's Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. However, I believe it is imperative that Congress \nconsiders the recommendations of our own commission on gambling before \nallowing an unelected Cabinet official to make a major policy change in \nthe area of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands.\n  For the last two years, I have offered amendments to the Interior \nappropriations bills prohibiting Secretary Babbitt from approving any \nnew tribal-state gambling compacts that had not first been approved by \nthe State in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Both of \nthose amendments passed the Senate on voice votes. Both of these \namendments were agreed to by the House in Conference. Only at the \neleventh hour during negotiations with the White House was the length \nof the moratorium on last year's bill shortened to 6 months. The \nmessage we sent to the Interior Department through these amendments was \nclear. Congress does not believe it is appropriate for the Secretary of \nthe Interior to bypass Congress and the states in an issue as important \nas whether or not casino gambling will be allowed within the state \nborders.\n  Mr. President, for the past two years when we have debated this issue \nthere have been lobbyists who have tried to paint this amendment as a \nLas Vegas protection bill. There are some lobbying groups that are \ntrying that same tactic again this year. I want everyone to be \nperfectly clear on this point. This amendment is designed primarily for \nthose states that do not allow gambling--particularly those that do not \nallow electronic gambling and especially those states that do not allow \nslot machines. The interest in this amendment from gambling states \nstems simply from these members sincere desire to have the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, enforced. Those states which have \ndecided through their state legislatures or through the initiative \nprocess that they want casino gambling have also established \nregulations and procedures to monitor this activity. This amendment \ndoes not in any way minimize the serious need for proper enforcement of \nexisting law.\n\n  Mr. President, the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee has \nintroduced legislation to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. His \ncommittee has scheduled a hearing later this month to listen to \ntestimony from a number of the parties involved in this debate. I \napplaud the senior Senator from Colorado for providing this forum. He \nhas offered to consider my thoughts and recommendations as the \ncommittee goes through the proper legislative process of considering \nchanges to existing law, and I look forward to providing some thoughts \nI have on possible changes to IGRA. I believe this is the proper manner \nto consider major changes to existing law. The committee should hold \nhearings and listen to the views of all the major parties involved, \nreport a bill, and have a debate in the Senate and House on what \nlegislation is most appropriate to fix any problems with the current \nstatute.\n  In contrast with this process, Secretary Babbitt is attempting to \nbypass Congress and all fifty states with his proposed rules. This is a \nslap in the face to Congress, to all the State governments, and to all \nthe Indian Tribes which have negotiated legitimate Tribal-State \ncompacts with the States in which they are located. The Secretary's \nrules effectively punish those tribes which have played by the rules, \nand as such, will open the floodgates to an approval process based more \non political influence than on proper negotiations between the states \nand the tribes. Who will be the winners under Secretary Babbitt's new \nregime? Will it be the Tribes that donate enough money to the right \npolitical party? In contrast, our amendment will make sure that the \nunelected Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, won't single-\nhandedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change \nto IGRA is done the right way--legislatively.\n  Actually, the timing of Secretary Babbitt's attempt to delegate \nhimself new authority is rather ironic. Last March, Attorney General \nJanet Reno requested an independent counsel to investigate Secretary \nBabbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-state gambling license to an \nIndian Tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have to wait for \nIndependent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her investigation \nbefore any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident that serious \nquestions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's judgment and \nobjectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts.\n  The very fact that Attorney General Reno believed there was specific \nand credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient \nto make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant \nhimself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the states in the \narea of Tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this investigation \nshould have taught us an important lesson: we in Congress should not \nallow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to \nusurp the rightful role of Congress and the states in addressing the \ndifficult question of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands.\n\n  Mr. President, the Secretary has not given any indication in the 11 \nmonths since the independent counsel was appointed that he should be \ntrusted with new, self-appointed trust responsibilities over Indian \nTribes. On February 22d of this year, United States District Judge \nRoyce Lamberth issued a contempt citation against Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt and Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, \nKevin Gover, for disobeying the Court's orders in a trial in which the \nInterior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were sued for \nmismanagement of American Indian trust funds.\n  In his contempt citation, Judge Lamberth stated, and I quote,\n\n       The court is deeply disappointed that any litigant would \n     fail to obey orders for production of documents, and then \n     conceal and cover up that disobedience with outright false \n     statements that the court then relied upon. But when that \n     litigant is the federal government, the misconduct is even \n     more troubling. I have never seen more egregious misconduct \n     by the federal government.\n\nThis conduct has raised such concern that both the Indian Affairs \nCommittee and the Energy Committee have held hearings to call Secretary \nBabbitt to task for his mismanagement of these funds and his disregard \nfor the rulings of a federal court. The Secretary's continued violation \nof his trust obligations to Indian Tribes should serve as a wake-up \ncall to all of us in the Senate. This is not the time to allow the \nSecretary to delegate to himself new, unauthorized, powers.\n  I should add that lobbyists for the various tribes and \nrepresentatives in the White House have made it abundantly clear that \nSecretary Babbitt fully intends to finalize his proposed rules once the \ncurrent moratorium expires. Our only way to stop this effort is to \nattach another amendment on this Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \nbill. This is a real emergency!\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\n Let me assure you, if Secretary Babbitt has his way, there will be no \nneed for the Tribes to resolve problems involving gambling and IGRA in \nand with their States.\n  I do believe that this issue could be resolved with hearings and a \nbill--actual legislation from Congress. But those hearings won't happen \nas long as the tribes anticipate the clout of a Secretary's rule that \nbypasses the states. Yes, the courts have ruled that current law--which \nwas passed by Congress, not an appointed Secretary--gives an edge in \nthe bargaining process to the States. But that process has worked. If \nthere is a need to change that process, it should only be changed by a \nbill passed by Congress--not by rule or regulation.\n  I must stress that if we do not maintain the status quo, there will \nnever be any essential involvement by the states in the final decision \nof whether to allow casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. There will \nbe no compromise reached. The Secretary will be given the right to \nbypass us, the Congress of the United States, and to run roughshod over \nthe states.\n  Again, I would like to stress that this amendment does not amend the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, but holds the status quo for another \neleven months. Three years ago, Congress voted to establish a national \ncommission to study the social and economic impacts of legalized \ngambling in the United States. One of the aspects the commission is \ncurrently analyzing is the impact of gambling on tribal communities. \nThis commission is now winding down its work and is set to deliver its \nreport to Congress no later than June 20th of this year.\n\n  It is significant that this commission--the very commission Congress \ncreated for the purpose of studying gambling--sent a letter to \nSecretary Babbitt last year asking him not to go forward with his \nproposed rules. I think it would be wise of this body to follow the \nadvice of the very commission we created to study the issue of \nlegalized gambling.\n  I want to emphasize again that we are the body that asked for this \ncommission. We created the commission to look at all gambling. The \nAmerican taxpayers are already paying for the study. The commission is \nnearing the end of its work. We need to let them finish. They have \nasked Secretary Babbitt not to make any changes while they do their \nwork. My amendment would give them that time.\n  The Judicial Branch has already preserved the integrity of current \nlaw. This amendment supports that. The President has twice approved my \namendment, in the FY98 Interior appropriations bill, and in the FY `99 \nOmnibus Appropriations bill. I'm asking my colleagues to take the same \n``non-action'' once again. The Committee on Indian Affairs must play a \nvery important role here. They need to hold hearings and write \nlegislation which specifically addresses this issue and then put it \nthrough the process. They will have time to do that if this amendment \nis agreed to. This amendment would support giving the Indian Affairs \nCommittee and Congress, as a whole, time to develop an appropriate \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, the Enzi-Sessions amendment is strongly endorsed by \nthe National Governor's Association.\n  This amendment is also supported by the National Association of \nAttorneys General. We have also received a number of letters from \nindividual state Attorneys General in support of this amendment. This \namendment is also supported by the National League of Cities.\n  I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing \nTribal-State compacts. It does not, in any way, prevent states and \nTribes from entering into compacts where both parties are willing to \nagree on class III gambling on Tribal lands within a state's borders. \nThis amendment does ensure that all the stakeholders must be involved \nin the process--Congress, the Tribes, the States, and the \nAdministration.\n\n  Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming \nwould be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent \na lot of money. The even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a \nlot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the \nspokesman for the opposition. When we first got our meager organization \ntogether, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor \nof gambling. When the election was held casino gambling lost by over 62 \npercent--and it lost in every single county of our state. The 40 point \nswing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue \nand implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. That's a pretty solid \nmessage. We don't want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote \nin my state have debated it and made their choice. Any federal \nbureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will only inject \nanimosity.\n  Why did we have that decisive of a vote? We used a couple of our \nneighboring states to review the effects of their limited casino \ngambling. We found that a few people make an awful lot of money at the \nexpense of everyone else. When casino gambling comes into a state, \ncommunities are changed forever. And everyone agrees there are costs to \nthe state. There are material costs, with a need for new law \nenforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are social costs. \nAnd, not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but once it is \ninstituted, the revenues can be addictive too. But I'm not here to \ndebate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to maintain the \nstatus quo so we can develop a legislative solution, rather than have a \nbureaucratic mandate.\n  Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society \nas a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A state's law \nenforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously \nimpacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian Tribal lands. \nTherefore, a state's popularly elected representatives should have a \nsay in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on \nIndian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an \nunelected cabinet official. Passing the Enzi-Sessions amendment will \nkeep all the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all \nthe parties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the \ntime it needs to hear all the sides and work on legislation to fix any \nproblems that exist in the current system. I urge my colleagues to \nstand up for the constitutional role of Congress--and for the rights of \nall fifty states--by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referenced \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          National Gambling Impact\n\n\n                                             Study Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Babbitt: As you are aware, the 104th \n     Congress created the National Gambling Impact Study \n     Commission to study the social and economic impacts of \n     legalized gambling in the United States. Part of our study \n     concerns the policies and practices of tribal governments and \n     the social and economic impacts of gambling on tribal \n     communities.\n       During our July 30 meeting in Tempe, Arizona, the \n     Commission discussed the Department's ``by-pass'' provision \n     for tribes who allege that a state had not negotiated for a \n     gaming compact in good faith. The Commission voted to \n     formally request the Secretary of the Interior to stay the \n     issuance of a final rule on Indian compacting pending \n     completion of our final report. On behalf of the Commission, \n     I formally request such a stay, and trust you will honor this \n     request until you have had an opportunity to review the \n     report which we intend to release on June 20, 1999. Thank you \n     for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kay C.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: We are writing on \n     behalf of the National Governors' Association to urge you to \n     co-sponsor and support the Indian gaming amendment to the \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill sponsored by Senator Michael \n     B. Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). This \n     amendment would extend the current moratorium on the \n     secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior using \n     federal funds for approving tribal-state compacts that have \n     not been approved by the state, as required by law. The \n     amendment would also prohibit the secretary from promulgating \n     a\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\n     regulation or implementing a procedure that could result in \n     tribal Class III gaming in the absence of a tribal-state \n     compact or from going forward with any proposed rule on this \n     matter in the near future.\n       The National Governors' Association is currently in \n     discussions with Indian tribes and the U.S. Departments of \n     Interior and Justice about negotiations on amendments to the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Meetings have already \n     been held in Denver, Colorado and Oneida, Wisconsin. The \n     nation's Governors strongly believe that no statute or court \n     decision provides the secretary of the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior with authority to intervene in disputes over \n     compacts between Indian tribes and states about casino \n     gambling on Indian lands. The secretary's inherent authority \n     includes a responsibility to protect the interests of Indian \n     tribes, making it impossible for the secretary to avoid a \n     conflict of interest or to exercise objective judgment in \n     disputes between states and tribes. To avoid protracted \n     litigation, we respectfully urge Congress to adopt the Enzi/\n     Sessions amendment to extend the current moratorium and \n     prohibit the secretary from issuing a final rule.\n       Thank you for your support of this amendment. Please \n     contact us if you have any questions about our position on \n     this matter, or call Tim Masan of the National Governors' \n     Association at 202/624-5311.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Thomas R. Carper, Delaware.\n     Governor Michael O. Leavitt, Utah.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Enzi and Sessions: We write in support of \n     your proposed amendment to the FY '99 Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Bill, which would extend the existing \n     moratorium on the Secretary of the Interior's proposed \n     regulations on Indian gaming.\n       The Attorneys General continue to believe that there is no \n     statutory authority for the Secretary's proposed procedures \n     to allow tribes to obtain gaming compacts from Interior \n     rather than by negotiations with the states. We believe that \n     only amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act can \n     create the power the Secretary asserts, and we believe that \n     such amendments should occur only by way of agreement between \n     states, tribes and federal interests.\n       Continuation of the existing moratorium on the proposed \n     procedures will be a strong incentive for discussions on \n     amendments, while allowing the moratorium to lapse would be \n     likely to end the opportunity for mutually acceptable changes \n     in the Act to emerge and instead set off another lengthy bout \n     of litigation. The consensus of the Attorneys General is that \n     discussions are preferable to litigation, and that \n     continuation of the moratorium for as long as is necessary is \n     the best incentive to achieve that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nelson Kempsky,\n       Executive Director, Conference of Western Attorneys \n     General.\n     Christine Milliken,\n       Executive Director and General Counsel, National \n     Association of Attorneys General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1999.\n     Hon.

Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd: I am writing to you \n     on behalf of the National League of Cities (NLC) to urge you \n     again to support the Enzi/Sessions amendment to the FY '99 \n     Interior Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill which \n     seeks to extend the moratorium on the implementation of \n     procedures by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior until on or \n     about February 20, 2000 or eight months after the national \n     Gambling Impact Study Commission issues its report to \n     Congress. It is of the utmost importance for Congress to hear \n     and digest the Commission's findings prior to permitting any \n     new regulations from becoming final. The current moratorium \n     will expire on March 31, 1999.\n       NLC urges support of the Enzi/Sessions amendment in order \n     to maintain the status quo of the Indian Gaming Regulatory \n     Act (IGRA) and slow the creation of new trust land. While \n     further legislation is required to remove the power of the \n     Interior Secretary to administratively create enclaves that \n     would be exempt from state and local regulatory authority, \n     passage of this amendment would be an important first step in \n     this process.\n       Because passage of the Enzi/Sessions amendment would slow \n     the creation of new trust land in one narrow set of \n     circumstances, NLC urges support of this amendment as a first \n     step. The concept of allowing an appointed federal official \n     to overrule and ignore state and local land use and taxation \n     laws through the creation of trust lands flies in the face of \n     federalism and intergovernmental comity.\n       The membership of the NLC has adopted policy which declares \n     that: ``lands acquired by Native-American tribes and \n     individuals shall be given corporate, not federal trust, \n     property status.'' This policy is advocated ``in order that \n     all lands may be uniformly regulated and taxed under \n     municipal laws.''\n       The Supreme Court has ruled that provisions of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. (IGRA) violate \n     certain constitutional principles that establish the \n     obligations, immunities and privileges of the states. The \n     Interior Department appears to be determined to implement the \n     remaining provisions of IGRA despite the fact that the \n     Supreme Court decision really requires a congressional re-\n     examination of the IGRA statute and the more general topic of \n     trust land designation. For these reasons, the NLC strongly \n     urges Congress to extend the current moratorium, as proposed \n     by the Enzi/Sessions amendment at least until eight months \n     after the National Gambling Impact Study Commission issues \n     its report to Congress, or February 20, 2000.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Clarence E. Anthony,\n     Mayor, South Bay, Florida.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1998.\n\n  Protect States' Rights--Vote for the Enzi/Sessions Amendment to the \n                      Interior Appropriations Bill\n\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers the FY '99 Interior \n     appropriations bill, an amendment sponsored by Senator Enzi \n     (WY) and Senator Sessions (AL) is expected to be offered. \n     This amendment would protect states' rights in negotiating \n     tribal-state compacts, especially when negotiating casino \n     gambling.\n       Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, every state has the \n     right to be directly involved in tribal-state compacts, \n     without Federal interference. Every state also has the right, \n     as upheld by the Supreme Court in the Seminole Tribe of \n     Florida v. Florida decision, to raise its 11th Amendment \n     defense of sovereign immunity if a tribe tries to sue the \n     state for not approving a casino compact. However, in the \n     wake of the Seminole decision, the Department of Interior has \n     created new rules whereby a tribe can negotiate directly with \n     the Secretary of Interior on casino gambling compacts and \n     bypass a state's right to be involved. These new rules are a \n     gross violation of states' rights. An unelected cabinet \n     member should not be given sole authority to direct the \n     internal activities of a state, especially with regards to \n     casino gambling contracts.\n       Christian Coalition is also very concerned with the severe \n     social consequences of casino gambling. There is much \n     evidence that the rise of casino gambling leads to a rise in \n     family breakdown, crime, drug addiction and alcoholism. With \n     such staggering repercussions, it is vital that Tribal-State \n     gambling compacts remain within each individual state and not \n     be commandeered by an unelected federal official.\n       The Enzi/Sessions amendment would prohibit the Secretary of \n     Interior, during fiscal year 1999, from establishing or \n     implementing any new rules that allow the Secretary to \n     circumvent a state in negotiating a tribal-state compact when \n     the state raises its 11th amendment defense of sovereign \n     immunity. It also prohibits the Secretary from approving any \n     tribal-state compact which has not first been approved by the \n     state.\n       Christian Coalition urges you to protect states' rights and \n     vote for the Enzi/Sessions amendment to the FY '98 Interior \n     appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Jeffrey K. Taylor,\n\n                                                Acting Director of\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am opposed the Enzi-Reid amendment on \nIndian gaming because it will continue the ``stand-off'' that exists \nbetween the tribes and states, preventing them from reaching fair \ngaming agreements.\n  There are members in the Chamber who are downright against gaming. \nThat is not what this debate is about.\n  Under Federal law, tribes are limited to the types of gaming allowed \nunder the laws of the State in which they reside. In my own State of \nColorado as an example, there are two tribes, the Southern Ute and the \nUte Mountain Ute. They are limited to slot machines and low-stakes \ntable games, just as the other gaming towns in Colorado.\n  In Utah, State law prohibits all gaming: tribal, non-tribal or \notherwise. The intention of the Federal law, IGRA, was that in States \nwhere gaming is limited or prohibited, tribes would be limited or \nprohibited from operating gaming as well.\n  But today's debate is about whether a Governor of a State can limit a \ntype of business activity to certain groups simply by refusing to \nnegotiate. That is unfair and un-American.\n  There are many tribes and States that have sat down and negotiated \nsuch agreements that are binding and effective.\n  There are some States that refuse to negotiate at all with tribes--\nleaving\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nthose tribes without the ability to conduct gaming and without the \nability to generate much-needed revenues.\n  This is the core problem: whether accomplished through legislation, \nthrough the kind of secretarial procedures we are talking about today, \nor whether through tribal-State negotiations, these impasses should be \nbrought to an end.\n  Let's not forget how we got here. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in \nCabazon that unless a State prohibited gaming entirely, such as Utah \nand Hawaii now do, the State's regulations would not apply to gaming \nconducted on Indian lands within that State.\n  This caused a clamor by the States and a year later the Congress \nresponded by passing the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  This act was a compromise and for the first time gave State \ngovernments a role in what kind of gaming would occur on Indian \nreservations within a State's borders.\n  In 1996, the High Court ruled in Seminole that tribes cannot sue \nStates and require them to negotiate for gaming compacts. Some States, \nhave used the Seminole case to refuse to talk to tribes completely.\n  That is unfair at the very least. As my colleagues know, I am a big \nsupporter of tribal-State negotiations on matters from business \ndevelopment, to jurisdictional issues, to taxes. If it is good enough \nfor tribes to have to negotiate, it is good enough for States as well.\n  So while I think that each State's public policy should determine the \nscope of all gaming conducted in that State, I also believe the current \nState of the law gives States what is in reality a Veto over tribes in \nthis field.\n  I was here in 1988, in fact, and helped write the IGRA legislation, \nand I can tell you it was never the intent of Congress to provide such \na veto.\n  I should point out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian \ngaming is promoted and even operated by State governments, so there is \nan element of competition. I believe some States have refused to \nnegotiate in order to preserve their monopoly on gaming.\n  To begin to address this situation, the Department of Interior has \nproposed a process that is based on the IGRA statute. Though the \nprocess does need refinement, I do not believe the secretary should be \nstopped from developing alternative approaches to these impasses.\n  Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anybody in this \nchamber of States rights, but those who say this process overrides the \nStates are wrong.\n  Under the proposal, if a State objected to a decision made by the \nInterior Secretary, that State could challenge that decision in Federal \ncourt.\n  For those who fear the department is acting without oversight, I \npoint out that Congress will have the authority to review any proposed \nregulations before they take effect.\n  As the proposal comes before the authorizing committees, any new \nregulations will get a careful review and if those regulations are \nfound to be unacceptable, they simply will not pass. We will legislate \na new approach if they do not pass.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and allow the \nregulatory and legislative process to work.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by Senators Enzi, Sessions, Gramms, Bryan, Lugar, Reid, \nVoinovich and Brownback, which would impose a moratorium on the \nInterior Secretary's authority to promulgate final regulations or to \nissue a notice of proposed rulemaking related to procedures which would \nprovide a means for securing a tribal-state compact governing the \nconduct of class III gaming on Indian lands.\n  Mr. President, in 1988, I served as the primary sponsor of the bill \nthat was later enacted into law as the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. \nThat Act provides a comprehensive framework for the conduct of gaming \non Indian lands, including a means by which the state and tribal \ngovernments, as sovereigns, may enter into compacts for the conduct of \nclass III gaming on tribal lands.\n  The Act further provides that should a state and tribal government \nreach an impasse in the negotiations that would otherwise lead to a \ntribal-state compact, a tribal government or a state government could \ninitiate a legal action in a federal district court pursuant to which a \ncourt could: (1) rule on the parties' substantive interpretations of \nlaw that gave rise to the impasse, thereby resolving the matter; or (2) \norder the parties to either resume negotiations or enter into a process \nof mediation.\n  However, in the intervening years, the United States Supreme Court \nhas ruled that a state may assert its sovereign immunity to suit if a \nlegal action is initiated by a tribal government, thereby divesting a \nfederal court of its jurisdiction, and that the Congress lacks the \nauthority to waive a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit.\n  Since that time, various members of the Committee on Indian Affairs \nhave proposed an array of alternatives to the Act's compacting process, \nbut each time, either the states or the tribes have opposed these \nmeasures. So the Interior Secretary stepped into the breach, and \ninvited comments on his authority to promulgate rules for an \nalternative means of securing the authority to conduct class III gaming \non Indian lands.\n  This has been a constructive effort on the Secretary's part, for \nwhich he is to be commended.\n  Mr. President, twenty-one states have entered into compacts with \ntribal governments over the last eleven years. There are only a few \nstates in which tribal-state negotiations have been frustrated, and \nthis amendment effectively precludes those tribal governments that have \nyet to secure a compact, from exploring an alternative route, as \nprescribed by the Secretary, and gives the states an absolute veto \npower over tribal gaming--a result that the Act was clearly intended to \navoid.\n  Not only does this amendment cut off the rights that tribes have \nunder the Supreme Court's ruling in California v. Cabazon Band of \nMission Indians, the amendment ties the Secretary's authority to the \nsubmittal of a Commission report that has no legal on these matters. \nThe National Gambling Impact Study Commission was authorized to examine \nand assess all forms of gaming in the United States, as well as \ngambling-related issues, including the conduct of state lotteries.\n  Mr. President, there are many of us in the Congress who are opposed \nto gaming, and as Indian country well knows, I include myself in the \nranks of those members. Hawaii is one of only two states in our Union \nthat prohibits all forms of gaming. But I don't see anyone in this body \nproposing to impose a moratorium on the conduct of state lotteries \nuntil eight months after the Commission submits its report to the \nCongress.\n  Nonetheless, tribal government-sponsored gaming is most analogous to \nthe lotteries operated by state governments. Federal law--the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act--clearly and unequivocally provides that tribal \ngaming revenues may only be used to support the provision of \ngovernmental services by tribal governments to reservation residents--\nboth Indian and non-Indian.\n  Mr. President, I must take exception to some of the representations \nthat have been made about this amendment. For instance, that the \namendment ``protects States' rights without harming Indian Tribes''.\n  A right to conduct gaming free of any State involvement was confirmed \nby the United State Supreme Court in May of 1997. Let us be clear about \nthis--what this amendment does is take away that right.\n  The proponents of this amendment also assert that their amendment \nwould maintain ``the status quo of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act''. \nHowever, we should also equally clear about this--this amendment does \nnot preserve the status quo. Rather it strips tribal governments of \nrights that have been confirmed by the Supreme Court, and rather than \npreserving the status quo, it vests the states with a right they never \nhad under the rulings of the Supreme Court or any other Federal law--\nnamely, a veto power over the conduct of gaming on tribal lands--lands \nand activities over which the states do not have the right to exercise \ntheir jurisdiction. This is what the Supreme Court has ruled. This \namendment would subvert the rulings of the Supreme Court in this area, \nand I believe our colleagues in the Senate\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\nshould be aware that the amendment does precisely that.\n  I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nallowing me to introduce this important amendment with him. I want to \ncongratulate him for his good work on an issue that is, at its heart, a \nmatter of great concern to those of us who believe that the Federal \nGovernment often goes too far in exerting its will on the individual \nStates. I think that the legislation that we have adopted today is good \nlegislation that recognizes the importance of protecting the ability of \nStates to regulate gambling within their borders.\n  Allow me to briefly share some of my thoughts on the importance of \nthis amendment. As Attorney General of Alabama, I cosigned a letter \nwith 25 other Attorneys General that was sent to the Secretary of the \nInterior regarding his promulgation of the rules at issue today. Every \none of the Attorneys General who signed this letter did so because we \nhad come to the same legal conclusion: the Secretary of the Interior \ndoes not have the authority to take action to promulgate regulations \nallowing class III gambling in this manner. In fact, I believe that if \nthe Secretary of the Interior were to attempt to finalize this rule and \ntake action, he would immediately be sued by States throughout this \ncountry in what would amount to expensive and protracted litigation. I \nfeel the Secretary would lose these suits, and that this amendment \noffers us the opportunity to prevent such a waste of resources on both \nthe State and Federal level from occurring.\n  This is an important issue for my State of Alabama, which has one \nfederally recognized tribe and which has not entered into a tribal-\nState gambling compact. The citizens of Alabama have consistently \nrejected the notion of allowing casino gambling within the State. If \nthe Secretary of the Interior is allowed to unilaterally provide for \nclass III casino gambling for this tribe, where the State has not \nagreed to enter into a compact and against the expressed will of the \npeople, he will also be unilaterally deciding to impose great burdens \non local communities throughout Alabama. This is because the one \nfederally recognized tribe in our State owns several parcels of \nproperty, and it is likely that once casino gambling was established in \none area it would spread to others.\n  Let me share with you a letter that the Mayor of Wetumpka, whose \ncommunity is home to one of these parcels of property, wrote me in \nreference to the undue burdens her town would face if the Secretary \nwere to step in and authorize casino gambling. Mayor Glenn writes:\n\n       Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could \n     not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. \n     The demand for greater social services that comes to areas \n     around gambling facilities could not be adequately funded. \n     Please once again convey to Secretary Babbitt our city's \n     strong and adamant opposition to the establishment of an \n     Indian gaming facility here.\n\n  Mayor Glenn's concerns about the costs to her community if the \nSecretary were able to exert this kind of authority have been seconded \nby other communities. Let me share with you an editorial that appeared \nin the Montgomery Advertiser. Montgomery is the state capital, and is \nlocated just a few miles from Wetumpka. The Advertiser wrote:\n\n       Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State \n     involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy-handed imposition \n     of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow \n     gambling here is too significant a decision economically, \n     politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive \n     State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the \n     others that would undoubtedly follow in other parts of the \n     State--has implications far too great to allow the critical \n     decision to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a \n     hand in this high stakes game.\n\n  Mr. President, the author of this editorial is correct. We should not \nallow the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate rules giving himself \nthe authority to impose drastic economic, political and social costs on \nour local communities.\n  I would also like to address another issue in connection with the \nregulations the Secretary of the Interior has proposed. If the \nSecretary is allowed to exert this kind of power, he will be in a \nposition to enrich selected tribes, potentially by millions of dollars, \nsimply by stroking a pen. I do not think this is proper. This is a \npowerful capability. Imagine the conflict of interests that could arise \nas tribes lobby the Secretary to either approve, or disapprove, \nrequests for class III casino gambling facilities. Indeed, the current \nSecretary of the Interior has already had his actions in similar \ninstances brought under investigation to see if departmental decisions \nwere influenced by campaign donations. This is unseemly, and unsound. I \nthink we should ensure that States remain a vital part of the \nnegotiating process to add legitimacy to decisions that are made.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has broad, bipartisan support. It has \nbeen supported by the National Association of Governors, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the Christian Coalition and the \nNational League of Cities. It is a reasonable, limited approach to this \nproblem and, on a more fundamental level, ensures the proper respect \nfor the role of States in deciding these issues. It reflects my public \npolicy belief that gambling decisions should be made on a rational \nbasis by the people of the State who would have to live with the \nresults of that activity, rather than by the Federal Government. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, I welcome its inclusion in \nthe Supplemental Appropriations legislation and I urge my colleagues to \nfight to preserve this provision during the conference negotiations \nwith the House.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last year, despite opposition from me, \nSenator Campbell, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \nand Senator Inouye, Vice-Chairman of our committee, the Enzi amendment \nsucceeded in suspending Secretarial authority to establish a regulatory \nroute for Indian gaming compacts until March 31, 1999. This prohibition \nprevents the Secretary of the Interior from proceeding with a \nregulatory route for tribes who have asked states to negotiate compacts \nand find the state to be unwilling.\n  Tribes lost their right to sue states under the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, IGRA, in 1996, when the Supreme Court, in the Florida \nSeminole case, determined that IGRA was unconstitutional in its \nprovisions allowing tribes to sue states. The Supreme Court upheld \nstates rights under the 11th Amendment.\n  If a state refuses to negotiate for compacts and that state allows \ngambling by any person for any purpose (all do in some form, except \nUtah and Hawaii), the Secretary of the Interior would have an \nalternative route to compacts, essentially negotiated through his \nDepartment, where he also has trust responsibility for Indian tribes.\n  New Mexico Indian tribes are opposed to the Enzi amendment, even \nthough there is no immediate effect in New Mexico. As Governor Milton \nHerrera of Tesuque Pueblo wrote, ``Section 2710 (d)(7)(B)(vii) of IGRA \nspecifically allows tribes to go directly to the Secretary and ask for \nalternative procedures to conduct Class III gaming.''\n  The Governor also objects to Congressional action on this issue \nwithout a hearing and as a violation of Senate Rule 16, which prohibits \nauthorizing legislation in an appropriations bill.\n  Governor Herrera goes on to say,\n\n       Gaming is to Indian tribes what lotteries are to state \n     governments. Indian gaming revenues are used to fund \n     essential government services including law enforcement, \n     health care services, aid for children and elderly, housing \n     and much-needed economic development. Through gaming, tribal \n     governments have been able to bring hope and opportunity to \n     some of this country's most impoverished people. Contrary to \n     popular opinion, gaming has not made Indian people rich; it \n     has only made some of us less poor.\n\n  As written, the Enzi amendment before us today would delay any \nSecretarial actions to develop alternative regulations until 8 months \nafter the expected report from the National Commission on Gambling \n(June 1999), or until February of the year 2000. If this amendment \nfails, lawsuits are expected over whether the Secretary has the legal \nright to develop these regulations that essentially skirt states rights \nto object to compacts.\n  Mr. President, given the delicate balances between sovereign states \nand tribes in IGRA, I would rather see a judicial determination of the \nSecretary's\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\nrights under IGRA to develop such regulations. Like Governor Herrera \nhas pointed out, without a hearing, it is difficult for the Senator to \nmake this judgment. For these reasons, I remain opposed to the Enzi \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment. I \nask for a voice vote on the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 111) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider that vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I was pleased to cosponsor the provision \nof the Senator from West Virginia for an Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee \nprogram when the Committee on Appropriations reported the bill to the \nSenate earlier this month. I felt then, as I do now, that many steel \ncompanies have suffered significant economic injury as a result of the \nillegal dumping of foreign steel. In my own State of Alabama, at least \none steel mill I know of is now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy \ndue to this illegal activity. I was, therefore, very pleased by the \nSenator from West Virginia's effort to address this problem and provide \nsome short-term needed relief to our steel companies. I know Senator \nSessions shares my support for this provision because of our concern \nwith the plight of local steel mills in our State of Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I too am concerned with the dilemma \nfacing our local steel mills in Alabama and I want to commend the \nSenator from West Virginia for his leadership, working, in a bipartisan \nmanner with Senators from all the steel-producing and other adversely \naffected states, to address the substantial economic injury that the \nillegal dumping of imported steel has caused across the country through \nan Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee program, which is to be part of the \nEmergency Supplemental appropriations bill, for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1999. My understanding is that the intent of the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee program is to afford all qualified steel \ncompanies with the opportunity to obtain a loan guarantee, whether or \nnot the company is now or is placed in a situation where it must seek \nto reorganize under Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy laws \nbefore the end of this year? Is my understanding of the program \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SHELBY. As you know, several companies have already been forced \ninto bankruptcy because of the ``critical circumstances'' that these \nunprecedented levels of imports have caused--Acme, Laclede, and Geneva \nSteel come to mind--and that several other companies are in a \ndistressed financial condition, including companies in West Virginia \nand Alabama. Senator Sessions and I have met with the workers of steel \ncompanies on numerous occasions since this crisis started last fall. We \nhave been told that because of this dire situation, companies are no \nlonger able to borrow money in the private sector because of the \ndisruptive and uncertain market. In which they must operate and that \nthe immediate implementation of the Emergency Steel Loan Program is \nessential to the continued viability of these companies. It is my \nunderstanding that this programs is specifically designed to encourage \nthe private sector to make such loans available and that the Board will \nexpedite its review of loan guarantee applicants that are in immediate \nneed of such financial assistance.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct. The Emergency Steel Loan program is \ndesigned to provide immediate access to necessary working capital and \nto allow companies to refinance long-term debt obligations on \nreasonable terms and conditions, which will improve their immediate \ncash flow positions so they can stay in business until this crisis \npasses. We do not want to have companies be deprived of on economic \nlife-line when they are drowning and need a helping hand.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As you know, the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I \nam a member, spent a great deal of time last year examining the \nbankruptcy law and how to improve it for both doctors and creditors, I \nam particularly concerned that companies that seek to reorganize under \nTitle 11 of the U.S. Code, are not precluded from obtaining a loan \nguarantee under this program since by definition the debts of such \ncompanies exceed their assets. Let me be specific, if a company does \nnot have traditional forms of available ``security,'' such as is \ndefined in the 11 U.S.C. Sec. 101, would the Board consider an order of \nthe federal bankruptcy judge finding that a guarantee is necessary to \nenable the company to operate its business or reorganize meets that \nrequirement?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct that the bill was written so that \n``security,'' as defined in the bill, would cover such a situation, \nhowever if further clarification is required we will work to address \nthat and similar issues so that such companies are not excluded from \nthe assistance provided in this emergency loan program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Is it the Committee's intent that the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program, established under S. 544, be made available to \nall qualified steel companies that satisfy the requisite security \nrequirements in section (h)(2) at the time loan commitment is made as \nwell as available at the time the loan becomes effective, regardless of \nwhether or not a qualified steel company is now or could be required to \nreorganize under Chapter 11 of Title II of the U.S. Code?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct, and if necessary we will clarify \nthat further.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The power of a United States bankruptcy court already \nprovide that a court may issue any order that is necessary or \nappropriate to carry out its responsibilities of the bankruptcy law to \nprotect the custody of the estate and its administration. Specifically, \n11 U.S.C. Section 364 requires a debtor to obtain the permission of the \ncourt as a prerequisite to incurring additional credit. If a United \nStates bankruptcy court determines that a qualified steel company under \nits jurisdiction requires the immediate access to a guarantee in an \namount less that $25 million, would that company be precluded from \nparticipating in the program because it has an immediate need of a \nlesser amount of guarantee than specified in section f(4)?\n  Mr. BYRD. That was not the intent of the Committee and we would \nexpect the Board to afford substantial deference to such a \ndetermination by a United States bankruptcy court and we will further \nclarify that if required.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2985-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2985-S2987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had not thought to address this \nsubject, but the opportunity presents itself here and I find that I \nhave reactions to this morning's newspaper that I would like to share \nwith the Senate.\n  There were two things that happened yesterday, both of which are \nreported in this morning's paper. I think they come together with an \ninteresting connection. The first one was a briefing held here in this \nbuilding, on the fourth floor, on the issue of Kosovo and what the \nUnited States is about to do there. Attending that briefing, \nappropriately reported in this morning's paper, were the Secretary of \nState, Secretary of Defense, the President's National Security Adviser \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Basically, they told us \nwe are on the brink of going to war; that is, that the United States is \nprepared, with its\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nNATO allies, to attack a country within its own borders to resolve a \ndispute among its own people in a way that the United States feels is \nappropriate.\n  There are those who have advised us to stay out of a civil war, not \ngo in the borders of another sovereign nation in order to resolve the \ndispute within that nation. But let us assume the stakes here are high \nenough to justify disregarding that advice. The second piece of advice \nthat we are given is, if you do go into a civil war, pick a side. It is \nnot entirely clear to me, from attending the briefing, that we know \nexactly which side we are for and what outcome we want. Because the \nthird advice that comes along is, if you are going to go into a civil \nwar and you are going to pick a side, make sure it is going to win. \nAgain, in the briefing we had yesterday I was not satisfied that those \nfour representatives of the administration had demonstrated a \ncompelling case.\n  But I do not rise to issue a challenge to them on those grounds. \nInstead, I rise because of the connection, as I say, between two \nevents: No. 1, a briefing of the Senate of the United States on the eve \nof the United States committing an act of war; and, No. 2, a report as \nto what the President of the United States was doing last night. In \nthis morning's newspaper we are told that the President conducted a \nboffo performance before a dinner made up of representatives of the \npress, that he received three standing ovations, and in the Style \nsection of the Washington Post we are told some of his best one liners. \nThis is why I find such a jarring disconnect between the President \npreparing one liners in the White House for a reporters' dinner and the \nPresident's advisers talking to the Senate about going to war.\n  During the briefing that we had in this building yesterday, prior to \nthe United States committing an act of war, we were told that one of \nthe reasons we had to go ahead with this action was because we had gone \nso far down the road, in consultation with our allies, it would damage \nour treaty obligations with our allies if we did not proceed. I must \nconfess I was offended--indeed, perhaps outraged by that logic--not \nbecause of what it said about what the administration had done with \nrespect to our allies, but because of what it said about what the \nadministration had not done with respect to its constitutional \nresponsibilities. In the Constitution of the United States, the power \nto declare war is vested in the Congress of the United States. Very \nclearly, very specifically, without equivocation, Congress shall \ndeclare war.\n\n  We are on the verge of actions that are the equivalent of the United \nStates going to war. The justification we are receiving for taking \nthose warlike actions is that the administration has made commitments \nto foreign governments. Why is the administration entering into \nconversations, consultations and other relationships with foreign \ngovernments about going to war and not talking to the Congress of the \nUnited States about going to war, instead, preparing one liners for a \ndinner with members of the press so the President can get standing \novations for his comedic abilities, the President competing with Bob \nHope and David Letterman, while the United States is on the verge of \nsending its young men and women into harm's way in a situation which, \naccording to the President's advisers, will ``take casualties''?\n  The phrase, ``we will take casualties,'' is a euphemism to say that \nAmericans are going to be killed. They are going to come home in body \nbags, and they will be killed in a war that Congress has not declared. \nThey will be killed in a war that takes place because the \nadministration has consulted with our allies and is worried about \nembarrassing themselves with our allies but cannot bother to bring \nthemselves to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to come to \nthe one agency that, under the Constitution, has the authority to \ndeclare war--that is, the Congress of the United States.\n  Indeed, in that briefing we were told that American forces will face \nthe most serious challenge militarily that we have faced since the gulf \nwar, and some said the most serious air defenses we would face since \nthe Second World War. Yet the administration does not bother to talk to \nCongress about this and gain congressional authority for these actions. \nInstead, the administration spends its time talking to our allies.\n  Don't make any mistake, I am not objecting to the fact that the \nadministration has consulted with our allies. I think that is right and \nproper that we should do that. Don't they have any sense of proportion \nor constitutional responsibility in this White House? Don't they \nunderstand that the Constitution says Congress has the right to declare \nwar, not the President?\n  The last time we went into major military confrontation was over the \ngulf war. At that time, the White House was in the hands of a \nRepublican President. That Republican President, whom I consider a good \npersonal friend and for whom I have the highest affection, was going \ndown this same road. He was preparing to take America to war without a \ncongressional authorization to do so. There were those in this body who \nstood and said, ``Mr. President, you cannot take us to war without the \napproval of Congress.''\n  President Bush and his advisers resisted that logic for a while. \nInterestingly enough, one of the Senators who spoke out most \nvigorously, saying to the President you have no right to take us to war \nwithout congressional authorization, is now the Secretary of Defense. \nThen-Senator Cohen said repeatedly, to his own administration and his \nown party, you cannot take us to war without congressional \nauthorization.\n  I am delighted and pleased that ultimately President Bush came to \nrealize that truth and that America did not go to war in the gulf \nwithout congressional authority. President Bush had made all of the \nsame kinds of commitments to allies that we now hear that President \nClinton has made to our NATO allies with respect to Kosovo. It would \nhave been enormously embarrassing for President Bush had the Congress \nnot approved his action. He risked that embarrassment because he \nrecognized his constitutional responsibilities. He came to Congress. \nThe vote was close. He ran the risk of losing that vote, but \nultimately, the Congress approved America's going ahead with the gulf \nwar. We went ahead with the gulf war.\n\n  Yes, we did take casualties, but we set a precedent that is in \nconcert with the constitutional responsibilities that we all face. \nAmerica could say we went to war with the proper constitutional \nauthorization.\n  I fear we are on the verge of going to war without the proper \nconstitutional authorization. I fear the President of the United \nStates, because of his concern--if we can believe what we were told in \nthe Capitol briefing yesterday--over our relationship with our allies, \nis not willing to risk his constitutional responsibility to come to \nCongress.\n  I wish that instead of perfecting his one liners for the \ncorrespondents dinner last night, the President had been working on a \nmessage to Congress. I wish the President of the United States would \ncome before a joint session of the Congress and explain to us what \nvital national interests are at stake here and why it is necessary for \nthe United States to consider attacking another sovereign nation.\n  Obviously, he must feel the reasons are compelling or he would not \nhave gone so far down the road as he has already gone. Let him share \nthose compelling reasons with the people of the United States. \nObviously, he feels he has a case to make or he would not have pilots \nstanding at the ready to begin bombing. Let him make that case before \nthe Congress of the United States. Let him recognize that when he took \nan oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, \nsimilar to the oath that we took, he cannot ignore the phrase in the \nConstitution that says that Congress has the right to declare war, not \nthe President. It could not be clearer.\n  The difference in the President's priorities could not be clearer. \nInstead of preparing a message to Congress, he was preparing comedic \none liners for a correspondents dinner.\n  Do my colleagues know what one of those one liners was, Mr. \nPresident? It is one of the things that offended me the most, reading \nthe paper this morning. He referred to the fact that the vote in the \nSenate on the impeachment trial had acquitted him and said, ``If it had \ngone the other way, I wouldn't be here tonight.'' Then the appropriate\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\ncomedic pause, and he said, ``I demand a recount.'' Laughter.\n  Mr. President, I suggest, in the strongest terms I can muster, that \nthe President should not be making light of the dangers of his \nappearing before a group of correspondents while his administration is \nin the process of preparing to send young Americans to their death. \nFlying over Kosovo with the air defenses that are embedded in those \nmountains firing at you is more dangerous than appearing before a group \nof correspondents who might write nasty columns about you. For the \nPresident to joke about the hazards of his appearing before that dinner \non the eve of sending Americans into harm's way, where we are certainly \ngoing to see some of them come home in body bags, is to me deeply \noffensive.\n  Mr. President, I conclude with what is obvious about my position. The \nPresident of the United States has a constitutional duty before he \nsends Americans to war to come to the Congress of the United States and \nget some form of declaration of war. I believe he will abrogate his \nconstitutional duty and violate his oath if he does not do that. \nWithout his coming to us and without our adopting constitutionally \naccurate support for his actions, I will vote against everything that \nhe proposes to do, against the appropriations.\n\n  I will vote in every way I can to say the President of the United \nStates has violated his oath and violated the Constitution if he \nproceeds in the manner that we were informed about in our briefings \nyesterday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, a good deal has been said in the last \nseveral days concerning our potential involvement as part of a NATO \npeacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Having had an opportunity to be \nbriefed on several occasions by the Administration, I am concerned that \nwe have not given enough consideration to what we will do if the \ninitial plan fails, or is somehow miscalculated.\n  Further, I am astonished that we do not have an end game for this \nexposure of our young men and women whom we would send into battle. As \nwe consider the consequences of involvement in the Kosovo matter, and \nmy sympathy runs deep for those who are in harms way as a consequence \nof this continued conflict, I am terribly concerned for the American \nlives which would be in harms way if we send troops to Kosovo. I just \ndon't think we can continue to be all things to all people.\n  There are certain times when we have to evaluate what is our \nappropriate role and when it is time to rally our allies in an \nefficient, effective coalition of support, of access, of supplies, some \nway short of a conflict.\n  When one looks at the armaments over there, we find Russian, we find \nChinese, we find U.S., and we find European. As a consequence, had we \ntaken steps some time ago to ensure that this sophisticated weaponry \nwould not fall into irresponsible hands, we might have been able to \navoid it. But we are down to a time when the administration obviously \nis reluctant to admit that, indeed, we are at the brink of entering \ninto a war.\n  Some have suggested it could be the beginning of World War III. I am \nnot going to dramatize, but do want to emphasize that I do not believe \nthat we have given sufficient attention and strategic analysis to the \nalternatives to intervention, or to a withdrawal plan should we proceed \nto send troops to Kosovo. As a consequence, this Senator is not \nprepared to support an action at this time. I think the President of \nthe United States owes it to the country, as well as to Congress, to \ncome before the body with a clear-cut, committed plan that addresses \nthe questions I have asked this morning.\n  I, as one Senator, want to put the White House on notice that support \nfrom this Senator from Alaska, at this time, is not there.\n  I also want to emphasize another point, Mr. President, concerning our \npotential intervention in Kosovo. We are about to enter into a recess \nat the end of next week and will not reconvene as a body until sometime \nin mid-April. Any action by the administration to send our troops, as a \npart of a NATO operation, into action during our absence, obviously \nputs the Congress in the position of having to support our troops--\nwhile we may not necessarily support the underlying action. Of course, \nwe will want to support our troops, and we will support our troops.\n  But, because of the timing, we as a Congress must decide now--before \nour troops go in--whether or not we support this intervention. I \nencourage Members to express their opinions now, in fact plead that \nMembers go on record with this issue, before we are asked to support \nour troops in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Member wishing to be recognized. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING.

In 1995, when I served in the House of Representatives, \nI and a large bipartisan majority supported a resolution which called \nfor President Clinton to obtain congressional authorization before \ndeploying troops to Bosnia. That resolution passed by a vote of 315 \nyeas to 103 nays.\n  Yet, despite that vote, President Clinton went ahead with a large-\nscale and long-term deployment of tens of thousands of troops to Bosnia \nwithout congressional authorization or any meaningful debate.\n  Back then, President Clinton spoke to us and promised us all that we \nwould have a well-defined mission with a clear exit strategy. But even \ntoday there are no details on getting our troops out of Bosnia. We are \nstill there and President Clinton has spent approximately $12 billion \non that mission without ever including Bosnia funds in his budget.\n  As a result, he is draining crucial defense resources from other \ncritical areas and further putting our soldiers in harm's way. We still \nhave almost 7,000 troops in Bosnia and we are all unsure of what their \nexact mission really is and when, if ever, they can come home to their \nfamilies. So much for a clearly defined mission and exit strategy.\n  But now, all I can say is, ``deja vu'' and ``here we go again.''\n  Right now, American troops are deployed all over the globe in over 30 \nnations on missions of questionable value and unclear rules of \nengagement. And now, President Clinton is about to scatter roughly \n4,000 more troops to intervene in Kosovo under a NATO mission to \nenforce a peace agreement. But there is no peace agreement to enforce \nbecause one does not exist.\n  The Serbs and the Albanians have been fighting in this southern \nregion of Serbia for centuries. So is it any surprise that earlier this \nweek in France, the Serbs would not accept the Kosovo peace plan that \ntheir rival ethnic Albanians have agreed to sign?\n  I do not believe that any amount of American involvement is going to \nend these ethnic conflicts that have raged for centuries. We have tried \nto resolve this problem for three years and have gotten nowhere. I do \nnot understand why we think we can end this civil war by sending 4,000 \nadditional troops.\n  President Clinton has not given us any answers as to why sending \nthese troops to Kosovo is so vital. President Clinton can tell us any \ntime. But where is he? He has the bully pulpit.\n  I do not believe it is in our national security interest to get \ninvolved once again in another so-called peacekeeping mission in this \nregion. In a few years, Kosovo will take its place in history books, \nalong with Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia, as an example of a foreign policy \nthat has no principled framework.\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\n  I want to hear from President Clinton as to why this region is of a \nnational security interest to the United States and why he should risk \nthe lives of our young troops by sending them to Kosovo.\n  And where is the European community in all of this? It seems as \nthough we are risking the lives of our soldiers to clean up Europe's \nbackyard. If anyone should take the lead on this intervention, it \nshould definitely be from a European nation. This is Europe's problem, \nif anyone's, and not ours. Kosovo is not in our backyard.\n  An American soldier's job is to protect America's interests by \ndestroying America's enemies on the battlefield. It is an insult to ask \nan American soldier to serve as a policeman under the umbrella of some \ninternational organization instead of the American flag.\n  There are many questions that President Clinton and his \nadministration need to answer, and we are being left in the dark once \nagain.\n  President Clinton, take these questions seriously.\n  When and how many troops are we deploying and how long will they be \nthere?\n  What is their mission?\n  Will there be more troops deployed if our goals and missions are not \nmet?\n  Will foreign commanders be commanding our troops under this NATO \nforce?\n  What are the rules of engagement?\n  How will this mission be paid for, and will valuable dollars be \npulled away from military readiness accounts to pay for this \ndeployment?\n  What, if any, is our exit strategy?\n  As you have heard, President Clinton, I have many questions and I am \nnot alone. You gave us no details and answers with regard to the Bosnia \nmission, and I fear we, as well, will be given very little, if any, \ndetails regarding our involvement in Kosovo.\n  But quite frankly, not getting answers from President Clinton does \nnot surprise me.\n  I do not believe we have a compelling national interest to send \ntroops to Kosovo. If they are sent, we all deserve answers from \nPresident Clinton before our troops are sent into another mess for \nyears to come.\n  Our men and women in uniform are ready and willing to defend the \ninterests of this great Nation, but not the interests of other nations. \nWe cannot undermine the oaths they take when they are sworn into the \nmilitary to serve this great Nation.\n  President Clinton, do your job, and let us know what is happening \nwith Kosovo.\n  God bless our troops.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wanted to take an opportunity in morning business, Mr. \nPresident, to comment just a little bit on this whole business of \nbudgeting; I guess more specifically, supplemental budgets and the \nproblems that are there.\n  First of all, with respect to the budget that is before the Senate, I \ncongratulate the leadership and the Appropriations Committee for the \ngood work that they have done. I know that it is difficult. I think \nthey have done a good job in seeking to offset the costs.\n  But I really believe that one of the things we need to change in the \nSenate is our method of budgeting, our method of supplemental budgeting \nparticularly. First of all, in the broader sense, I am hopeful that we \nwill consider this year the idea of a biennial budget, that we will \ncome in at the beginning of the 2-year period, put down a budget, and \nhave 2 years under which to operate so that in the second year we can \ndo more of what we should be doing, and that is oversight of the \nexpenditures of that budget.\n  I understand that under that circumstance there would be supplemental \nbudgets, that you would probably be more likely to have one if you had \nthe 2-year budget, but I think that is the thing we ought to be doing. \nNow we spend such a high percentage of our total time doing budgetary \nthings and quite often bringing in things that are nonbudgetary on to \nbudget bills. I think that is a mistake.\n  We are set up to have a Budget Committee. We are set up to have an \nAppropriations Committee that deals with the expenditures. We are set \nup to have committees of jurisdiction that are responsible for the \npolicy. Unfortunately, many times we find that issues on policy come to \nthe appropriations, particularly on supplementals, without ever going \nto the committee of jurisdiction, and we find ourselves with policy on \nAppropriations Committee measures, which I think is inappropriate.\n\n  There again let me say, I congratulate those who have been involved \nwith this bill, because I think they have done a good job--something \naround $2 billion, I believe, that has been generally offset. And I \nknow how difficult it is to keep the amendments from coming. Everybody \nsees that as an opportunity to put on there the things they have been \nseeking to do.\n  We talk about having surpluses; we talk about what we are going to do \nwith those surpluses. The real issue before us, particularly if you are \ninterested in keeping the size of the Federal Government under control, \nis spending and spending caps.\n  I am pretty proud of what has happened here in the Senate, in the \nCongress, over the last several years, when we have been able to have \nsome spending caps, and we have been able to at least hold spending at \na relatively level. Yet we have a surplus, and we begin to think, ``Oh, \nwe can do this.'' If you really want to keep control over the size of \nthe Federal Government, if you really want to encourage governance to \ntake place more at the State and local level, then we have to be very \nobservant, I think, of spending caps.\n  There is a justification for emergency spending, certainly, when we \nhave things like storms and earthquakes and so on, but emergency \nspending can also result in all kinds of things being called \n``emergency spending,'' and the result is we spend more than our caps.\n  So I think most people in Wyoming believe that $1.6 trillion is \nplenty of money. That is what our spending is. In the natural event, we \nspent last year about $20 billion in emergency spending, much of which \nwould be very hard to really honestly identify as emergency spending. \nIt was an ``emergency'' way to have more spending, encouraged by the \nadministration, encouraged by this President. And his budget is going \nto cause us to consider that even more, where the President has cut \ndown spending that needs to go on, to put in new spending in the hopes \nthat the total spending will be increased.\n  So, Mr. President, I just think that is the wrong way to go. I do, \nagain, appreciate our chairman trying to hold and offset spending. I \nvoted against the supplemental bill last year even though obviously \nthere are always things there that you would like to have happen.\n  I think we need to look very closely at this bill to make sure that \nspending is in fact offset or that it is indeed emergency spending.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share some general \nfeelings about our budgeting system and to urge that we take a very \nclose look at what we do in terms of our total spending and how it has \nbeen impacted by these kinds of supplemental budgets.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Crop Loss Assistance.--(a) In General.--Section \n     1102 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 \n     (section 101(a) of division A of Public Law 105-277), is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``(not later than June \n     15, 1999)'' after ``made available''; and\n       (2) in subsection (g)(1), by inserting ``or private crop \n     insurance (including a rain and hail policy)'' before the \n     period at the end.\n       (b) Designation as Emergency Requirement.--Such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out the amendments made by subsection (a): \n     Provided, That such amount shall be available only to the \n     extent an official budget request, that includes designation \n     of the entire amount of the request as an emergency \n     requirement for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, is transmitted by the \n     President to Congress: Provided further, That the entire \n     amount is designated by Congress as an emergency requirement \n     under section 251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding my amendment \nto improve the crop loss assistance program. I would like to begin by \nexpressing my appreciation to Chairman Stevens, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Lugar, and Senator Kohl for their assistance in gaining an \nagreement on this amendment.\n  I believe this amendment will help provide much needed assistance to \nour Nation's farmers. In the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations \nbill we provided emergency funds to the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) to aid farmers who have suffered losses due to \nnatural disasters in recent years. I believe the regulations that were \npromulgated by the USDA were inadequate to address the needs of many of \nour farmers.\n  Under the multi-year disaster assistance provisions contained in the \nfiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill, farmers who experienced \nlosses in three of the last five crop years (1994-1998) or 1998 alone \nwere eligible for 25 percent of indemnities paid. Farmers would be paid \nthe higher of the multi-year or single year loss but would not quality \nunder both.\n  Many farmers in parts of Alabama experienced losses in two out of \nfive years, or experienced devastating losses in years other than 1998 \nand so were ineligible for the disaster assistance. In addition, many \nproducers experienced losses but did not meet the eligibility \nrequirement since they may have had up to 35-percent losses but no \ninsurance indemnity was paid that crop year.\n  Farmers may have also experienced a loss with a private crop policy \nsuch as rain and hail but did not have enough of a loss to trigger the \nindemnity. This amendment would require that USDA count indemnity \nlosses by private policies such as rain and hail that were paid during \nthe crop years 1994-1998 to be counted as a loss, under the three out \nof five year crop loss requirement.\n  In determining eligibility for the multi-year provisions, the Risk \nManagement Agency, RMA, simply generated a list of producers by \ntaxpayer ID and if their production records showed a loss for either \n1998 or three out of the five preceding crop years, RMA determined they \nwere eligible. However, since these private crop policies are not \noffered under the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program, MPCI, and purely \na private contract between the insured producer and insurance company, \nRMA did not count these losses as qualifying under the multi-year \nprovisions.\n  This amendment will simply provide equity for producers who might \nhave experienced losses under their private policies such as rain and \nhail, but did not experience losses under the catastrophic or ``buyup'' \npolicies. I believe this amendment will provide essential flexibility \nin the program so that farmers who have endured severe conditions in \nrecent years can qualify for the assistance we provided in the omnibus \nbill last year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from me to Secretary Glickman \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1999.\n     Mr. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, Department of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: I am writing regarding some \n     concerns I have about the Crop Loss Disaster Assistance \n     Program that was authorized by the Supplemental \n     Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1999.\n       I am concerned about the regulations that have been \n     formulated by the USDA with regards to this program. Congress \n     provided these funds to aid farmers that have faced extreme \n     conditions during the past few years. Having been contacted \n     by several of my constituents, it has come to my attention \n     that the program is not adequate in addressing many farmers \n     needs. Although numerous farmers suffered significant losses \n     in 1998, many still will not qualify for assistance under the \n     provisions specifically designed to address 1998 losses due \n     to disasters. Furthermore, the provisions relating to multi-\n     year losses precludes many farmers from receiving the \n     assistance they so desperately need, even when they had two \n     devastating years. While I understand that these types of \n     programs must have limits, I request that you investigate \n     this disparity to determine if a possible solution is \n     available.\n       I am also concerned about the disproportionate impact that \n     the program will have on different geographic areas. While I \n     am aware that different areas face distinct weather problems, \n     I have some concerns that certain areas of the U.S. are going \n     to receive a much larger portion of the assistance funds than \n     other areas. I believe this could be due to the way the \n     regulations were formulated. Again, I request that you \n     investigate this inequity to determine if we are implementing \n     the best system possible.\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I \n     know we share the common goal of aiding the American farmer \n     in the fairest and most equitable way possible. I would \n     appreciate your contacting me or my office with any findings. \n     If you have any questions or require more information, please \n     feel free to contact John Little, my legislative counsel for \n     this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Jeff Sessions,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 122\n\n (Purpose: To make available funds for a scholarship fund for Zamorano \n                  Agricultural University in Honduras)\n\n       On page 8, line 21, by inserting after ``Honduras:'' the \n     following: ``Provided further, That, of the amount \n     appropriated under this heading, up to $10,000,000 may be \n     made available to establish and support a scholarship fund \n     for qualified low-to-middle income students to attend \n     Zamorano Agricultural University in Honduras:''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Alaska for \nhis leadership on this very important supplemental appropriations bill. \nIt goes without saying that these funds are much needed both in our \ncountry and in the countries of Central America and the Caribbean \naffected by Hurricane Mitch. The funds will go to some of the neediest \npeople in this hemisphere and will address immediate and long-term \nneeds. I have traveled the region personally in the wake of this \ndisaster, and I know that these resources\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nare imperative to its economic viability and recent strong advances in \nfreedom and democracy.\n  In considering this large assistance measure, however; we should \nrecognize that there are problems in some of the recipient countries. \nIn particular, we have heard of many difficulties with American \ncompanies trying to do business in the region. Currently, there are a \ngroup of Senators, led by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, who are concerned about an airport project in Honduras and \nthe government's apparent refusal to pay the American company \nperforming the work. In the Dominican Republic, I have consistently \nbeen informed of problems the American energy sector is having in \ntrying to do business in that country. While U.S. State Department \npersonnel have been responsive and have tried to be helpful in \nproviding consular assistance, a group of American energy companies \nstill are having problems getting paid on time--or at all--under the \nterms of their established contracts. This is worrisome. It obviously \nhurts domestic confidence in investing in this region--or in these \ncountries particularly.\n  I would appreciate it if the chairman would review the material I \nwill provide him on these situations and consider developing report \nlanguage to accompany this legislation which would address this \nrecurring problem. In the language, I would like to encourage these \ncountries to honor their contracts to the best of their abilities and \nto abide by the rule of law. If we are going to provide this infusion \nof resources, we need to assure that our companies operating in the \nregion are treated fairly. It is certainly best for both us and the \ncountries in which we invest. I thank the chairman for his leadership \non this measure.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 123\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the use at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South \n Dakota, of the amount received by the United States in settlement of \nclaims with respect to a family housing project at Ellsworth Air Force \n Base, and to increase the amount of rescission of the ``Operation and \n   Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' account of the Department of Defense)\n\n       On page 39, line 20, strike ``$209,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$217,700,000''.\n       On page 58, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Sec. 5001.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of Kosovo. \nIt is obviously a topic of extreme importance. It appears that the \nadministration and the President have decided to use American military \nforce in Kosovo in conjunction with NATO. This, to me, is a serious \nmistake.\n  I wish this administration had a set policy we could turn to and say, \n``This is why they have decided to do this.'' But they do not. In fact, \nthe Kosovo decision has many parallels to the Haiti decision, and the \nHaiti decision, as we know, has turned into a complete disaster, \ncosting millions of dollars--potentially, I think, billions of \ndollars--although luckily no American lives, but it has not corrected \nthe problem in Haiti in any significant way.\n  Kosovo, on the other hand, has the potential of not only to cost \nbillions of dollars, but also to cost American lives. It is a mistake \nto pursue a policy of using American force without a doctrine or a \nguideline or a theorem as to why you are using that force.\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\n  My belief is that before we use American force in this world today to \naddress issues which are ethnically driven, religiously driven, or \nwhich involve civil war type of instances, which are the new threats we \nso often seem to get involved in--I am not talking about issues of \nterrorism, which is a separate issue, or state-sponsored terrorism, \nwhich is a separate issue. I am talking about regions of the world \nwhere we are seeing ethnic, civil, and political violence of such a \nnature that American forces are considered to be sent into that region.\n\n  It is my belief that before we make a decision to pursue the use of \nAmerican force and put American lives at risk, we need to answer three \nbasic questions.\n  The first question is this: Is there a national interest, is there an \nAmerican interest, which is significant enough to justify risking \nAmerican lives? Is there a national interest which can be clearly and \nconcisely explained, if it has to be explained, regrettably, to a \nparent, to a wife, to a child of an American service man or woman who \nmay lose their life because we have pursued the use of American force? \nIs there a definable American interest of such significance that we are \nwilling to put at risk the cream of America's young people--our service \nindividuals?\n  So far, this administration has set forth absolutely no presentation \nof doctrine or ideas or position which establishes that there is such \nan American interest. There may be a European interest, no question \nabout that. Clearly, what is going on in that part of the world is \nhorrific in many instances. But is there an American interest that \njustifies using American force and risking American life? We have not \nheard that explained to us.\n  If people are being indiscriminately killed by a group of thugs, then \nare we not also supposed to be in Georgia or Azerbaijan or Rwanda or \nany number of other places in this world? In fact, I think there was \nsome tallying up of this, and there is something like 39 places in the \nworld today where there is this type of activity going on, and some of \nit involving much larger deaths in the way of civilian casualties than \nis occurring in Kosovo. Of course, any death is a tragedy.\n  The fact is that there has to be a reason for Americans stepping in \nto try to stop that conflict. In this instance, we have not seen a \ndifferentiation that justifies us going into Kosovo versus going into \nsome other of these 39 confrontations around the world. There has been \nno definition given to the purpose of the use of American military \nforce, other than that this conflict appears on television. This \nconflict involves a European state. This conflict, therefore, maybe \nattracts more sympathy from a country which has always identified \nitself with Europe, but sympathy is not a good reason for putting at \nrisk American lives.\n  The Balkans represent no strategic issue for the United States today \nof any significance. It is a strategic issue for the European nations, \nand it is a European issue which should be addressed by the European \nnations, but clearly there is no definable American purpose for going \ninto Kosovo, and this administration has presented none.\n  I was at a briefing where I heard the Secretary of State say \nsomething to the effect, this might lead to World War III if we let \nthis conflict ensue between Serbia and Kosovo, because she was \nreferring back to World War II and World War I which started in this \nregion of the world.\n  The dynamics of the world have changed. There are no alliances which \nare going to cause the domino effect that is going to bring the death \nof the Archduke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into play with Germany, \nwith Prussia. There are no such alliances that exist today. There is no \nAdolf Hitler who has the capacity to project force throughout Europe as \na result of actions occurring in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. In \nfact, the Balkans have been, for all intents and purposes, \nstrategically bypassed.\n  There are other regions of the world where America has significant \nstrategic interest--Iraq is obviously the most apparent at this time, \nbut there are others also--where, if we have to use American force, we \nshould use American force. But to use American force arbitrarily and \nsimply because the region happens to be European and because it happens \nto be on television, and for no other apparent reason, is a very hard \nexplanation to make, should American lives be lost, to the parent or \nthe spouse or the child.\n  That is the first point we must test. The first test of engagement \nis, Is there a vital national interest for us? No, there is not. I want \nto come back to that because there are a couple of other points on \nthat.\n  Let's go on to the second point. The second point is, Can the use of \nAmerican force stabilize or terminate the conflict?\n  When we are looking at these racial, political, religious, civil war \ntype situations, can the introduction of American force have a long, \nlasting effect? That has to be the second question. And if it cannot, \nthen why would we put the force in?\n  I think anybody who has done even a cursory study of the Balkans \nknows that these folks, these cultures, regrettably, have a historic, \nalmost a genetic, attitude which causes constant conflict and which \ncreates tremendous antagonism which leads to violence between these \ndifferent cultures.\n  I have tried to trace it back a little bit. I was reading the history \nof the Ottoman Empire. Ironically, it goes back, I think, to Kosovo and \na battle that was fought, I think, in 1555 or 1585 where Solyman ``the \nGreat'' fought the Serbs in Kosovo. In fact, just a few years ago, the \nSerbs dug up their hero of that battle and took his body all around \nSerbia as an expression of support for that battle and for their hatred \nof the Moslem empire which had caused that fight to occur. And those \nhatreds have developed and evolved and have gone forward in every \ngeneration, been passed down from generation to generation to \ngeneration.\n  We cannot understand it as Americans because we are a melting pot, \nand we do not have that type of hatred in our Nation. A lot of people \ncame to the United States, however, to get away from it and immigrated \nhere for that purpose.\n  But I remember, I worked in Montenegro one summer, and I would meet \npeople--and this was back a long time ago, back in 1970-something--and \nI would meet people, the local folks who I was working with, and they \nwould tell me, forthrightly, that as soon as Tito died there was going \nto be a genocide in that part of the world because the Serbs hated \nthe Croatians. And it was just a matter of fact, a matter of their \nlives that as soon as this stabilizing force, Tito, died, this was \ngoing to occur. They knew it as a culture.\n\n  So what arrogance do we have as a nation, sitting here across the \nocean, that we think we can project arms into a region, putting \nAmerican lives at risk, and stabilize that region which has not been \nable to settle things out for hundreds of years--hundreds of years. I \nthink it is foolish for us to presume that.\n  But equally important, I think we have to understand that, in this \ninstance, to put American forces in there is essentially an act of war \non our part, because this is a freestanding nation and Kosovo is a \nprovince of that freestanding nation. It is as if Canada decided to put \ntroops in Vermont because New Hampshire and Vermont were not getting \nalong. That may be too glib a statement, but the fact is, from a \nphysical standpoint and a political standpoint, that is essentially the \nsame situation. This is a nation which is at civil war. What if the \nEnglish during our Civil War had decided to set troops down in North \nCarolina? I don't think the North would have taken that very well.\n  Granted, in this instance, the Serbs are led by a malicious and \nmalignant individual who is acting in a manner which is outside, in \nmany ways, the bounds of any type of confrontation that should occur in \nthe 20th century or the 21st century. But the fact is, for us to put \nAmerican troops in there will be legally, at least, an act of war \nbecause we will be invading a sovereign nation which is fighting within \nitself relative to a province in that nation which is trying to create \nindependence, and we will be deciding to separate that country by our \nuse of military force.\n  Of course, this administration has not come to this Congress and \nsuggested that. In fact, this administration has not come to the \nCongress at all. It has violated all sorts of directives, but it has \njust marched down\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nthis road of arbitrary evolution into a position of confrontation in \nSerbia and Kosovo. It has set our prestige at risk without having any \nidea why our prestige should be at risk, in my opinion.\n  But that is the second point: Can you resolve the conflict by the use \nof American force? I would have to say that history tells us we cannot. \nA lot like Haiti. When we went into Haiti, a lot of people asked, Are \nwe going to correct this situation? Is this going to improve this \nsituation? Are we putting our people at risk? Are we spending all this \nmoney and getting something out of this that is better after we leave? \nIs it going to change the culture?\n  We have seen it did not. Haiti is back to almost the exact position \nit was before we put our troops in, except that it has absolutely no \nprivate enterprise now because we basically wiped out the private \nenterprise when we went in and closed all the private enterprise down \nand pushed it offshore. We wiped out their private sector workforce and \ncapitalist base. So we actually put them in a worse position \neconomically. And politically they are in the same position.\n  I suspect that no matter how long we put American troops in there--\nand there is no definition coming; and that is the third point of how \nlong we will be there--no matter how long American troops are in that \nregion, there will be no resolution of this problem by the introduction \nof American troops into that region which will have any long-term \nimpact. They will be back at each other's throat as soon as the \nopportunity arises, unless we wish to stay there forever, which brings \nus to the third point.\n\n  The first point is: Is there a vital national interest for us? The \nsecond point is: Can the conflict be resolved by the use of American \nforces? The third point: Is there an exit strategy or are we committing \nAmericans' tax dollars and the lives of American troops without any--\nany--idea as to how we are going to get out of this situation?\n  As far as I know, this administration has not really defined an \nentrance strategy. They have sort of stumbled into that, so, clearly, \nthey have not found any exit strategy. In fact, if you ask them, all \nthey have thought about is the first bombing raids. They have not even \nthought about the second--they may have thought about the second series \nof bombing raids, but they have not thought about what they do after \nthat. There is no exit strategy. In fact, there is very little strategy \nat all other than what the military has been willing to do and has to \ndo in order to prepare itself to execute public policy which is so \nhaphazardly designed.\n  We could be there a long time. I mean, since 1385 or 1355, it has \nbeen 600 years. Are we going to stick around another 600 years in order \nto pacify this region? I think we might have to if our intention is to \naccomplish that goal.\n  And for what purpose? What is the national interest that justifies \nthat? And remember, this is not like Haiti in many ways. This is a \ncountry where people do fight, where people are under arms. This is a \ncountry of military-type individuals. This is a country which fought \nthe German army to a standstill; the greatest army in the world at the \ntime they invaded, fought them to a standstill through guerrilla \ntactics. These are proud people, proud people and militaristic people. \nI know that. I was there for awhile. It was a long time ago, but I do \nnot think they have changed. They do not seem to change much.\n  So where is this policy going? It appears that it is a policy that is \nundefined, that cannot give us a legitimate national reason, that \ncannot proclaim that the introduction of American forces will settle \nthe situation. And it cannot give us a definition as to how they are \ngoing to get out of the situation once we get into the situation.\n  It is a bad policy. It is one that, unfortunately, puts many American \nlives at risk if it is pursued. But this administration seems insistent \non going down that road. And I think that is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2992-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2992-S2993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A STUNNING REVELATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I read a remarkable article this week in the \nHill newspaper concerning the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCleland. The article recounted events that occurred 31 years ago in \nVietnam when then-Captain Cleland was gravely injured in a grenade \nexplosion. The injuries that he received in that horrible accident cost \nhim his right arm and both of his legs, and very nearly cost him his \nlife. He was 25 years old at the time, and just 1 month shy--just 1 \nmonth shy--of completing his tour of duty in Vietnam. Now, think of \nthat. Just a month to go.\n  For more than three decades, Max Cleland lived with the crushing \nbelief that his own carelessness had caused the accident, that the hand \ngrenade that shattered his body and shattered his life had somehow \nfallen from his own web belt when he jumped from the helicopter. Most \npeople in Max Cleland's situation would have been consumed with self-\npity, even if they had had the grit to live. Think of that. The young \nCaptain Cleland certainly battled it. But as he has handled so many of \nthe challenges that have marked his life since that terrible day in \nVietnam, Max Cleland triumphed over the lure of self-pity. He triumphed \nover his injuries. He triumphed over self-doubt. He triumphed over \nbitterness.\n  Max Cleland could have given up after that accident in Vietnam. Most \nof us would have. But he did not. He turned his misfortune into the \nservice of others. Three years after returning home from Vietnam, he \nwas elected to the Georgia State Senate, becoming the youngest member \nand the only Vietnam veteran in that body. In 1977, he became the \nyoungest administrator of the U.S. Veterans' Administration and the \nfirst Vietnam veteran to head that Agency. He returned to Georgia \nwhere, in 1982, he was elected Secretary of State. And, in 1996, he was \nelected to the U.S. Senate from Georgia.\n  Now, that is a remarkable record, a remarkable feat. It is remarkable \nfor anyone to reach the Senate of the United States. Out of all the \nmillions of people that are in America, there are 100 Senators--the \nsame number that were in the original Roman Senate when Romulus founded \nthat city on the banks of the Tiber. He created the Senate, made up of \n100 of the wisest men, and he chose old men for that Senate.\n  So here is a man with the disadvantages that Max Cleland had to \novercome, the struggle that he had to undergo daily and nightly, every \nhour of the day, even to live, and he made it to the U.S. Senate. In \nall of that time, he quietly blamed himself for the accident that so \nradically altered his life.\n  But last week, according to the report in the Hill, Senator Cleland \nwas stunned to learn from an eyewitness that the grenade that injured \nhim was not one of his own, but had been lost by another soldier.\n  My wife and I are reading the Psalms. Every Sunday, we read it. \nActually, we have completed the Psalms, and now we are in Ecclesiastes.\n\n       Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; \n     all is vanity.\n\n  In our reading of the Bible, we have already read the New Testament \nand we have read the Old Testament. We have come all the way down, as I \nsay, to the Book of Ecclesiastes. From the 85th Psalm, I will quote two \nlines:\n\n       Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace \n     have kissed each other.\n\n  Through his indomitable spirit, Max Cleland overcame the injuries he \nreceived as a young Army captain in Vietnam and conquered the \ntemptation to succumb to self-pity. He is an inspiration to us all, and \nI hope that he finds a measure of peace and solace in the long-lost \ntruth that was revealed to him this past week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nMarch 17 issue of the Hill, titled, ``For Senator Cleland, a Searing \nRevelation After 31 Years,'' be printed in its entirety at this point \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n                     [From the Hill, Mar. 17, 1999]\n\n         For Sen. Cleland, a Searing Revelation After 31 Years\n\n               (By E. Michael Myers and Betsy Rothstein)\n\n       For 31 years, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) has labored under \n     the belief that he was to blame for dropping the hand grenade \n     that forever transformed his life.\n       It was an otherwise insignificant moment in a still-\n     divisive war, a terrible instant when Cleland lost his legs, \n     his right arm and, for the time being, his dignity.\n       But from the confusion of that moment--the bleeding, the \n     flood of nausea, the blinding pain, the medics scrambling to \n     patch him together--has emerged an unshakable notion: that he \n     was most likely responsible for that act.\n       That is, until now.\n       The year was 1968. The war, Vietnam. The place, a valley \n     called Khe Sanh.\n       The valley, only 14 miles from the demilitarized zone, was \n     as dangerous as it was deceptive.\n       From the air, Khe Sanh was a bastion of streams, rolling \n     hills, picturesque cliffs, lush vegetation and even a \n     waterfall. On the ground, it was teeming with giant rats, \n     razor-sharp grasses, precipitous grades and rivers with \n     violent rapids.\n       Some 6,000 American Marines were holed up in Khe Sanh. \n     Hiding in the hills surrounding the valley were North \n     Vietnamese army troops. Nobody knew exactly how many. One \n     estimate said 20,000. Another said twice that number.\n       The hills were so dangerous that supply convoys could not \n     make it through Route 9, the main road into Khe Sanh. The \n     Marines turned to helicopters for their shipments. But even \n     that became so dangerous that C-130 planes had to swoop from \n     the skies to drop supplies from the cargo bays.\n       Khe Sanh itself was hardly worth saving. Its strategic \n     importance was so low that, when the Americans did finally \n     capture it, they let it go again.\n       Instead, Gen. William Westmoreland feared another Dien Bien \n     Phu, the 1954 battle which led to the French retreat from \n     Vietnam. The sight of a brigade of Marines in body bags being \n     hauled from Khe Sanh would have been a tragedy of awesome \n     proportions.\n       That is why the general ordered Operation Pegasus, a large-\n     scale joint Army-Marines rescue effort. Included in the \n     operation was the Army's 1st Air Cavalry Division, the \n     division of 25-year-old Capt. Max Cleland.\n       The tall son of a secretary and an automobile salesman from \n     Lithonia, Georgia, had signed up for Reserve Officers' \n     Training Corps at Stetson University, was trained in \n     guerrilla warfare and had always ached to fight in an \n     important battle.\n       After his first three months as a platoon leader of a \n     signal battalion, he thought, ``It didn't seem like much of a \n     war.''\n       So he volunteered for a dangerous new assignment that would \n     take him to what he considered the nucleus of the war. He \n     became communications officer with the 2nd Infantry Battalion \n     of the 12th Cavalry with the Cav's 2nd Brigade.\n       Cleland's boredom quickly subsided. At one point during \n     Operation Pegasus, he spent five days and five nights in a \n     bomb crater 20 feet in diameter. In a letter to an aunt, he \n     wrote, ``If I ever make it back to the Atlanta airport, I'll \n     be happy just to crawl home regardless of what shape I'm \n     in.''\n       Some of the hills around Khe Sanh were battlefields almost \n     as harrowing as any in U.S. military history. Marines still \n     boast of having survived battles known only as Hill 881 and \n     Hill 861.\n       But the hill where Cleland's fate was decided--once east of \n     Khe Sanh--would not become known for any great act of valor. \n     Its strategic importance was as a communications relay \n     station.\n       The 12th Cav's Maj. Maury Cralle, Cleland's commanding \n     officer who was stationed in the rear, recalls that he had \n     trouble communicating consistently with the front lines. A \n     relay was needed.\n       On April 8, 1968, less than a week before the siege of Khe \n     Sanh was broken and one month before his anticipated \n     departure from Vietnam, Capt. Cleland accompanied his men by \n     helicopter to the hill, arriving within minutes.\n       He had jumped from helicopters countless times before. \n     Usually, there was nothing to it.\n       He jumped, and once clear of the spinning helicopter \n     blades, turned, watching the chopper lift into the air. \n     That's when he noticed the hand grenade resting on the \n     ground.\n       Ordinarily, grenades only detonate when their pins are \n     pulled. Somehow, this grenade's pin had become dislodged. All \n     Cleland saw was the grenade.\n       ``I went toward it,'' Cleland said in an interview with The \n     Hill last week. ``I didn't know it was live. It wasn't a \n     heroic act. I just thought it was mine. I really didn't know \n     where in the hell it came from.''\n       The explosion threw Cleland backwards. His right hand and \n     most of his right leg were gone, and his left leg was a \n     bloody mass.\n       ``The blast jammed my eyeballs into my skull, temporarily \n     blinding me, pinning my cheeks and jaw muscles to the bones \n     of my face,'' Cleland wrote in his 1980 memoir. ``My ears \n     rang with a deafening reverberation as if I were standing in \n     an echo chamber.''\n       For days, as he fought for his life, flashbacks of the \n     incident haunted him. ``Why had I pressed my luck? What was I \n     trying to prove?''\n       For more than three months, he battled his condition in \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center in an orthopedics ward known \n     as the ``Snake Pit.'' It was there where he also battled his \n     self-pity.\n       For years, Cleland has been inundated by the ``awkward \n     self-conscious stares of people.''\n       ``I have done that `mea culpa' thing for a long time,'' he \n     described last week. ``Like, `You were stupid to volunteer, \n     you were stupid to go [to Vietnam], you were stupid to get \n     blown up, you are stupid, stupid stupid.' ''\n       His resolute spirit allowed Cleland to fight the self-\n     doubts and to eventually serve as administrator of the \n     Department of Veterans' Affairs under President Carter and \n     win election to the Senate in 1996.\n       But as he rolled that critical event over and over again in \n     his mind, one pervading thought stood still: ``Somehow I had \n     fumbled the ball.''\n       Last week, Cleland was stunned when he received a phone \n     call from a man named David Lloyd--a 60-mm mortar squad \n     leader in ``Charlie'' Company of the 1st Brigade, 1st \n     Regiment of the 1st Marine Division.\n       Lloyd told Cleland that the grenade that nearly killed him \n     belonged to another soldier.\n       Lloyd, now a retired airline worker living in Annapolis, \n     Md., told Cleland that he, too, had been stationed on that \n     hill outside Khe Sanh that fateful day. Lloyd said he had \n     watched as Cleland's helicopter came in for landing and, \n     although he couldn't be sure, he believes he even took a \n     photograph.\n       Lloyd provided The Hill with that photo, as well as \n     evidence of his service in Charlie Company. Company-level \n     documents could not be located for this article. But Marine \n     Corps archival records confirm that one of his brigade's \n     assignments was to set up a relay station outside Khe Sanh \n     during the first two weeks of April 1968 for the Army's First \n     Air Cavalry Division--Cleland's division.\n       Earlier this month, Lloyd was watching a program about \n     combat medical corpsman on the History Channel in which the \n     senator detailed his account of his injuries. For the first \n     time, he learned that Cleland blamed himself for his \n     injuries.\n       Lloyd was stunned. ``He had said he had an accident, that \n     he was always dropping things off his web belt, but that is \n     not what happened,'' Lloyd described in an interview. ``I was \n     there, I know what happened.''\n       Lloyd saw the explosion from his mortar pit 20 yards away \n     and rushed up to Cleland's torn body.\n       ``He was white as chalk,'' Lloyd said. ``His pants were \n     smoldering. It was devastating. I saw literally thousands of \n     wounds in Vietnam. I never thought he would survive.''\n       Lloyd cut off Cleland's shredded fatigues. He used a belt \n     and medical wrappings to set a tourniquet around the bleeding \n     stumps of his legs. Moments later, a Navy corpsman arrived on \n     the scene and ordered Lloyd to help another wounded soldier \n     who had numerous shrapnel wounds.\n       Said Lloyd of the second soldier: ``He was crying, but I \n     didn't think it was from the grenade fragments. He kept \n     saying, `It was my grenade, my grenade.' He was very upset.''\n       Last Thursday, in the Senate Dining Room, Cleland and Lloyd \n     met for the first time.\n       For a moment, the former Army captain's world turned upside \n     down. ``It is amazing, it is mind-boggling to go back to the \n     most traumatic part of your life and have the furniture \n     rearranged,'' Cleland said. ``For 31 years, that has been the \n     only story I really knew.''\n       Slowly trying to digest the information Lloyd has given \n     him, Cleland said,``I don't know whether this gives me relief \n     or not. I guess it is better that way than if it had been my \n     fault. It frees me up to a certain extent.''\n       Still, for Cleland there are many unanswered questions.\n       ``I think after you survive something traumatic, you wonder \n     why the hell you are alive, why you were left and somebody \n     else is taken. It is called survivor guilt.\n       ``You wonder if God wants me here, why does He want me \n     here, what is He out for?''\n       Cleland said he knows he is here only by the grace of God, \n     good friends and people like Lloyd, who helped him when he \n     was dying.\n       ``I feel I am where the good Lord wants me. Otherwise I \n     wouldn't be here, I would be on the Wall. Oh my God. Thirty-\n     one years later, it wasn't my hand grenade at all, it was \n     somebody else's? It's been a hell of a week.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted to proceed for my full 10 minutes, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2993-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2993-S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SPRINGTIME\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is an old adage--and I have heard it \nmany times, and so have you and our other colleagues--that, ``March \ncomes in like a lion and leaves like a lamb.'' That adage was certainly \nturned on its ear this year. March tiptoed in on little lamb's hooves, \nas soft and warm as a curly fleece, giving us all hope of an early, \nmild spring.\n  Aha. The smiles that have lighted up the faces here in the pages and \nthe officers of the Senate and the employees of\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nthe Senate who sit before me here when I mentioned that word \n``spring.''\n  In West Virginia, the center of the world--half the world on one \nside, half the world on the other--West Virginia, early daffodils \npushed through great rafts of dried leaves washed up against old stone \nfarmhouse foundations that jut like rocky reefs out of sunny hillsides. \nOh, the iridescent sunsets and the viridescent hills that are West \nVirginia's. Bluebirds decorated telephone line perches while forsythia \nblossoms announced the awakening of the Earth.\n  Then the March lion roared with a vengeance, sending successive storm \nwaves across the Nation. Snow buried the daffodils under a crystalline \nblanket of sparkling white. West Virginia was hit hard by these late \nstorms, as were many other States. What was a boon for skiers and \nschoolchildren has been a real hardship for commerce and commuters.\n  But now, as the vernal equinox and the official first day of spring \napproaches, we can all look forward to the lion at last lying down with \nthe lamb. It is time, as the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-\n1909), wrote in ``Atlanta in Calydon'':\n\n     For winter's rains and ruins are over,\n       And all the season of snows and sins;\n     The days dividing lover and lover,\n       The light that loses, the night that wins;\n     And time remembered is grief forgotten,\n       And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,\n     And green underwood and cover\n       Blossom by blossom the spring begins.\n\n  Once again, the warm sun encourages us to consider folding away our \nscarves, our gloves, and our overcoats, retiring the snow shovel to the \nshed, and pulling out instead the trowel and the seed packets.\n  How many of us have enjoyed looking at those seed packets and \nfancying ourselves as young farmers, how we would grow these cucumbers, \nor these tomatoes, or this lettuce, or these onions, or the potatoes?\n  What promise is contained in seed packets! What a joy. Reading garden \ncatalogs during cold, dark winter days inspires small-scale gardeners \nlike myself with dreams of grandeur. Ah, fancy myself growing these \nbeautiful vegetables. Ah. I am sure that others have shared that \npleasantry with me many times. A few tomato plants are all that I \nreally have the time for, but for me those humble plants with the spicy \nscent, their soft leaves and glossy fruits--Better Boy, Big Boy, \nBeefsteak, Early Girl--a few tomato plants are all that I really have \nthe time for, but for me, those humble plants with their spicy scent, \ntheir soft leaves and glossy fruits, serve each year to reconnect me \nwith cycles of nature. In my few tomato plants, I share with farmers \nthroughout the Nation worries about cold spells, early frosts, drought, \nexcessive rainfall, fungus, and insect infestation. But, like those \nfarmers throughout the Nation, I glory in the success of my efforts, \nand my family and neighbors--mostly my family--share in the bounties of \nthose tomato plants.\n  How can one even dare to believe that there is no God, no Creator? \nWhy do I put those tomato plants in the ground? Why? I have confidence \nthat the Creator of man and the universe is going to make those tomato \nplants bear some fruit.\n  And this year I will delight in introducing the newest member of my \nfamily, too--I say to our distinguished leader, a new member of my \nfamily--a dainty great-granddaughter, Caroline Byrd Fatemi; wait until \nI introduce her to my garden. She was born just 2 weeks ago yesterday. \nSo small and precious now, she will grow strong and happy in the \nsunshine. And perhaps someday she too will grow some tomatoes.\n  I do love the promise of the spring.\n  William Jennings Bryan spoke of the Father, the Creator:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the \n     Earth the soul of man made in the image of his Creator?\n       If He stoops to give to the rosebush whose withered \n     blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of \n     another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the \n     sons of men when the frosts of winter come?\n\n  I do love the promise of the spring. Every place is better for \nspringtime's artistry. There exists no imposing monument of granite or \nmarble that is not improved by a softening verdigris of springtime \ngreen, highlighted by bright blooms. Washington is at its best in April \nand May, under bright skies and tossing cherry blossoms, with all of \nits governmental mass leavened by leaves. Spring travels a little \nslower to the hillsides of West Virginia, but it is, perhaps, all the \nmore cherished for blooming later. There, in the deep shadows of the \nhills where rhododendron thickets outline quiet chapels among the \ncathedral of the trees, greening springtime coincides in harmony with \nGod's Easter promise of resurrection.\n  I encourage my colleagues, and everyone else, too, to shake off the \nlast of the winter blahs and go outside. Go early in the morning when \nthe birds sing in grand chorus, or in the blinding brightness of noon, \nor in the lilac serenity of evening, but go outside. Go outside and \nbreathe in the scent of hyacinths and fresh-turned earth. Plant a \ngarden. Plant a single tomato seedling and join in the great community \nof gardeners and farmers and lovers of the earth. But do enjoy the \nspringtime. It resurrects the spirit.\n\n       I asked the Robin as he sprang\n       From branch to branch and sweetly sang\n       What made his breast so round and red\n       ``Twas looking at the sun,'' he said.\n\n       And I asked the violets sweet and blue,\n       Sparkling in the morning dew,\n       Whence came their colors, then so shy,\n       They answered, ``Looking to the sky.''\n\n       I saw the roses one by one\n       Unfold their petals to the sun.\n       I asked them what made their tints so bright,\n       And they answered, ``Looking toward the light.''\n\n       I asked the thrush whose silvery note\n       Came like a song from angel's throat,\n       Why he sang in the twilight dim.\n       He answered, ``Looking up at Him.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I will continue to work on that, I should say to Senator \nByrd.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2994-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE SMILING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I don't know \nabout eloquence, but I can say that the Senator from Mississippi always \ncarries a warm smile. I have not been noted for smiling. I once read a \nstory by Nathaniel Hawthorne entitled, ``The Great Stone Face.'' And so \nI usually think of myself, in the context of that story, as the great \nstone face. But the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is always \nbubbling with energy, always on the move, always wearing a smile, \nalways with twinkling eyes. He brings a lift to the spirits of all of \nus. I congratulate him. I know that grandchild of his is always going \nto carry the picture in his little mind of that grandfather with that \nsparkling, radiant smile.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2994-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2994-S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS ON KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Byrd and I, as a matter of fact, \njust came from an extended meeting with the President of the United \nStates, where the joy of our grandchildren and great grandchildren was \nalso uppermost in our minds, because we are\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\ntalking about actions by our country, our Government, that affect the \nyoung people--a military action. While I always try to have that smile \non my face, sometimes it is very serious, what we have to attend to. \nBut I appreciate Senator Byrd's comments this morning to the President. \nI appreciate the President of the United States meeting with the \nleaders of Congress as we talk about the situation regarding Serbia and \nKosovo. I thought it was a positive step.\n  The Senate, the Congress, must be involved and consulted if a \ndecision is made to take military action, certainly if it is an action \nthat could lead to being an act of war. And we will consider this very \ncarefully. I think it is important this afternoon, and on Monday, the \nSenate be heard on this issue; that we have the time to discuss and \ndebate, as a matter of fact, the merits and demerits of the plans in \nKosovo, what risks are involved. I don't believe the American people \nnow are properly informed about the situation as it now exists. The \ndynamics have definitely changed in the last few days.\n  We have gone from considering whether or not ground troops from the \nUnited States as a part of a NATO mission would be placed in a \npeaceable situation in Kosovo--to a situation where it appears that an \nagreed settlement is not going to be achieved and that the Serbian \nofficials will not agree to have a NATO force come in a peaceful \narrangement--to the possibility of airstrikes involving Serbian troops \nand Serbian sites. This is a very serious step. I think the Senate \nshould have an opportunity to be briefed as we were on Thursday, as we \nmeet with the President as we did today, and to continue to be involved \nin the dialog.\n\n  I believe the President needed to hear some of the things that he \nheard today. That is why these meetings are not one-way, they are two-\nway streets--to make sure that we as the people's representatives are \nbeing heard. We made the point, the Speaker and others made the point, \nthat the President needs to address this issue with the American \npeople, explain what the present circumstances are. The President will \nhave a press conference this afternoon. I hope he will address it, and \nI hope there will be appropriate questions about exactly what the plans \nare for our military in the near term.\n  Does Senator Byrd wish me to yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, if the distinguished majority leader would.\n  I am glad he has spoken as he has. I don't know how much the American \npeople know about, really, what we face. And I am not sure I know, by \nany means. I am sure that Congress has certain constitutional \nresponsibilities and that when it comes to sending American men and \nwomen into war, into conflict, into danger, Congress also bears part of \nthe responsibility. I am fearful that in recent years especially, \nAmerican Presidents in both parties have not recognized that fact, and \nthey have, sent men and women into areas of peril without taking the \nCongress along with them.\n  I think we learned in Vietnam that unless the American people are \nbehind an effort such as that, it cannot succeed. I believe that \nCongress ought to fulfill its duties. But I also believe that Congress \nhas to take a stand and demand that its constitutional prerogatives be \nrecognized. No President can carry on a war without the support of \nCongress or without the support of the American people. I am sure the \ndistinguished majority leader feels the same way about it. We are on \nthe edge of a great precipice here of national danger. And what is \nhappening in the Balkans is something that should be of great concern \nto all of us and to the people of the world. It was from that area, may \nI say to my friend, that the Roman legions procured their fiercest \nfighters. There has been turmoil and fighting in that area of the world \nfor hundreds and hundreds of years. We are seeing there today an \nindividual, Mr. Milosevic, who has a strong will and who is absolutely \nruthless in his determination to subjugate and to massacre and to \nexterminate other peoples.\n\n  The President needs to get out front and tell the American people why \nit is, if we are going to send our men and women into conflict there. \nIf we are going to send planes in there, some of those planes may be \nshot down. Americans may be held hostage. Americans may be killed. The \nAmerican people need to know what we are about to do and why and what \nthe end game is and what the exit strategy is, what the motivations \nare, what the costs are going to be, before we get out there on a limb \nand have a lot of people killed.\n  I hope the President will take the lead. Sandy Berger or the \nSecretary of State or even the Vice President cannot speak for the one \nman in the country who is the President of the United States, whether \nhe is a Democrat or Republican. The President has the responsibility to \nget out front, tell the American people what we face and if we are \nabout to send men and women into war, and when this will end, if we \never go there, ever begin bombing. We need to know this. The President \nneeds the Congress behind him. He can't do this alone. He needs the \nCongress behind him. He needs Republicans and Democrats. We can only be \nbehind him if we understand what we are being asked to do. We don't \nreally understand.\n  I compliment the majority leader and the minority leader for \nrequesting--they should not have to request this--this hearing in the \npresence of the President of the United States. That is the man we need \nto hear from. He is the man who has to put his name on the line. He has \nto get out front. He has to tell the American people the truth, and he \nhas to tell Congress. He has to keep Congress informed. He must not get \nout too far in front of Congress, because, otherwise, he will look \nbehind him and wonder where the troops are one day, meaning the \ncongressional battalions.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2995-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2995-S2996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 81\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Grassley, Sam \n             Brownback, Tim Hutchinson, Michael B. Enzi, Bill \n             Frist, Frank Murkowski, Jim Inhofe, Conrad Burns, \n             Mitch McConnell, Ted Stevens, and Jim Bunning.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the purpose of the procedure that I just \nundertook was to make sure we had an opportunity today and on Monday to \nbegin to debate the issue surrounding Kosovo and to decide what the \nSenate's role should be and what action we will take. This may not be \nthe amendment we wind up considering in the end, but to make sure that \nwe have this opportunity for this debate, I thought it was essential we \ngo ahead and take this action now.\n  I have been working with the minority leader for the last 2 days in \nan effort to try to reach an agreement with respect to the situation in \nKosovo, as to how we could consider it and when that would be. \nUnfortunately, because of the evolving circumstances and because of the \nbriefings that occurred on Thursday and again today, we have not been \nable to best decide how to proceed.\n  Therefore, I did call up the Hutchinson amendment, which primarily \nhad to do with the things that would have to occur, information we \nwould have to receive from the President before the deployment of \nground troops in Kosovo. I then sent to the desk an amendment to that \nwhich said, basically, that military action could not be undertaken \nwithout the Senate having considered this issue. That is basically the \nSmith of New Hampshire proposal.\n  Again, I reiterate, so we can lock in the guarantee that we will have \nan opportunity to discuss this, a cloture motion was filed, but \nhopefully it won't be necessary to have this vote occur on cloture. We \nwill need to continue to talk about how to proceed, how long we will \nneed, what a vote would be, or to make the decision not to go forward \nwith it would also be an option. I will continue to work with Senators \non both sides of the aisle who wish to be heard on this to try to come \nto a conclusion about how we want to have this vote.\n  We also have the situation where next week the budget resolution will \nbe taken up on Tuesday afternoon, and we have 50 hours of debate on \nthat. It is our intent to complete action on that before we leave so \nthat we can, for the first time in a long time, meet the April 15 \ndeadline in having a budget resolution agreed to. We have a lot of work \nto do. I want to try to set this up.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 30 \nminutes equally divided, for debate only, on Tuesday, March 23, \nbeginning at 11:45, and a cloture vote occur at 12:15 on Tuesday, and \nthe mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority leader whether or not, given the fact it does not now appear \nthat we will have votes on Monday and Senators will just be coming \nback, we could schedule the vote for 2:15, immediately following the \ncaucus, so that we would have the opportunity to discuss this matter in \ncaucus and decide what course of action we may take; 2:15, I think, \nwould probably accommodate many Senators who might not otherwise have \nthe opportunity.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield, I think that is a reasonable \nrequest. My only purpose in trying to get it to begin and be completed \nbefore the policy luncheon is so we could go right to the budget \nresolution right after lunch. I think to just have the vote right after \nlunch at 2:15 and then go to the budget resolution is a reasonable \nrequest. We will have Monday in which Senators can begin to express \nthemselves. Senator Byrd and I just had a little colloquy. We will have \nmore Members, I hope, available, as we go forward, and Senators are \nalready calling to indicate they would like to be heard even this \nafternoon or Monday, to discuss this. We will have the opportunity \nTuesday morning.\n  I want to say, again, we may decide to vitiate all of this. We are \njust not ready to go forward. If that is the case, then we will do so.\n  I will modify my request to say that--I would like to have the time \nstill equally divided before the luncheon--the vote occur at 2:15 \ninstead of 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation. I thank \nSenator Cleland. I thought it was just going to be a couple of minutes. \nYou have been very patient. Thank you for yielding this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In yesterday's Record, it did not reflect that I was \nan original cosponsor of the Roberts-Brownback amendments regarding gas \nproducers that was adopted. I want to inform my colleagues that I was \nan original cosponsor and I understand the permanent Record will \nreflect that fact.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the bill managers for \naccommodating me--and more importantly the elderly and disabled \nresidents of the St. Paul Public Housing Agency--by accepting an \namendment I was prepared to offer which is intended to right a wrong \nwhich has been imposed by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) upon elderly and disabled public housing residents in \nSt. Paul, Minnesota, as well as nearly 50 other cities in America. As \nyou may be aware, the Service Coordinator Program administered by HUD \nhas succeeded where many Federal programs have failed. It has enabled \nsome of our nation's most vulnerable citizens--the elderly and \ndisabled--to live independently in public housing with dignity. Mr. \nPresident, most elderly and disabled public housing residents are not \nhelpless individuals, but rather are people who simply need a little \nassistance doing the day to day tasks we all take for granted. However, \nwithout someone to help with these tasks, many of these people may be \nforced to move into more expensive assisted living or nursing \nfacilities. The Service Coordinator Program provides basic support \nservices to these residents to enable them to live independently.\n  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, HUD has again proven its \nincompetence by bungling a recent round of funding of this popular and \nhighly successful program. In a June 1998, funding announcement, HUD \nstated that the $6.5 million available for public housing agency \nservice coordinators would be allocated through a lottery, but HUD also \nnoted that expiring three year grants would be funded first before the \ngeneral lottery. Unfortunately, the $6.5 million HUD set-aside was well \nshort of the $9.9 million in applications received and rather that \nfunding all renewals at a prorated level, HUD quietly selected some \napplicants through a lottery and rejected others.\n  Although this may simply seem like an inconvenient administrative \nglitch, to the residents of the St. Paul public housing agency which \nhave thrived under this program, it is devastating. That is because St. \nPaul PHA was one of the fifty or so PHAs which were passed over by HUD. \nAs a result of HUD's blunder, the St. Paul public housing agency will \nhave to release three of their service coordinators within the next \nmonth, resulting in the disruption of countless elderly and disabled \nresidents' lives.\n  In order to correct this problem, my amendment transfers $3.4 million \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development administrative \nexpenses account to fully fund the applications which HUD rejected due \nto their miscalculation. I believe this amendment appropriately keeps \nour promise to the elderly and disabled public housing residents with \nthe burden being borne by the agency which created the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2996-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2996-S2997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GRATITUDE AND THANKS TO SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to say a word of gratitude and \nthanks to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for \nseveral observations.\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\n  First of all, as the war clouds gather in the Balkans, hopefully this \nNation and NATO will not be drawn into war. If we are drawn into war, I \nhope we will, as a country, keep in mind the axiom by Baron von \nClausewitz that one must know the last step one takes in terms of war \nbefore one takes the first step. That should be fully debated here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia had some \nwonderful observations about life itself and about spring.\n  I could not help but identify with his wonderful comments about his \ngreat granddaughter and his love for tomatoes and the things that grow \nin the spring. My father has a similar love for vegetable gardens and \nparticularly for Better Boy and Big Boy tomatoes. I was very touched by \nSenator Byrd's comments about me, and I appreciate his thoughts \nimmensely.\n  The last week or two has been fascinating in my life where I learned \nsome things about my own experience in war that have, in effect, \ntriggered a lot of the emotions of war and, hopefully, will lead to a \ndeeper healing of the wounds I incurred there.\n  The story is in the Hill newspaper, and Senator Byrd was kind enough \nto enter that into the Congressional Record. I thank him personally for \nthat, and it is an honor to be serving with him. He has been one of my \npersonal heroes for many, many years.\n  I wanted to say those words, Mr. President, because we have an \nincredible human being with us in the Chamber, Senator Byrd, whose \nlight and life continues to guide us all.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that we are now going to \ntalk about the Kosovo situation. I think it is a very fluid resolution \nthat we have before us but, nevertheless, I think it is very important \nthat we begin to talk about the situation there, because, frankly, in \nthe last 24 hours, things have changed greatly. When the Serbs refused \nto sign the peace agreement, that started a different dynamic.\n  Many Members of Congress have been in constant meetings with members \nof the administration, including the President, about just where we are \nnow, where is NATO, what are the commitments and, most important, I \nthink from all of the meetings, it has become very clear that many \nMembers of Congress want to know what is the totality of the \ncommitment.\n  We are beginning to have to address the issue of what kind of hostile \npossibilities will there be if the NATO forces, which includes the \nUnited States, go forward into any kind of a military intervention in \nKosovo.\n  We do not know what Milosevic is planning. I believe if President \nMilosevic starts to take human lives, that is going to trigger a very \nswift response.\n  I hope the President of Serbia will realize that he could solidify \nthis Congress in a way that nothing else would if he decides that he is \ngoing to embark on that course, because I think our forces are ready to \nstop something that would be the annihilation of innocent people.\n  Mr. President, I think many are not prepared to go into a full-scale \naltercation with a sovereign country until we have looked at the \nentirety of that commitment. We need to know the entirety of the \ncommitment of our allies and what we ourselves are willing to do in \nlight of our own principles and our own standards for when we would put \nAmerican troops into harm's way, into foreign conflicts, and into a \nsituation in which there is no peace agreement. There is even a \nquestion of whether it is a real peace agreement if that peace \nagreement is arrived at through bombing.\n  This is a watershed period for our country, and the Members of \nCongress who have been participating in the meetings are trying to put \nbefore the President and the administration and the people of this \ncountry exactly what are our options.\n  I believe it is going to be very important in the next week or so \nthat we do know what our commitments are, if we are going to propose to \ntake any kind of hostile action, that we know what is the end game, \nwhat is the strategy, what is the commitment of dollars as well as \npotential lives. The President of the United States must come forward \nand not only inform Congress, not only work with Congress on these \nplans, but inform and work with the American people to explain exactly \nwhat is proposed and what will be the end game if we get into this kind \nof conflict.\n  Mr. President, this is a sobering time. I am pleased that my \namendment is the pending business.\n  I am pleased that Senator Lott has now offered a second-degree \namendment, because we now have two options. We have the option of an \nup-or-down vote on whether we are ready to send troops into Kosovo, or \nwe have a second approach, which is, if we are going to do this, let's \nhave a plan. Those are two options, and in the next 72 hours, I think \nit will become more and more clear what kind of approach we should \ntake.\n  There is one thing that is certain today, and that is, the Congress \nof the United States has the power to declare war. I suggest that means \nthe power to send our troops into harm's way for a long period of time \nif we are expecting a conflict. If this is the case, then it is \nimperative we talk about this issue up front, we have a full debate in \nthe Senate and House of Representatives, that the people of America \nknow what the plans are, know what the potential liabilities are, and \nthe people of America realize what is at stake. There is no substitute \nfor this kind of planning and this kind of communication.\n\n  So I am pleased that we are now on this amendment. I look forward to \nworking with all the Members of the Senate so that everyone can be \nheard and so that, hopefully, we will be able to come to an agreement, \nbut if not, a clear agreement that there will be a real vote and that \nCongress will play its constitutional role in what happens next; \nbecause I believe that what happens in Kosovo and the rest of the \nBalkans in the decisions that will be made in the next few weeks will \nperhaps have consequences for years to come in our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we face a matter of utmost seriousness as \nevents are evolving with respect to Kosovo and the massing of a large \namount of Serbian troops about to strike imminently, according to all \nreports. Ethnic cleansing is already being undertaken in the form of \nbrutal attacks on people in Kosovo. Large numbers of people--according \nto media reports; and since confirmed--were lined up, asked to kneel, \npistols placed behind their heads, and executed in cold-blooded murder. \nThis follows a pattern of ethnic cleansing which has gone on for many \nyears in Bosnia.\n  The United States is considering, in conjunction with NATO forces, \nair attacks. In the context of what is likely to go on in Kosovo, these \nare in fact, acts of war which call for authorization by the Congress \nof the United States under the U.S. Constitution.\n  We have seen in modern times this constitutional mandate violated by \nunilateral action by the President, arguably under his authority as \nCommander in Chief. It is true that he has substantial authority as \nCommander in Chief to act in times of emergency, but when Congress has \nan opportunity to deliberate and to consider the issue, it\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\nis the congressional authority and congressional responsibility to act \nif the United States is to be engaged in war.\n  Presidents are traditionally reluctant--unwilling really--to come to \nthe Congress to ask for authorization because they do not want to make \nany concessions about what they consider to be their unilateral \nauthority as Commander in Chief. That, in fact, was the tact taken by \nPresident Bush when he declined to come to Congress to ask for a \nresolution authorizing the use of force in 1991.\n  However, debate was undertaken. We had historic debates on this floor \non January 10, 11, and 12. Finally, a resolution was passed in the \nHouse and passed in the Senate. The resolution which passed here was by \na very narrow margin of 52-47. But the hand of the President was \nstrengthened immeasurably by the congressional action.\n  We have seen the brutal historical fact of life that a war cannot be \nmaintained--such as the Vietnam war--without public and congressional \nsupport. There was a Senate briefing yesterday by the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Adviser, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outlining a number of the issues \nrelating to possible military action in Kosovo. This morning, President \nClinton met with a large group of Senators and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives in a session which lasted approximately 2 hours, going \nover a great many of these issues.\n  I believe it is fair to say that although there has been some \ndissent, most of those in attendance stated that they believe that \nacting against Serbia, a sovereign nation, in the context of this case \ndoes constitute an act of war and should require congressional \nauthorization. I commend our distinguished majority leader, Senator \nLott, for taking steps today after that meeting occurred to try to \nbring this issue to a vote.\n  There is an amendment pending on the supplemental appropriations bill \nstating that there should not be airstrikes taken by the administration \nwithout prior congressional authority. I believe this is a very sound \nproposition.\n  In my view, it is very important that there be a national debate, and \nthat there be an understanding by the American people of precisely what \nis involved if we undertake airstrikes in Kosovo. This is not a matter \nwhere the airstrikes can be limited to missile strikes which do not put \nAmericans in harm's way. If there are airstrikes with aircraft, \nconsidering all of the factors at play here, there is a very, very \nserious risk of casualties. That is something which none of us takes \nlightly. Certainly the American people are very reluctant, as the \nAmerican people should be, to see those kinds of risks undertaken; and \nthe Congress is very reluctant--really, unwilling--to take those risks \nunless there is a clear statement of what our national interests are. \nAnd if they warrant that kind of military action.\n\n  The Constitution gives the sole authority to involve the U.S. \nMilitary in war to the Congress of the United States. One of the \nproblems with this issue is that too often when confronted, there is a \ntendency on the part of the Congress--candidly--to duck. In February of \n1998 when missile strikes were imminent against Iraq, they never came \nto pass. The Congress had an opportunity to debate and act on the issue \nand decided not to act.\n  Last fall, and again this past December, we had missile strikes \nagainst Iraq and, again, the Congress of the United States had an \nopportunity and authority to face up to that issue and decided not to \nact. Now, with the imminence of military action in Kosovo, in my view, \nit is imperative that this issue be debated by the Senate. It has been \ndebated by the House of Representatives and they had a narrow, but \nfavorable vote--a close vote--supporting peacekeepers, conditioned on a \npeace agreement being entered into. The agreement has not since \nhappened, so that resolution is really irrelevant at this point.\n  But it is my hope that when the President addresses the Nation this \nafternoon at 4 o'clock, as he is scheduled to do, that will trigger a \nvery extensive national debate. That is not the kind of debate that is \ngoing to be triggered by one Senator in an empty Senate Chamber \nspeaking on C-SPAN 2, but the American people need to know what is \ninvolved. They need to know that there are risks involved, and there \nhas to be the formulation of a national judgment to undertake this risk \nif we are, in fact, to move forward.\n  I have found in my contacts with people from my State of Pennsylvania \nthat the people do not yet understand Bosnia, do not understand why we \nare there. We have the bitter experience of Somalia, when we saw the \ntelevision picture of American soldiers being dragged through the \nstreets, and we beat a hasty retreat.\n  We ought not to undertake military action in Kosovo unless we are \nprepared for the eventualities. I think it is a very useful matter to \nhave the issue formulated in the Senate, to have debate on Monday and \nTuesday, to follow up on the President's presentation, and to make a \ndetermination as to what our national policy should be. While bearing \nin mind that it is the role of the Congress to authorize the use of \nforce if, in fact, it is to be undertaken.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for a short while today and on Monday and \non Tuesday, we will debating a very short, clear, and concise proposal \nby the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, \nrelating to the use of American Armed Forces in combat in Kosovo and \nYugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, I want to state as forcefully as I possibly can my \nsupport for that amendment. Senator Smith states, I think with total \naccuracy, that the U.S. national security interests in Kosovo do not \nrise to a level that warrants military operations by the United States. \nIt goes on to point out that any intervention on our part would be to \nengage the Armed Forces of the United States in a civil war inside the \ntruncated but still nation of Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, there was an op-ed column in the Washington Post just \n3 days ago in which the author set out three principles that struck me \nas totally sound and logical. Rule 1 is, don't involve yourself in a \ncivil war; rule 2, if you do involve yourself in a civil war, take a \nside; rule 3, if you do involve yourself in a civil war and take a \nside, make certain that your side wins.\n  Mr. President, the proposed intervention in Kosovo on the part of the \nUnited States essentially violates all three of those rules. Clearly, \nit will involve us in a civil war. To a large extent, we will not have \npicked a side because we will not be promoting what those who are \nrevolting against the Serbian authorities wish; that is to say, their \nindependence. And we clearly aren't going in with the intention of \nwinning in the sense of settling that conflict.\n  So we will follow the sorry example of this administration's military \nadventures so far: The billions of dollars we have spent in Haiti with \ntroops still in that country now simply defending themselves, without \nhaving any discernible positive impact on that society; the low caliber \nwar in which we have been engaged on and off in Iraq without any \ndiscernible prospect of removing Saddam Hussein from office; and our \nmultibillion-dollar adventure in Bosnia, an adventure that has no end, \nbecause we are attempting to force people to live together who have no \nintention and no willingness to do so; and, now here in Kosovo we \npropose to do exactly the same thing.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the situation would be different and \nperhaps more justifiable if the President were to go all the way and to \nsay that the service of freedom requires liberating people who no \nlonger wish to be a part of Yugoslavia and helping them attain their \nfreedom. But we are not doing that. We continue to promote the fiction \nthat borders will not be changed.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n  The Secretary of State has justified this intervention on three \ngrounds: that it is vital to the survival of NATO, a strange \nproposition when we have gotten NATO into this position largely \nourselves and largely by accident; second, that there are humanitarian \nreasons to save the victims of this civil war, a justification which \nwill also require us to enter a civil war in Africa, and perhaps in \nAfghanistan, and in Lord knows how many other places around the world; \nand the ancient domino theory that if we don't stop this fighting here, \nit will next go over into Macedonia, into Greece, and into Turkey. But \nif we were to defend Macedonia, at least we would be defending a \nsovereign nation.\n\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that before the President commits our \nArmed Forces to combat in Kosovo that he should be required to seek the \nadvice and consent of both of the Houses of the Congress of the United \nStates. I am convinced that this is a matter on which the views of this \nbody should be known formally after a debate, and by a vote. I am \nconvinced that the amendment sets the issues in this case in stark and \nappropriate context. And I am convinced, Mr. President, that we should \nvote in favor of that Smith amendment; that we should not risk the \nlives of members of our armed services and the prestige of the United \nStates to an undefined cause for undefined and secondary ends in a way \nin which those ends are highly unlikely to be met, or at least highly \nunlikely to be met without a permanent investment in both our money and \nin our Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2999-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as the Congress works to provide billions of \ndollars to address a crisis affecting our neighbors abroad who have had \ntheir lives disrupted overnight by raging waters, I have become more \nand more concerned about another water-related crisis occurring every \nday in this nation. That crisis is the lack of a safe, reliable supply \nof drinking water for millions of rural American families. Since 1995, \nfederal data outlining the sorry details of the safe drinking water \ncrisis have been available and, yet, year after year, adequate funding \nfor water and wastewater projects that would solve this crisis is not \nprovided. Last night, my distinguished colleagues joined Senator \nStevens and me in sending a message to rural Americans that their \ncrisis is not forgotten.\n  Yesterday evening, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by myself \nand Senator Stevens to the supplemental appropriations bill that would \nprovide $30 million in additional funds for rural water and wastewater \nsystems. This money would benefit the neediest of rural communities \nthat are affected by extreme conditions that increase the cost of \nconstructing water and wastewater systems, that have a high incidence \nof health problems related to water supply and poor sanitary \nconditions, or whose residents are suffering from a high rate of \npoverty.\n  Within the $30 million in budget authority provided in this \namendment, $5 million would be allocated for loans and $25 million for \ngrants. The result would be a total program level of $55,303,000. The \nreality of this funding is that this year, an additional 25 or more \ncommunities throughout the United States would get some relief from the \nfear of an inadequate, unsafe supply of drinking water.\n  Safe, reliable drinking water is not an amenity. Safe drinking water \nis essential to the health and well-being of every American. All life \nas we know it depends on the necessary element of water.\n  Most Americans take safe drinking water for granted. Most Americans \njust assume that when they turn on the faucet, clean water will \nautomatically flow out of the faucet. They assume that there will \nalways be easy access to an unlimited supply of clean, safe drinking \nwater.\n  The terrible truth is that, in the United States of America, the \nhealth of millions of men, women, and children is made vulnerable by \ntheir reliance on a possibly contaminated water supply.\n\n  According to statistics from 1998, approximately 2.2 million rural \nAmericans live with critical quality and accessibility problems related \nto their drinking water, including an estimated 730,000 American \ncitizens who have no running water in their homes. Let me repeat that--\nan estimated 730,000 people have no running water in their homes. An \nadditional five million rural Americans are affected by grave, although \nless critical, water problems, such as water sources that are over-\ntaxed or poorly protected, and by antiquated distribution systems. The \nvery young and the elderly are placed at particular risk of illnesses \ncaused by unsafe, unclean, drinking water, and many towns without a \nreliable supply of water cannot even protect residents from the threat \nof fire.\n  This funding provided in our amendment is desperately needed to \naddress conditions in West Virginia and much of Appalachia, the \nMississippi Delta, in rural and native Alaskan villages, the Colonias, \nand in Indian Reservations. Senator Stevens has been working hard to \nget the necessary funds for an authorized program for rural development \nin several Alaskan Native villages. I understand that while the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) is trying to help, funding simply is \nnot there for the water and wastewater systems that are the backbone of \nany development proposal. Our amendment specifically directs funds \nthrough the national reserve in an effort to serve the deserving \nfamilies in Alaska in a timely manner.\n  In my own state of West Virginia, families in towns such as Pageton, \nBelington, and Crum must deal with the normal family worries of \nproviding food, shelter, and a sound education to their children. Can \nyou imagine the frustration that these families face every day in \nhaving to further protect their children from a foul or unreliable \nsource of water! I am not talking about water that smells bad or tastes \nfunny. I am talking about water that must be boiled before consumption, \nor that flows--when it flows--like opaque brown sludge from their taps. \nThis is water not fit to wash a car, let alone to cook with or to mix \nwith baby formula. That simply should not be, in a nation as rich in \nresources as we are.\n  A good part of the supplemental provides assistance for disaster \nrecovery in other nations. This amendment reaches out to Americans in \ncrisis. It gives hope to rural America that a brighter future lies \nahead, a future flowing as bright and clear as the water out of their \ntap.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S2999-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 975.

A bill to encourage States to incarcerate individuals \nconvicted of murder, rape, or child molestation; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                              aimee's law\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to address the suffering of victims of repeat offenders.\n  My legislation, ``Aimee's Law,'' is named after Aimee Willard, a \ncollege senior from suburban Philadelphia who was raped and murdered by \na man released from prison in another state after serving time for a \nsimilar offense. This tragedy has made me aware of some very disturbing \nfacts about sentencing and recidivism. For instance, more than 14,000 \nmurders, rapes and sexual assaults on children are committed each year \nby felons who have been released after serving a sentence for one of \nthose very same crimes. Moreover, convicted murderers, rapists and \nchild molesters who are released from prisons and cross state lines are \nresponsible for sexual assaults on more than 1,200 people annually, \nincluding 935 children. Furthermore, recidivism rates for sexual \npredators are the highest of any category of violent crime. Despite \nthis, the average time served for rape is only five and one half years \nand the average time served for sexual assault is under four years. \nAlso troubling is the fact that thirteen percent of convicted rapists \nreceive no jail time at all.\n  With this in mind, I propose to use federal crime fighting funds to \ncreate an incentive for states to adopt stricter sentencing and truth-\nin-sentencing laws. Specifically, Aimee's Law will redirect enough \nfederal crime fighting dollars from a state that has released a \nmurderer, rapist, or child molester to pay the prosecutorial and \nincarceration costs incurred by a state which has had to reconvict this \nreleased felon for a similar crime. Indeed, laws regarding the horrific \ncrimes of murder, rape and sexual assault are best enacted at the state \nlevel. However, the federal government bears a responsibility to ensure \nthat federal taxpayer dollars are spent in such a manner as to reflect \nnational views on national issues. This legislation uses federal monies \nto create incentives without intruding into a state's right and need to \nlegislate on the problem of repeat offenders.\n  Representative Matt Salmon introduced this legislation last Congress \nand earlier this Congress. Representative Salmon's bipartisan bill \ncurrently has 66 cosponsors, including Majority Whip Tom Delay and \nDemocratic Caucus Chair Martin Frost.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nensure compliance by Federal facilities with pollution control \nrequirements; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the federal facilities clean water compliance act of 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith the senior Senator from Louisiana, the senior Senator from Ohio, \nand the junior Senator from Minnesota. This legislation--the Federal \nFacilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999--will guarantee that the \nfederal government is held to the same full range of enforcement \nmechanisms available under the Clean Water Act as private entities, \nstates, and localities. Each federal department, agency, and \ninstrumentality will be subject to and comply with all Federal, State, \nand local requirements with respect to the control and abatement of \nwater pollution and management in the same manner and extent as any \nperson is subject to such requirements, including the payment of \nreasonable service charges.\n  It has been over twenty-six years since the enactment of the Clean \nWater Act. This Act has been an effective tool in improving the quality \nof our nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. Over that period of time, \nhowever, states have not had the ability to impose certain fines and \npenalties against federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water \nAct. This is a double standard that should not be continued.\n  In 1972, Congress included provisions on federal facility compliance \nwith our nation's water pollution laws in section 313 of the Clean \nWater Act. Section 313 called for federal facilities to comply with all \nfederal, state, and local water pollution requirements. However, in \n1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled in U.S. Dept. of Energy v. \nOhio, that States could not impose certain fines and penalties against \nfederal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act and the Resource \nConservation Recovry Act (RCRA). Because of this decision, the Federal \nFacilities Compliance Act (H.R. 2194) was enacted to clarify that \nCongress intended to waive sovereign immunity for agencies in violation \nof RCRA. Federal agencies in violation of the RCRA are now subject to \nState levied fines and penalties. However, this legislation did not \naddress the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the Clean Water \nAct. The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999 makes it \nunequivocally clear that the federal government waives its claim to \nsovereign immunity in the Clean Water Act.\n  The federal government owns hundreds of thousands of buildings, \nlocated on millions of acres of land, none of which have to abide by \nthe same standards as a private entity does under the Clean Water Act. \nThis legislation simply ensures that the federal government lives by \nthe same rules it imposes on everyone else.\n  I would like to thank Senator Breaux, Senator DeWine, and Senator \nGrams for cosponsoring this important legislation, and look forward to \nworking with them and my other colleagues in the United States Senate \non its speedy consideration.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Coverdell, \nSenator DeWine and Senator Grams in introducing the ``Federal \nFacilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999.''\n  My primary reason for sponsoring the bill is to make the federal \nClean Water Act equitable by requiring that it apply to and be enforced \nagainst the federal government.\n  Currently, states, local governments and the private sector do not \nhave immunity from the act's enforcement. By the same principle, the \nfederal government should not be granted such immunity from the clean \nwater statute and this bill provides that parity.\n  The bill also provides that the federal government would be subject \nto all the same enforcement mechanisms that apply to states, local \ngovernments and the private sector under the Clean Water Act.\n  Fairness, safety, public health and environmental protection all \ndictate that Federal agencies should be held to the same standards for \nwater pollution prevention and control as apply to states, local \ngovernments and the private sector.\n  Equity is ensured by our bill because all levels of government and \nthe private sector would be treated the same under the Clean Water \nAct's enforcement programs. No one would be allowed immunity.\n  To paraphrase a well-known adage, what's good for states, local \ngovernments and the private sector in terms of clean water should be \ngood for the federal government.\n  In addition to the provisions stated previously, the bill reflects \nthe adage's fairness principle in another fashion.\n  The bill would hold the federal government accountable to comply not \nonly with its own clean water statute, but also with state and local \nclean water laws. Again, equity would be upheld. And, safety, public \nhealth and environmental protection would be strengthened.\n  Other provisions are contained as well in the legislation which \nSenator Coverdell, Senator DeWine, Senator Grams and I are introducing \ntoday. For example, the EPA administrator, the Secretary of the Army \nand the Secretary of Transportation would be authorized to pursue \nadministrative enforcement actions under the Clean Water Act against \nany non-complying federal agencies. It also includes provisions for \nfederal employees' personal liability under the act's civil and \ncriminal penalty provisions and a requirement that the federal \ngovernment pay reasonable service charges when complying with clean \nwater laws.\n  Over the years, the United States has made dramatic advances in \nprotecting the environment as a result of the Clean Water Act. We have \nall benefitted as a result.\n  Today, I encourage other Senators to join Senator Coverdell, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Grams and me as cosponsors of the bill to bring equity \nto the clean water program and to make possible the expansion of its \npublic and private benefits.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Coverdell, \nBreaux, and Grams in introducing the Federal Facilities Clean Water \nCompliance Act of 1999. This legislation would\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\nhold the Federal Government accountable under the Nation's Federal \nwater laws. Today, states, local governments and the private sector \nmust all comply with each and every Federal, State, and local water \nrequirement. The Federal Government does not.\n  Although Congress included provisions requiring Federal facilities to \ncomply with the Nation's water pollution laws in 1972, the United \nStates Supreme Court ruled that State governments could not impose \ncertain fines and penalties against Federal agencies for violations of \nthe Clean Water Act. While other legislation has forced the Federal \nGovernment to comply with other environmental statutes, Congress has \nnot yet brought Federal facilities into compliance with the \nrequirements on the prevention and control of water pollution.\n  This legislation, however, guarantees that the Federal Government is \n(1) held to the same enforcement mechanisms under the Clean Water Act \nas private entities, states, and localities; (2) complies with all of \nthe Federal, State, and local requirements on the prevention and \ncontrol of water pollution; and (3) is responsible for the payment of \nreasonable service charges.\n  The Clean Water Act celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary two years \nago. As a result, the entire nation has benefitted from cleaner water. \nIn the interests of fairness, the Federal Government should not be \ngranted immunity from the Nation's clean water laws any longer. For the \nsake of fairness, public safety and health, and environmental \nprotection, the Federal Government should be held to the same standards \nfor water pollution prevention and control as states, local governments \nand the private sector.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Federal \nFacilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999. I would like to thank \nSenator Coverdell for bringing this important legislation forward again \nin the 106th Congress.\n  Quite simply, this legislation would force federal agencies to comply \nwith the provisions of the Clean Water Act--something I believe most \ncitizens assume already takes place. Unfortunately, when Congress \npassed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it left an out for federal agency \ncompliance with the law by allowing them to claim ``sovereign \nimmunity'' for protection against state actions or fines. So when \nfederal agencies are not complying with provisions of the Clean Water \nAct, they can state in court that they are above the law.\n  I have always believed that the government must live under the same \nrules that it forces everyone else to live under. Any government which \nattempts to subvert the law or hide from responsibility by claiming \n``sovereign immunity'' from environmental protection requirements, is a \ngovernment that is above the people it serves, rather than a servant of \nthe people. This legislation would reverse that trend, and force the \nfederal government to waive sovereign immunity when a state brings an \naction under the Clean Water Act. And the bill ensures that any money \nthat state receives as a result of such an action is placed back into \nprograms that protect the environment or defray the costs of \nenvironmental protection or enforcement.\n  I believe it is important that federal agencies comply with the \nenvironmental standards Congress mandates everyone else must comply. By \npassing the legislation we are offering today, we can restore a degree \nof certainty to the American people and to our states and localities \nthat their federal government is not exempt from protecting the \nenvironment and that their federal government is not above the law. \nThat is why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. I look forward to \nworking with Senators Coverdell, DeWine, and Breaux over the coming \nweeks and months in bringing this matter before the full Senate for \ndebate and a vote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 670. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the exclusion from gross income for foster care payments shall \nalso apply to payments by qualifying placement agencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          tax code legislation\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \neliminate unnecessary distinctions drawn by the Internal Revenue Code \nin the tax treatment of payments received by people who open their \nhomes to care for foster children and adults. Currently, the law allows \nan exclusion from income for foster care payments received by some \nproviders, while denying eligibility for the exclusion to other \nproviders. My bill expands the law's exclusion for foster care \npayments. By simplifying the tax treatment of foster care payments, the \nbill will remove the inequities and uncertainties inherent in the \ncurrent tax treatment.\n  Under current law, foster care providers are permitted to deduct \nexpenditures incurred for the care of foster individuals. Providers \nmust maintain detailed records to substantiate these deductions. In \nlieu of this detailed record keeping, section 131 of the Internal \nRevenue Code allows certain foster care providers to exclude from \nincome the payments they receive for providing foster care. Eligibility \nfor this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three \nfactors: the age of the person in foster care; the type of foster care \nplacement agency; and the source of the foster care payments. For \nchildren under age 19 in foster care, section 131 permits providers to \nexclude payments when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) or \na charitable tax-exempt placement agency places the individual in \nfoster care and makes the foster care payments. For persons age 19 and \nolder, section 131 permits providers to exclude foster care payments \nonly when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) places the \nindividual and makes the payments.\n  This bill will simplify these anachronistic tax rules by expanding \nthe tax code's exclusion to include foster care payments for all \npersons in foster care, regardless of age. The exclusion will also be \navailable when the foster care placement is made by a private foster \ncare placement agency and even when foster care payments are received \nthrough a private foster care placement agency, rather than directly \nfrom a State (or one of its political subdivisions). To ensure \nappropriate oversight, the bill requires that the placement agency be \neither licensed by, or certified by, a State or a political subdivision \nthereof.\n  A qualified foster care payment under this bill must be made pursuant \nto a foster care program of a State or a political subdivision thereof. \nMy intention is for this bill to cover the wide variety of foster care \nprograms developed by States, some of which are part of larger State \nprograms designed to provide a variety of home- and community-based \nservices to individuals. These foster care programs place children--and \nin some cases adults--in homes of unrelated families who provide foster \ncare on a full-time basis. Families providing foster care give those in \ntheir care the daily support and supervision typically given to a \nfamily member. Like traditional families, foster care providers ensure \nthat foster children or adults have a healthy physical environment, get \nroutine and emergency medical care, are adequately clothed and fed, and \nhave satisfying leisure activities. Foster families provide those under \ntheir care with intellectual stimulation and emotional support that is \nall too often lacking in institutional or large congregate settings.\n  In some States, the State itself (or a political subdivision) \nadministers both child and adult foster care programs. Many States, \nhowever, are increasingly entrusting administration of these programs \nto private placement agencies, approved through licensing or \ncertification procedures, or government-designated intermediary tax-\nexempt organizations. Through the approval process, private placement \nagencies are accountable for their use of funds and for the quality of \nservices they provide. The bill is intended to cover both those \ngovernmental foster care programs funded solely by State or political \nsubdivision monies, and--especially in the case of adult foster care--\nprograms funded by the federal government, typically through a State's \nMedicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver program approved by the \nfederal government under 42 U.S.C. section 1396n(c).\n  While foster care for children has been in existence for decades, \nfoster care for adults is a more recent phenomenon. Sometimes referred \nto as\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\n``host homes'' or ``developmental homes,'' adult foster care facilities \nhave proven to be an effective alternative to institutional care for \nadults with disabilities. My home State of Vermont has been at the \nforefront of efforts to develop individualized alternatives to \ninstitutional care. In 1993, Vermont closed the state institution for \npeople with developmental disabilities. Vermont has chosen to rely on \nfoster families, so that people with developmental disabilities can \nlive in homes and participate in the regular routines of life that most \nof us take for granted. The foster care model has provided people with \ndisabilities a cost-effective opportunity for successful lives in \ncommunities, with valued relationships with their foster families that \nhave developed over time.\n  Vermont authorizes local developmental service providers to act as \nplacement agencies and to contract with families willing to provide \nfoster care in their homes. The tax law's disparate tax treatment of \nfoster care payments impedes these types of arrangements. Persons \nproviding foster care for individuals placed in their homes by the \ngovernment can exclude foster care payments from income. For providers \nreceiving payments from private agencies, however, the exclusion is not \navailable (unless the individual in foster care is under age 19 and the \nplacement agency is a nonprofit organization). Because of the \ncomplexity of current law, providers often receive conflicting advice \nfrom tax professionals regarding the proper tax treatment of foster \ncare payments they receive. In addition, these rules discourage willing \nfamilies from providing foster care in their homes to persons placed by \nprivate placement agencies, thus reducing the availability of care \nalternatives.\n  Mr. President, this bill will advance the development of family-based \nfoster care services, a highly valued alternative to \ninstitutionalization. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to again introduce with \nmy colleague, Senator Jeffords, a critically important piece of \nlegislation that will ensure fair treatment for individuals and \nfamilies who provide invaluable care to foster children and adults.\n  Foster care providers are currently permitted to deduct expenditures \nmade while caring for foster individuals if detailed expense records \nare maintained to support such deductions. However, section 131 of the \nInternal Revenue Code permits certain foster care providers to exclude, \nfrom taxable income, payments they receive to care for foster \nindividuals. Who specifically is available for this exclusion depends \nupon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the individual \nreceiving foster care services, the type of foster care placement \nagency, and the source of the foster care payments.\n  Section 131 permits foster care providers to exclude payments from \ntaxable income only when a state, or one of its political divisions, or \na charitable tax exempt placement agency places the individual and \nmakes the foster care payments for children less than 19 years of age. \nHowever, for adults over the age of 19, section 131 permits foster care \nproviders to exclude payments from taxable income only when a state, or \none of its divisions, places the individual and provides the foster \ncare payments.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must move to eliminate the inequities and \nneedless complexities of the current system. Because states and \nlocalities across the country are increasingly relying on private \nagencies to arrange for foster care services for both children and \nadults, this inequity will only become more apparent. Presently, some \nfoster care providers are understandably reluctant to contract with \nprivate placement agencies because current law requires such providers \nto include foster care payments as taxable income. In contrast, current \nlaw permits providers who care for foster individuals placed in their \nhomes by government agencies to exclude such payments from taxable \nincome. Current law, therefore, discourages families from providing \nfoster care on behalf of private placement agencies, thereby reducing \nbadly-needed foster care opportunities for individuals requiring \nassistance.\n  The bill Senator Jeffords and I introduce today will greatly simplify \nthe outdated tax rules applicable to foster care payments. Under our \nproposed legislation, foster care providers would be able to avoid \nonerous record keeping by excluding from income any foster care payment \nreceived regardless of the age of the individual receiving foster care \nservices, the type of agency that placed the individual, or the source \nof foster care payments. To ensure appropriate oversight, this bill \nwill require the placement agency to be licensed either by, or under \ncontract with, a state or one of its political divisions.\n  Mr. President, this legislation accomplishes what current law does \nnot--consistent and fair treatment of families and individuals who open \ntheir homes and their hearts to foster children and adults. While this \nmodest proposal was unfortunately not adopted in the last Congress, it \nis my hope that foster parents may soon realize equitable treatment \nwith the passage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 671. A bill to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to provide for the \nregistration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, in order to \ncarry out provisions of certain international conventions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   madrid protocol implementation act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce implementing \nlegislation for the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement \nConcerning the International Registration of Marks (Protocol). Last \nCongress, I introduced an identical bill, S. 2191 which unfortunately \nthe Senate did not consider.\n  This bill is part of my ongoing effort to update American \nintellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and \nprotect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would \nhelp American businesses, and especially small- and medium-sized \ncompanies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international \nmarkets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark \napplication procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of \nthe U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the \nUnited States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' \ninternational trademark registration process, which would be an \nenormous benefit for American businesses. This bill is one of many \nmeasures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to \nensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in \ntoday's world of changing technology and complex international markets.\n  When I introduced this legislation last year, I also cosponsored S. \n2193, legislation to implement the Trademark Law Treaty. S. 2193 \nsimplified trademark registration requirements around the world by \nestablishing a list of maximum requirements which Treaty member \ncountries can impose on trademark applicants. The bill passed the \nSenate on September 17, 1998, and was signed by the President on \nOctober 30, 1998. I am proud of this legislation since all American \nbusinesses, and particularly small American businesses, will benefit as \na result.\n  I have in the past supported legislation critical to keeping our \ntrademark laws up-to-date. For example, last year I introduced S. 1727, \nwhich authorized a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new \ngeneric Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property \nrights. This bill became law as part of the Next Generation Internet \nResearch Act, S. 1609, which was signed into law on October 28, 1998. I \nalso supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, enacted in \nthe 104th Congress to provide intellectual property rights holders with \nthe power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks \nthat would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality.\n  Together, these measures represent significant steps in our efforts \nto ensure that American trademark law adequately serves and promote \nAmerican interests.\n  The legislation I introduce today would ease the trademark \nregistration burden on small- and medium-sized businesses by enabling \nbusinesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries \nwith a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark \nOffice. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their \ntrademarks abroad, they\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nmust register their trademarks in each and every country in which \nprotection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-\nconsuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a \ndisproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking \ninternational trademark protection.\n  Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International \nRegistration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international \ntrademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the \nProtocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained \nterms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In \n1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which \ncorrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American \nparticipation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, \napplications for international trademark extension can be completed in \nEnglish; formerly, applications were required to be completed in \nFrench. It should be noted that the Protocol would not require \nsubstantive changes to American trademark law, but merely to certain \nprocedures for registering trademarks. This implementing legislation is \nidentical to legislation that passed the House last year and has been \nreintroduced this year as H.R. 769, by Representatives Howard Coble (R-\nNC) and Howard Berman (D-CA). Indeed, H.R. 769 has already been \nreported favorably by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and \nIntellectual Property.\n  To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty \nbecause of voting rights disputes with the European Union. The EU has \nsought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental \nentity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the \nAdministration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable \nand democratic principle of one-state, one-vote.

The Commissioner must also \n     apprise the International Bureau of other relevant \n     information pertaining to requests for extension within the \n     designated time periods.\n       If an extension for protection is granted, the Commissioner \n     issues a certificate attesting to such action, and publishes \n     notice of the certificate in the ``Gazette.'' Holders of \n     extension certificates thereafter enjoy protection equal to \n     that of other owners of registration listed on the Principal \n     Register of the PTO.\n       If the International Bureau notifies the PTO of a \n     cancellation of some or all of the goods and services listed \n     in the international registration, the Commissioner must \n     cancel an extension of protection with respect to the same \n     goods and services as of the date on which the international \n     registration was canceled. Similarly, if the International \n     Bureau does not renew an international registration, the \n     corresponding extension of protection in the United States \n     shall cease to be valid. Finally, the holder of an \n     international registration canceled in whole or in part by \n     the International Bureau may file an application for the \n     registration of the same mark for any of the goods and \n     services to which the cancellation applies that were covered \n     by an extension of protection to the United States based on \n     that international registration.\n       The holder of an extension of protection must, within \n     designated time periods and under certain conditions, file an \n     affidavit setting forth the relevant goods or services \n     covered an any explanation as to why their nonuse in commerce \n     is related to ``special circumstances,'' along with a filing \n     fee.\n       The right to an extension of protection may be assigned to \n     a third party so long as the individual is a national of, or \n     is domiciled in, or has a ``bona fide'' business located in a \n     country that is a member of the Protocol; or has such a \n     business in a country that is a member of an \n     intergovernmental organization (like the E.U.) belonging to \n     the Protocol.\n       An extension of protection conveys the same rights as an \n     existing registration for the same mark if the extension and \n     existing registration are owned by the same person, and \n     extension of protection and the existing registration cover \n     the same goods or services, and the certificate of extension \n     is issued after the date of the existing registration.\n     Section 3. Effective Date\n       This section states that the effective date of the act \n     shall commence on the date on which the Madrid Protocol takes \n     effect in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 672. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nextend the higher Federal medical assistance percentage for payment for \nIndian Health service facilities to urban Indian health programs under \nthe Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE FEDERAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE TO \n                      URBAN INDIAN HEALTH PROGRAMS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would correct an inequity in the current reimbursement \nrates for health care services provided to low-income Medicaid-eligible \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives through the Indian Health Service \n(IHS) urban Indian health care programs.\n  Mr. President, currently, a 100 percent Federal medical assistance \npercentage (FMAP) applies for the cost of services provided to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries by a hospital, a clinic, or other IHS facility, under the \ncondition that the facilities are operated by the IHS, a tribe, or \ntribal organization. IHS facilities which are predominately located in \nrural areas are eligible to receive the 100 percent FMAP, while similar \nservices provided through IHS programs located in urban areas receive \nonly 50-80 percent reimbursement depending on the type of service \nprovided.\n  This legislation would address this inequity by extending the Federal \nmedical assistance percentage to payments for IHS facilities to urban \nIndian\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nhealth care programs under the Medicaid program, and informal estimates \nindicate that equalizing the FMAP for IHS programs would cost $17 \nmillion over the next 5 years.\n  With few employment opportunities in tribal reservation communities, \nmost Indians are literally forced to relocate and seek employment in \ncities, and as a result, roughly half of the total American Indian/\nAlaska Native population is now residing in urban areas. With that in \nmind, equalizing the Federal medical assistance percentage for health \ncare provided to Medicaid-eligible Indians through the IHS urban Indian \nhealth care programs is essential.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 673. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish requirements \nconcerning the operation of fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam \ngenerating units, commercial and industrial boiler units, solid waste \nincineration units, medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste \ncombustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland cement plants to reduce \nemissions of mercury to the environment, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          The Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing the ``Omnibus \nMercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999,'' a bill that I originally \nintroduced during the 105th Congress. I am pleased that Senator Snowe \nhas agreed to co-sponsor the bill.\n  As United States Senators, we all have a responsibility as stewards \nfor the nation and society we will be entrusting to our children and \ngrandchildren. I became a grandfather for the first time a little over \na year ago, and this duty has never been more real for me. The \n``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999'' is a comprehensive \nplan to eliminate mercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a \nspecific control strategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By \neliminating mercury pollution from our natural resources, we will \nprotect our nation's most important resource: the young Americans of \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are \nat the greatest risk from these poisons. How many future scientists, \ndoctors, poets, and inspiring teachers have we lost in the last \ngeneration because of the toxics they have been exposed to in the womb \nor in early childhood? Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much \ngraver effects on children at very low levels than it does on adults. \nThe level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-\ntenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to \nthe success of the original Clean Air Act. We should strive to achieve \nno less with mercury.\n  Mercury is toxic in every known form and has utterly no nutritional \nvalue. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic \nways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as \nsuffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small \nMinimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food.\n  For years, the Chisso Company, a chlor-alkali facility that \nmanufactured chlorine, discharged mercury contaminated pollution in the \nbay, which was consumed by fish and then by people. Their disease was \nterribly painful, causing tremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading \nto death. Thankfully, wholesale discharges of mercury like those in \nMinimata Bay have been eliminated. But a torrent of air pollution still \nneedlessly dumps this heavy metal into the air of North America, \npoisoning lakes and streams, forests and fields and--most importantly--\nour children. Mercury control needs to be a priority now because of the \nneurological damage it causes.\n  This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in \nagony as they were three decades ago in Japan. Mercury pollution today \nis more subtle, but it is no less insidious. Wildlife are also being \nharmed. Endangered Florida panthers have been fatally poisoned by \nmercury. Loons are endangered as well. In Lake Champlain we have fish \nadvisories for walleye, trout and bass even though we have relatively \nfew mercury emissions within our own state borders. There are now 40 \nstates that have issued fishing advisories for mercury; Vermont's and \nthose of 10 other states cover all of the water bodies in these states. \nNearly 1,800 water bodies nationwide have mercury fishing advisories \nposted. The number of water bodies with mercury advisories has doubled \nsince 1993.\n\n  My fellow Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants that \nblow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from other \nregions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired power \nplants are not accountable to the people of Vermont, and therefore a \nfederal role is needed to control the pollution.\n  That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members \nof the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public \nhealth and the environment nationally, then to take the appropriate \naction. And in many cases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not \nwhen it comes to mercury.\n  Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning \nof America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed \nfrom manufactured products, and much of that has been done. Mercury can \nbe removed from coal-fired powerplants, and now that should be done. \nWith states deregulating their utility industries, this is the right \nmoment and the best opportunity we will have for a generation to make \nsure powerplants begin to internalize the costs of their pollution. We \ncannot afford to give them a free ride into the next century at the \nexpense of our children's health.\n  So, too, should mercury be purged from other known sources such as \nchlor-alkali plants, medical waste incinerators, municipal combustion \nfacilities, large industrial boilers, landfills, and lighting fixtures.\n  My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest \nsources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by \n95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet \nthe standard at their facility whether through the use of better \ntechnology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching.\n  The bill also gives people the right-to-know about mercury emissions \nfrom the largest sources. That should be the public's right. To \nfacilitate the public's right-to-know and getting mercury containing \nitems out of the waste streams that feed municipal combustion \nfacilities, it also requires labeling of mercury containing items such \nas fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, pharmaceuticals. The bill also \nbegins a phaseout of mercury from products, with exceptions possible \nfor demonstrated essential uses.\n  We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing mercury \nreduction steps will cost. In advance of those complaints I want to \nmake two points. First, when we were debating controls for acid rain we \nheard a lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But \nwhat we learned from the acid rain program is that when you give \nindustry a financial incentive to clean up its act, they will find the \ncheapest way. More often than not, assertions about the cost of \ncontrolling pollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you \nlook at electricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain \nprogram was implemented, their rates have remained below the national \naverage and some have actually decreased--even without adjusting for \ninflation. The mercury controls on coal-fired power plants contained in \nmy bill may add a little over $2 dollars per month to the electric bill \nof the average residential consumer who receives power from a coal-\nfired plant. So, for the monthly cost of a slice of pizza or a \nhamburger and fries we can rein in the more than 50 tons of mercury \nthat are being pumped into our air from power plants.\n  Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be \nthe cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of not \ncontrolling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many \nEinstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high.\n  Let us make controlling mercury pollution one of our first \nenvironmental legacies of the 21st Century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\noverview of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) on the basis of available scientific and medical \n     evidence, exposure to mercury and mercury compounds \n     (collectively referred to in this Act as ``mercury'') is of \n     concern to human health and the environment;\n       (2) pregnant women and their fetuses, women of childbearing \n     age, children, and individuals who subsist primarily on fish, \n     are most at risk for mercury-related health impacts such as \n     neurotoxicity;\n       (3) although exposure to mercury occurs most frequently \n     through consumption of mercury-contaminated fish, such \n     exposure can also occur through--\n       (A) ingestion of drinking water, and food sources other \n     than fish, that are contaminated with methyl mercury;\n       (B) dermal uptake through soil and water; and\n       (C) inhalation of contaminated air;\n       (4) on the basis of the report entitled ``Mercury Study \n     Report to Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), the major sources of mercury \n     emissions in the United States are, in descending order of \n     volume of emissions--\n       (A) fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating \n     units;\n       (B) solid waste incineration units;\n       (C) coal- and oil-fired commercial and industrial boiler \n     units;\n       (D) medical waste incinerators;\n       (E) hazardous waste combustors;\n       (F) chlor-alkali plants; and\n       (G) Portland cement plants;\n       (5)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report described \n     in paragraph (4), in conjunction with available scientific \n     knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury \n     emissions from anthropogenic combustion and industrial \n     sources and mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and \n     sediments;\n       (B) the Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that \n     the geographical areas that have the highest annual rate of \n     deposition of mercury in all forms are--\n       (i) the southern Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley;\n       (ii) the Northeast and southern New England; and\n       (iii) scattered areas in the South, with the most elevated \n     deposition occurring in the Miami and Tampa areas and 2 areas \n     in northeast Texas; and\n       (C) analysis conducted before the date of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency report demonstrates that mercury is being \n     deposited into the waters of Canada;\n       (6)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report described \n     in paragraph (4) supports a plausible link between mercury \n     emissions from anthropogenic combustion and industrial \n     sources and concentrations of methyl mercury in freshwater \n     fish;\n       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned \n     the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared \n     to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993;\n       (C) the total number of mercury advisories increased from \n     899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent; and\n       (D) the United States and Canada have agreed on a goal of \n     virtual elimination of mercury from the transboundary waters \n     of the 2 countries;\n       (7) the presence of mercury in consumer products is of \n     concern in light of the health consequences associated with \n     exposure to mercury;\n       (8) the presence of mercury in certain batteries and \n     fluorescent light bulbs is of special concern, particularly \n     in light of the substantial quantities of used batteries and \n     fluorescent light bulbs that are discarded annually in the \n     solid waste stream and the potential for environmental and \n     health consequences associated with land disposal, \n     composting, or incineration of the batteries and light bulbs; \n     and\n       (9) a comprehensive study of the use of mercury by the \n     Department of Defense would significantly further the goal of \n     reducing mercury pollution.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to greatly reduce the quantity of mercury entering the \n     environment by controlling air emissions of mercury from \n     fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units, \n     coal- and oil-fired commercial and industrial boiler units, \n     solid waste incineration units, medical waste incinerators, \n     hazardous waste combustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland \n     cement plants;\n       (2) to reduce the quantity of mercury entering solid waste \n     landfills, incinerators, and composting facilities by \n     promoting recycling or proper disposal of used batteries, \n     fluorescent light bulbs, and other products containing \n     mercury;\n       (3) to increase the understanding of the volume and sources \n     of mercury emissions throughout North America;\n       (4) to promote efficient and cost-effective methods of \n     controlling mercury emissions;\n       (5) to promote permanent, safe, and stable disposal of \n     mercury recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control \n     systems, and other methods of mercury pollution control;\n       (6) to reduce the use of mercury in cases in which \n     technologically and economically feasible alternatives are \n     available;\n       (7) to educate the public concerning the collection, \n     recycling, and proper disposal of mercury-containing \n     products;\n       (8) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury \n     exposure and the threat to public health, particularly the \n     threat to the health of pregnant women and their fetuses, \n     women of childbearing age, children, and individuals who \n     subsist primarily on fish;\n       (9) to significantly decrease the threat to human health \n     and the environment posed by mercury; and\n       (10) to ensure that the health of sensitive populations, \n     whether in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, is \n     protected, with an adequate margin of safety, against adverse \n     health effects caused by mercury.\n\n     SEC. 3. MERCURY EMISSION STANDARDS FOR FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED \n                   ELECTRIC UTILITY STEAM GENERATING UNITS.\n\n       Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (s) as subsection (x);

He is particularly concerned \n     about the effects of mercury. He is also concerned about \n     transport of air pollution from other parts of the nation to \n     the lakes, rivers, forests, and agricultural lands of \n     Vermont.\n       EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to Congress,'' mandated by the \n     1990 Clean Air Act, documents mercury pollution sources and \n     troubling trends in mercury pollution in the United States.\n       Mercury is one of the last major pollutants without an \n     overall pollution control strategy, and as a result it \n     remains largely uncontrolled.\n     What are the key findings of the ``Mercury Study Report to \n         Congress''?\n       Scientific and medical evidence show that exposure to \n     mercury and mercury compounds is harmful to human health, and \n     concentrations of it in the environment are arising (e.g., in \n     lake and river sediments).\n       Pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of \n     child-bearing age, and children under the age of 8 are most \n     at risk for mercury-related health effects such as \n     neurotoxicity.\n       Neurotoxicity symptoms include impaired vision, speech, \n     hearing, and walking; sensory disturbances; incoordination of \n     movements; nervous system damage very similar to congenital \n     cerebal palsy; mental disturbances; and, in some cases, \n     death.\n       Exposure to mercury and mercury compounds occurs most \n     frequently through consumption of mercury-contaminated fish \n     but can also occur through ingestion of methyl-mercury \n     contaminated drinking water and food sources other than fish, \n     and dermal uptake through soil and water.\n       The major sources of mercury emissions in the United States \n     are coal-fired electrical utility steam generating units, \n     solid waste combustors, commercial and industrial boilers, \n     medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste combustors, \n     chlor-alkali plants (which manufacture chlorine and sodium \n     hydroxide), and Portland cement plants.\n       EPA's analysis of mercury deposits and transport, in \n     conjunction with available scientific knowledge, supports a \n     plausible link between mercury emissions from combustion and \n     industrial sources and mercury concentrations in air, soil, \n     water, and sediments.\n       The following geographical areas have the highest annual \n     rate of deposition of mercury in all forms: the southern \n     Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley; the Northeast and \n     southern  New England; and scattered areas in the South, \n     with the most elevated deposition occurring in the Miami \n     and Tampa areas and in two areas in northeast Texas.\n       The analysis of mercury deposits and transport supports a \n     plausible link between mercury emissions from combustion and \n     industrial sources and methyl mercury concentrations in \n     freshwater fish. In 1997, 40 states have issued health \n     advisories warning the public about consuming mercury-tainted \n     fish, compared to 27 states in 1993. Eleven states have \n     issued state-wide advisories, and 5 states have issued \n     advisories for coastal waters. Mercury advisories have \n     increased 98 percent from 899 in 1993 to 1,782 in 1998.\n       The presence of mercury in consumer products is of concern \n     in light of the health consequences associated with exposure \n     to mercury.\n       The presence of mercury in certain batteries and \n     fluorescent light bulbs is of special concern, particularly \n     given the substantial quantities of used batteries and \n     fluorescent light bulbs that are discarded annually in the \n     solid waste stream and the potential for environmental and \n     health consequences associated with land disposal, \n     composting, or municipal waste incineration.\n     Estimates of U.S. Annual Mercury Emissions Rates for the \n         Largest Emitting Source Categories Source of Data: \n         Mercury Study Report to Congress, December 1997\n     Coal Fired Utility Boilers: 52 tons per year\n     Solid Waste Combustors: 30 tons per year\n     Commercial/Industrial Boilers: 29 tons per year\n     Medical Waste Incinerators: 16 tons per year\n     Hazardous Waste Combustors: 7 tons per year\n     Chlor-Alkali Plants: 7 tons per year\n     Portland Cement Plants: 5 tons per year\n     Key features of the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act \n         of 1999''\n       Directs EPA to promulgate mercury emissions standards and \n     regulatory strategies for the largest emitting source \n     categories: fossil-fuel fired electric utility steam \n     generating units; fossil-fuel fired commercial and industrial \n     boilers; solid waste combustors; chlor-alkali plants; and \n     Portland cement plants.\n       Requires Reports to Congress: By EPA on progress in \n     implementing mercury emission reductions for medical waste \n     incinerators pursuant to existing regulations; by EPA on \n     progress in implementing mercury emission reductions for \n     hazardous waste combustors pursuant to existing regulations; \n     by the Department of Defense on the use of mercury and \n     mercury compounds by DoD.\n     Other features of ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act \n         of 1999''\n       Directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to inventory the \n     sources and pathways of mercury air and water pollution \n     within North America, and recommend options and strategies to \n     greatly reduce transboundary atmospheric and surface water \n     mercury pollution in North America.\n       Expanded research into characterizing the health effects of \n     mercury pollution to critical populations (i.e., pregnant \n     women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and \n     children).\n       Requires safe disposal of mercury recovered through coal \n     cleaning, flue gas control systems, and other pollution \n     control systems so that the hazards emanating from mercury \n     are not merely transferred from one environmental medium to \n     another.\n       Requires annual public reporting (hardcopy publication and \n     Internet) of facility-specific emissions of mercury and \n     mercury compounds;\n       Requires labeling of mercury containing items such as \n     fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, pharmaceuticals, \n     laboratory chemicals and reagents, electrical devices such as \n     thermostats, relays, and switches, and medical and scientific \n     equipment.\n       Begins a phase out of mercury from products.

RESERVE FUND FOR MEDICARE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Adjustment.--If legislation is reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Finance that significantly extends the solvency \n     of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use \n     of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund, the \n     Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may change committee \n     allocations and spending aggregates if such legislation will \n     not cause an on-budget deficit for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2000;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 2000 through 2004; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n       (b) Prescription Drug Benefit.--The adjustments made \n     pursuant to subsection (a) may be made to address the cost of \n     the prescription drug benefit.\n       (c) Budgetary Enforcement.--The revision of allocations and \n     aggregates made under this section shall be considered for \n     the\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n     purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as \n     allocations and aggregates contained in this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 210. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n            TITLE III--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MARRIAGE PENALTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) differences in income tax liabilities caused by marital \n     status are embodied in a number of tax code provisions \n     including separate rate schedules and standard deductions for \n     married couples and single individuals;\n       (2) according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42 \n     percent of married couples incurred ``marriage penalties'' \n     under the tax code in 1996, averaging nearly $1,400;\n       (3) measured as a percent of income, marriage penalties are \n     largest for low-income families, as couples with incomes \n     below $20,000 who incurred a marriage penalty in 1996 were \n     forced to pay nearly 8 percent more of their income in taxes \n     than if they had been able to file individual returns;\n       (4) empirical evidence indicates that the marriage penalty \n     may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's second \n     earner, because higher rates reduce after-tax wages and may \n     cause second earners to work fewer hours or not at all, \n     which, in turn, reduces economic efficiency; and\n       (5) the tax code should not improperly influence the choice \n     of couples with regard to marital status by having the \n     combined Federal income tax liability of a couple be higher \n     if they are married than if they are single.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that significantly \n     reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty should be a \n     component of any tax cut package reported by the Finance \n     Committee and passed by Congress during the fiscal year 2000 \n     budget reconciliation process.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPROVING SECURITY FOR \n                   UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that there is an urgent and ongoing \n     requirement to improve security for United States diplomatic \n     missions and personnel abroad, which should be met without \n     compromising existing budgets for International Affairs \n     (Function 150).\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ACCESS TO MEDICARE HOME \n                   HEALTH SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) medicare home health services provide a vitally \n     important option enabling homebound individuals to stay in \n     their own homes and communities rather than go into \n     institutionalized care; and\n       (2) implementation of the Interim Payment System and other \n     changes to the medicare home health benefit have exacerbated \n     inequalities in payments for home health services between \n     regions, limiting access to these services in many areas and \n     penalizing efficient, low-cost providers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate the \n     levels in this resolution assume that the Senate should act \n     to ensure fair and equitable access to high quality home \n     health services.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF \n                   HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) under current law, the self-employed do not enjoy \n     parity with their corporate competitors with respect to the \n     tax deductibility of their health insurance premiums;\n       (2) this April, the self-employed will only be able to \n     deduct only 45 percent if their health insurance premiums for \n     the tax year 1998;\n       (3) the following April, the self-employed will be able to \n     take a 60-percent deduction for their health insurance \n     premiums for the tax year 1999;\n       (4) it will not be until 2004 that the self-employed will \n     be able to take a full 100-percent deduction for their health \n     insurance premiums for the tax year 2003;\n       (5) the self-employed's health insurance premiums are \n     generally over 30 percent higher than the health insurance \n     premiums of group health plans;\n       (6) the increased cost coupled with the less favorable tax \n     treatment makes health insurance less affordable for the \n     self-employed;\n       (7) these disadvantages are reflected in the higher rate of \n     uninsured among the self-employed which stands at 24.1 \n     percent compared with 18.2 percent for all wage and salaried \n     workers, for self-employed living at or below the poverty \n     level the rate of uninsured is 53.1 percent, for self-\n     employed living at 100 through 199 percent of poverty the \n     rate of uninsured is 47 percent, and for self-employed living \n     at 200 percent of poverty and above the rate of uninsured is \n     17.8 percent;\n       (8) for some self-employed, such as farmers who face \n     significant occupational safety hazards, this lack of health \n     insurance affordability has even greater ramifications; and\n       (9) this lack of full deductibility is also adversely \n     affecting the growing number of women who own small \n     businesses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that tax relief \n     legislation should include parity between the self-employed \n     and corporations with respect to the tax treatment of health \n     insurance premiums.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT TAX REDUCTIONS SHOULD GO \n                   TO WORKING FAMILIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assumes any reductions in taxes \n     should be structured to benefit working families by providing \n     family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Army National Guard relies heavily upon thousands \n     of full-time employees, Military Technicians and Active \n     Guard/Reserves, to ensure unit readiness throughout the Army \n     National Guard;\n       (2) these employees perform vital day-to-day functions, \n     ranging from equipment maintenance to leadership and staff \n     roles, that allow the drill weekends and annual active duty \n     training of the traditional Guardsmen to be dedicated to \n     preparation for the National Guard's warfighting and \n     peacetime missions;\n       (3) when the ability to provide sufficient Active Guard/\n     Reserves and Technicians end strength is reduced, unit \n     readiness, as well as quality of life for soldiers and \n     families is degraded;\n       (4) the Army National Guard, with agreement from the \n     Department of Defense, requires a minimum essential \n     requirement of 23,500 Active Guard/Reserves and 25,500 \n     Technicians; and\n       (5) the fiscal year 2000 budget request for the Army \n     National Guard provides resources sufficient for \n     approximately 21,807 Active Guard/Reserves and 22,500 \n     Technicians, end strength shortfalls of 3,000 and 1,693, \n     respectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in the budget resolution assume \n     that the Department of Defense will give priority to \n     providing adequate resources to sufficiently fund the Active \n     Guard/Reserves and Military Technicians at minimum required \n     levels.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM ON WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security benefit structure is of particular \n     importance to low-earning wives and widows, with 63 percent \n     of women beneficiaries aged 62 or older receiving wife's or \n     widow's benefits;\n       (2) three-quarters of unmarried and widowed elderly women \n     rely on Social Security for more than half of their income;\n       (3) without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty \n     rate among women would have been 52.2 percent, and among \n     widows would have been 60.6 percent;\n       (4) women tend to live longer and tend to have lower \n     lifetime earnings than men do;\n       (5) women spend an average of 11.5 years out of their \n     careers to care for their families, and are more likely to \n     work part-time than full-time; and\n       (6) during these years in the workforce, women earn an \n     average of 70 cents for every dollar men earn.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) women face unique obstacles in ensuring retirement \n     security and survivor and disability stability;\n       (2) Social Security plays an essential role in guaranteeing \n     inflation-protected financial stability for women throughout \n     their entire old age; and\n       (3) the Congress and the President should take these \n     factors into account when considering proposals to reform the \n     Social Security system.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health is the Nation's \n     foremost research center;\n       (2) the Nation's commitment to and investment in biomedical \n     research has resulted in better health and an improved \n     quality of life for all Americans;\n       (3) continued biomedical research funding must be ensured \n     so that medical doctors and scientists have the security to \n     commit to conducting long-term research studies;\n       (4) funding for the National Institutes of Health should \n     continue to increase in order to prevent the cessation of \n     biomedical research studies and the loss of medical doctors \n     and research scientists to private research organizations; \n     and\n       (5) the National Institutes of Health conducts research \n     protocols without proprietary interests, thereby ensuring \n     that the best health care is researched and made available to \n     the Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that there shall be a \n     continuation of the pattern of budgetary increases for \n     biomedical research.\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING FOR KYOTO PROTOCOL \n                   IMPLEMENTATION PRIOR TO SENATE RATIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The agreement signed by the Administration on November \n     12, 1998, regarding legally binding commitments on greenhouse \n     gas reductions is inconsistent with the provisions of S. Res. \n     98, the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, which passed the Senate \n     unanimously.\n       (2) The Administration has agreed to allowing at least 2 \n     additional years for negotiations on the Buenos Aires Action \n     Plan to determine the provisions of several vital aspects of \n     the Treaty for the United States, including emissions trading \n     schemes, carbon sinks, a clean development mechanism, and \n     developing Nation participation.\n       (3) The Administration has not submitted the Kyoto Protocol \n     to the Senate for ratification and has indicated it has no \n     intention to do so in the foreseeable future.\n       (4) The Administration has pledged to Congress that it \n     would not implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior \n     to its ratification in the Senate.\n       (5) Congress agrees that Federal expenditures are required \n     and appropriate for activities which both improve the \n     environment and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Those \n     activities include programs to promote energy efficient \n     technologies, encourage technology development that reduces \n     or sequesters greenhouse gases, encourage the development and \n     use of alternative and renewable fuel technologies, and other \n     programs justifiable independent of the goals of the Kyoto \n     Protocol.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that funds should not be \n     provided to put into effect the Kyoto Protocol prior to its \n     Senate ratification in compliance with the requirements of \n     the Byrd-Hagel Resolution and consistent with previous \n     Administration assurances to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FEDERAL RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) A dozen internationally, prestigious economic studies \n     have shown that technological progress has historically been \n     the single most important factor in economic growth, having \n     more than twice the impact of labor or capital.\n       (2) The link between economic growth and technology is \n     evident: our dominant high technology industries are \n     currently responsible for 80 percent of the value of today's \n     stock market, \\1/3\\ of out economic output, and half of our \n     economic growth. Furthermore, the link between Federal \n     funding of research and development (R) and market products \n     is conclusive: 70 percent of all patent applications cite \n     nonprofit or federally-funded research as a core component to \n     the innovation being patented.\n       (3) The revolutionary high technology applications of today \n     were spawned from scientific advances that occurred in the \n     1960's, when the government intensively funded R In the 3 \n     decades since then, our investment in R as a fraction of \n     Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has dropped to half its former \n     value. As a fraction of the Federal budget, the investment in \n     civilian R has dropped to only \\1/3\\ its value in 1965.\n       (4) Compared to other foreign nation's investment in \n     science and technology, American competitiveness is slipping: \n     an Organization for Economic Co-opertion and Development \n     report notes that 14 countries now invest more in basic and \n     fundamental research as a fraction of GDP than the United \n     States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Federal \n     investment in R should be preserved and increased in order \n     to ensure long-term United States economic strength. Funding \n     for Federal agencies performing basic scientific, medical, \n     and precompetitive engineering research pursuant to the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement Act of 1997 should be a priority \n     for the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committees this \n     year, within the Budget as established by this Committee, in \n     order to achieve a goal of doubling the Federal investment in \n     R over an 11 year period.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COUNTER-NARCOTICS FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the drug crisis facing the United States is a top \n     national security threat;\n       (2) the spread of illicit drugs through United States \n     borders cannot be halted without an effective drug \n     interdiction strategy;\n       (3) effective drug interdiction efforts have been shown to \n     limit the availability of illicit narcotics, drive up the \n     street price, support demand reduction efforts, and decrease \n     overall drug trafficking and use; and\n       (4) the percentage change in drug use since 1992, among \n     graduating high school students who used drugs in the past 12 \n     months, has substantially increased--marijuana use is up 80 \n     percent, cocaine use is up 80 percent, and heroin use is up \n     100 percent.\n       (b) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals \n     included in this resolution assume the following:\n       (1) All counter-narcotics agencies will be given a high \n     priority for fully funding their counter-narcotics mission.\n       (2) Front line drug fighting agencies are dedicating more \n     resources for intentional efforts to continue restoring a \n     balanced drug control strategy. Congress should carefully \n     examine the reauthorization of the United States Customs \n     service and ensure they have adequate resources and authority \n     not only to facilitate the movement of internationally traded \n     goods but to ensure they can aggressively pursue their law \n     enforcement activities.\n       (3) By pursuing a balanced effort which requires investment \n     in 3 key areas: demand reduction (such as education and \n     treatment); domestic law enforcement; and international \n     supply reduction, Congress believes we can reduce the number \n     of children who are exposed to and addicted to illegal drugs.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) more than 26,500 students from 250 tribes nationwide \n     attend tribal colleges. The colleges serve students of all \n     ages, many of whom are moving from welfare to work. The vast \n     majority of tribal college students are first-generation \n     college students;\n       (2) while annual appropriations for tribal colleges have \n     increased modestly in recent years, core operation funding \n     levels are still about \\1/2\\ of the $6,000 per Indian student \n     level authorized by the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Act;\n       (3) although tribal colleges received a $1,400,000 increase \n     in funding in fiscal year 1999, because of rising student \n     populations, these institutions faced an actual per-student \n     decrease in funding over fiscal year 1998; and\n       (4) per student funding for tribal colleges is only about \n     63 percent of the amount given to mainstream community \n     colleges ($2,964 per student at tribal colleges versus $4,743 \n     per student at mainstream community colleges).\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding difficulties \n     faced by tribal colleges and assumes that priority \n     consideration will be provided to them through funding for \n     the Tribally Controlled College and University Act, the 1994 \n     Land Grant Institutions, and title III of the Higher \n     Education Act; and\n       (2) the levels in this resolution assume that such priority \n     consideration reflects Congress's intent to continue work \n     toward current statutory Federal funding goals for the tribal \n     colleges.\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     January 1999 ``Economic and Budget Outlook,'' the Social \n     Security Trust Fund is projected to incur annual surpluses of \n     $126,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1999, $137,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2000, $144,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2001, \n     $153,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2002, $161,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2003, and $171,000,000 in fiscal year 2004;\n       (2) the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution crafted by \n     Chairman Domenici assumes that Trust Fund surpluses will be \n     used to reduce publicly-held debt and for no other purposes, \n     and calls for the enactment of statutory legislation that \n     would enforce this assumption;\n       (3) the President's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal not \n     only fails to call for legislation that will ensure annual \n     Social Security surpluses are used strictly to reduce \n     publicly-held debt, but actually spends a portion of these \n     surpluses on non-Social Security programs;\n       (4) using CBO's re-estimate of his budget proposal, the \n     President would spend approximately $40,000,000,000 of the \n     Social Security surplus in fiscal year 2000 on non-Social \n     Security programs; $41,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2001; \n     $24,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2002; $34,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 2003; and $20,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2004; \n     and\n       (5) spending any portion of an annual Social Security \n     surplus on non-Social Security programs is wholly-\n     inconsistent with efforts to preserve and protect Social \n     Security for future generations.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the Sense of Senate that the \n     levels in this resolution and legislation enacted pursuant to \n     this resolution assume that Congress shall reject any budget, \n     that would spend any portion of the Social Security surpluses \n     generated in any fiscal year for any Federal program other \n     than Social Security.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SALE OF GOVERNOR'S ISLAND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that the sale of Governor's Island should \n     be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2000.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PELL GRANT FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) public investment in higher education yields a return \n     of several dollars for each dollar invested;\n       (2) higher education promotes economic opportunity for \n     individuals, as recipients of bachelor's degrees earn an \n     average of 75 percent per year more than those with high \n     school diplomas and experience half as much unemployment as \n     high school graduates;\n       (3) higher education promotes social opportunity, as \n     increased education is correlated with reduced criminal \n     activity, lessened reliance on public assistance, and \n     increased civic participation;\n       (4) a more educated workforce will be essential for \n     continued economic competitiveness in an age where the amount \n     of information available to society will double in a matter \n     of days rather than months or years;\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n       (5) access to a college education has become a hallmark of \n     American society, and is vital to upholding our belief in \n     equality of opportunity;\n       (6) for a generation, the Federal Pell Grant has served as \n     an established and effective means of providing access to \n     higher education for students with financial need;\n       (7) over the past decade, Pell Grant awards have failed to \n     keep pace with inflation, eroding their value and threatening \n     access to higher education for the nation's neediest \n     students;\n       (8) grant aid as a portion of all students financial aid \n     has fallen significantly over the past 5 years;\n       (9) the nation's neediest students are now borrowing \n     approximately as much as its wealthiest students to finance \n     higher education; and\n       (10) the percentage of freshmen attending public and \n     private 4-year institutions from families below national \n     median income has fallen since 1981.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President's proposed reductions in the Pell Grant \n     program are incompatible with his proposed $125 increase in \n     the Pell Grant maximum award;\n       (2) the President's proposed reductions should be rejected; \n     and\n       (3) within the discretionary allocation provided to the \n     Appropriations Committee, the maximum grant award should be \n     raised, to the maximum extent practicable and funding for the \n     Pell Grant program should be higher than the level requested \n     by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S3023-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SESSIONS AMENDMENT NO. 121\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Sessions) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n544) making emergency supplemental appropriations and rescissions for \nrecovery from natural disasters, and foreign assistance, for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 7, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISION, THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I rise to offer a personal tribute \nto the countless Americans who personify the finest traditions of \ncharity by giving much-needed humanitarian supplies to the storm-\nravaged people of Central America.\n  We are a generous people. For centuries, we have responded to human \nneeds, to end suffering and to help those who were afflicted by the \nwrath of nature.\n  I have just returned from Central America, where the devastation of \nHurricane Mitch is still felt by millions, many of whom are children. \nIn communities throughout this neighboring region, storm victims \ncontinue to lack basic food, shelter, clothing and medical care. Damage \nto roads and bridges hampers the ability to move goods to market, and \nto transport emergency supplies.\n  As a repeat visitor to Central America since Hurricane Mitch, I can \npersonally attest to the widespread human suffering caused by this \nfierce storm. But I have also witnessed the outpouring of humanitarian \nassistance from the United States and its impact in Central America.\n  By any measure, the myriad acts of kindness by the American people to \nour neighbors in need have been inspirational to all those who deplore \nthe hunger of a child or the suffering of the sick. The list of \nexamples of the humanitarian response to Hurricane Mitch is indeed \nlengthy, but I would like to cite a few examples.\n  As we paused last fall to celebrate Thanksgiving, a young Floridian \nnamed Abhishek Gupta read news accounts of the poor and needy at home \nand abroad. This high school student, along with other young people, \nraised thousands of dollars for charities in Florida and to help the \nvictims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America.\n  During the period between Christmas and New Year's Abhishek joined a \nmedical mission to Honduras and Nicaragua, taking food, clothing and \nmedical supplies.\n  Meanwhile, for years the American Nicaraguan Foundation has helped \ndistribute donations in Nicaragua through local outlets, including \nCatholic relief groups. In response to Hurricane Mitch, the foundation \npurchased and received food and medicine for victims.\n  With transport help from the U.S. military, these supplies were part \nof the immediate response in November to hurricane devastation.\n  Rebuilding the hard-hit communities of Central America will be a \nlong-term process, and much work remains to be done. But as we re-\ncommit ourselves this year to continue to help victims of last year's \nhurricane, we should applaud the multitudes of kind-hearted and \ndedicated people who have given time and resources to assist our \nneighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S3024-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement. I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 1998-99 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest which I sponsored in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indiana. These \nstudents have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``Hoosier Farmers--\nGlobal Impact.'' Considering the importance of our expanding global \nmarket-place, students were asked to select a country or region of the \nworld that buys products from Hoosier farmers and then creatively \ndescribe the value of this relationship to both trading partners. I \nwould like to submit for the Record the winning essays of Wyatt James \nRoth of Pulaski County and Jennifer Tarr of Orange County. As state \nwinners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two outstanding students are \nbeing recognized on Friday, March 19, 1999 during a visit to our \nNation's Capitol.\n  The essays are as follows:\n\n                       Corn's Ticket to Thailand\n\n                   (By Jennifer Tarr, Orange County)\n\n       This little kernel of Indiana's corn is going places. It \n     will travel halfway around the world to the Southeast Asian \n     country of Thailand. Come along with me . . .\n\n\n                       FIRST STOP: INDIANA FIELD\n\n       I grew up in a field in Indiana. Less government subsidies \n     make farmers rely more on international trade for income. \n     Indiana farms had $5.39 billion in sales receipts for all \n     commodities ranking it 14th in U.S. sales. Indiana had 3.2% \n     of all U.S. exports ranking it 9th. That's why I'm on my \n     trip.\n\n\n                         SECOND STOP: GRAIN BIN\n\n       Corn prices are only $1.80 per bushel. With 9.7 billion \n     bushels harvested in 1997, about 1.4 billion bushels are \n     being stored in these bins. We're here partly because exports \n     are down due to the strong American dollar and declining \n     values of foreign currency. In Thailand, the baht is off 58%. \n     U.S. economic sanctions also hurt exports because it takes \n     trade away from Indiana farmers.\n\n\n                        THIRD STOP: GRAIN BARGE\n\n       I'm on my way! Part of Thailand's trade was cut back due to \n     trade with Russia who is exporting crops for the first time \n     since the Soviet breakup. This takes income from Indiana \n     farmers.\n\n\n                      FOURTH STOP: THAILAND TABLE\n\n       I'm at this table as supper, but my friends may be used for \n     everything from food to gasoline. Farmers here will use us to \n     feed poultry, their main farm product. Because 96% of \n     the world lives outside of the U.S., we need to export \n     Indiana goods to those markets to prosper. Trade with \n     other countries is critical to being competitive in \n     today's world.\n       It's been a wonderful trip! Everyone gained something. \n     Thailand gained with food that they couldn't have grown and \n     Indiana farmers gained with income in an unsteady market.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Hoosier Farmers--Global Impact\n\n                 (By Wyatt James Roth, Pulaski County)\n\n       ``Good morning, class,'' exclaimed social studies teacher, \n     Mr. Beach. ``Today's lesson should prove both interesting and \n     educational for you. We have with us today, Mr. Toshitomo \n     Kobiyashi, from Japan. He and I will be talking to you about \n     agricultural products that we sell to Japan and how they help \n     not only his country, but ours as well. First of all, let me \n     explain that when we sell products to Japan or any other \n     country, the process of a product leaving our country and \n     going to another place is called exportation. Indiana farmers \n     depend on the export of their farm products such as corn, \n     soybeans, and wheat, along with beef and pork, for their \n     livelihood.''\n       ``Yes, Mr. Beach, and we in Japan are very thankful for \n     these products. My people used to rely on rice as a major \n     source of food. This is still there, but we have also \n     developed other tastes, one of which is the taste for red \n     meat. We buy breeding stock from Indiana farmers, which is \n     the reason I am in Indiana. I was sent here to buy hogs for \n     breeding so that we can supply our people with pork.''\n       ``Mr. Kobiyashi, why doesn't your country raise all of \n     these products in Japan so that you don't have to buy them \n     from us?''\n       ``Good question, young man! Japan is too small and too \n     heavily populated to grow everything in its own country.

Mr. President, I was pleased to join 97 of my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the Education Flexibility Partnership \nAct, or Ed-Flex, last week. This bill expands the current federal Ed-\nFlex pilot program to all states and allows them to waive certain \nfederal education requirements for local schools, so long as schools \nare accountable for making education improvements, and does so without \naltering federal requirements concerning health, safety and civil \nrights. It is my hope that Ed-Flex can help increase student \nachievement by serving as a catalyst for innovative school reform at \nthe state and local levels.\n  Mr. President, while I am pleased the Senate passed the underlying \nEd-Flex bill, I am disappointed that the bill includes amendments that \nwould force local schools to choose between smaller classes and \nstudents with special needs. These amendments could undermine the \nimportant class size reduction program agreed to on a bipartisan basis \nlast year. I was also deeply disappointed with the defeat of the \nKennedy/Murray class size amendment, which would have built on the down \npayment of 30,000 teachers agreed to last year and finished the job by \nauthorizing class size funding for the next six years.\n  My own State of Wisconsin has been a leader among the states trying \nto reduce class size in the early grades. Wisconsin's Student \nAchievement Guarantee in Education or SAGE class size reduction \nprogram, has proven conclusively that smaller classes make a difference \nin our children's education. SAGE officials want the Federal Government \nto be a partner in Wisconsin's effort to reduce class size. Federal \nfunds are an important complement to Wisconsin's ongoing SAGE program \nand will ensure that SAGE continues to thrive. The rejection of the \nKennedy/Murrary amendment sends a discouraging message to schools in my \nState and across the nation that are just beginning to make decisions \nabout how to implement the class size funds agreed to last year.\n  It is very unfortunate Mr. President that two critically important \nfederal programs, funds for special education and to reduce class size, \nwere pitted against each other during the Ed-Flex debate. I am fully \ncommitted to funding for special education, but not at the expense of \nfunds to reduce class size. The promise of these critically important \neducation funds affecting our nation's children should not fall victim \nto partisan maneuvers. Congress should not be choosing one over the \nother--both special education and class size are national education \npriorities. American parents should know those in Congress who pit \nthese programs against each other are the friend of neither.\n  Finally, Mr. President, while I understand that Ed-Flex is not a \npanacea for America's education problems, I do believe it will improve \nthe federal, state and local partnership needed to ensure our children \nreceive the best quality education possible. I am confident that the \nconference committee will protect the class size funds agreed to last \nyear and that Congress will vote on an improved version of Ed-Flex in \nthe near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S3025-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ALFRED TESTA JR.\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Alfred Testa on his departure as the Director of Manchester \nAirport. Fred has been the Director of Manchester Airport since 1991. \nHe has brought about tremendous and exciting change to the airport \nduring his tenure and I am proud to have worked with him during his \ndistinguished career.\n  Fred came to Manchester after serving as Deputy Director of T.F. \nGreen Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island. He is a graduate of the \nUniversity of Rhode Island with a B.A. in Political Science and earned \nhis J.D. at Suffolk University Law School. He is an Accredited Airport \nExecutive with the American Association of Airport Executives and is a \nregular lecturer on airport development, management and marketing.\n  Fred has been the driving force behind the substantial growth at \nManchester Airport. When Fred began as Manchester Airport's Director, \nthe airport handled approximately 700,000 passengers a year and there \nwere six commercial airlines that serviced the airport. Today, there \nare eleven commercial airlines based there, and last year, the airport \nserved almost 2 million travelers. Fred's efforts have played a key \nrole in the City of Manchester's nationally recognized renaissance.\n  Fred has worked closely with each member of the New Hampshire \nCongressional Delegation - educating, advising, and encouraging us to \nundertake a number of vital federal initiatives at the airport. He has \nvigorously pursued support for the Residential Sound Insulation \nProgram; the New Passenger Terminal; the New Armed Forces Reserve \nCenter; the Manchester Airport Access Road; and the Runway, Taxiway, \nParking, Roadway and Terminal Improvements and U.S. Customs Service's \nat the renovated Ammon Terminal. It has been my great privilege to work \nwith Fred on these and other important airport projects which have \nfundamentally changed for the better air transportation services for \nNew Hampshire. Fred deserves the highest admiration and praise for \nthese significant accomplishments.\n  Fred leaves Manchester Airport to become the Director of Philadelphia \nInternational Airport. Aldermen and the Mayor of Manchester have \nexpressed high praise for the work Fred did for the City of Manchester, \nand I strongly agree. His leadership and effective advocacy for safe \nand efficient airline transportation will be fondly remembered by all \nNew Hampshire citizens.\n  Once again, I would like to commend Fred Testa on his service to \nManchester Airport and the State of New Hampshire. His work was greatly \nbeneficial to the City and the State, and I wish him well. It has been \na pleasure to represent Fred Testa in the United States Senate, and I \nam proud to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S3025-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3025-S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. MARTIN SANTINI\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nMartin Santini, an architect and planner who has literally helped New \nJersey build and grow. His entrepreneurial spirit is to be commended as \nthe firm he founded, Ecoplan, celebrates its 25th year in existence. \nEcoplan is an award-winning architectural, planning, and design firm, \nwhose clients include the State of New Jersey. His peers have \nrecognized his talent, accomplishments, and contributions to the State \nas he has been elected as president of the New Jersey chapter of the \nAmerican Institute of Architects. He is a registered architect in six \nStates and licensed as a professional planner in the State of New \nJersey.\n  After graduating with both Bachelor of Architecture and Master of \nArchitecture, as well as an Urban Planning degree, Martin established \nhis own firm in 1974. Ecoplan has been dedicated to providing quality \ndesign services and producing creative solutions that add lasting value \nto its client's projects. After 25 years of committed service, his firm \nhas grown exponentially. Recently, Ecoplan was ranked as the 14th \nlargest architectural firm in New Jersey by New Jersey Business \nMagazine. To date, Ecoplan has designed and built over 1,000 structures \nin the Tri-State region. As Ecoplan's president, Martin has been \nlargely responsible for this success.\n  Martin and Ecoplan have served the State of New Jersey well. \nEcoplan's clients include numerous municipalities, counties, boards of \neducation, housing authorities, and police departments. They have \nserved the public sector well by closely maintaining construction \nbudgets and schedules, which are so important in Ecoplan has also \nserved the private sector and various communities well, building \nschools, medical offices, YMCAs, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, \nsingle family homes, corporate headquarters, restaurants, commercial \noffice buildings, warehouses, and a wide variety of additions, \nrenovations, and interior design projects.\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\n  Martin and his firm have served the State of New Jersey by improving \nour schools, housing our citizens, and providing a workplace for our \ngovernment employees.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. It is clear \nthat a reform of our consumer bankruptcy laws is called for. The United \nStates is at the height of its prosperity, yet in these good economic \ntimes bankruptcy filings are at an all time high.\n  Of course, no matter how well the Nation is doing as a whole, \nindividuals and individual families may need to fall back upon \nbankruptcy protection. The reforms included in the bipartisan Grassley-\nTorricelli proposal will not punish legitimate uses of the bankruptcy \ncodes. Rather this bill will root-out what I agree are its illegitimate \nuses, and assert rights of consumers filing for bankruptcy. S. 625 also \nextends or authorizes several necessary bankruptcy judgeships, \nincluding one in Delaware, and reenacts farm bankruptcy laws among its \nprovisions.\n  This bill also makes changes in the way that tax claims are handled \nin bankruptcy. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have a strong \ninterest in these tax-related provisions. As Senator Grassley mentioned \nwhen he introduced the bill, we both expect to modify a number of the \nprovisions at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to join my friend and fellow Delaware \nSenator, Joe Biden, as a cosponsor of the Bankruptcy Reform Act. I look \nforward to its consideration on the Senate floor in the coming \nmonths.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/19/senate-section/article/S3026-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R 975\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
