Mr. President, I would like to welcome Father Peter \nChrisafideis to the United States Senate this morning, and to thank Dr. \nOgilvie for graciously extending his hospitality to him.\n  Allowing guest chaplains to open the United States Senate with prayer \nhelps to highlight the important role that clergy of different faiths \nplay throughout the United States--from the largest cities to the \nsmallest towns. It is a statement that we are a nation of men and women \nfor whom spiritual guidance and fulfillment is a vital part of daily \nlife. Our country's spiritual leaders play an indispensable role in \nhelping us to forge a sense of community, and I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank each and every one of them for their service.\n  For me personally, growing up, the Greek Orthodox religion was a \nconstant and important presence in my life. My father was a Greek \nimmigrant; my mother, the daughter of immigrants. So, ever since my \nearly childhood, Greek Orthodox religious traditions have been at the \ncenter of my upbringing, and have helped shape my beliefs and my life.\n  Father Peter, as he is referred to by his congregation, has been a \npart of that tradition for me, serving formerly at Holy Trinity Church \nin Lewiston, Maine, where I am a member of the congregation. In fact, \nwhile it's hard for me to believe it could have been that long ago, \nFather Peter officiated at my own wedding almost exactly ten years ago. \nAnd he must have done a great job, because we are still going strong \nand looking forward to the next ten years!\n  Today, Father Peter leads the congregation of the St. George Greek \nOrthodox Church, where he serves the spiritual needs of Greek-Americans \nin the greater Bangor community. In addition, he has served a number of \nparishes outside the State of Maine throughout the years, helping \nmembers of the Church to nourish their beliefs and come to know their \nfaith.\n  I again want to thank Father Peter for his service to the Church, as \nwell as his personal friendship and support. And I want to extend my \nappreciation once more not only to Dr. Ogilvie, but to all of the \nnation's spiritual leaders for the tremendous inspiration and wise \nguidance they provide in helping people to live happier, better, and \nmore fulfilling lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1971-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John \nBradshaw and Sarah Nelson, a fellow and an intern, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am grateful to our leadership for \naffording us this time this morning to debate and to vote on Senate \nResolution 45. Some would say this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nso this isn't important and that this is filling time, or whatever. I \nsuggest that there are a couple of things that have happened just \nrecently which underscore the value and the importance of the time we \nare spending on the Senate floor this morning and the vote on this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, just this morning the Associated Press reported that \ntwo more members of the Chinese Democracy Party were detained. They \nwere taken from their homes for trying to set up a human rights meeting \nin Wuhan. That was reported just this morning. It has become all too \nfrequent, and almost daily, that there are news reports of the \ncontinued crackdown on human rights in China.\n  These today were detained only for being members of the Chinese \nDemocracy Party, the fledgling opposition party advocating democracy \nand human rights in China. I think this incident, just reported this \nmorning, underscores the value and the importance of what we are doing \nand what we are about today.\n\n  Then it is reported this morning as well that Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright, in her testimony before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee yesterday, said the administration is still \ndeciding the most effective way for the United States to persuade China \nto improve its human rights record.\n  The fact that the Secretary of State admitted before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee yesterday that the administration has not \nyet decided what they are going to do, that they have not yet \ndetermined what course of action they will take to try to persuade the \nChinese to improve their human rights record, I believe, underscores \nthe importance and the value of the resolution that is before us, one \nthat is incredibly important.\n  One of my colleagues yesterday, in seeing the agenda for today, said, \n``Well, Tim, there you are slamming the Chinese again.'' Let me say \nthat I have the utmost respect and admiration for the Chinese people. \nIn fact, I cannot think of any group that I have higher admiration for \nthan those Chinese citizens today who are fighting courageously and \nstanding up for human rights within their own country and fighting for \nthe democracy movement in China.\n  This resolution today has nothing to do with the Chinese people, but \nit has everything to do with the intolerable practices of the Chinese \nGovernment in which they continue to abuse the basic fundamental human \nrights of the Chinese people. This resolution is important because the \nadministration has all but said they are looking for a signal from \nCapitol Hill. They are looking for direction from the Congress as to \nwhether or not they should sponsor a resolution in Geneva this summer \ncalling the world's attention to those abuses that are ongoing in China \ntoday. We need to send them that signal. This resolution affords us \nthat opportunity.\n  If there is one thing the Chinese Government does take seriously, it \nis international opinion. To the extent that by this resolution and by \nour Government offering a resolution in Geneva this summer we can \nmarshal the international community in protest to the ongoing human \nrights crackdown in China, we will have done something very significant \nand very worthwhile.\n  Mr. President, the resolution before us today urges the \nadministration to sponsor a resolution at the United Nations Human \nRights Commission critical of China's human rights abuses. The \nCommission will meet in March and April in Geneva, Switzerland.\n  By passing this resolution, which enjoys very strong bipartisan \nsupport, we give Secretary Albright a clear message to bring with her \nto China when she travels there in the beginning of March. That message \nis that the United States will not accept China's wholesale violation \nof internationally accepted human rights standards. It is an important \nsignal. I have had discussions with the administration and with the \nDepartment of State, and I know they are looking for the sentiment of \nthe Senate and the Congress on this issue.\n  The Communist Government of China has long committed a litany of \nhuman rights abuses. Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison, \nmany of them sentenced after unfair trials, others today languishing in \nprison without any trial at all. At least 200 of these prisoners are \nstill suffering because of their participation in or their support of \nthe 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.\n  Religious persecution runs rampant in China. People who dare to \nworship outside the aegis of officially sponsored religious \norganizations face fines, they face detention, arrest, imprisonment \nand, too often, torture as well.\n  And the human rights movement in China, the democracy movement in \nChina, and the house church movement are very much intertwined. And \nmany of these home churches have become, in fact, bases of the \ndemocracy movement and human rights efforts within China today. \nThousands of peaceful monks and nuns have been detained and tortured in \nTibet where the Chinese Government is imposing a harsh patriotic so-\ncalled education campaign.\n  Mr. President, under China's one-family-one-child policy, couples \nface punitive fines and loss of employment for having unapproved \nchildren. But it does not stop with monetary penalties. Local \nauthorities, with or without the approval of the Communist Party cadre, \nforcibly perform abortions or sterilizations on women who are pregnant \nwith their second child. Relatives are held hostage until couples \nsubmit to this coercion.\n  Furthermore, incredibly, prisoners are executed in China after \ngrossly unfair trials, and then their organs are sold on the black \nmarket. The pattern of abuse is clear. And in the eyes of the Chinese \nCommunist Government human life seems to bear no value at all.\n  What has been this administration's response to these abuses? Under \nPresident Clinton's policy of so-called constructive engagement, the \nadministration effectively disengaged human rights practices from trade \npractices in 1994, while promising that efforts to pass a resolution at \nthe U.N. Human Rights Commission would be increased.\n  However, Mr. President, last year, President Clinton further unhinged \nhis policy by deciding not to pursue a resolution at the Commission in \nGeneva, Switzerland, which was critical of China. We historically had \ndone that. Year after year, we offered that resolution, but last year \nsupposedly the administration said in a good-faith gesture we withheld \noffering that resolution.\n  That commitment was given to China in exchange for their promise to \nsign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \nICCPR, a covenant which affirms free speech and free assembly. It is \nhighly ironic that the ICCPR itself is a product of U.N. Human Rights \nCommission meetings. China did sign the ICCPR in October, only to turn \naround and violate its every principle since they put their signature \nto that document.\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\n  Since the President's trip to Beijing in July 1998, the Communist \nGovernment of China has renewed its crackdown on all who would dare to \noppose the Communist Party. Some 100 members of the fledgling Chinese \nDemocracy Party, the CDP, have been detained, excluding the two that \nwere announced this morning. Some have been released, others await \ntrial, and the most unfortunate have been sentenced to very long prison \nsentences.\n  Three visible leaders of the CDP, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin, and Wang \nYoucai were sentenced to 13, 12 and 11 years in prison, respectively, \non charges of subversion and endangering state security, after highly \ndubious trials. In reality, these democracy activists exercised their \nlegal rights under Chinese law to create and to form a political party. \nTheir true crime, in the eyes of the Communist Party, was simply their \nlove for democracy.\n  But the crackdown does not end there. In fact, incidents of \nharassment and imprisonment are almost too numerous to list. I will \nhighlight just a few examples.\n  The Communist Government sentenced businessman Lin Hai to prison for \n2 years for--listen to this crime--providing e-mail addresses to a \nprodemocracy Internet magazine.\n\n  Zhang Shanguang is in prison now for 10 years for this crime: \nProviding Radio Free Asia with information about farmer protests in \nHunan Province.\n  The Government sentenced poet and writer Ma Zhe to 7 years in prison \non charges of subversion for publishing an independent literary \njournal.\n  In addition, the Communist Government is cracking down on film \ndirectors, artists, computer software developers and the press, and \ncontinues to harass and detain religious activists. The list goes on.\n  In 1998, police imprisoned 70 worshipers from house churches in Hunan \nProvince. And the pattern of human rights violations is undeniable. \nRather than improving since the good-faith gestures of the American \nGovernment and our rewarding of the Chinese Government with favorable \ntrade status, we have seen not a favorable response on the part of the \nChinese Government but an exacerbated attack upon those who would \nsimply advocate freedom and democracy.\n  I see that my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, has \ncome to the floor to speak on this resolution. I appreciate his \noutstanding leadership on this issue. He was the lead sponsor of a \nsimilar resolution last year. And if Senator Mack is prepared to speak \nat this time, I will yield to Senator Mack. Is the Senator ready to \nspeak now?\n  Mr. MACK. I am prepared.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask Senator Mack, how much time would you desire?\n  Mr. MACK. No more than 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is ever a time and place to raise \nhuman rights concerns, it is at the annual meeting of the United \nNations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. That Commission \nis meeting right now. And I rise today to urge my fellow Senators to \njoin with me and the 17 other cosponsors of this resolution to make a \nsimple statement. We disapprove of the human rights abuses occurring in \nChina and in Tibet.\n  Since last year, when we passed this resolution with 95 votes, the \nPresident has engaged in two summits with Chinese President Jiang. \nDuring that time, many promises were made and agreements were \nconcluded, and the United States did not introduce a human rights \nresolution in Geneva.\n  We were told the United States would make progress by not introducing \na resolution. And Wei Jingsheng, a prominent dissident, was released. \nTomorrow, Mr. Wei will be here in Washington, DC, and he will urge the \nUnited States not to make the same mistake as last year. Mr. President, \nwe must now make this statement of condemnation of China's human rights \npractices.\n  We received many promises from the Chinese Government last year as \nwell. But we know that the human rights conditions have only \ndeteriorated. The State Department's human rights report clearly \ndelineates the atrocities occurring in China and Tibet. And we know \nfrom press accounts that the crackdown on human rights and political \nactivists has hardened.\n  It is unconscionable that the United States would not take a stand \nagainst these blatant atrocities, especially when they are documented \nby our own State Department. By remaining silent, we do a great \ninjustice to those fighting for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law \ninside China and Tibet.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to quote from a statement made by Mr. Wei not \nlong after he was released and exiled from his country. And this is \nwhat he said:\n\n       Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of \n     humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. \n     Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, \n     in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness \n     to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still \n     struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of \n     those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of \n     oppression, exploitation and massacres.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an easy one. It does not matter whether the \nworld votes with us or against us or abstains in Geneva. It does not \neven matter if this resolution will change the minds of anyone in \nBeijing. We do know, however, from the firsthand testimony of released \ndissidents, that the actions of the United States are important to \nthose engaged in the struggle for freedom. We know from those released \nthat by simply making this statement we demonstrate our solidarity with \nthose who are engaged within the daily struggle for freedom, justice, \nand the respect for human dignity.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in calling for this expression of \nsolidarity--this stand for freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Florida. He has truly been a \nchampion for human rights around the world, not just in China but \naround the world. I thank him for his leadership on this issue and his \nwillingness to urge the administration to take this very appropriate \naction in Geneva this summer. And I thank him for his very eloquent \nstatement.\n  Mr. President, at this time I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Mack, and I am certainly pleased to be here on the floor with \nSenator Hutchinson.\n  Mr. President, I want to build on the remarks of Senator Mack for a \nmoment. He was talking about Wei Jingsheng. Wei Jingsheng wrote an op-\ned piece in the New York Times in December. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 24, 1998]\n\n                      China's Diversionary Tactics\n\n                           (By Wei Jingsheng)\n\n       Last Saturday, when Liu Niachun, a prominent dissident, \n     left his Chinese prison cell and arrived in the United \n     States, many Western reports said he had been ``freed'' or \n     ``released.'' One year ago, after 18 years in a Chinese \n     prison, I, too, was ``released'' and sent here. A Chinese \n     official said that if I ever set foot in China again, I would \n     immediately be returned to prison. I cannot identify any \n     legal principle that explains how my expulsion or Mr. Liu's \n     could be construed as a release.\n       Yet the State Department, in a report last January, used my \n     forced exile as evidence that China was taking ``positive \n     steps in human rights'' and that ``Chinese society continued \n     to become more open.'' These ``positive steps'' led the \n     United States and its allies to oppose condemnation of China \n     at a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     in April. In the months that followed, President Clinton and \n     other Western leaders traveled to China, trumpeting increased \n     economic ties and muting criticism on human rights.\n       Thus, without fear of sanction, the Chinese Government \n     intensified its repression in 1998. Once the leaders achieved \n     their diplomatic victories, they turned to their main \n     objective: the preservation of tyrannical power. This year, \n     about 70 people are known to have been arrested, and in \n     recent weeks the Government has greatly stepped up that pace.\n       On Monday, Xu Wenli, another dissident, was sentenced to 13 \n     years in prison for ``subversion of state power.'' He was \n     given only four days to prepare for his trial and was denied \n     a lawyer of his choice. Two others, Wang Youcai and Qin \n     Yongmin, were sentenced to 11 and 14 years, also for \n     subversion. Both were denied legal representation.\n       It was widely believed that Mr. Liu's ``release'' was an \n     attempt to deflect world attention from these harsh \n     punishments. This\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\n     time, at least, the State Department didn't buy the \n     deception. Deploring China's actions, a spokesman called the \n     sentences ``a step backward.''\n       Whether this statement constitutes a change of American \n     policy or merely a cosmetic change remains to be seen. If the \n     American Government really wanted to punish China, it could, \n     say, restrict Chinese imports to the United States. Or it \n     could halt all questionable technology transfers to China.\n       Despite the Chinese Government's occasional lip service to \n     ``openness,'' the authorities have consistently and swiftly \n     moved to quash not only political organizations but also \n     trade unions, peasants' associations and unapproved religious \n     gatherings.\n       As Li Peng, the speaker of the National People's Party \n     Congress, declared recently, ``If an organization's purpose \n     is to promote a multiparty system in China and to negate the \n     leadership prerogatives of the Chinese Communist Party, then \n     it will not be permitted to exist.''\n       This statement clearly shows that the Communist Party's \n     primary objective is to sustain its tyranny, and to do so it \n     must deny the people basic rights and freedoms. We must \n     measure the leaders' progress on human rights not by the \n     ``release'' of individuals but by the people's ability to \n     speak, worship and assemble without official interference and \n     persecution. Only that can be called progress.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The article talks about the release of Mr. Liu, a \nprominent dissident, who left his cell. He will be with us at a press \nconference tomorrow. What Wei Jingsheng had to say is that after Mr. \nLiu was released,\n\n       . . . many Western reports [the administration talked about \n     this as a triumph] said he had been ``freed'' or ``released\" \n     [to Wei Jingsheng].\n\n  He goes on to say,\n\n       One year ago, after 18 years in a Chinese prison, I, too, \n     was ``released.''\n\n  Of course, the problem is he was told by the Chinese Government that \nif he ever set foot in the country again, he would be immediately \nreturned to freedom. It is hard to argue that this is what in the \nUnited States we would call freedom at all.\n\n       Yet the State Department, in a report last January, [Wei \n     Jingsheng goes on to say] used my forced exile [and that is \n     what it is] as evidence that China was taking ``positive \n     steps in human rights'' and that ``Chinese society continued \n     to become more open.''\n\n  These ``positive steps'' led the United States and its allies to \noppose condemnation of China at a meeting of the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights last April. Senator Hutchinson, I, and \nSenator Mack came to the floor. We got 95 votes calling on our \nGovernment to take the lead with the resolution condemning these \nwidespread violations of human rights in China.\n  Here is the key part of Wei Jingsheng's piece:\n\n       Thus without fear of sanction, the Chinese government \n     intensified its repression in 1998. Once the leaders achieved \n     their diplomatic victories, they turned to their main \n     objective: The preservation of tyrannical power. This year, \n     about 70 people are known to have been arrested, and in \n     recent weeks the government has greatly stepped up the pace.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Hutchinson, talked about Zhong Ji and Shao She \nChang today. I want to quote from the Washington Post: ``Chinese police \ndetained two dissidents.'' What did they want to do? Why are they now \ndetained? Why do they face imprisonment? They want to meet with our \nSecretary of State when she visits China to talk about human rights. \nFor that, they have been detained and face possible, probable \nimprisonment.\n  We have offered a resolution today that condemns China's human rights \nrecord. We call upon our Government to introduce a resolution \ncondemning China's human rights record at the next session of the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights which meets in March. We also call on our \nGovernment to begin immediately contacting other governments to ask \nthem to cosponsor such a resolution.\n  When President Clinton formally delinked trade and human rights in \n1994, he pledged on the record that the United States would ``step up \nits efforts, in cooperation with other states, to insist that the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with \nthe serious human rights abuses in China.'' That is what the President \nof the United States of America has said.\n  Now, he also said that we would speak out on human rights, but the \nfact of the matter is, we have increased our trade, our military \ncontacts, we have gone forward with high-level summits. In the \nmeantime, Chinese Government leaders continue to crack down on every \nlast dissident in a country of over 1 billion people. We have seen what \nhas happened this past year.\n\n  It is time for our country, the United States of America, which \nstands for democracy and freedom, to go to this United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights and to introduce this resolution supporting \nthe brave people in China who stand up for human rights. That is what \nthis resolution is all about.\n  The Chinese Government--and my colleague has talked about this--\ncontinues to commit widespread abuses and, since the President's visit \nin June, has flagrantly violated international human rights agreements.\n  Examples: Recently it sentenced three of China's most prominent \nprodemocracy advocates, Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Chin Yougmin, to a \ncombined prison term of 35 years. These disgraceful arrests were part \nof a crackdown by the Government on efforts--to do what? These Chinese \ncitizens wanted to form a political party. For that, they face a \ncombined 35-year prison sentence.\n  Further, a businessman in Shanghai, Lin Hai, is now being tried for \nproviding e-mail addresses to a prodemocracy Internet magazine in the \nUnited States. Bill Gates, America Online, it is time for you to get \nengaged in this. You ought to be supporting human rights in China.\n  Another democracy activist, Zhang Shanguang, was convicted and \nsentenced to 10 years in prison for giving Radio Free Asia information \nabout protests by farmers in the Hunan province. This is all about \norganizing. I say to labor, this is all about the right of people to \norganize and to speak out. And for this, this man is now been sentenced \nto 10 years in prison.\n  These events are all part of a pattern of growing repression, with \nlegislation passed, when artists and press are told: If you do anything \nto ``endanger social order'' or attempt to ``overthrow state power,'' \nwe will round you up and we will throw you in prison.\n  Mr. President, these dissidents and these courageous men and women in \nChina deserve our full backing.\n  At the June meeting in Beijing, President Clinton engaged in a \nspirited debate on human rights with President Jiang Zemin. In light of \nthis brutal recent crackdown, all of which has taken place since the \nPresident visited China, all of which has taken place since the United \nStates refused to bring a resolution before the Human Rights Commission \nin the United Nations, I and my colleague, Senator Hutchinson, urge, \nand I think we will have 90-some votes that will urge, the \nadministration to bring a resolution at Geneva in March and to continue \nto register our deep concern about the absence of freedom of expression \nand association and the use of arbitrary detention in China. Past \nexperience has shown that if we apply the pressure, it can make a \ndifference. By sponsoring a resolution at the United Nations Human \nRights Commission, the United States will be showing our commitment to \ninternational human rights standards.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Arkansas spoke about this. On \nOctober 5, 1998, China finally signed the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights. When I talked to Sandy Berger, a friend, \nlast year, he said to me: Look, we don't think we need to go forward \nwith this resolution condemning China on human rights abuses at the \nU.N. Commission on Human Rights, because they are going to make a \ncommitment, and they will sign this International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights.\n  What have they done? They have not taken the steps to make it \nbinding, and, more importantly, they violated what the whole agreement \nis.\n\n  We have seen in this last year a very clear pattern of more and more \nand more repression, Chinese citizens imprisoned for trying to form a \npolitical party, Chinese citizens imprisoned for writing articles, \nChinese citizens in prison for trying to organize so they can get a \nbetter price as farmers, so they can get better wages as workers. It is \ntime for the United States Government to provide the leadership which \nthe courageous people in China depend upon.\n  Mr. President, I have had the great honor--and I don't know about \nSenator Hutchinson, but I think he would say the same thing--of \nbecoming friends, and I feel almost small saying that, because Wei \nJingsheng is such a great\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\nman, I have to pinch myself to remind me there is somebody who spent \nover 20 years in prison because he had the courage to stand up against \na government, he had the courage to write and to speak out for what he \nthought was good and right for people in China. I don't think I could \never have the courage to do so. Thank God, I live in the United States \nof America. He is a Chinese dissident who spent so much time in prison \nbecause of his courage.\n  In an article published shortly after his release, Mr. Wei Jingsheng \nstated,\n\n       Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of \n     humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. \n     Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights \n     in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness \n     [this is what he said, Mr. President] to numb them into \n     forgetting that many others who are still struggling against \n     tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all those who are suffering \n     from unimaginable forms of repression, exploitation and \n     massacres.\n\n  We shouldn't forget such people. We shouldn't take our freedom for \ngranted. And we, the United States of America, ought to take the lead \nin bringing this resolution before the United Nations Commission on \nHuman Rights.\n  When you talk to people around the world--and we are talking about \nChina today--Senator Hutchinson, they will tell you that maybe Senators \ndon't realize this, maybe we have this debate on the floor of the \nSenate, and then we have a vote, but what a difference this makes to \nthe people in these countries who have the courage.\n  We are going to get a strong vote at 12 o'clock today and we are \nsending a signal to the White House it is time for our Government to \ntake the lead. I hope we will get the leadership from the White House. \nI hope we get the leadership from the Secretary of State. I certainly \nhope that the U.S. Senate will go on record today with a strong \nbipartisan vote.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Wellstone for \nhis commitment to the issue of human rights. When Paul Wellstone comes \nto the floor and I come to the floor and we work own human rights \nissues together, we both want to make it clear that we can agree very \nrarely. There are few political issues that we are going to be united \non, and our votes will more often than not cancel each other out on the \nissues coming before the U.S. Senate. But I admire and respect Paul \nWellstone for his deep commitment to democracy and to human rights \naround the world, and for his involvement in this issue. I am glad to \nbe able to work with him on this. I think it is a very important \nresolution.\n  I reiterate that this resolution is important, and it is important \nfor several reasons. It is important because it will be a message to \nthe administration. It is very timely, and I appreciate our majority \nleader for ensuring that this vote occur this week because our \nSecretary of State will be traveling to China next week. It is \nimportant for this vote to occur. It is important for it to be a strong \nbipartisan vote and for our Secretary of State to have that message as \nshe goes to China. So I think it is important from that standpoint.\n  It is also a very, very important message to our European allies. \nMany of our allies in Europe are looking for our leadership. Germany \nhas had a change in government. They are much more sympathetic to the \ncause of human rights, in my estimation. The French press reported that \nthis vote in the U.S. Senate was going to occur today. They are looking \nfor a message and a signal from political leaders in the United States. \nSo it is important from that standpoint as well. It is a message to the \nChinese Government, not just through our Secretary of State, but that \nwe as the elected Representatives of the people--the U.S. Senate, the \nHouse of Representatives--as we speak out on this issue, it conveys a \nstrong message to the Chinese Government, and they are concerned about \nwhat this country thinks.\n  I think one of the great failings of this administration has been \nthat it has rewarded human rights abuses and crackdowns in China, \nwhether it is religious freedom crackdowns, press crackdowns, Internet \ncrackdowns, or any host of human rights abuses; they have, in effect, \nrewarded that by increasing economic opportunities through trade with \nthe United States--most recently, their plan to bring China into the \nWorld Trade Organization, almost as a reward for the very terrible \nabuses that have occurred during the last several months.\n  And then, may I say that this resolution is critically important \nbecause of the message it sends--as my colleague from Minnesota said, \nthe message that it sends to the Chinese activists for democracy and \nhuman rights within China today, which is that when we take the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and speak on this issue, they are listening--Radio \nFree Asia--through the Internet and through other means by which our \nactivities and the news of our activities gets into China. They are \nlistening and they are interested and it is an encouragement to them to \nknow that there are those who stand with them in the cause of freedom \nin our country and our Government.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, it is wholly appropriate for the United \nStates to advance a resolution at the Commission in Geneva critical of \nChina's ongoing human rights abuses. The Commission is a multilateral \nforum authorized to deal with the very abuses perpetrated by the \nChinese Government today--a resolution that the Commission will pierce \nany notions that China's violations of human rights will be quietly \naccepted by the world community.\n\n  There are some in the administration--and I think it is reflected in \nSecretary Albright's statement yesterday--that are undecided on how \nthey are going to proceed, and whether or not they are going to offer \nthis resolution. There are some within the administration who argue \nthat a resolution critical of China at the Human Rights Commission \nshould not be pursued and is in effect pointless because, as they put \nit, it is certain to fail.\n  I think Senator Mack said, ``Well, I don't believe it is certain to \nfail''; but whether it was certain to fail or not, it should be offered \non the basis of principle, on the basis of the encouragement and the \nemboldenment it will provide for those within China. But the very \nsentiment that the administration expresses when they say it is certain \nto fail becomes a self-fulfilling sentiment, a self-fulfilling \nprophecy. The more halfhearted the administration is in its attempts to \nadvance such a resolution, the less chance that such a resolution will \nhave to pass.\n  The longer the administration refrains from exercising leadership in \nthe international community on this matter of human rights, the less \nlikely it is that the resolution will be successful. Bringing forth a \nresolution at the Commission is, as Senator Mack so accurately put it, \na matter of principle. Success will be measured by the statements of \ntruth that flow from the debate at the Commission. A resolution at the \nCommission this summer will proclaim boldly that the human rights \nabuses in China are an affront to the international community and its \nvalues.\n  Mr. President, these values are not uniquely American values. There \nare those who have argued in the past that it is wrong for us to speak \nof these values and to try to, as they put it, force these values upon \nthe Chinese Government. But I would assert--and I believe that this \ncountry is built on this belief --that these values are not uniquely \nAmerican values, that they transcend any national boundary, that they \nare fundamental human values and human rights. Thus, it is highly \nappropriate that we pursue such a resolution. The U.S. must take steps \nto protect internationally recognized human rights, or we will take a \nback seat to those who openly and blatantly abuse them.\n  As Senator Wellstone said, last year, this body passed a resolution \nvery similar to the one before us today by an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 95-5. I hope we can send an equally strong signal to the \nadministration again this year. In light of the affront to the \nadministration's policy that the Chinese Government has committed in \nthe recent crackdown of the last 2 to 3 months, I think it is a very \ntimely resolution and an appropriate time for the administration to \nreverse field, to reverse its decision last summer in not pursuing such \na resolution and, in fact, to say the abuses, the crackdowns, have been \nso flagrant that now the administration will pursue with a new \naggressiveness a human rights resolution in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, promoting human rights is now, and must \nremain, an important component of our overall relationship with China. \nThat is why I support Senate Resolution 45, calling on the \nadministration to voice our concerns about China's human rights abuses \nbefore the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.\n  Even as we try to expand cooperation in areas of mutual interest--\nstability on the Korean peninsula, nonproliferation, trade, and the \nenvironment--we must take note of China's violation of international \nnorms in the area of human rights.\n  Last year, the administration decided to remain silent in Geneva, \narguing that more progress could be achieved through quiet diplomacy \nthan through public pressure. China did, in fact, release some high \nprofile political prisoners. China also signed the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  In recent months, however, we have witnessed a crackdown on dissent, \nincluding the arrest of prominent democracy party organizers. China \ncontinues to jam the broadcasts of Radio Free Asia and to closely \nmonitor China's domestic media.\n  With respect to Tibet, China's leaders have yet to establish a \ndialogue with the Dalai Lama, and they refuse even to meet with U.S. \nofficials responsible for coordinating U.S. policy on Tibet.\n  Mr. President, we should not stand mute in the face of China's \ncontinuing violation of basic human rights. Our silence would be \ndeafening.\n  If we are not going to call on China to respect human rights before \nthe UN Human Rights Commission, where will we make our concerns known?\n  And if we must act alone, without support from our European and Asian \nallies, so be it. There is no shame in being alone on the right side of \nhistory.\n  Ten years ago this June the world watched in horror as Chinese \nauthorities used lethal force to suppress the Tian-an-men democracy \nmovement. I am convinced that the gradual improvement in human rights \nin China over the past decade would not have occurred without concerted \ndiplomatic pressure--public and private.\n  Now is not the time to let up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the resolution. \nIn the past, the U.S. has rightfully been the strongest critic of human \nrights abuses in China. So I was disappointed, as I think most in the \nSenate were, that the President chose not to sponsor a resolution \ncondemning China's human rights practices at last year's annual meeting \nof the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The United States has \nsponsored such a resolution at each of these annual meetings since \n1990.\n  Although I didn't agree with that decision, I understood the \nreasoning behind it. China seemed to be making some progress. It had \nsigned the UN Covenant on Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights, and \ncommitted itself to signing the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights (ICCPR). Perhaps reform was at hand. And I certainly \nfavor building a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with \nChina.\n  But recent history indicates that China often makes such concessions \nuntil the world's attention is focused elsewhere, and then quickly \nreverts back to it's policy of severe intolerance and repression. In \n1993, for instance, when human rights became an issue in Beijing's bid \nto host the Olympics, China released its most prominent dissident, Wei \nJingsheng. The Olympics were awarded to Australia, and Wei was detained \nagain the following year.\n  Similarly, just last December, 6 months after signing the ICCPR, \nChina sentenced three democratic activists to prison terms of 10 years \nor more for trying to organize a political party. A fourth dissenter \nwas given a 10-year sentence for allegedly ``providing intelligence to \nhostile foreign organizations.'' His crime? He gave an interview to \nRadio Free Asia about farmer protests. And the Chinese premier, Jiang \nZemin, recently stated that China needed to ``nip those factors that \nundermine social stability in the bud, no matter where they come \nfrom,'' and that ``the Western mode of political systems must never be \ncopied.''\n  However, this is not about ``western political systems,'' it is about \ninternationally recognized human rights. Respect for these rights must \nbe real, and it must be systemic. Empty commitments and token gestures \nare meaningless, and we should not allow them to sway us from \nadvocating on behalf of those who are imprisoned in China, or will be, \nfor exercising freedoms acknowledged by the world community. An \ninternational resolution condemning China's human rights practices is \nstrongly supported by human rights groups like Amnesty International \nand Human Rights Watch. By passing such a resolution, the international \ncommunity can demonstrate that we will no longer be duped by false \npromises.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise in begrudging support for S. \nRes. 45. I say begrudging only because while I agree that the UN Human \nRights Commission should address China's human rights record, I neither \nbelieve that the UNHRC will place the issue on its agenda nor do I feel \nthat this resolution has been brought to the floor in the most \nconstructive manner.\n  I agree with the other Senators who have spoken this morning that \nthere has been a disturbing increase in China in the last six months in \ncrackdowns on the freedom of expression, crackdowns evidenced by an \nincrease in the number of arrests and convictions of prodemocracy \nactivists. Moreover, despite attempts to establish a dialog with \nBeijing, China still refuses to meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama \nto discuss the future of Tibet and instead continues to facilitate the \nincreasing immigration of Han Chinese into Tibet and the jailing of \nBuddhist nuns and lamas. Christian churches not registered with the \ncentral government continue to be subject to harassment and closure and \ntheir congregants subject to arrest.\n  I believe I understand, although I certainly in no way condone, the \nimpetus behind the crackdown. China has recently embarked on a program \nto restructure its economy to a market-oriented system and to open more \nto the world around it. These changes are obviously potentially \ndestabilizing for a communist regime governing 1.3 billion people. And \nas with other campaigns in China's past designed to restructure \nsociety, such as the ``Let 100 Flowers Bloom'' campaign, once the \nprogram took hold and began to accelerate, the central authorities got \nanxious about continuing to be able to control the pace of reform and \nabout it getting out from underneath them. They have consequently begun \nslamming on the brakes and stifling any perceived dissent. And it is \nthat movement to stifle peaceful dissent and universal human freedoms \nthat should prompt the US to press this issue before the UNHRC.\n  In a perfect world one would think that these are exactly the type of \nactions the UNHRC would want to address, but sadly we all know the \nreality of the eventual outcome. This year, as in years past, the \nUnited States will fail by a significantly wide vote margin to place \nChina on the Commission's agenda. We will be deserted by most of our \npurported allies who, while nominally paying lip service to the \nsanctity of human rights, appear more interested in securing their \ncommercial interests in the PRC. Well Mr. President, so be it. As \nSenator Biden has noted, there is no shame in standing alone on the \nright side of history, and I fully support that stand under the \nconditions prevailing in China this year.\n  But Mr. President, while I support the consideration of this \nresolution today, I am less enthused about the terms of the unanimous \nconsent agreement which brought it here. As the Chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction, in past Congresses I have strongly \ndisfavored the practice of discharging the Foreign Relations Committee \nfrom the consideration of legislation which the Committee has not had \nthe opportunity to address first. My disapproval of discharges is \nespecially acute when the legislation in question is sponsored by a \nSenator not a member of the Committee. I intend this to be my practice \nin this Congress as well.\n  I have, however, made exceptions in the case of legislation which is \ncompletely non-controversial or is somehow time-sensitive. Since the \nUNHRC meetings this year in Geneva are imminent, and since there was \nnot enough time to consider the legislation\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nin Committee, it made sense in this narrow case and for those reasons I \nagreed to the discharge.\n  I am also uneasy with the terms of the unanimous consent agreement \nbecause they preclude any amendment to the resolution, thereby \npreventing members from offering what I feel would be constructive \nchanges to the text. In addition, Mr. President, I am unsure why--when \nthe Senate should be focused on more pressing domestic issues such as \nthe Y2K problem or Social Security--we are taking the Senate's time to \ndebate and then vote on a resolution about which there is no difference \nof opinion and which will most likely pass 100 to 0. This could have \njust as easily been disposed of by unanimous consent yesterday. For \nthose that argue that a unanimous roll call vote somehow sends a \nstronger signal than passing legislation by unanimous consent, I would \nnote that it is my longstanding experience that very few people if any \noutside the Beltway--especially in foreign countries--understand the \nnuanced differences between the two.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining that I \ncontrol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little over 7 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little over 19 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold. I think his model is one of consistency. He is \nconsistent on human rights questions, and he is absolutely one of the \nmost forceful and effective leaders in the U.S. Congress for human \nrights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I especially thank my \nfriends from Arkansas and Minnesota. I am extremely proud of their \nleadership on this issue. Having this matter become one of the first \nmatters we take up in this Congress is exactly the right way to go. We \nneed to be as aggressive as we can on this issue. That is why I am \ncosponsoring the resolution. I strongly commend them for their \nleadership on this.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United \nStates should initiate active lobbying at the United Nations Commission \non Human Rights for a resolution condemning human rights abuses in \nChina. And it calls specifically for the United States to introduce and \nmake all efforts necessary to pass a resolution on China and Tibet at \nthe upcoming session of the Commission, which is due to begin next \nmonth in Geneva.\n  This resolution makes a simple, clear statement of principle: The \nSenate believes that there should be a China resolution in Geneva, \nperiod.\n  The Commission is a focal point for the protection of human rights, \nand as such, is an ideal multilateral forum in which the United States \nshould voice its concerns. Under the pressure of previous Geneva \nresolutions, China has finally reacted. China signed the U.N. Covenant \non Social, Economic and Cultural Rights in 1997 and the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights in October 1998. Unfortunately, \nneither of these important documents has been ratified or implemented.\n  But at least the kind of pressure the United States put on this \nsituation led them to sign these documents.\n  The effort to move a resolution in the Commission is particularly \nimportant this year, in light of the Administration's decision, \ncontrary to the nearly unanimous sentiment of the Senate, not to \nsponsor such a resolution last year. That was a real disappointment for \nall of us.\n  Their misguided belief that progress could be achieved by other means \nwas clearly not borne out by events in 1998, when, particularly in the \nlast quarter, China stepped up its repression.\n  As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have \naggressively lobbied against efforts at the Commission earlier and more \nactively than the countries that support a resolution. Last year, \nChinese officials basically succeeded in getting the European Union \nForeign Ministers to drop any European cosponsorship of a resolution. \nIn the past, China's vigorous efforts have resulted in a ``no action'' \nmotion at the Commission.\n  I will say, on a bright note, that in 1995 a ``no action'' motion was \ndefeated and a resolution was almost adopted. But, unfortunately, on a \ndownbeat note, it lost by only one vote. A little more effort could \nhave made the difference. I sincerely hope that we do not end up with \nthat kind of a loss at this year's meeting.\n  Nearly five years after the President's decision, which I deeply \nregretted, to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, we \ncannot forget that the human rights situation in China and Tibet \nremains abysmal. While the State Department has not yet provided its \nmost recent human rights report, I have no doubt it will be as critical \nof China as the 1997 report was when it noted that ``the Government of \nChina continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights \nabuses in violation of internationally accepted norms, including \nextrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from \nexecuted prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights \nof freedom of speech, press, and religion.'' I encourage Secretary \nAlbright to actively raise these concerns with her counterparts during \nher visit to Beijing next week. Unfortunately, in the past bilateral \ndiscussions have produced only empty promises from China's leaders on \nthe subject of human rights. Regardless of what assurances China may \nprovide to the Secretary, we should not let Beijing's easily abandoned \npromises deter us from seeking international condemnation of its \npractices. Only through strong US leadership can we gain the broad \ninternational consensus necessary to maintain the pressure on China to \ndemonstrate sustained progress in providing the basic human rights its \npeople deserve.\n  Mr. President, again my thanks to these two Senators. The time is \nnow, and the place is Geneva. We are going to keep pushing this until \nit gets done.\n  I thank the President, and I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from \nWisconsin that we are really going to put the pressure on. We are going \nto have this vote today. It is going to be an overwhelmingly strong \nvote.\n  Tomorrow, the State Department will be releasing its report on human \nrights conditions in other countries. It surely has to be critical \nabout China, because of the action we are going to take.\n  The Chinese Embassy is going to have a press conference here in \nWashington as well. We are going to have a press conference tomorrow \nbringing together any number of different people--those Senators and \nRepresentatives who are still here. We are going to be joined by Mr. \nWu, a very courageous man, Harry Wu, Wei Jingsheng, and human rights \norganizations.\n  We are going to keep the pressure up. We are going to keep the \npressure on.\n  The end of our resolution says:\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, the United States should introduce and \n     make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution calling upon \n     the People's Republic of China to end its human rights abuses \n     in China and Tibet.\n\n  As I said to my colleague, Senator Hutchinson, we haven't talked much \nabout Tibet. Let me just say in deference to some of the work of \nSenator Helms, who really wanted us to have an ambassador to Tibet, the \ncompromise agreement was to have Julia Taft become our Special \nCoordinator on Tibet out of the U.S. State Department. The Chinese \nEmbassy has refused to meet with Julia Taft. They won't even meet. The \nChinese Embassy, whatever they say in their press conference tomorrow, \nwill not even meet with Julia Taft, State Department Special \nCoordinator on Tibet. What we were told last year was, no, we shouldn't \ngo forward as a government and introduce this resolution on human \nrights at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.\n  Senator Hutchinson is right. This is the forum. This is the place. \nThis is the international body. When we do, as an international \ncommunity, focus on\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nhuman rights issues--and we were silent last year. Silence is betrayal. \nAnd we are insisting today on the floor of U.S. Senate that our \nGovernment no longer be silent on these questions.\n  We were told last year, first of all, there will be a lessening of \nrepression. The Chinese Government is going to sign this covenant. They \ndid. We see more repression. We were told that in Tibet that visitors \nwould be allowed to Tibet. You know what happened. Mary Robinson, who \nwas our ambassador on human rights to the United Nations, went to \nChina. Her visit took place in September 1998. But Chinese officials \nproduced none of the information she requested on prisoners, denied her \naccess to Panchen Lama. Panchen Lama is the youngest political prisoner \nthat we know of in the world. She had no access to him. And they made \nno specific commitments on ratification of two U.N. human rights \ntreaties. They signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights, but they produced no timetable for ratifying it. And they \nclearly violated it.\n  I ask you. I ask the administration. I ask the President. The \nPresident made a commitment that when we deal in trade in human \nrights--that is what this debate is about. This is not a debate about \nMFN. It is not about whether or not trade should be linked to human \nrights. I think that it should and others don't. I don't know if \nSenator Hutchinson and I agree or not agree. This is about a different \nissue. The President of the United States of America said he would put \nthe pressure on at Geneva at the Human Rights Commission. That is the \nplace. And we haven't done it.\n  Last year we had this vote. We have a stronger vote this year. And in \nspite of our vote, our Government ignored the wishes of the U.S. \nSenate. This time we are saying don't do that. We are saying you can't \nargue, our Government can't argue, the State Department can't argue, \nthe President can't argue, the Secretary of State can't argue--that \nwhat has happened is, after the President's visit, we have seen now \nmore respect for human rights. They can't argue that there is less \nrepression. They can't argue that there is progress in China or Tibet.\n  We are saying today that if our Government does not introduce this \nresolution condemning the widespread violations of human rights by the \nChinese Government at this important U.N. Human Rights Commission \ngathering in Geneva in March, then our silence will be betrayal.\n  We should introduce this resolution. As Senator Hutchinson said, we \nshould garner support for it. We should urge the European Community \nalso to come out with a strong resolution.\n  I want to tell Senator Hutchinson that I understand the German \nGovernment is looking at the wording of this resolution, and they may \nvery well lead the way with other European countries. It is time to do \nso.\n  I feel strongly about this. I don't want to be self-righteous at all, \nbut my father fled persecution in Russia in 1914 when he was 17 years \nof age with czarist Russia. Then there was the revolution. And he \nthought all the country would be better. And then his parents wrote and \nsaid, ``Don't come back.'' The Communists had taken over. And he never \nwent back.\n  My dad passed away in 1983. Sheila and I finally visited where my dad \ngrew up in 1991. It was pretty clear to us that his family was probably \nall murdered by Stalin. All communication was broken off during the \nStalin era. The letters stopped.\n  I was raised in a home where I was told by my dad really almost every \nday--every night, at 10 at night, starting in high school--he was kind \nof an embarrassment when I was younger, because he was very ``old \ncountry.'' He was almost 50 when I was born, and he wasn't ``cool.'' \nBut when I got to be high school age, I realized what a treasure he \nwas. He could speak 10 languages fluently, and was the wisest, best \nperson I ever knew in my life.\n  We would have hot tea and sponge cake at 10 at night--not on the \nweekend, but Monday through Thursday, and I would listen to him talk \nabout the world. My father Leon would talk about the importance of the \nfirst amendment rights, about the importance of human rights, and about \nthe importance of freedom.\n  I am telling you that I feel as if that is what our Government is all \nabout. That is what the United States of America is all about. That is \nwhat we are all about. And we ought to be speaking out on this and we \nought to be taking the lead in Geneva. That is what our resolution \nsays, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I think what I will do, we will have a vote coming up \nsoon, and although I love to speak on this and I am very committed to \nthis, I would like for Senator Hutchinson to make our concluding \nremarks, because I want to say to Senator Hutchinson, he is right, we \ndon't agree on everything. In fact, this could be the end of my \nreputation, being out on the floor of the Senate with him.\n  Actually, being a little more serious, it has been a labor of love, \nworking with Senator Hutchinson on this. We are just starting. We are \nnot going to let up. I would like the Senator to conclude on this. I \nthank the Senator very much for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding back his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back the rest of my time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am also glad to join in this effort, \none that we will continue to fight and one on which we will ultimately \nprevail, I believe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bunning be added \nas a cosponsor to this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think we have covered many of the reasons why this \nis important. We have reiterated them. I do believe we will have a \nstrong vote today.\n  One of the individuals whose name has been mentioned several times by \nSenator Mack, by myself, Senator Wellstone, is Wei Jingsheng, truly one \nof the courageous heroes of our generation. And I, too, am glad to be \nable to call Wei Jingsheng a friend. Wei Jingsheng has been in my \noffice on numerous occasions, and he will be at our press conference \ntomorrow.\n  As I am able to conclude our presentation of this resolution today, I \nwant to just mention a little bit about Wei Jingsheng.\n  I see Senator Feinstein has come to the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have a little problem in that Senator Wellstone has \nyielded his time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If possible, I would like to speak in favor of this \nresolution for 5 minutes, if I may.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent to gain my \ntime back. I would like Senator Hutchinson to finish. How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, we can yield back 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I give 5 minutes to the Senator from California?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Absolutely. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you. I would like to thank the \nSenators for their courtesy.\n  I rise to add my support to the resolution offered by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and the Senator from Arkansas.\n  I do so with a considerable sense of disappointment because for much \nof 1998, politics in the People's Republic of China appeared headed \ntoward an authentic transformation. The government began to tolerate--\nand even encourage--discussion among intellectuals, academics, and \nreformers of the gradual development of democracy in China, to the \npoint that many began to speak of a ``Beijing Spring.''\n  After many years of stalling, China signed the U.N. International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, which, when ratified, would \nrequire China to allow much closer international scrutiny of its human \nrights practices. Cross-strait discussions resumed with Taiwan.\n  And during President Clinton's visit to China last summer, President \nJiang Zemin, an old friend of mine, did two extraordinary things; he \nallowed the Chinese people to hear President Clinton directly by \ntelevising both his speech at Beijing University and the two leaders' \njoint press conference; and, in the press conference, President Jiang \nimplied that the Chinese leadership would be prepared to meet with\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nthe Dalai Lama to discuss the question of Tibet if the Dalai Lama would \nmake certain statements about the principle of One China and Tibet and \nTaiwan's status as a part of China.\n  That was a major step forward for many of us who have advocated this \nfor years.\n  Each of these developments seemed to represent a hopeful shift toward \na new, more open attitude by the Chinese government. It seemed to \nreflect the confidence of a new generation of Chinese leaders, firmly \nin control, unafraid to allow their people to stretch their minds, and \nwilling to deal forthrightly with difficult political questions like \nTibet and Taiwan through negotiations. But now these hopes appear to be \nin abeyance.\n  I now believe that the hardliners appear to be strengthening their \nhand, and in so doing are causing their President, Jiang Zemin, to lose \nface as they prevent him from allowing a further opening-up of Chinese \nsociety and from carrying out a negotiation to solve real issues of \ndeep concern to six million Tibetans.\n  The recent spate of arrests of dissidents of China, followed by \nsummary trials and convictions of several of the most prominent among \nthem--Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin--raise the ugly specter of \na renewed tightening on political freedom in the months leading up to \nthe tenth anniversary of the Tiananment Square tragedy.\n  On Tibet, the Dalai Lama abandoned plans to use his recent visit to \nthe United States to make far-reaching statements intended to open the \ndoor to negotiations with China, amid unmistakable signals from Beijing \nthat it was not prepared to begin a dialog regardless of what he said. \nMeanwhile, China's persecution in Tibet has only intensified. The \nbrutal tactics of brainwashing, intimidation, and torture--tools of the \nCultural Revolution--are now in use in Tibet.\n  The United States can continue to make contributions toward systemic \nchanges that will instill the rule of law in China, which would, for \nexample, make summary trials a thing of the past. Congress failed to \nfund the President's rule of law initiative last year; we should not \nrepeat that mistake this year. Congress and the Administration should \ncontinue to resist sanctions and economic penalties that will only make \nthe situation worse, but we must develop a stronger policy to put \npressure on China to begin a dialog with the Dalai Lama on providing \nautonomy for the people of Tibet. An important step was taken last \nmonth when Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and \nMigration Julia Taft was named the State Departments Special \nCoordinator for Tibet.\n  This resolution argues for an additional step the United States can \ntake. It urges the Administration to support and work for the passage \nof a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the U.N. \nHuman Rights Commission in Geneva.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that precise individual \ndocumentation and statements of this be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks. These statements were recently given by refugees coming out \nof China directly to some of our friends in Nepal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Whatever the reason for China's entrenchment, it now presents a \nserious challenge to strengthening of relationships between our two \ncountries.\n  I happen to remain convinced that sustained, active dialog and \nengagement with the Chinese leadership is the wisest course, but in \nthese discussions we must be frank and open and the interests of both \nour Nations must be served. The United States can continue to make \ncontributions towards systemic changes that will instill the rule of \nlaw in China which would, for example, make summary trials a thing of \nthe past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it possible----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, the problem is we are going to \nhave a vote soon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask unanimous consent just for 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Congress failed to fund the President's rule of law \ninitiative last year. We should not make that mistake this year. \nCongress and the administration should continue to resist sanctions and \neconomic penalties that will only make the situation worse, but we must \ndevelop a stronger policy to put pressure on China to begin a dialog \nwith the Dalai Lama and providing autonomy for the people of Tibet.\n  An important step was taken last month when Assistant Secretary of \nState for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julia Taft was named as \nthe State Department's Special Coordinator for Tibet.\n  This resolution argues for an additional step the United States can \ntake. It urges the administration to support and work for the passage \nof a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the United \nNations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. While we should acknowledge \nChina's progress in many areas and continue to encourage China in \nsearch of greater progress, we should also use the forum of the United \nNations Human Rights Commission to let China and the world know that \nChina's human rights abuses are unacceptable.\n  Ultimately, China's leaders must come to understand that the economic \nfreedom that have until recently championed--and which they still know \nis necessary for China to fully modernize its economy--must advance \ntogether with social and political freedom. As in Hong Kong and Taiwan, \nChina's ability to withstand economic turmoil will depend in part on \nthe ability of Chinese citizens to make judgments for themselves. \nPolitical leaders cannot expect to draw a line between economic and \npolitical judgments. Both must be allowed to flourish hand-in-hand. And \nthat means viewing the efforts of Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin \nYongmin to organize a more pluralist Chinese polity, and viewing the \nefforts of the Dalai Lama to promote dialogue and religious and \ncultural freedom, as encouraging signs of China's modernization, not as \ndangerous signs of China's instability.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Testimony of Tibetan Refugees in Nepal--November 1998\n\n             (Names have been removed for their protection)\n\n       I rode on trucks and other vehicles many days' travel from \n     Kham to Lhasa, where I purchased a business permit for Yuan \n     250 to travel onward. There, a younger cousin and I paid Yuan \n     1,200 each to a Nepali guide to smuggle us across the border \n     at night. We completed our walk mostly at night.\n       I was a monk at Rinchen Lingpa monastery in Dzong, and had \n     to leave because of a new policy reducing the number of monks \n     from 45 to a maximum of 30. But already, severe economic \n     conditions were forcing me to look for other opportunities; \n     my father, who was imprisoned for 15 years after 1959, is 73 \n     years old now and unable to support me and himself. Because \n     of Dzong's proximity to the recent summer's flooding along \n     the Yangtse, officials were coming and ``shaking down'' the \n     monasteries for contributions to the relief efforts. Also, \n     livestock, farm product and head taxes and other fees have \n     increased steeply and consistently over the past few years, \n     and especially so recently. So many people want to escape \n     from Tibet, but most are afraid of getting caught, shot at or \n     encountering great hardship along the way.\n       I would like to go to Drepung Monastery, in southern India, \n     and resume my Buddhist practice there.\n                                  ____\n\n       In Tibet, I lived for many years in Ko-lung, a Nyingma sect \n     nunnery, except for one trip to India in 1994. Earlier, there \n     were 60 nuns, and recently that number was officially reduced \n     and limited to 45, along with enactment of other strictures \n     such as a ban on all morning prayers [an important foundation \n     of Tibetan Buddhist practice].\n       In April of 1998, I was drawn into an argument with the \n     head nun, who accused me of being aligned with the Tibetan \n     community in exile. (When I returned to Nagchu from my trip \n     to India in '94, I was kept in solitary confinement for 20 \n     days before being released). As a result, I was turned over \n     to the authority in charge of the political re-education \n     program, which I was inducted into. I, and others, were \n     forced to renounce our allegiance to and relinquish all \n     photos of the Dalai Lama (which we tried to hide), and to \n     state in writing that Tibet is and always has been an \n     inalienable part of China. However, knowing that I faced \n     imprisonment in doing so, I refused to write that I agreed \n     with their ``re-education'' points. I was not imprisoned, but \n     fined Yuan 1,400. My parents and I realized that we were \n     unable to pay my fine, and that without the nunnery there was \n     nothing left for me there, so I decided to leave.\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       From the age of 15, I had been a monk at Ganden monastery, \n     and a teacher and part time translator for tourists. I was \n     expelled in September, 1996, along with 200 other monks as a \n     result of suspicions that authorities had developed following \n     the Ganden uprising on May 6 of that year: 50 officials had \n     arrived at Ganden, and the monks began throwing stones. That \n     night, the monastery was surrounded and about 100 monks were \n     arrested the next morning; most of those are now serving 9-15 \n     years sentences. During the night, I had helped a \n     photographer escape with film, resulting in a news story that \n     was broadcast on VOA wherein the photographer thanked the \n     Ganden teachers for advising him to escape that night. I \n     became very cautious, careful to clean my quarters and hide \n     all my Dalai Lama photographs, but officials tracked me down \n     on the basis of that VOA news report.\n       The situation in Tibet is getting worse, month by month. \n     Monks are being expelled from monasteries, and now and \n     entrance exam in which you have to write well in Chinese is \n     required for every job, even low level jobs. The culture of \n     Lhasa has also deteriorated, with Chinese prostitution and \n     other vices found everywhere, now.\n                                  ____\n\n       In Lhasa, I bought a fake internal travel pass to the \n     border, and came with my pregnant wife. We paid Rs. 30,000/--\n     and were smuggled across.\n       When I was 15, I left Amdo to train as a monk at Ganden, \n     but I was there for less than 2 years. In 1987 and '89, I \n     witnessed the uprisings and demonstrations in Lhasa, and was \n     emotionally very moved by them. That's when I realized that I \n     had to stand up to the Chinese, and I have been helping the \n     Tibet cause since that time.\n       After 1992, I was constantly on a PSB (Public Security \n     Bureau) watch list, and several times was harassed, \n     interrogated and detained. I was first arrested in 1992, and \n     was held in solitary confinement and interrogated and beaten \n     for 8 days. Continuously, three policemen had me kneel on a \n     cement floor and kicked me on the body and face. One of them \n     did all the kicking and beating, one watched, and the other \n     sat at a desk and took notes. They were Chinese and Tibetan, \n     but I don't harbor ill feelings toward the Tibetans because I \n     feel their circumstances in being there were not their fault.\n       They couldn't get any information out of me, so they fined \n     me Yuan 6,700 and made me swear that I would never reveal the \n     place of confinement--which looks like a normal government \n     office, but with confinement rooms attached at the back. I \n     believe that there are many other such places of confinement; \n     I know others who have been similarly interrogated and \n     beaten.\n       In 1993, I went on pilgrimage to India to attend His \n     Holiness's Kalachakra initiation in Sikkim, and when I \n     returned to Lhasa I had to hide and move my residence \n     frequently, in order to avoid being arrested. Even my parents \n     were being watched, in Amdo. I had opened a shop in Amdo with \n     a friend, and he was arrested and sentenced to five years \n     imprisonment, so I realized that I was in imminent danger of \n     arrest.\n       In 1994, I returned to Amdo and changed my name, stopped \n     wearing monks' robes, and stayed mostly in remote areas. But \n     in August of 1995 I came back to Lhasa, and in October opened \n     a restaurant there. In December of 1995, right at the time \n     when the Chinese appointed their selection for the Panchen \n     Lama, one of my teachers was arrested and kept in \n     confinement, and I was arrested shortly thereafter. The PSB \n     questioned me about my time in India, and tried to force me \n     to agree that the Chinese-selected Panchen Lama was the \n     genuine one. They closed and ransacked my restaurant, which \n     they suspected of being a meeting place for people to talk \n     about freedom for Tibet.\n       I was sentenced to 2 years in prison on 3 counts: for going \n     to India to see the Dalai Lama, for running a restaurant \n     suspected of being connected to the Tibet freedom movement, \n     and for being suspected of engaging in political activity. I \n     was first held at Gutsa prison, about 5 kilometers from \n     Lhasa, for 10 months. I was kept chained and was beaten for \n     the first 15 days (one of my testicles was crushed), and was \n     given no food or water for the first 5 days. They offered \n     food and water, trying to tempt me to tell them what I had \n     been doing. I was beaten so much that I really thought I had \n     died and gone to Hell. I had a cell that was only big enough \n     to lie down in, with a pan to use as a toilet. Our child died \n     during delivery, in June, 1996, when I was in prison.\n       On January 10, 1997, I was transferred to Tolong Dzong \n     prison, where I stayed for the remaining 14 months of my \n     sentence. I was released on April 2 of 1998, and then on May \n     30 was re-arrested by a plain clothes PSB officer, on \n     political grounds, and held for 45 more days. After that, I \n     had to report every month to the police, and was not allowed \n     to travel. That's when my wife and I decided to leave for \n     Nepal.\n       My wife gave birth to a boy on November 3. Now, my first \n     priority is to find work, in order to repay a large loan that \n     I own in Lhasa. I'd also like to learn at least some \n     rudimentary English, to work for the Tibet cause, and to help \n     my friends who are still in Tibet, many of them in prison.\n                                  ____\n\n       My brother was killed by the Chinese in 1958, and since \n     then the situation in Tibet has only been getting worse. In \n     1975 and '76, the state took possession of all the private \n     farm lands in our area, and has been leasing them back to the \n     farmers. Beginning this year, we have not been allowed to \n     sell our crops (primarily barley and wheat) to the open \n     market, but are forced to sell 70-80% of it to the government \n     at a fixed rate that is about half the open market rate. And \n     now, we're not allowed to keep pictures of the Dalai Lama \n     even in our homes.\n                                  ____\n\n       I came over a high pass, though we started as a group of \n     only 18 and merged with other groups from Amdo and Lhasa.\n       This year at the Gawa monastery, where I was a monk, \n     officials recently forced us to publicly denounce the Dalai \n     Lama, and they now prohibit monks younger than 18 from \n     joining the monastery. This is a very shrewd tactic on the \n     part of the Chinese, because they understand that by the time \n     young people are 18 they have already been exposed to modern \n     distractions and bad habits, such as drinking and gambling \n     and prostitution, which spoils their desire for religious \n     practice. Historically (before 1959), our monastery had 800 \n     people, but in recent years it has remained at around 300. \n     About 3 months ago, though, 225 monks were expelled, \n     including me and most of the senior monks. It is now nearly \n     impossible to get admitted to a monastery--and entrance to \n     Sera, Drepung or Ganden is impossible--because the officials \n     are reducing the numbers of monks allowed at monasteries \n     everywhere. Some of the Gawa monks have nowhere to go, and so \n     they wait until the officials are gone and then discreetly \n     join the activities in the monastery, hiding when necessary.\n       The Chinese have appointed their own Panchen Lama, and we \n     don't even know where the genuine Panchen Lama is. I have \n     been told that the public is prohibited from meeting the \n     genuine Panchen Lama's parents.\n       Also, taxes have increased beyond what Tibetans can afford. \n     We used to pay pasture taxes of 7 per yak and Yuan 200 per \n     horse each year, but these have been raised recently, plus \n     farmers and herders have to pay in-kind taxes of meat and \n     butter each year to the authorities--taxes totaling about 30% \n     of our total production. I don't have parents, nor any \n     livestock, and all else that I owned I gave to the monastery. \n     But now my brother and I have had to repay many debts that my \n     parents accumulated, and we have no livestock as a source of \n     income for this.\n       During the severe snowstorms of 1996, we heard on American \n     radio that we would be receiving relief in the form of \n     blankets and money. Some foreign donors did come, and in \n     front of them the officials handed us blankets and Yuan 200 \n     each, but after they left the officials returned and \n     collected all the blankets and money. I think the Chinese are \n     very skilled at tricking outsiders.\n       My brother (age 36) joined me on this trip, and we are \n     relieved to finally be outside of Tibet. After an audience \n     with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, I want to become a monk at \n     the Sera Monastery in southern India.\n                                  ____\n\n       Eighteen years ago, my parents owned a house near the \n     Mosque. A few years ago, the authorities said they would tear \n     down the house and provide us with improved housing there, in \n     the same place. The new complex was built, but then promptly \n     sold to developers. We did get compensation of Yuan 30,000, \n     but this is half what the old house was worth.\n       My mother and I had a very small table on the Bargkor \n     (market area and circumambulation route) where we sold cloth \n     and shirts. We had to pay a Yuan 300 monthly fee to 3 \n     different government departments--for a business permit, for \n     the space itself and also income tax.\n       When I was around 10 years old, I remember getting tear \n     gassed during the rioting, and then staying inside for \n     several days. Nowadays, you might occasionally see a small \n     group of monks or nuns demonstrating, but they never make it \n     more than half a circuit around the Bargkor before being \n     arrested. In August of this year, the authorities entered all \n     the homes in our area, banging on doors loudly and \n     threatening severe penalties, in a search for Dalai Lama \n     photos. We had hidden all of ours ahead of time.\n       My parents and I decided that if our family was to get \n     ahead financially, one of us would have to leave, and we \n     agreed that I should go, hopefully to get an education. I \n     wasn't able to study in Tibet because I didn't have a \n     residency permit for Lhasa, and studying there is very \n     expensive, anyway--as is living there, Right now we are \n     paying Yuan 450-500 for tuition for my younger brother, which \n     doesn't include his uniform or books. Each year it is getting \n     worse. We don't have a family member in government service, \n     but many Tibetans now are being fired, and you now have to \n     take a written exam in Chinese for even a low level job. \n     Tibetan language is hardly used in Lhasa, there are no high \n     lamas left there, there are far fewer monks than there used \n     to be, and anyone showing a sign to resistance to the Chinese \n     is sentenced to 6-7 years' imprisonment. The Chinese \n     immigrants are bringing infectious diseases to Tibet with \n     them [likely in reference to STDs], while prostitution, \n     gambling and night clubs are thriving.\n                                  ____\n\n       In October 1997, four women from our village were called \n     for sterilisation.\n       Two had children already and two did not. One evening the \n     Chinese took the four of them to another place and sterilised \n     them. Two got sick and the others remained healthy. About one \n     month before this, officials from the birth control office \n     came and summoned a meeting. During the meeting\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\n     the Chinese said that they would operate on women from the \n     age of 18 to 40. They said that those women who didn't \n     undergo the operation would be expelled from their jobs. All \n     of them were farmers.\n       I heard from the people of the village that one evening a \n     truck belonging to the birth control office arrived in our \n     village and the 4 of them were taken away to get operated on, \n     totally by force. The officials told the 4 of them that the \n     government would pay everything and no problems would result \n     from the operations. They said that one needed rest for 7 \n     days after the operation, and should take proper medicine, \n     and the food and expenses would be provided by the \n     government. But the women were in bed for more than 2 weeks \n     and hardly recovered, and the expenditures were paid by their \n     families and not by the government.\n                                  ____\n\n       I used to distribute booklets and other literature that \n     dealt with our cause and also I put up posters. As a result, \n     I was caught three times by the Chinese authorities and \n     suffered from imprisonment and torture.\n       When I was first arrested, apart from handcuffing me, they \n     gave me a few kicks and slaps but I wasn't beaten very badly. \n     On the third day I was specifically charged with possession \n     of a book. It was Friday and I was given the ultimatum to \n     hand over any books or literature dealing with Tibetan \n     affairs by Monday. When I reported on Monday, I was asked \n     where the book was, I told them that I didn't have it and was \n     once again imprisoned.\n       For the next two months I was interrogated by using all \n     sorts of tactics but I refused to hand over the book. In the \n     end, my friends paid 2000 yuan and I was released on the \n     conditions that I report daily to the police, confine myself \n     within the monastery and not engage in any subversive \n     activity. I was also told to be an informer. If I did well as \n     an informer, I would be paid secretly and if not I would be \n     re arrested. For the next year I was constantly harassed by \n     the police. Sometimes, they visited me in the middle of the \n     night in my monastic room and asked me questions like whether \n     I had been working sincerely for them and whether I was doing \n     any subversive work.\n       In July 1994 I was arrested for the 3rd time by the Chinese \n     authorities. I was bound in chains both on my hands and feet \n     and taken to the local detention centre. This prison is an \n     interrogation centre for those prisoners who had not \n     confessed their crimes of mistakes. There were no permanent \n     prisoners there. The main reason I was taken to this prison \n     was to keep me away from contacting any Tibetans. While I was \n     being interrogated at this prison, no one knew anything about \n     my whereabouts. I learned later that on the day of my arrest \n     my grandmother died, out of shock and worry.\n       The torturing began every day at 8 in the morning and went \n     on till 9 in the evening. They adopted all sorts of methods \n     to torture me. My hands were tied at the back in a most \n     painful manner and they put electric rods in my mouth. They \n     used the electric stick on me so many times, I can't say how \n     many times. They made me kneel on the floor with a stick \n     under my knees and another stick on the calves of my legs so \n     that the skin was rubbed off my knees. At the same time my \n     hands were handcuffed together on my back, with one arm over \n     my shoulder and the other arm over my lower back. In addition \n     to this, I received countless numbers of slaps and kicks \n     throughout the day.\n       In the coldest month in Amdo, every morning before the sun \n     rose, I was subjected to 2 hour cold baths and I was told to \n     strip myself completely naked and then they kept on pouring \n     buckets of icy cold water on me until I completely blacked \n     out. Sometimes I was subjected to a treatment in which they \n     hit with me with thin, sharp bamboo all over my body. After \n     some time, my whole body became like a plucked chicken, very \n     blue with patches of white. Sometimes after throwing \n     countless buckets of ice cold water on me, they would bring \n     me before a red glowing fireplace, if they felt I was about \n     to faint. They gave me this type of torture for 15 days.\n       I was also fed very poorly with 2 glasses of black tea and \n     some meagre food. I was almost starving because sometimes if \n     I could chew a single pea, I used to feel very happy. \n     However, no matter what type of torture they it was, I didn't \n     admit or confess anything except the possession of the book, \n     which I had already done earlier. I suffered rigorous torture \n     for about 4 months in this prison and since I didn't confess \n     anything they eventually transferred me. In the new prison I \n     was chained and made to sit on a chair, and the security \n     personnel kept me from sleeping for 14 days. The food given \n     to me was the same as they gave to their pigs. I was charged \n     for being a spy of the Tibetan government. The final verdict \n     was that I was a counter-revolutionary who had been engaged \n     in propagating their cause. Thus, I was sentenced for two \n     years and 7 months imprisonment. They took away my political \n     rights for a period of 2 years. After serving my imprisonment \n     I was finally released at the beginning of 1997. After my \n     release I was constantly harassed by the local police.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was arrested and imprisoned because I called for Tibet's \n     independence. At Gutsa detention center, we were placed in a \n     room with a cement floor where there were no beds and \n     blankets. It was mid winter, and they kept us for over 3 \n     months without blankets, which they allowed only when our \n     relatives brought them from home. We were given small amounts \n     of food, just 2 dumplings per day. It didn't fill our \n     stomachs.\n       When we were interrogated they questioned us about who was \n     behind the demonstration, but we told them that we had done \n     it independently. Then they beat us with the use of an \n     electric baton. They put it everywhere, on my head, hands, \n     mostly on the veins, and here where it is very painful. We \n     would lose memory because of that. They also kicked us and \n     slapped us in the face. They interrogated me three times a \n     day, every day for one or two hours at a time. They asked the \n     same questions and we wouldn't answer them properly. There \n     were 3 or 4 police questioning us.\n       They kept us in Gutsa for one year and 9 months and \n     interrogated us. After that they brought us to court to pass \n     our sentences. I got 4 years imprisonment. They then took us \n     to a hospital where we were supposed to get a medical check \n     up. But they didn't give us any treatment and instead took \n     one bottle of blood from each of us forcibly. Because of that \n     we became thinner and thinner. Then finally they took us to \n     Drapchi prison where we had to do work with wool for making \n     carpets. There wasn't any education and the food was very \n     poor. They treated the political prisoners very harshly while \n     they treated normal prisoners better.\n       We were kept in the prison for a very long time and were \n     not allowed to meet our family. We were able to receive small \n     things such as things to eat. They didn't allow us to meet \n     our family members except after we were sentenced. After our \n     sentencing, they allowed us to meet our family, but only one \n     person could visit at a time.\n       I suffered from a stomach disorder while at Drapchi, from \n     food which was not properly cooked. We used to eat packaged \n     noodles which led to stomach ailments, and whatever I ate, I \n     had to vomit with blood. I suffered from this for about 8 \n     months after I was released from prison. I start vomiting \n     when the weather turns cold. In prison I asked to visit the \n     hospital, but they only used to take (prisoners) to the \n     hospital when they were almost dead. Otherwise they don't \n     care for political prisoners.\n       When I was in prison there were some foreign visits but we \n     were watched all the time so we couldn't talk to them. Before \n     they came we were made to clean the rooms and then we had to \n     do whatever work we had to do. They brought big pieces of \n     meat to the kitchen and stuck up list of food telling the \n     visitors that they give us such food. But in reality we \n     didn't get to eat this meat. After the heads had left they \n     took it away.\n       They put at least one female common law prisoner in each \n     cell to watch the nuns so that we wouldn't talk about things \n     like independence. She would tell the authorities information \n     about us and because of that her sentence was decreased. They \n     were put in a separate room because they feared that we would \n     harm them. They were very happy in their rooms which were \n     better than ours.\n       In Drapchi prison we were made to do exercises which were \n     not for the purpose of our health. It was like military \n     training. When we were doing the exercises we had to shout \n     something in Chinese which meant that we were confessing to \n     our mistakes and that we would come out to society as a new \n     person. Once we understood the meaning of the words we \n     protested and didn't say them. Then many soldiers came and \n     beat us. It was during winter and at that time it is very \n     cold in Tibet. We were made to stand on the cold cement floor \n     in the shade barefooted for a whole day, our shoes and socks \n     removed. This made our feet cold as ice. Then we had to run \n     while they didn't give us any water. Some of us fell \n     unconscious. If someone fell down they said we were not \n     allowed to help. They also stopped the monthly opportunity \n     for our families to visit us. We had to stand in the sun and \n     put our faces in the direction of the sun as a result of \n     which some of us had blisters on our face.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California \nfor her very significant statement. I know we have not always agreed on \nChina, but I think that was a very candid and very honest statement. I \nappreciate her making it.\n  I want to publicly thank, on behalf of Senator Wellstone and myself, \nour staffs: On Senator Wellstone's staff, Charlotte Oldham Moore and \nJohn Bradshaw, for their very persistent and hard work on this issue; \non my staff, Samuel Chang, for his hard work and continued interest in \nthe human rights issues in China.\n  As I said, one of my heroes, and I think one that has been mentioned \nrepeatedly, one that will be with us at the press conference tomorrow, \nis Wei Jingsheng, who spent about 20 years in solitary confinement in \nChina back in the 1970s, arrested for his involvement at the Democracy \nWall effort.\n  At that time he was sentenced to spend 14\\1/2\\ years in solitary \nconfinement, went out and was involved in Tiananmen Square. He was \ntruly a friend and truly a hero. I thought, when I visited with him in \nmy office, while I was going on annual vacations, while I was rearing \nthree boys and seeing them grow up and going out and\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nplaying basketball with them and coaching their soccer games, this man, \nwho is about my age, was languishing in a Chinese prison.\n  I recently read the book ``China Live'' by Mike Chinoy. Mike was the \nCNN correspondent and before that, the NBC correspondent--in Beijing, \nthen Hong Kong. He went to China as a young man in the seventies, very \nidealistic, believing the Chinese regime was going to bring human \nrights and democracy and freedom to the people of China. He left \ndisillusioned to a great extent, but he tells about the trial of Wei \nJingsheng. I want to read this as I conclude. He talked about Wei \nJingsheng, on October 9, 1979, going on trial.\n\n       Pictures from the proceedings were broadcast on Chinese TV. \n     They showed a youthful-looking Wei, dressed in prison garb, \n     his head shaved and bowed, listening to the verdict before a \n     panel of stony-faced judges and a carefully selected audience \n     of five hundred people. I had read his essays and seen for \n     myself the hope generated by Democracy Wall. Now, working \n     late at the NBC bureau in Hong Kong on the day Wei was \n     sentenced to fifteen years in jail for ``counterrevolutionary \n     incitement'', I was angry and upset.\n       Although intellectually I recognized that profound changes \n     were still under way in China--holding out, over the long \n     term, the possibility of a more humane society--it was hard \n     to be neutral and dispassionate watching such a travesty of \n     justice. My feelings became even stronger when I acquired a \n     copy of the transcript of Wei's trial, which had been \n     surreptitiously tape-recorded and distributed by other \n     activists not yet under detention. Standing before his \n     accusers, Wei refused to admit to any crime. Instead he \n     forcefully defended his ideas of democracy. His courage in \n     the face of a certain guilty verdict and long prison term was \n     astonishing. I wished I could do something to help.\n\n  He said, ``I wished I could do something to help.'' Twenty years \nafter that trial, things are not better in China, and we see a new \nround of the same kind of show trials, phony trials and repression. \nMike Chinoy said, ``I wished I could do something to help.'' Ladies and \ngentlemen of the Senate, we have a chance today to do a little \nsomething to help. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the \nTiananmen massacre. This is an incredibly important year in China and \nfor the democracy movement in China. We can take an important step and \ncast an important vote with overwhelming bipartisan support for this \nresolution today.\n  I ask my colleagues to call upon the administration to sponsor this \nresolution in Geneva this summer, condemning the human rights abuses \nongoing in China today.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished majority \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have a unanimous consent request to \npropound, and I know we would, then, be prepared to go to a recorded \nvote. But before we do that, I want to take a moment to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas for the work he has done and the \nfact that he has been joined by the Senator from Minnesota in \naddressing this very important issue. I know they have been joined by a \nnumber of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is not something new with the Senator from Arkansas. Senator \nHutchinson has been trying to emphasize his concerns about the terrible \nhuman rights policies in the People's Republic of China ever since he \nhas been in the Senate. I know he worked on it last year. He has been \ntrying to make the point this is a serious problem, and I think the \njustification for this serious expression is the fact that it is still \nnot what it should be. He has been talking about it for quite some \ntime, as have others, and there continue to be terrible human rights \nviolations.\n  So I think it is appropriate that the Senate, in its second \nlegislative action of this year, would express its very strong concern \nregarding this human rights situation in the People's Republic of \nChina. I have read the resolution. I think it is well stated. And the \ntimeliness is also very important. As we now are about to have the \nannual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in \nGeneva, Switzerland, for the Senate to go on record taking a stand for \nthis human rights position, I think, is very commendable. I am glad I \nhave been able to work with Senator Daschle and both sides of the aisle \nto make it possible for us to consider this separately, to highlight \nthe fact that we are not just sticking this on as a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution in a bill, this is a Senate resolution that states clearly \nour concern and our position. I am very pleased to be supportive of my \ncolleague's efforts.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know Senator Hutchinson thanked the majority leader. \nI also want to thank the majority leader for his support in doing this. \nHe is right. It is timely. We do want to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1972-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 1, 1999 AND TUESDAY, MARCH 2, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Res. 45\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China continues to commit \n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China \n     and Tibet and continues the coercive implementation of family \n     planning policies and the sale of human organs taken from \n     executed prisoners;\n       Whereas such abuses stem from an intolerance of dissent and \n     fear of civil unrest on the part of authorities in the \n     People's Republic of China and from a failure to adequately \n     enforce laws in the People's Republic of China that protect \n     basic freedoms;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct enshrined by the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China recently signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has \n     yet to take the steps necessary to make the covenant legally \n     binding;\n       Whereas the President decided not to sponsor a resolution \n     criticizing the People's Republic of China at the United \n     Nations Human Rights Commission in 1998 in consideration of \n     commitments by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to sign the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights and based on a belief that progress on human \n     rights in the People's Republic of China could be achieved \n     through other means;\n       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have \n     recently escalated efforts to extinguish expressions of \n     protest or criticism and have detained scores of citizens \n     associated with attempts to organize a legal democratic \n     opposition, as well as religious leaders, writers, and others \n     who petitioned the authorities to release those arbitrarily \n     arrested; and\n       Whereas these efforts underscore that the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China continues to commit serious human \n     rights abuses, despite expectations to the contrary following \n     two summit meetings between President Clinton and President \n     Jiang in which assurances were made regarding improvements in \n     the human rights record of the People's Republic of China: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, the United States should introduce and \n     make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution calling upon \n     the People's Republic of China to end its human rights abuses \n     in China and Tibet.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1982-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we will be discussing two critical areas as \nwe address the education of our youth in this country. Those two areas \nare flexibility and accountability. Discussing this topic with me will \nbe Senators Chafee, Bond, Craig, Voinovich, Gregg, Hutchinson, and \nCollins.\n  The issue that we will discuss is called Ed-Flex. Specifically, it is \nthe Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. The shorthand \nversion is ``Ed-Flex.'' That is the way it will be referred to, I am \nsure, over the next several hours and the next several days as we look \nat this particular bill which I expect to come to the floor next week.\n  Let me begin by discussing what Ed-Flex is so people will know what \nwe are talking about. It is really pretty simple. Ed-Flex is a State \nwaiver program that allows schools and school districts at the local \nlevel to obtain or have the opportunity to obtain a waiver to carry out \nand accomplish a specific educational mission, but with flexibility \nfree of Washington red tape, free of the administrative regulatory \nburden which too often--and we hear it as we travel across the State \nagain and again--shackles them in terms of meeting those specific \ngoals. These regulations are often well intentioned. We create them \nright here in this room in Washington, DC, and then we expect them to \nfit every local community. They simply don't fit. That is No. 1. That \nis what Ed-Flex is.\n  No. 2, we as a country recognize we are failing our children today in \nterms of education. We are trying hard, teachers are trying hard, local \nschools are trying hard, but we simply are not doing the job that our \nchildren deserve in preparing them for the next millennium.\n  Ed-Flex allows every State the option of participating in a \ndemonstration program which has been enormously successful; this \nprogram was first established in 1994 and expanded in 1996. So we have \na track record. Right now Ed-Flex is in 12 States. What this bill does \nis strengthen the accountability provisions and then gives all 50 \nStates the opportunity to participate in Ed-Flex to help our States, to \nhelp our localities.\n  Education is primarily a local issue. That is where these decisions \nshould be made. Washington must give these localities, these schools, \nthese school districts, the flexibility they need in order to innovate, \nto do a better job, to do what they know is best.\n  Let me cite some examples that really make it clear to people. They \nunderstand Ed-Flex is a State waiver program that allows schools and \nschool districts to accomplish goals free of red tape. Here are some \nexamples:\n  In Maryland, Ed-Flex reduced class size for math and science students \nfrom 25 to 1 to 12 to 1. It has cut it in half. They wouldn't have been \nable to do it without Ed-Flex.\n  In Oregon, Ed-Flex allowed high schools and community colleges to \nwork together to provide advanced computer courses to students who \nwould otherwise not be able to receive this technical instruction.\n  A third example: In Kansas, waivers provide all-day kindergarten, \npreschool for 4-year-olds, and new reading strategies for all students. \nIt would not be possible without Ed-Flex.\n  It is common sense. It is bipartisan. It is a plan that has been \nsupported by every Governor in this country. It is one that we are \ngoing to move ahead, doing the Nation's business in a bipartisan way to \naccomplish what I believe is one of the most important goals before us, \nand that is to improve education in this country.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  Now, that describes the flexibility, innovation, and creativity. The \naccountability is an important issue, because if you strip away \nWashington red tape, you have to be accountable. Accountability is \nbuilt strongly into this bill. It is even tiered-in so that you have \nlocal accountability, State accountability, and Federal accountability \nto make sure that those missions are accomplished.\n  At the local level, schools have to demonstrate why this waiver is \nnecessary, what the objectives will be; they have to have specific, \nmeasurable goals.\n  At the State level, there must be in place an accountability system \nin three ways: You have to have content standards, No. 1; No. 2, you \nhave to have performance standards; and No. 3, you have to have \nassessment standards. Backing that up at the Federal level, the \nSecretary of Education is required to monitor the performance of \nStates, and in fact the Secretary can terminate the State's waiver \nauthority at any time.\n  So we have a three-tiered approach to accountability.\n  Ed-Flex expansion has passed twice in the Senate Labor Committee. It \nhas the support of 38 Senators from both sides of the aisle. It has the \nsupport of the National Governors' Association. It has the support of \nthe Democratic Governors' Association. The Secretary of Education and \nthe President have all called for Ed-Flex expansion.\n  Last year, we ran out of time to pass Ed-Flex. It has already gone \nthrough the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee this year. \nWe need to keep the bill clean and simple. There will be an unfortunate \ntendency to put a lot of amendments on the bill and attach your \nfavorite education bill. We have an opportunity to have a bill passed \nin this body next week, passed by the House of Representatives within a \ncouple of weeks, and at the President's desk within 6 weeks. It is a \nsimple message: Congress cares about education.\n  Congress respects local control, local innovation, local creativity. \nAnd we, by passing this bill, demonstrate to the American people that \nwe can work together in the interest of our children, preparing them \nfor that next century, the next millennium. Let's untie the hands of \nlocal government. Let them do the jobs they are entrusted to do. Ed-\nFlex is a modest bill, but an important first step at administrative \nregulatory simplification with strong accountability built in. I look \nforward to the Senate's consideration of this bill next week, again, \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  I thank the Chair. At this juncture, I will yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Rhode Island. I will yield to colleagues, and they can \ntake from my time as we go forth over the next 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the manager of this \nlegislation. I rise in support of this legislation introduced by the \nSenator from Tennessee, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. Last \nweek, while the Senate was in recess, I spent time in Rhode Island \ntalking with educators about Ed-Flex. I had a group of educators from \nour schools come in; principally, they were principals of our schools. \nAs a result of those conversations, I became a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, Ed-Flex.\n  First, it is important to point out what it is not. It is not a block \ngrant proposal. Senator Frist's bill, which will be the next order of \nbusiness, as I understand it, next week, expands a demonstration \nprogram, as he pointed out, for six States where it was created in \n1994. Now, 2 years later, it is expanded from 6 to 12 States. This bill \nwould permit all 50 States to benefit from it.\n  Now, what is this bill? Ed-Flex allows State departments of education \nto apply for waivers of Federal requirements for State administrative \nprograms. Examples of these programs are: the title I program, the \nEisenhower Professional Grants Program, and the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Program. The States must agree to waive any corresponding State \nregulations for these programs. If we are going to waive the Federal \nregulations, we are going to waive the State regulations as well. The \nStates must have made demonstrable progress in creating and putting \ninto place the challenging statewide content standards. In other words, \nStates must have a place in statewide school reform, and that is what \nthis is designed to do.\n  One of the best examples of how Ed-Flex can benefit schools was \noffered by an elementary school principal in my State when I talked to \nhim last week. He noted that for several years, his school district's \nemphasis had been on raising achievement in math and science. \nProfessional development had been squarely focused on math and science, \nand students in his school were showing the results through increased \ntest scores. Now he would like to be able to use the funds he receives \nfrom the Eisenhower Professional Grants Program, which is targeted to \nmath and science--he wants to use it for professional development in \nreading, have his teachers become better reading teachers. Ed-Flex \nwould allow him to do that. Absent Ed-Flex, he could not use these \nprofessional development moneys for anything except science and math. \nHe could not use it for reading. This permits this legislation to be \nused with this flexibility.\n  Since enactment of Goals 2000, States and school districts have been \nworking hard to develop schoolwide reform plans that will improve the \nquality of education for all children. I believe this legislation will \nhelp give schools the needed reforms that they seek. It has, as was \nmentioned, strong bipartisan support. A companion bill, I understand, \nis moving through the House, and the President has indicated his \nwillingness to sign it. So this is a hopeful sign for all of us, and I \nthink it is excellent legislation. I commend it to my colleagues.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Tennessee for his great leadership.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Ed-Flex because it gives \nStates and local officials in 12 States now greater freedom from \nregulation in the use of Federal education dollars. We need to expand \nthat. This is moving in the right direction. It is not all the way \nthere. They should be encouraging innovation, creativity, and \nflexibility on the local level in regard to education. We should not be \nhandcuffing teachers, principals, and others from trying to do what is \nright for the kids in their schools.\n  I think expanding Ed-Flex is a step in the right direction of putting \nour Nation's children first and not the red tape and bureaucracy.\n  Ed-Flex is a step in the right direction because it moves in the \ndirection of putting decisionmaking back where it belongs, on the local \nand State level. It proposes consolidating funding and removing the \nstrings that Washington has put on.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island has talked about his meetings with \nlocal educators in Rhode Island. Over the last 2 years, I have met with \nprincipals, teachers, superintendents, parents, and school board \nmembers in every section of my State. It is amazing what they tell me \nwhen I ask them about how our Federal programs are helping them. They \nsay, ``They are burying us in red tape. We have to hire people to write \ngrant applications, and to try to play `Mother May I' with the Federal \nGovernment. We are taking away time from our task, which should be \neducating our children and providing them with a quality education.'' \nThey say that too many of them--if they fight and finally get a \ncompetitive grant for 3 years, that grant runs out and then they are \nfaced with taking away money from their basic programs of providing \nquality education to fund a Federal program that was stuffed down their \nthroats.\n  At our best count, we have about 763 Federal education programs. I \nchallenge every single one of my colleagues to go back home and ask the \neducators: Do you really need 763 different Federal prescriptions? Are \nthey really helping you educate your children? I can tell you that the \nresponse from my State is overwhelming, and I believe it will be from \nyour States as well.\n  When we think about the tremendous waste in time and bureaucracy with \n4,500 people in the DOE, the bureaucracy overseeing them, and 13,000 at \nthe\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\nState bureaucracies, those are dollars that are not going to the \nclassrooms. Who is accountable for education? Are we as a Congress? I \ndon't think so. I don't think anybody elected us to a national school \nboard. Ed-Flex is moving away from the concept that we have come to \nWashington to be a national school board.\n  I say to you, to the President, and I say to the Secretary of \nEducation: If you want to run local education, run for the school \nboard, or be a superintendent or a principal.\n  Now, I hope we can pass this bill cleanly out of here and send it on \nto the President, get it signed. Let's expand on this program. I will \ntell you one thing for sure. If they start adding amendments to it, I \nhave something called a ``Direct Check for Education.'' Direct check \nfor education would put the money directly in the schools, not on the \nbasis of a complicated formula, but on the basis of average daily \nattendance. I have explained that program to school districts \nthroughout my State.\n  I have a sampling of letters from school superintendents. I ask \nunanimous consent that these may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Harrisburg R-VIII School District,\n\n                                                   Harrisburg, MO.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Bond, The Harrisburg School District is in support \n     of ``Direct Check for Education'' proposed by yourself. The \n     Senator's office indicated funds available at $76.00 per \n     pupil. The funds from this ``Direct Check'' would \n     significantly enhance our educational offerings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William E.

Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: As per your request, I have reviewed \n     your ``Direct Check'' proposal and am responding to your \n     idea. I am very interested in what you are proposing through \n     the ``Direct Check'' alternative. Our school district is, I \n     assume, fairly typical of many within our great state in that \n     we participate and offer many of the federally subsidized \n     programs. Through your ``Direct Check'' proposal, our \n     district will not only receive more dollars than it presently \n     does, but also have the latitude to utilize those dollars as \n     deemed appropriate by our Board of Education and this school \n     system.\n       I fully understand the potential turf issues that you face \n     with this ``Direct Check'' for Education proposal. I am also \n     cognizant of the bureaucracy that is affiliated with each of \n     these programs subsidized by federal education dollars. I am \n     most appreciative of and agree with your assessment that this \n     is substantive reform, and, therefore, our district would \n     gladly offer any assistance that we might. If there is \n     anything that we might do to further your ``Direct Check'' \n     for Education proposal, please do not hesitate to ask. Again, \n     we very much appreciate your concern for public education and \n     this demonstration of a return to local control.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Larry E.

Bond,\n     Russell State Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I appreciate the recent opportunity to \n     attend the news conference in Joplin, Missouri, concerning \n     your Direct Check proposal. Likewise, it was encouraging to \n     receive your recent correspondence concerning the proposal.\n       On behalf of the Carthage R-9 School District in Carthage, \n     Missouri, I want to express our strong support for the \n     proposal. It is our belief the plan will bring about equity \n     and benefit our students in numerous ways.\n       Your work to reform this payment process is highly valued. \n     If at any time our district can be of service to you, please \n     let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Kenneth C.

Bond,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     St. Louis, MO.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I am writing to let you know that I \n     fully support your ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal. \n     After so many false promises by lawmakers regarding help for \n     education, your idea is one that I have hoped to see for many \n     years. It should truly be the job of local decisionmakers to \n     decide how funds are spent on each school. We do not mind \n     being held accountable for producing results when we have the \n     freedom to spend dollars as the local board sees fit. I \n     congratulate you for the stand you have taken on this issue. \n     I doubt it is popular among other lawmakers, because it will \n     no doubt rock the boat in some circles.\n       Again, thank you for this initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Larry Graves,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Blue Springs School District,\n\n                               Blue Springs, MO, February 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S.

The ``Direct Check'' proposal would \n     allow us, at the local level, to make the decisions we need \n     to make without the restrictions that are often applied at \n     the state and federal levels.\n       We encourage you to press forward with this initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Charles McGraw,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Reeds Spring R-IV School District,\n\n                               Reeds Spring, MO, February 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Your ``Direct Check'' proposal does what \n     legislation should do. It puts the money where it can do the \n     most good. Leaders in local schools will be able to address \n     specific needs of students rather than conform to directives \n     from bureaucratic number crunches.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Dr. Bill Wheeler,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Kirbyville Public School,\n\n                                                   Kirbyville, MO.\n     Senator Christopher Bond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: ``Direct Check'' is one small ``step'' \n     in the right direction. Sending tax money back to the people \n     it came from has never been a bad idea. Eliminating federal \n     and state bureaucratic taxpayer payrolls has always been a \n     good idea but appears to be an impossibility.\n       Local boards of education should be held accountable for \n     the quality of public education programs within their own \n     communities. If state and federal governments want to support \n     programming efforts through certification standards, a simple \n     process that ties certification to funding would seem \n     appropriate. If student performance is the primary indicator \n     used for certification, it shouldn't require multi-billion \n     dollar bureaucracies to manage the process.\n       Public education in America is in serious trouble. \n     Solutions to the problems will require a comprehensive \n     approach from every level, i.e., federal, state and local. I \n     applaud your leadership with this effort at the federal \n     level.\n       I encourage you to look for different funding approaches \n     for public education. The local property tax is a very useful \n     tool, but it has been extended beyond its limits. State \n     funding is also very useful and has been a lifesaver for many \n     Missouri Schools. However, the ``Big Dogs'', i.e., the \n     industries that produce ``adult'' products, when used as \n     directed can kill, have been allowed to advertise their \n     products over airways owned by the federal government without \n     regard to the collateral damage to the minds of our youth.\n       Public education should not be required to spend taxpayer \n     money to remediate problems cause by these irresponsible \n     industries that target the youth of our nation as future \n     addicts of their products. It is my understanding that the \n     top five contributors to the nations two political parties \n     are: the tobacco industry, the liquor industry, the movie \n     (media) and music industries and trial lawyers. Local \n     taxpayers should not be the only responsible agent for the \n     costs associated with drug education, violence prevention, \n     sex education and character development programs for public \n     schools. If the ``Bid Dogs'' are going to play the game they \n     should have the opportunity to pay for the dance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lonnie Spurlock,\n     Superintendent\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Webb City School District R-7,\n\n                                  Webb City, MO, February 4, 1999.\n     Senator Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Please accept my enthusiastic support \n     for the ``Direct Check'' education initiative you are \n     sponsoring. It is my opinion that a program of this nature is \n     long overdue. Those of us who have spent a career in \n     education have repeatedly experienced the jubilation of \n     anticipation that arose from promises made by the Federal \n     Government toward education. Unfortunately, however, \n     excitement was then always tempered by the reality of the red \n     tape that accompanied the promise. As the result, frustration \n     was generally the only product forthcoming.\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\n       It is my opinion that one size does not fit all in \n     anything, especially education. I would welcome your program \n     and see it as an opportunity for real improvement of results \n     that would arise from federal dollars that flow toward \n     education. You can count on me as a supporter of your \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald Lankford,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Pemiscot County\n\n\n                                       Special School District\n\n                                      Hayti, MO, February 5, 1999.\n       Senator Bond, As a school administrator, parent, and \n     taxpayer, I would like to commend your Direct Check efforts \n     and offer my support in its passage.\n       I must remind myself daily that, even though some decisions \n     appear to be more easily made from our Central Office, the \n     best decisions are those that are made from the source of \n     need.\n       The Direct Check concept would allow the decisions about \n     utilizing education funds to rest in the hands of our \n     constituents without losing some of the funds in state \n     administrative procedures. I feel confident that our Board of \n     Education indeed represents the wishes of our constituents \n     and frequently engages in dialogue with parents and students \n     to determine educational needs.\n       Thank you for your efforts. Please don't hesitate to \n     contact me for additional support.\n                                               Nicholas J. Thiele,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the direct check for education doesn't block \ngrant education funds; it doesn't affect title I or include vocational \neducation, special education, or Eisenhower Professional Development; \nit just says send the money directly back to the school districts, \neliminating the time spent reviewing grant applications and the \npaperwork burden. It replaces a cumbersome and costly process with a \nresource of flexible funding.\n  Do we need 100,000 new teachers? In many small school districts, they \nfigure it comes out to about .16 students for their entire district, or \n.1. How do you hire .16 teachers? Some districts may need to use that \nmoney to pay more so they can keep good teachers. This would allow them \nto do it. Some of my colleagues say you will take power away from the \nStates and the States ought to be running it. I say the State \nregulations can still stay in effect, but the accountability is going \nto be at the local level.\n  We have school boards that we elect to take care of our educational \nneeds and to make sure that our children get a quality education. I \nhave a really radical proposal: Let's go back to the old system where \nschool boards are responsible through the superintendents and \nprincipals and teachers and allow them to use the good ideas. We have \nlots of good ideas up here, and we ought to offer those voluntarily and \nsay: Here is a good idea; do you want to try it?\n  The President just came up with a whole new series of standard things \nhe wants to do for every school district in the Nation. They may well \nbe good ideas. If you were a school superintendent, they might be just \nthe thing to do. Let's suggest to them that these are things they might \nwant to require. They may have a different way of going about it. I am \nwilling to take the chance on putting that money in the hands of the \npeople, the local educators who know our kids, know kids' names, and \nknow their problems.\n  I believe Ed-Flex is a tremendous step in the right direction. I urge \nthat we pass it without amendment. If we do start amending it, I am \ngoing to give my colleagues an opportunity to vote on sending the money \ndirectly back to the schools. Let's be radical, and let's do something \nthat can make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Missouri and \nothers who have spoken on the floor in relation to the legislation that \nwe will begin to debate next Tuesday, I believe, Senate bill 280. We \nare calling it the Ed-Flex bill because of a demonstration project that \nhas now gone on in 12 other States in our country where school \ndistricts have demonstrated that, given the flexibility to move dollars \naround, they can accomplish great things for the young people they are \nresponsible for educating.\n  So for the rest of our country, I think the Senator from Missouri and \nI want to see a similar kind of flexibility.\n  What does it mean? It is very clear what it means. It means that when \nit comes to educating the young people of our country, we basically \ntrust parents a great deal more than we trust bureaucrats.\n  For a long time, we felt that the promotion of education in our \ncountry would come only if you could have a national department of \neducation, and from that would flow all good things to the rest of the \ncountry, and they would serve as the leaders to project our States and \nour school districts into the dynamics of improving our public \neducation system. We found out that while there is a department of \neducation necessary on occasion, that the real energy comes from a \nlocal school district, or a State, or a group of parents who do not \nlike what they see, or the direction their children's education is \nheading in, and they want to make changes.\n  I am not at all opposed to public education. How could I be? I, my \nwife, and all of our children are the products of the public education \nsystem. And we are very proud of it. In Idaho we have a very good \npublic education system that could be a great deal better. The Governor \nof the State of Idaho, former Senator here in this body, just elected, \nhas recognized in our State that one of the greatest needs is in the \narea of reading. Should he be allowed, along with local school \ndistricts, to shift to more concentration on reading from the first \ngrade through to the fourth or fifth grade? If that is what Idaho \nneeds, that is what he should be allowed to do. Even within that \ncontext, in some school districts in our State reading has already been \na higher priority, and those students are doing better.\n  In the State of Texas, which has been able to operate under this \ndemonstration project that we now want to send nationwide, the students \nthere are outperforming others, because once again school districts are \nallowed to focus, to target, and on their standardized test scores they \nare moving up faster than they are in other States.\n  In Maryland, students are receiving a one-on-one tutoring--again, a \ndemonstration on the part of the school districts that in Maryland they \nneeded to focus on reading. That one-on-one relationship might \notherwise be denied under the concept that a one-size education program \nfits all which would not have allowed the students to do so.\n  There are a good many stories out there. It is from those stories, \nthose clear examples of understanding, that we bring S. 280 to the \nfloor. I think it has the kind of dynamics we ought to be involved in. \nFor some time we Republicans have recognized that bureaucracies just \ndon't educate. They burn up a lot of money. They direct a lot of very \nwell-meaning people sometimes in the wrong directions.\n\n  Where it works is when the money gets to the local levels where \nparents, along with their educators, can determine what the needs are \nin a given area. That, of course, has always historically produced one \nof the most dynamic public systems in the Nation, in the world, and \nthat is our public education system, stalled out in a good number of \nyears simply because it did not have the flexibility to respond.\n  At this level we are going to put more dollars into education. We \nbelieve that is a high national priority. Unlike those of the past \nwhere money should have come from the State and local units, we are \ncommitted in our opportunity of surplus years to put some of those \ndollars into education, and in so doing, we don't want them to get hung \nup here where 25 or 30 percent will be spun over into bureaucratic \ninertia. We want them to flow directly to our units of education at the \nlocal level.\n  Ed-Flex, Senate bill 280, offers us that opportunity. We begin to \ndebate it next week. I hope we can have strong bipartisan support in \nwhat is an extremely valuable initiative.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senate 280, \na bill to extend educational flexibility to all of the 50 States.\n  One of the nice things about becoming a Member of the U.S. Senate is \nthat I am going to have an opportunity as a Member of Congress to \npromote some of the programs I lobbied for while I was mayor of the \ncity of Cleveland and\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\npresident of the National League of Cities, and programs that I \npromoted as Governor and chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation.\n  Way back in 1991, we did a study in the State of Ohio in regard to \nour department of education to find out if there were ways we could \nchange its direction. One of the things we discovered was that there \nwere all kinds of reports that needed to be filed. What was astounding \nis that half the reports that were being filed by school districts were \nto the Federal Government and the Federal Government was only \nparticipating to the extent of about 6 percent of the money that was \nbeing spent in those school districts.\n  So at that time I came to Washington and I met with Lamar Alexander, \nwho was at that time the Secretary of Education, and said to him that \nsomething had to be done about this. At that time he started to put \nsome things together. I think he may have coined the word ``Ed-Flex.'' \nAlso, Secretary Riley, an enlightened former Governor, realized that \nthe Department of Education could be of help to the States. They \nextended the right to local State secretaries to grant waivers to local \nschool districts where they wanted to use certain Federal programs for \ndifferent purposes.\n  Prior to--we have to put this in perspective--Ed-Flex, if a local \nschool district had a Federal program and they wanted to use it \ndifferently, they had to go to their respective State capital, kiss the \nring of the superintendent of education, and then that superintendent \nof education would have to go to Washington and do the same thing.\n  So Ed-Flex basically says to those States that want to participate, \nif you put together an overall plan of how you are going to in your own \nState eliminate a lot of excess regulations, if you will put together \nan overall plan on how you intend to take these Federal dollars and use \nthem better to really make a difference for the kids in the classroom, \nwe will allow you the authority that we have in Washington to grant \nthose waivers to the local school districts--in Ohio, 611 of them.\n  One of the really unique things that came about as a result of Ed-\nFlex in our State was that every school district had to prepare eight \nreports to the State department of education for Federal money, and \nthen they would submit eight to the Federal Government. Today, they \nonly provide one report to the State, and the State provides one to the \nDepartment of Education.\n  I think it is important also to point out that Ed-Flex is just the \nbeginning of education reform in the 106th Congress. I would like to \ncongratulate my colleagues on the Republican side and on the Democratic \nside for their willingness to allow Ed-Flex to be the first step in \neducation reform in this session of Congress.\n  We all know that there are different ideas on how we need to reform \neducation. The President has his ideas and some of us have a little \ndifferent idea. You have heard from Senator Bond of Missouri about his \nprogram.\n  Many of us believe that the first thing we ought to do before we \nreauthorize elementary and secondary education is to inventory the 550 \neducation programs that the GAO says we have or the 760 that the \nCongressional Research Service says we have and figure out what we are \ndoing there, get rid of the ones that are not working, consolidate the \nmoney or save it, put it into a block grant, and send it back to the \nStates and local governments so they can do a better job with the money \nwe are making available to them. In other words, be a better partner \nwith State and local government because they have the major \nresponsibility for education in this country.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to see if we can't \ncome up with a program that is really going to make a difference for \nour boys and girls throughout the United States of America.\n  In Ohio, this program has only really been in existence for 2 or 3 \nyears, and there are some who say, why aren't you doing a lot more with \nit?\n  One of the things that needs to be emphasized is that school \ndistricts are interested in moving forward and taking advantage of Ed-\nFlex, but they are being very careful about when they ask for a change \nin the waivers and use the money differently because they want to make \nsure, if they ask for a change in the waiver, in fact they are really \ngoing to make a difference for the kids. They don't want to do this \njust to go through the motions.\n  In our State, we have testing in the fourth, sixth, and ninth grades, \nand we have a tough high school proficiency test. One of the things we \nare trying to do is to bring up the test scores in those first two \ntests, fourth and sixth grade. Through the use of Ed-Flex, we have been \nable to allow a local school district to use the Eisenhower \nprofessional grant money in a different way than is required under the \nFederal statute, and they are taking that money and putting it into \nemphasizing reading and social studies. We have seen, as a result of \nreallocating those resources, a marked improvement in the students' \nperformance on their fourth- and sixth-grade proficiency tests.\n  I would love to see the rest of this country take advantage of this \nEd-Flex Program so that they can do the same thing for their boys and \ngirls. So I strongly urge that we pass this Ed-Flex legislation, as I \nsay, the first phase of our education reform program.\n  I would like to underscore one other thing. One of the most important \nthings the Congress of the United States did was to reform the welfare \nprogram in the United States of America. Prior to that reform, it was \nan entitlement program. We came and we lobbied Congress and said change \nit to a block grant, give us the flexibility so we can make a \ndifference for our customers, the recipients of the welfare program.\n  We have seen a dramatic change in what is happening in our welfare \nprogram. For example, in my State we have 560,000 fewer people on \nwelfare--a 60-percent reduction since 1992--because we have given the \npeople closest to the customer the power and the authority to make a \ndifference in their lives.\n  We never would have had welfare reform in the United States if it had \nnot been for the fact that waivers were granted to the States prior to \nwelfare reform and, as a result of that, Governors were able to show \nthat with flexibility we can really make a difference in people's \nlives.\n  Ed-Flex will give Governors and local school district people that \nauthority to change some of these Federal programs, these one-size-\nfits-all programs, change them and make a difference for our \nyoungsters, and it will be a way we can show America that if you give \npeople closest to the kids, the parents, the teachers in the classroom, \ngive them the power and the authority to take those dollars and utilize \nthem in a way that is really going to make a difference in the lives of \nour children, we will see the most revolutionary change and measured \nimprovement we have seen in this country in terms of our public \neducation system.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to applaud my colleagues who have been in the Chamber speaking \nof education reform, and my colleagues on the Republican side I think \nhave come forward with a very progressive and innovative reform program \nfor education. I know Senator Voinovich from Ohio led the way in \neducation reform in that State.\n  But Ed-Flex, providing those waivers for State educational \nestablishments to be able to avoid the kind of heavy-handed \nbureaucratic mandates that are imposed upon them; the Dollars to the \nClassroom Bill, which I am sponsoring, which would consolidate 31 of \nthose hundreds of education programs and allow new flexibility to State \ngovernments in ensuring that 95 cents of every dollar get to the \nclassroom as opposed to the 65 cents that currently get there; and the \nproposal to increase funding for disabilities programs, mandates that \nwe placed on local schools but have not funded, I think are all very \nimportant ingredients to our education reform package which will truly \nlead to improvement in education in this country.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hutchinson pertaining to the introduction of the \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for not to exceed 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who \nare sponsoring the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 which \nwould afford states important exemptions from burdensome federal \nregulations. Indeed, the bill would expand a 12-state demonstration \nprogram to all 50 states, and would allow for the waiver of statutes \nand regulations that hinder State and local educational improvement \nplans. I thank my colleagues, Senator Frist and Senator Wyden, for \ntheir leadership on this innovative legislation. It is, indeed, a \nlandmark bill that I am confident will improve the performance of our \nNation's public schools by placing the control back where it belongs--\nin the hands of teachers, parents, school board members and the \nadministrators of local school districts.\n  I am delighted to join my colleagues as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, because I am confident that it will improve the academic \nperformance of students in my home State of Maine and in States across \nthe Nation. Our Nation's public school system is the foundation upon \nwhich the American dream is built. Time and time again, we see that \neducation is the difference between poverty and prosperity, ignorance \nand understanding.\n  There is no doubt that America's public schools are in need of a \nboost, but not one that is dictated by the Federal Government in a \n``one size fits all'' approach. Rather, we need a boost for our \nNation's schools; a boost conceived of and built from the bottom up by \nthe people who know best what our students need; namely, educators and \nadministrators at the State and local levels.\n  The Ed-Flex plan does just that by cutting the bureaucratic strings \nthat now entangle Federal education dollars. It would allow local \ncommunities to spend Federal dollars as they think best, as long as \ntheir programs accomplish the objectives of Federal guidelines.\n  In short, the Ed-Flex bill will help our public schools attain and, \nindeed, in many cases exceed Federal standards without resorting to a \n``Washington knows best'' approach.\n  I note, Mr. President, that this approach is totally contrary to that \nproposed by the Clinton administration. The President wants to be the \nNation's principal. He wants to decide everything from promotion \npolicies to curriculum standards. That is not the approach that this \nbill takes. Rather, this bill reflects our philosophy that those who \nare most committed and best able to improve education are found at the \nState and local level--our parents, our school board leaders, our \nprincipals, and our teachers.\n  In Maine, our students rank near the top in many national tests. The \nState Department of Education, the State's elementary and secondary \nschools and the University of Maine have worked diligently to design \nand use challenging statewide learning standards.\n  National test results show that these efforts have been successful. \nEven more important, they demonstrate that a strong K-12 education \nsystem designed and supported by State and local officials, school \nboard members, teachers, and parents can produce first-rate students.\n  And, indeed, I am very proud of the accomplishments of Maine schools.\n  Dozens of schools across the country have participated in the current \nEd-Flex Partnership Program. They have proven that test scores and \nlearning increase most rapidly when guided by locally designed \nprograms, not by Federal ones. We need to expand the Ed-Flex Program so \nthat students in every State can reap these same benefits.\n  Public schools in Maine and across the Nation have made a good-faith \neffort to repair the deteriorated foundation of our system of public \neducation. There is, however, much more that needs to be done. Our \nStates cannot do it alone. They need assistance but not the dictates of \nWashington.\n  The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 directly addresses \nthe need for change within public schools by putting the power to plan, \nbrainstorm, build, and implement back in the hands of State and local \ncommunities. Expanding the opportunity for the Ed-Flex Program will \ngive every State the chance to experiment and innovate and to chart a \npath for better schools. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis very important initiative.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair and welcome the Presiding Officer in \nthat very important position that he has undertaken. We all have had an \nopportunity to do it in our careers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for up to 5 minutes. I take it we \nare in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Breaux pertaining to the introduction of S. 469 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. \nAre we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, and there \nis a grant of 5 minutes per Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Ed-Flex bill we are \ngoing to take up next week, which has been brought to the floor by \nSenators Frist and Wyden and which is an excellent piece of \nlegislation, a commonsense idea. The Ed-Flex bill simply gives freedom \nto the States to assist local school districts in meeting the \nparticular needs of their particular students.\n  As a former Governor, I was very frustrated when I would receive \nFederal funds that were chock full of strings and Federal directions--\nstrings that limited the ability of local school districts to address \nthe educational needs of their students.\n  Had Ed-Flex been an option when I was Governor, schools could have \nchosen whether they would use Federal funds to hire more math teachers \nor instead if they wanted to use them to hire more reading teachers. \nThose choices should have been dependent upon the particular needs of \neach school.\n  They should have been dependent upon the particular needs of the \nstudents. Instead, those choices were being made by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Under the current system, 38 States are prohibited from issuing the \ntype of waivers the Department of Education can issue under the Ed-Flex \nProgram. New Hampshire is one of those States. This means that someone \nat the Department of Education who doesn't even know the name of one \nstudent at, for example, the Rumford Elementary School in Concord, NH, \nhas more authority over whether the Rumford Elementary School principal \nand the Rumford schoolteachers can decide\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nwhether they need math help or reading help for that student than the \nprincipals and the teachers have. It is difficult to fathom that some \nof my colleagues believe that the Federal bureaucrat, however well-\nintentioned, rather than a Concord school district principal or a \nConcord elementary district schoolteacher or a parent is a better judge \nof what a child needs in the Rumford Elementary School than they are.\n  It is hard for me to understand how we can turn to a Federal \nbureaucracy to make decisions about local schools rather than have the \nlocal schools make decisions about how the education should proceed.\n  This philosophy of Federal control over local education is insulting \nto the principals, to the teachers, to the superintendents, to the \nschool board, to the parents. And more importantly, it is \ncounterproductive because it doesn't put the resources where we need \nthem. It doesn't help the student with the needs that that student has \nbeen identified as needing by the local school district, but rather \nwith a set stringent regulated framework which has been determined by a \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  Furthermore, this philosophy of Federal control is unjustified. \nTwelve Ed-Flex States, in the words of Secretary Riley, have used their \nauthority to grant waivers ``judiciously and carefully.'' There is no \ncompelling reason to delay expansion of Ed-Flex authority to all the \nStates. In fact, Secretary Riley, President Clinton--both of whom are \nformer Governors--and the National Governors' Association support \nexpanding Ed-Flex to all 50 States. I congratulate the President and I \ncongratulate Secretary Riley for his support of this initiative.\n  With that said, Ed-Flex is a modest but important first step to \ndriving more flexibility and control to the locals, thereby giving them \nthe schools to improve education. However, it still leaves the bulk of \ndecisionmaking and control regarding Federal education programs in the \nhands of the Department of Education rather than with the States and \nlocal communities. I hope that later on in this year we will address \nthose additional regulations.\n  At this time, we are taking up Ed-Flex. That, at least, is a first \nstep and a positive step. Ed-Flex is a bipartisan, widely supported \nbill with proven effectiveness. We should take this opportunity to \nprovide much needed flexibility to the States.\n  Finally, I take this opportunity to commend Senator Frist and Senator \nWyden for their diligent, bipartisan effort to expand Ed-Flex to all 50 \nStates. They led the fight last year to ensure that all States benefit \nfrom the increased flexibility and innovation that Ed-Flex provides. I \nthank them for their efforts to bring Ed-Flex again to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I believe the very fact that Ed-Flex will be considered on the Senate \nfloor next week sends a clear signal to the American public that the \ntop priority of this Senate is education and educational programs that \nare sensitive to the needs of the parents, the students, and the local \nschools. Ed-Flex is proof positive that the Senate is prepared to hit \nthe ground running and promote proven educational reform measures such \nas the expansion of the Ed-Flex Program. I hope that in a strong, \nbipartisan manner we can work together to pass Ed-Flex and give the \nGovernors, the local schools, the parents, teachers, and the principals \nthis much needed tool which will free them from much unneeded Federal \nregulation.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry? How are \nwe operating at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DROOZ: ``THE RABBI SPEAKS''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with great honor, yet immense sadness \nthat I stand today to pay tribute to a man--Rabbi Herbert Drooz--whose \nspirit, vision, and voice will live on for generations to come in my \nState of Delaware.\n  As a respected religious leader and social activist for 30 years, he \nwas a builder--literally and figuratively--who dreamed big and made big \nthings happen.\n  When I got back to Delaware from law school--I went out of State, we \ndidn't have a law school in the State at the time, in 1968--Rabbi Drooz \nwas one of the first civic activists that I came in contact with. He \noversaw the building of a new synagogue for the reform congregation of \nBeth Emeth, that he led, which is now the largest synagogue in \nDelaware, along with the construction of the school on Lea Boulevard, \nnot far from where I had gone to school in Wilmington, Delaware. These \ntwo buildings stand as not only monuments to his vision and his \ndedication to religious service, but they also had the very practical \nimpact of enhancing the region and the neighborhood, and causing people \nto invest not only physically and financially, but psychologically in \nour city.\n  He built a community esprit de corps as well--founding the Delaware \nChapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, which \nrecently was renamed the National Conference for Community and Justice, \nwhich is one of the most significant civic organizations and moral \nbarometers in my State. At the University of Delaware, my alma mater, \nhe organized the popular student Hillel group. When I was a student at \nthe University of Delaware in 1961 to 1965, it had a very small Jewish \nstudent body. It now has a vigorous, engaged and involved Jewish \nstudent body, and the Hillel group at the University is, again, a major \nforce for justice, focusing on the moral dilemmas of our time.\n  What most Delawareans remember about Rabbi Drooz was his voice. He \nwas known as the Rabbi who speaks. Every Sunday morning, you could turn \non WDEL radio station, one of the largest radio stations in my State, \nand hear his words of wisdom and compassion, on a program that was \ntitled, ``The Rabbi Speaks.''\n  He spoke to and reached out to more than Delaware's proud Jewish \ncommunity. He was one of the first people who went the extra mile to \nreach out to the non-Jewish community.\n  He spoke during times of social unrest in my State. He spoke about \nmore than religious issues. In 1954, he used his leadership and \noratorical skills to speak out forcefully against the racist hatred \nexhibited by a militant in the southern part of my State, in a city \ncalled Milford, who tried to defy the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \nBrown v. the Board of Education, to end racial segregation in our \npublic schools. It may come as a surprise to many, but to my great \nshame, my great State has the blot upon its history that we were \nsegregated by law, and in 1954 it was not particularly popular to speak \nout on that issue.\n  His words from the Beth Emeth pulpit still ring out.\n  He questioned, quote:\n\n       Why no leader has risen from among the citizens of Milford \n     to combat this merchant of hate from another. We have been \n     tardy. Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal \n     treacherously, brother against brother?\n\n  The Rabbi speaks, indeed. He spoke, and he spoke at a time when few \nwere willing to speak.\n  In 1966, he joined with bishops from the local Catholic and Episcopal \ndioceses in leading the Methodists and Presbyterians in opposing \nAmerican involvement in the war in Vietnam--not very popular at the \ntime and not always popular among his congregation.\n  Rabbi Drooz led the Rabbinical Association of Delaware for two terms \nas President. He spoke out as a board member on the board of the Fair \nHousing Council, Pacem In Terris, the American Red Cross, the Mental \nHealth Association, and Delaware's Urban Coalition.\n  Everything that mattered, every issue that required some moral \nbearing, every issue that people tended to shy away from because they \nwere controversial, Rabbi Drooz spoke out.\n  A point of personal privilege, Mr. President. You know as a former \nGovernor and a former mayor and a Senator now, occasionally things get \nsaid about us that are totally untrue. We never fail to forget those \nvoices in the community who have significant standing, who are willing \nto risk their reputations to speak out for us.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n  Rabbi Drooz spoke out for Joe Biden, too. He spoke out for me at a \ntime that could have stopped me in my tracks from winning the election \nin 1972.\n  Please allow me this point of personal privilege to tell this brief \nstory. Just days before that election, I was falsely accused of being \nanti-Semitic in an unfounded charge by a disgruntled, former campaign \nworker. I was 29 years old. Hardly anybody knew me. Those who knew me \nknew, and my record as a Senator has demonstrated, I am far from an \nanti-Semite. As a matter of fact, I am accused these days by my \nopponents of being the other way.\n  At the time, as a 29-year-old guy from a family with no influence or \nmoney running for the U.S. Senate in a year when George McGovern was \nbeing trounced in my State. I was accused in this sort of Pearl Harbor \nsneak attack the weekend before the Tuesday of being an anti-Semite, \nand it was printed in our largest paper.\n  Rabbi Drooz immediately went into action on the Sunday prior to the \nelection. Rabbi Drooz organized a meeting of Delaware's Jewish \ncommunity, enlisting the support of the very influential Governor of \nPennsylvania who happened to be Jewish, Milton Shapp. Rabbi Drooz spoke \nout for Joe Biden and supported me against this untrue, unfair \naccusation. Needless to say, he was effective in setting the record \nstraight, or I would not be standing here today. The mere fact that \nRabbi Drooz said, ``I know Joe Biden,'' was good enough for the entire \ncommunity in my State.\n  I will forever hold Rabbi Drooz in the highest esteem for his \ncourage, his leadership, his boldness and for getting me back on my \nfeet at a time when I needed his courage, leadership and boldness the \nmost.\n  After I became a Senator, on a regular basis I would brief Rabbi \nDrooz on the situation in the Middle East. He would put together people \nfor me to speak to. Seldom did we disagree, but when we did, there was \nno question about my independence, and he never questioned whether or \nnot I should be.\n  Rabbi Drooz was a fighter to the end. Alzheimer's stole his mind, but \nnot his spirit. Just six months before he died, as an octogenarian, he \nagreed to participate in a study for Alzheimer's to test new \nmedication.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I point out that I truly believe his \nspirit lives on in his son Daniel and his daughter Johanna, his brother \nArnold and his six grandchildren. They are respected in the community \nand continue to participate in the community.\n  I say goodbye to Rabbi Drooz. Shalom and peace be with you, my \nfriend, and may all that you did for the good of Delaware be \nremembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized under \nthe previous order for 1 hour.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1989-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1990-S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUCATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of this 1 hour I will be \nyielding to other Members on this side of the aisle. We will be \ndiscussing a range of topics, primarily focusing on questions of \neducation.\n  Let me say at the outset, Mr. President, last week I journeyed back \nto my home State of Illinois--a welcome interlude from our impeachment \nproceedings--to address issues which I consider to be very critical to \nthe future not only of my State but this Nation. In the span of 4 days \nI visited a variety of communities and had nine different meetings with \neducators, teachers, administrators, students, parents, and interested \npeople in the community to talk about the state of education. It was an \neye-opener.\n  As we started to discuss education from a brand-new perspective, to \nthrow out some of the assumptions and some of the rules, to take a look \nat education today, I found that there were three basic fallacies in \neducational thinking today which these educators understood and many in \nCongress do not. The first fallacy is the belief that children start to \nlearn at age 6, and therefore, we have a social responsibility to put \nchildren in school at age 6.\n  Any parent will tell you, and certainly those who study the issue can \nconfirm it, children start learning at a much earlier age. Teacher \nafter teacher told me of students who showed up in kindergarten already \nfar behind where they should be--students who had fallen behind because \nof family problems or the lack of family initiative or the lack of \nexposure to an educating environment. Of course, it took the teachers a \nlong time to bring these kids up to speed. They challenged the premise, \nthe assumption, that education starts at the age of 6.\n  When I asked my staff, incidentally, to research why we put kids in \nschool at age 6, they couldn't find a reason. We looked at history. We \nasked the experts. They couldn't come up with a reason. The best we \ncame up with is most kids can sit still at age 6, and in the old days \nthat is what a classroom was all about--kids sitting still at their \ndesks. It is not the modern threshold and should not be the threshold \neducation of decision.\n  The second notion we challenged is the premise of the schoolday. Why \non God's green Earth are students dismissed from school at 3 in the \nafternoon? Why? There was a day, of course, when they would go home to \na parent or their parents, but the days of Ozzie and Harriet with \ncookies and milk waiting for the kids, I am afraid, are long gone. Most \nkids have no adult supervision. I am not surprised to find reports from \nthose who know that kids, between the hours of 3 o'clock and the \narrival of an adult for supervision at, say, 6 o'clock, are the kids \nmost prone to get in trouble--kids who are involved in scrapes with the \nlaw, exposure to drugs, gang activity, teen pregnancy. These things are \nhappening during unsupervised hours.\n  That is why when we discussed in our proposals on Capitol Hill \nafterschool programs, it is in the best interest of all of these \nchildren--those who are coming out of school who need remedial help, as \nwell as those who are doing well in school and need enrichment.\n  The final point that came through loud and clear is that summer \nmonths with 3 months of vacation is something that we all look forward \nto as kids, but it doesn't make as much sense anymore. There was a time \nwhen kids needed the summer months off to go work on the farm. Not many \nkids do that anymore. Frankly, kids need an opportunity to do something \nconstructive, positive, and supervised during the summer months, as \nwell.\n  I am happy the democratic proposal on education addresses these three \nissues and addresses many others. At this point, I will yield to \nseveral of my colleagues who have joined me on the floor.\n  I see my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. I am happy you \nhave joined in this discussion. I yield to the Senator as much time as \nshe needs to express her thoughts on this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my colleague if he would engage in a colloquy. I \ndon't have a speech, but I was so moved by what the Senator just \ndescribed as what we need to do.\n  Oftentimes I wonder if the Senator would agree that what we see \nhappening here with the leadership on the Republican side is that they \nknow that education is a key issue and they bring before the Senate \nthese very narrow bills. For example, last time we had a bill that \nwould have given a benefit of about $7 a year, allowing some children \nto get $7 more to go to a private school. We were arguing that we \nneeded a broader vision.\n  I say to my friend, does he not see this in somewhat the same \nfashion? We have a narrow bill when, as the Senator says, we need to \nlook at afterschool, we need to look at more teachers, see that the \nclassrooms are smaller; we need to look at what is happening to kids \nwhen they need mentoring. We have to look at what kind of classrooms \nthey are in. And my colleague misses Senator Moseley-Braun, who worked \nso hard on school construction. I wanted to ask my friend if he saw a \npattern here developing where certain folks take a poll and they see \nthere is an important issue, and they come back with a very narrow \nanswer when what we need is a broader vision for the next century.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from California. There is no \ndoubt that the funding for education is primarily State and local. The \nresponsibility follows the funding. But we are remiss at the Federal \nlevel if we don't realize we have an important role here. As I have \ntraveled around and have spoken to school administrators, the\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nsource of the funding was secondary. They were talking about solving \nproblems and what to do with those problems.\n  I see that we have been joined by the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Murray, who was a teacher in the classroom before she came to \nthe Senate. I welcome her to join us in this colloquy. She knows, as \nwell, that there are practical problems. When the administration starts \ntalking about technology in schools, they are sometimes heartened by \nthe fact that they have the new computers, but they quickly add, \n``Senator, don't forget, we have to bring the teachers up to speed \nnow.'' Many teachers my age, as decrepit as I am, and even older, are \ntrying to become well versed in technology in order to keep up with the \nstudents. If the kids don't get the technology and the teachers don't \nget the training to give it to them, then we are all going to be \nlosers. I agree, that is a central part of this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to finish quickly because I \nwant to give the Senator from Washington the floor.\n  When I think about kids and schools, I think about Senator Murray \nbecause of her hands-on experience. But I can tell you that as a \nparent--now a grandparent--decrepit as you are, I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and even a little more, in my younger days, I \nvolunteered to work in the auxiliary, going down to schools in San \nFrancisco where they needed volunteers, and this whole issue of keeping \nthe kids busy after school is an education issue and it is a crime \nissue. A lot of people hear say they are tough on law and order. What \nbetter way than to give our children something to say yes to?\n  The FBI tells us that between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock are the hours \nkids get into trouble, when juvenile crime peaks. You don't need a \ndegree in criminology and psychology to know that this makes sense. The \nPresident has a tremendous expansion of ``after school'' in his budget. \nWe need to talk about that when we get this Ed-Flex bill before us. \nKids should not be going into classrooms where they can't read because \nit is so musty. I have been in those rooms. I had to run out of one \nparticular classroom in Sacramento, which was so musty because there \nwere leaks that hadn't been fixed; it was a disaster. To think that our \nchildren are in that atmosphere--that is not right.\n  After school children need to be kept busy, and during school they \nneed small class sizes. We know what we have to do when we get a little \nbill that is very narrow here. And it may make some people feel happy \nthat they are doing something. But I think it is our obligation--those \nof us on both sides of the aisle who care about our children--to point \nout that just passing a bill that has the title ``education'' in it \ndoesn't mean that we are really doing right by our kids. It is just a \nsham. I am very proud to be here with my colleagues, and I am very much \nlooking forward to this debate on the Ed-Flex bill, to make it a bill \nthat really meets the needs of our young people.\n  I yield back to my friend, Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. I notice that the \nSenator from Nevada is on the floor, and I know he wants to address \nsome education issues. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nNevada, Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I want to express my \nappreciation to the senior Senator from Illinois for arranging this \nopportunity for us to talk about education.\n  Mr. President, what I want to talk about today is an amendment that \nSenator Bingaman from New Mexico and I are going to offer on the Ed-\nFlex bill. Senator Bingaman and I offered this amendment, which passed \nthe Senate last year. The problem has gotten no less complicated and no \nless important. Every day in America 3,000 children drop out of high \nschool; that is 500,000 a year. This is something about which this \ncountry should be embarrassed. ``So what,'' some say. Well, each child \nwho drops out of high school is less than they could be.\n  It also complicates societal matters by increasing the cost of \nwelfare and the criminal justice system. It even complicates increasing \ncosts in our educational system.\n  If you look at the people in prison, 82 percent of the people in \nprison are high school dropouts. I repeat, 82 percent of the people in \nour prisons are high school dropouts. That should say it all.\n  We need to be concerned about high school dropouts. We know \nstatistically without any question that the children of dropouts have a \nmuch higher dropout rate than those who finish high school.\n  The median income of college graduates is more than three times that \nof high school dropouts. The probability of falling into poverty is \nthree times higher for high school dropouts than those who had finished \nhigh school. Unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than \ntwice those of high school graduates.\n  The statistics are replete with evidence that we should do something \nabout this. What should be done? There are a number of things that we \ncan do.\n  But the legislation that has been offered by Senator Bingaman and I, \nwhich will be an amendment to the legislation that will be before this \nbody next week, would establish a department within our Department of \nEducation whose sole function, sole responsibility, would be to focus \non high school dropouts.\n  There are programs around the country that some of the school \ndistricts have adopted mostly on a very small basis that work, and work \nquite well. We want someone to be gathering information to find out \nwhich of these programs work and which programs don't work.\n  We would provide $30 million a year for this program, and a total of \n$150 million.\n  Think of the money it costs us to keep people in prison. Is it \n$20,000 a year? Is it $30,000 a year. It is a huge amount of money to \nkeep somebody in prison. Remember, Mr. President, that 82 percent of \nthe people in prison are high school dropouts.\n  Our legislation would establish within middle and high schools around \nthe country--those that have high dropout rates--an ability to compete \nfor grants that would enable them to implement proven and widely \nreplicated models of comprehensive reform.\n  The State of Nevada, I am not proud to say, leads the Nation in high \nschool dropouts. I wish we didn't, but we do. We worked on a number of \nprograms, one of which I am sure will be, if this legislation passes, \none of the model programs. It is a program in Carson City, NV, our \ncapital, where Hispanics are in a program called Ola, Carson City. It \nis a program where these young Hispanic students have a little TV \nstation. They do TV programs. It has kept scores of these young people \noccupied and in high school. They are proud of the fact that they are \ngoing to be high school graduates. This is a program that has been \ngoing for 6 years.\n  Mr. President, I don't know of anything that we could do that would \nbe more important in the education field than keeping our young people \nin school; in high school. There are 3,000 dropouts a day; 500,000 a \nyear.\n  I hope that as we proceed through this debate, we will understand \nthat the problems are not the same with every ethnic group.\n  For example, in the State of Nevada, 25 percent of the students--\nactually more than 25 percent of the students--in our Clark County \nschool district, Metropolitan Las Vegas area, are Hispanic children. I \nam sorry to report that the Hispanic children have a dropout rate that \nis about 20 percent higher than any other ethnic group. Some ask why. \nThere are a number of reasons. Most of the Hispanic students in Nevada \ncome from Mexico. Mexico doesn't have a tradition of public education. \nThere are at times language problems. And also one of the problems is \nHispanics have such a great work ethic. They are willing to work as \nyoung kids, and they perform so well that their employers really do not \nin any way inspire these young people to complete high school. As a \nresult of that, they are doing the same thing when they are 55 years \nold that they are doing when they are 16 or 17 years old.\n\n  We need to recognize that within a few years. In fact, by the year \n2030, in America, Hispanics will make up 20 percent or more of our \npopulation. The Hispanic leaders in this country know\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nthat the most important thing for them is educating their youth. We \nhave to participate so that we join with the Hispanic leaders in this \ncountry to keep Hispanic youth in high school.\n  I hope that we all realize that this legislation, the Ed-Flex bill, \nis something that gives us a vehicle to focus on education.\n  I heard the Senator from Illinois talk about the fact that we no \nlonger are an agrarian society. Why should kids be out of school 3 \nmonths out of the year in the summertime? Should we have year-round \nschool? That is a debate that should take place.\n  I remember when I went to the State legislature almost 30 years ago I \ntalked about year-round schools. People laughed at me at the time. But \nnow in Nevada we have year-round schools in a number of places, mainly \nbecause of the population growing so large they can't build the schools \nfast enough. And now we have year-round schools.\n  In short, Senator Bingaman and I are going to do everything we can to \nsee that this legislation passes.\n  I, again, express my appreciation to the Senator from Illinois for \nallowing me to come and speak on this very important issue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I also say, before yielding, as the Senator from \nIllinois has already pointed out, that it is tremendous to have someone \nwho has been in the classroom teaching children. We talk about it from \nan outside perspective, but the Senator from Washington has been in \neffect in the trenches.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I wanted to ask a question and share a story with him, because I \nthink what we are talking about in terms of the dropout prevention is \nso important today.\n  I am sure the question that the Senator from Nevada hears so often, \nand the Senator from Illinois hears so often in these debates today is, \nWhat role does the Federal Government have in this? Should this be a \nlocal decision? Should we just hand the dollars down to our local \ndistricts?\n  What I want to share with you is that I met with a number of students \nlast week in Washington State who had fallen through the cracks. I come \nfrom a State where the constitution says it is the paramount duty of \nthe State to provide funding for education, and we do a good job. But \nwe are struggling like everyone else with our budgets at home. This \nschool happened to be in a district that has well-founded schools. This \nwas a young student who had fallen through every single crack and \ndropped out of school. What brought him back was the Federally funded \nSchool-to-Work Program. When I asked the student if the Federal \nGovernment had a role, he said, ``Absolutely yes. You need to be there \nwhen everybody else fails.''\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Nevada has heard that as well.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Washington, without question, the \nanswer is yes. There are programs that work. I would also say that the \nFederal Government has to identify national problems in all areas. \nEducation is an area where we have to identify national problems. I \nbelieve that if there was ever a problem that this country has, it \ndeals with high school dropouts.\n  I repeat. There are 3,000 children a day dropping out of school. Can \nyou imagine how much better society would be if we could keep only 500 \nof those children in school so that we only--and I emphasis ``only''--\nhad 2,500 children dropping out of high school a day.\n  I have heard every day the constant refrain that the Federal \nGovernment has no business dealing with local education.\n  The program that Senator Bingaman and I are sponsoring is a program \nthat gives local school districts absolute control. We are not telling \nthem what to do. All we are saying is we are going to be a resource for \nyou. Washington, DC, is going to be a resource. We have all of these \nprograms that we have analyzed and evaluated. Here is how they work. If \nyou have a problem in your school with a dropout, make an application \nand we will give you a grant and we will extend the money to the local \nschool districts. They can implement the program, if they think it will \nhelp their kids.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Nevada will yield, I \nthink it is interesting to step back for a second and look at what \nCongress does. We believe that because there is a problem of crime in \nAmerica, we should Federalize a lot of crimes. Even the Chief Justice \nof the United States recently noted that if we continue this trend of \nFederalizing crime, we are going to dramatically change law enforcement \nin the United States. The enforcement of laws involving crime used to \nbe a State and local responsibility. But because of our interest on \nCapitol Hill in crime, we continue to Federalize more and more crime. \nYet, when it comes to prevention programs such as the one suggested by \nthe Senator from Nevada, many people argue, ``Keep your hands off.'' If \nyou want to prevent crime, it has to be done at the State and local \nbasis.\n  I hope we can find a balance here.\n  As I traveled around Illinois, I found some extraordinary ideas \ncoming out of local school districts about afterschool programs, \nbringing kids up to the reading levels in school, remedial activities, \nand the like. I want to express that.\n  I notice the Senator from Nevada was careful to say that he wanted to \nsee this local creativity, that we were not going to send down a \nFederal rule book, a manual of instruction. We are looking for results. \nWe want accountability. I think if we take that approach, we can build \nFederal programs that are welcomed at the local level, and not \nrejected.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, I keep throwing these \nstatistics out because to me they are overwhelming. They are \nmindboggling. I didn't take a lot of mathematics courses in high school \nor college. But I don't have to be a mathematician to understand that \n82 percent of people who are in prison who are not high school \ngraduates, that there is some reason people who do not graduate from \nhigh school are more likely to go to prison. We have to recognize if we \ncan keep kids in high school, we are going to keep them out of prison. \nI don't know how much more we need to talk about prevention. That is \none of the biggest prevention programs. We don't need to build youth \ncenters, although that is a help. We don't have to come up with new \ninventions every day to keep kids in school to realize that if we keep \nthem in school we keep them out of prison.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I \nthank the Senator from Nevada for his work on this extremely important \nissue and wish him well as he offers this amendment next week on this \nimportant bill. I thank my colleagues for allowing us today to talk \nabout issues that are really going to make a difference in our \nclassrooms across the country.\n  Mr. President, across this country families are having conversations \nat their breakfast tables about how we can improve education. They are \ntalking about reducing class size. They are talking about afterschool \nprograms. They are talking about dropout prevention. They are talking \nabout teacher training, because parents know that is what is going to \nmake a difference for their own child, for their family, for their \nneighborhood, and for their community. That is the type of conversation \nwe need to be having on this floor in this Senate in this Congress, as \nwell. I am delighted that we are finally going to have the opportunity \nto do that.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that one of the first bills that is going \nto be considered is S. 280, which is the Ed-Flex bill. It is a bill \nthat will help States develop new and innovative programs, and it is an \nimportant issue and one that I am glad we are going to address and that \nI am happy to support.\n  I think it is really important to note that merely improving the \nprocess is not enough. We also have to make an immediate and a direct \nimpact on the overcrowded classrooms that our children across this \ncountry find themselves in every single day in this country.\n  That is why I am going to be introducing an amendment that will \nauthorize a 6-year effort to continue to help local school districts \nhire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers nationally to begin to reduce \nclass size in first through third grade where it will have the most \nimpact.\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n  My amendment builds on the bipartisan success of last year's \nagreement. It is based on local control and flexibility, and it focuses \non improving teacher quality, which is so important. Local school \ndistricts will make all the decisions about hiring and training their \nnew teachers. Any school district that has already reduced class size \nin those early grades to 18 or fewer students will be able to use the \nfunds to either further reduce class size in the early grades or to \nreduce class size in other grades or carry out activities to help \nimprove teacher quality.\n  My amendment will also provide accountability and ensure that schools \ncommunicate with parents which is so essential today. These funds are \nsupplementary, and they cannot replace current spending on teachers or \nteachers' salaries. School districts will be required to send a report \ncard in easily understood language to their local community including \ninformation about how achievement has improved as a result of reducing \nclass size, and they won't have to fill out any new forms. Reducing red \ntape and improving local decisionmaking in education programs is a \nbipartisan effort, and both Ed-Flex and my class size reduction \namendment accomplish both.\n  Last year's bipartisan agreement that we reached included my \nlegislation to provide $1.2 billion as a downpayment on the goal of \nhiring 100,000 new teachers, and it did it without requiring any new \nreports or any new forms. Governors and legislators across this country \nare now responding to our budget agreement last year and addressing \nthis at their local levels. Local school districts are putting together \ntheir budgets right now as we speak and teachers are writing their \nlesson plans for next year with the expectation that we will deliver on \nthe promise that we made to them last year. They are all counting on \nus. We must take this opportunity to now fulfill our commitment to \nreduce class size.\n  Mr. President, smaller classes mean a better education for children. \nStudies have shown it. Teachers know it. Parents know it. And they know \nit from experience. I have seen it with my own eyes. Controlling a room \nof 30 children is not teaching. It's crowd control. We need to return \nto teaching.\n  Just yesterday, I heard from Christi Rennebohn-Franz, who is a first \nand second grade teacher in Pullman, WA, and she wrote and told me that \n``without small class sizes, we cannot reach all children and give them \nthe time that they deserve. If you have too many students in your \nclass, you go home every day knowing that you came up short giving them \nthe attention they need.''\n  Another teacher from Fircrest, WA, wrote to me to say that ``since I \nteach at an at-risk school, lower class size means that I can more \neffectively work with students on a variety of problems they bring to \nmy classroom every day.''\n  Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle to ensure that we meet our promise to these \nteachers and all the other parents and students across America to \nreduce class size and truly make a difference in the education of our \nchildren and our country's future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1990-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada said earlier, \nmany of us have theories on education as parents who watched our kids \ngo through school and met with teachers and administrators. The Senator \nfrom Washington has spent enough time in classrooms to teach all of us, \nand I think her suggestions are very valuable suggestions.\n  What I have found as I have traveled around my state, and I think \nother Senators have as well, is that the basics of what they need in \neducation and a helping hand can make such a difference.\n  When we talked about after school programs in school district after \nschool district, they said, Senator, can you help us with transporting \nthe kids safely from a school to an after school program and back home \nagain?\n  A practical concern that stops them from doing things that are so \nimportant. And I think there are ways we can help here. Yesterday, we \npassed an important bill about military salaries. We decided to put $11 \nbillion more in the bill than the President's budget requested, and \nmany of us raised questions about where that figure came from, why \nthere had been no hearings on it. And they said, of course, we want to \nhelp the military. We all do. But it really raises the question, if we \nwere to come up with $11- or $12-billion today for education for after-\nschool programs, I am afraid there would be a firestorm of opposition. \nPeople would say, wait a minute, you didn't have a hearing; it's too \nmuch of an undertaking by the Federal Government. I really hope that we \ncan get this priority right.\n  People across America identify education as the No. 1 concern. I \nthink it's because of their personal experience and also the \nrealization that opportunity in this country comes with achievement, \nachievement in school is really I guess the best way to get started on \na good life in America and many other places.\n  I am happy today to join with the Senator from Washington to discuss \nthis. Isn't it interesting, President Clinton's suggested 100,000 more \nteachers to reduce classroom size. My Republican Governor in Illinois, \nin the State of the State message, George Ryan, suggested 10,000 new \nteachers for our State. The reaction from local school districts? \n``Where are we going to put them? We need classrooms. You can't just \ngive us more teachers and expect smaller classroom sizes without new \nclassrooms.''\n  That is why the President's proposal to help school districts \nmodernize their schools, expand their schools, build new schools is \nreally a timely suggestion. The GAO report a few years ago said that we \nneed 6,000 new schools in America by the year 2006. One-third of all \nschools in America, serving 14 million kids, need extensive repair and \nreplacement. So I think we understand that the President's proposal for \nteachers and classrooms is the only sensible way to have class room \nsize reduction in a way that will be handled effectively.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Illinois yield on that point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois brought up an \nextremely important point, and that is that hiring new teachers is one \npart, hiring well trained teachers is the second part, and providing \nclassrooms for them clearly is a critical part. That is one of the \nreasons why in my amendment we make sure that it is very flexible \nlanguage, so that local school districts that do have a school \nconstruction, a very real school construction crunch can use those \ndollars in a very flexible way so the teachers can work jointly in \nclassrooms, that it isn't just one teacher per classroom, that we can \ndo some local ways of providing extra one-on-one help with youngsters \nwho need it the most.\n\n  We also must address the school construction problem. It is a real \nchallenge to crumbling schools that exist across our country where our \nkids are in unsafe classrooms, where they are crowded simply because \nthere is no space to put them. It is an area we have to address, and I \nam delighted the Senator from Illinois recognizes that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. I have noted this on \nthe Senate floor before, but it struck me that at the turn of the last \ncentury one of the most amazing things that happened in America was \nthat between the years 1890 and 1920 we built in America on average one \nnew high school every day. We started our new century with a dedication \nto public education. We Democratized education unlike any country in \nthe world. And we said, whether you are rich or poor, you are going to \nhave a chance to go to high school.\n  That wasn't a Federal mandate. That sprung up from local communities \nthat said, if we are going to build a community in Washington or \nIllinois, and it is going to be a real community, we are\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\ngoing to have a real high school, we are going to hire teachers, and we \nwill have all the kids go to school.\n  Look at the benefits we have reaped as a nation because of that kind \nof forward thinking, that kind of vision that said in 20th century \nAmerica will be different, our commitment to education will be \ndifferent. And look what we have seen as a result of it. We have gone \nfrom the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk to a space program; we have gone \nfrom Henry Ford's tin lizys* moving across that assembly line to the \npoint where we have the most modern computer chip factories in the \nworld here in the United States.\n  I don't think it is a coincidence. I think what happened here is the \nfact that we dedicated ourselves to improving our work force and \nelevating the intelligence and training and skills of Americans. And \nlook at the benefits we reaped. We had an American century in the 20th \ncentury. Will we have an American century in the 21st? If we take a \nview that it is a hands-off subject and we can't talk about that in \nWashington and the people at the local level can't raise the money we \nare missing another opportunity.\n  But to bring in talented teachers to have smaller classroom sizes, to \nhave more modern classrooms, has to be an investment of the 21st \ncentury to continue what has become the American way of doing things. I \nwant to salute not only Senator Murray and Senator Reid by those who \nhave joined us in supporting the President's program. I think it is a \nprogram that is balanced, a program that takes a portion of this \nsurplus, a surplus we worked hard to put together, and says we are \ngoing to put that portion into education. It's an investment that will \npay off in generations to come. At this point I don't know that any \nother Senators are seeking time on the issue of education, and, Mr. \nPresident, I would reserve the remainder of my time or yield perhaps to \nthe Senator from Florida if he would like to speak on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1993-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, on the heels of passing a much-needed pay \nand benefits increase for the men and women who give up their freedom \nto serve us in our armed services, I want to direct my colleagues' \nattention to one longstanding military mission these men and women have \nbeen assigned. That is the mission of containing the threat of Saddam \nHussein in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I do this for a couple of reasons. First is that I \nhave argued for a stronger military operation in Iraq. Indeed, I have \nargued to change the objective from containment to replacement. And \noftentimes people come back and say, well, if we do that, we will risk \nlives.\n  I would like to describe to my colleagues--in fact, we have a \nmilitary operation going on today, have had since 1991; and this \nmilitary operation is costing us dearly both in lives and in money.\n  Mr. President, last Tuesday I had the opportunity to give a speech to \nthe cadets at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and they asked \nme to speak on patriotism, for which I was only too anxious to oblige.\n  I talked to them about something that I think is causing the decline \nin enrollment--in addition to the inadequate pay and retirement \nbenefits--and that is that Americans are less willing to volunteer for \nservice in our Armed Forces as a consequence, in my judgment, of our \nnot doing enough to tell them --especially our younger citizens--the \nstories of heroism which are being written every single day by the \nbrave men and women who wear the uniform of one of our services. \nInstead of role models of people who have given themselves to a higher \ncause, Mr. President, unfortunately our young people are being told an \nincreasing number of stories, especially on television, of self-\ngratification and indulgency. It is no wonder as a consequence that a \npatriotic decision to serve seems like a nonmainstream choice.\n\n  Before I gave my speech at the Academy, the superintendent warned me \nI needed to remember how young my audience was. ``Half your audience,'' \nhe said, ``wasn't even 10 years of age when Saddam Hussein invaded \nKuwait in 1990.'' Mr. President, I must tell you that gave me some \npause because that seemed like yesterday that happened, but, in fact, a \ngreat deal of time has expired since then.\n  For me, the statement was more than just a reminder to be careful \nwhat language I used when talking to these young people, but also a \nwakeup call not to take for granted the military mission that we have \nin place in Iraq today. It is a dangerous military operation. It is a \nmilitary operation that costs us a great deal of money, and I hazard a \nguess that most of us who have looked at the objective of containing \nSaddam Hussein would say that the mission is dangerously close to \nunraveling.\n  This military strategy began in August 1990 when Saddam Hussein \ninvaded Kuwait. In response to this active aggression, the United \nStates, under President Bush's leadership, assembled and led an \ninternational coalition of forces against Iraq. It was a costly war, \nboth in terms of our financial commitment but also in terms of the \nhuman cost to the more than 540,000 men and women in our military \nforces deployed to the Persian Gulf. Sixty billion dollars was spent \nprosecuting the war, but this does not compare to the price paid by 389 \nAmerican families who lost loved ones in Operation Desert Storm.\n  At the end of the war, most Americans assumed our military commitment \nto Iraq would come to an end. After all, the war had been fought. We \nhad been victorious. Saddam Hussein had sued for peace. It was time to \nbring home the troops. But almost from the beginning, Saddam Hussein \nrefused to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreements his \ngovernment had signed. From violating the no-fly zones to obstructing \nthe work of weapons inspectors to provoking troop deployments, Iraq's \ncontinual challenges and our policy of containment forced us to \nmaintain a very strong military presence in the region. With each \ncrisis generated by the Iraqi regime, the United States and our allies \nresponded to the deployment of more troops and at times with the use of \nmilitary force. While it is difficult to quantify the monetary cost of \nthe numerous redeployments and military confrontations that have taken \nplace with Iraq over the last 8 years, it is even more difficult to \nquantify the effect these deployments have had on our troops. How many \nfamilies have had to be separated for months at a time? What has been \nthe cost in morale for troops deployed to the Desert?\n  We must also examine the broader costs of our military strategy in \nIraq. The continual need for large numbers of American troops in Saudi \nArabia has created a strong sense of resentment throughout the Arab \nworld, and it has also increased the danger of terrorist acts against \nAmericans.\n  Again, I have urged a different military strategy with a different \nobjective\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nin the past. The reason I bring this story to the floor, Mr. President, \nis oftentimes people will say, ``Americans don't want to risk the lives \nof our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in a military operation.'' \nIn 1996, 19 Americans were killed in the Khobar Towers bombing and they \ndied as a result of the anger directed at the American military \npresence in the gulf. Indeed, the terrorist bombings of U.S. Embassies \nin Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, in which 12 Americans were \nkilled, were directed by Osama bin Laden, a man who had been stripped \nof his Saudi citizenship for financing Islamic militants in Algeria, \nEgypt, and Saudi Arabia. Today, bin Laden remains at large and remains \na significant threat not just to people of the world but especially to \nAmerican citizens around the world. The reason he is a threat and the \nreason he has killed not just Americans but Kenyans is we are deploying \na military operation in Saudi Arabia. It is our presence that he \nobjects to. It is our presence and our military strategy that is being \nmet with his terrorist activities.\n  Again, I raise these points because I think we have a tendency to \nforget the price that we paid for our policy in Iraq. We forget the \nprice that we are paying today for our policy in Iraq. This policy has \nbeen described as containment. It has been expensive and, in my \njudgment, it has failed. Recent events may indicate that there is a \nlight at the end of the tunnel. The Iraqi people may be closer to their \nfreedom than at any time in years. America must be prepared for sudden \nchange in that country.\n  The Iraqi people are suffering. The Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein is \namong the most brutal and repressive in the world. Americans can be \nproud of the leading role we are playing in confronting this \ndictatorship. Last fall President Clinton and Congress took a big step \ntowards delegitimizing Saddam by passing and signing the Iraqi \nLiberation Act. The world was placed on notice that America wanted to \nsee Saddam's dictatorship gone and would work with democratic \nopposition groups to attain that goal.\n  The administration and our British allies took another big step in \nDecember with the Desert Fox airstrikes. By attacking the underpinnings \nof Saddam's power, the Special Republican Guards and the intelligence \nservices, Operation Desert Fox reduced Saddam's ability to terrorize \nhis people and showed Iraqis we and our allies were truly opposed to \nSaddam in a way previous air campaigns had not done.\n\n  Saddam responded to Desert Fox by undertaking regular violations of \nthe northern and southern no-fly zones, trying to entice allied \naircraft into air defense missile ambushes. The allied counter has been \nhighly effective. Rather than simply chasing retreating Iraqi aircraft, \nUnited States and allied warplanes have been attacking the Iraqi air \ndefense missile and radar and communication sites, which would support \nsuch ambushes. Almost every day so far in 1999 we have attacked some \nIraqi air defense installation in response to a no-fly zone violation. \nThe effectiveness and readiness of Saddam's air defense forces decline \ndaily. Equally important, the complete impotence of Saddam's military \nrelative to the allies is made plain to all Iraqis. In military terms, \nthe Iraqi regime has never looked weaker.\n  Last weekend, the world saw signs of a political rally to match the \ndecline of Iraq's military. The Grand Ayatollah of the Shiites, the \nspiritual leader of 65 percent of Iraqis who are Shiite Muslims, was \nmurdered Thursday night with two of his sons. According to press \nreports, the Grand Ayatollah had reportedly opposed the regime's \ndirective to all Muslims that they pray at home rather than at Friday \nservices in mosques. Opposition sources said the Grand Ayatollah had \npreached against the regime and had blamed it for the misery of Iraqis. \nPerhaps for these reasons, Shiite Muslim Iraqis suspected the \ngovernment of the crime and took to the streets in Baghdad and in \nseveral southern cities.\n  The Iraqi opposition groups claim scores, perhaps hundreds, of Iraqis \nwere killed in the government's harsh response. Two other Shiite \nleaders of international reputation have also been mysteriously \nmurdered in southern Iraq within the last year. The murder of the Grand \nAyatollah, coming on these earlier murders and in the background of \nlongstanding Shiite resistance to Saddam's regime, sparked \ndemonstrations and violent government responses in Baghdad and several \nother cities, according to opposition reports. By Sunday night, the \nregime had apparently quelled the demonstrations. The human cost and \nthe extent of continuing Shiite hostility to Saddam's regime are simply \nnot known to us, but the episode demonstrates the Iraqi government's \nlack of legitimacy in the eyes of its people, as well as the extent to \nwhich Saddam would go to suppress any opposition. The episode reveals a \nweakening Iraqi regime lashing out in an increasingly desperate effort \nto maintain power. When dictatorships act this way, it may signal that \ntheir end is near.\n  But when the end comes, it may come quickly. The question will be, Is \nAmerica prepared for the end? If we have done our homework on the \nvarious Iraqi opposition groups and actively supported the groups which \nqualify under the criteria set forth in the Iraq Liberation Act, we \nwill be well positioned to help Iraq make the transition to democracy. \nHowever, if we delay full implementation of the act and take a wait-\nand-see posture toward the opposition, we should not be surprised if \nour influence on events in post-Saddam Iraq is slight. Similarly, if we \ndo not have humanitarian supplies ready to be forwarded to Iraq as soon \nas Saddam falls, and if we do not have international consensus for \nforgiving the debts of a post-Saddam Iraq, we should not be surprised \nto see him replaced by another hostile dictator.\n  Mr. President, we have a vital national interest in Iraq's future. \nThe lives of young Americans are invested there--our honored dead from \nthe gulf war, as well as from the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers. \nThe valor of our young warriors--now being demonstrated daily in the \nskies over Iraq--is invested there.\n  Tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have spent \nmonths of their lives on deployments to the Persian Gulf and to Turkey \nin support of the U.S. policy to contain Iraq. We have invested \nbillions of dollars supporting this policy: $1.36 billion on \ndeployments in fiscal year 1998 alone, and $800 million so far in \nfiscal year 1999.\n  The American people have made this heavy investment and they have the \nright to a good return--a democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors \nand with its people, so we can bring our troops, ships, and planes home \nfor good. To attain this return, we must be ready for an internal \ncrisis in Iraq, which could occur sooner than we expect.\n  Mr. President, on later occasions, I intend to come to the floor to \ndescribe why I believe a policy other than containment is necessary. I \nunderstand there are people who are very suspicious and very guarded in \ntheir assessments of our success. But I ask them merely to look at \nprevious examples of where the United States of America has been \nsuccessful in the face of considerable skepticism about our ability to \nget that done.\n  In addition, Mr. President, we have, as I have tried to outline here, \na considerable military investment and a risky operation going on today \nthat puts every single one of these men and women, their health, \nsafety, and well-being at risk, and we should not and dare not take \nthat for granted.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on a couple of issues \nthat concern me greatly in the arena of foreign policy.\n  First, a couple of comments concerning the administration's recent \npolicies in Kosovo. I am very, very concerned that the administration, \nin the negotiations in France, is making a mistake. I hope that is not \nthe case. I wish that is not the case. Maybe I don't have all the \ninformation the administration has. But I have been to Kosovo. I have \nbeen in Pristina. I have met with Mr. Milosevic. I do happen to think \nhe is a tyrant. I think he has conducted a lot of atrocities in Bosnia \nand Kosovo against people--right now the Albanians in Kosovo. I think \nhe is a bad guy. I think the international community needs to stand up \nto him.\n  But I am very, very concerned about the administration's policy, or \nobjective, where they are talking about committing 4,000 U.S. troops \nout of a contingency of 28,000, where they are sending our military in \nwithout a militarily achievable objective and without an exit strategy. \nI am really concerned because I think we are going to be there for a \nlong, long time. It seems like we are duplicating what happened in \nBosnia, which the administration calls an outstanding success. But it \nlooks to me like we are stuck in Bosnia. We are spending billions and \nbillions of dollars there. Nobody seems to know exactly how much money \nwe have spent in Bosnia. I heard some people say we have already spent \n$12 billion in Bosnia. Some people say the real figure is closer to $20 \nbillion or $22 billion. But we are spending billions of dollars.\n  I remember in 1995 the President, when he committed the troops, said \nthey would only be there for a year. As a matter of fact, the year \nwould expire right around election time in 1996. He thought he was \ngoing to get them out before election time. But he didn't. Then he said \nhe would extend them another year. And now they are on 3 years plus, \nand they are still in Bosnia, and we know they will be in Bosnia for a \nlong, long time.\n  I visited our troops there. They are very dedicated and very \ncommitted. They are also very, very expensive peacekeepers. I have \nurged the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that if we \nare going to get involved in Kosovo let s not repeat what we have done \nin Bosnia. It is not the same amount of cost and consternation for \nEuropean troops, who live in Poland or live in Germany or live in \nItaly, to spend a little time in Bosnia or Kosovo as it is for somebody \nin the United States. They are able to go home at various points. We \nare not able to do that. We are awfully expensive.\n  So I just make the point that I am very concerned about the \nadministration's strategy. I am concerned about this idea that if we \njust get the Kosovars to agree, then we can bomb Mr. Milosevic and he \nwill now be a compliant partner for peace. That has not proven to be \nthe case. I don't think it will be the case. I think we will be stuck \nthere for a long time.\n  That is the main point I wish to bring as far as my objective. I \ndon't see an exit strategy. I am afraid that we will be there for tens \nof years instead of 1 year or a very short period of time.\n  Mr. President, I make those comments on Kosovo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S1996-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1996-S2000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAILED POLICY ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the primary reason I came to the floor \nthis afternoon is to speak about the administration's failed policy on \nIraq. I say it is a failed policy. I wish that weren't the case, but it \nis. It is a failed policy.\n  The administration, this administration, President Clinton, inherited \na situation where President Bush and the Secretary of State had won the \nwar with Iraq. We achieved our military objective, which was to get \nIraq out of Kuwait. We stated that was our objective. We accomplished \nthat objective. We came home. We implemented sanctions against Iraq for \nits invasion of Kuwait in the summer of 1990. We had a total embargo on \nIraqi products, including oil. Oil was the No. 1 product, or commodity, \nthat Iraq exported. It provided 95 percent, I believe, of its foreign \ncurrencies.\n  We put that embargo on because they invaded a neighbor. And, frankly, \nthey probably intended to invade other neighbors--maybe Saudi Arabia--\nand really became the dominating power in the Persian Gulf. We didn't \nthink that was right. We sent 550,000 troops. We stopped them. We \nkicked them out of Kuwait, and we imposed sanctions to make sure that \nwe would get rid of their weapons of mass destruction, because we knew \nthey were building chemical and biological weapons and possibly nuclear \nweapons.\n  And so we set up an international regime called UNSCOM to inspect to \nmake sure they wouldn't be doing this again, that they wouldn't be \nbuilding these weapons of mass destruction to cause more problems for \ntheir neighbors and surrounding countries in the foreseeable future. \nThe entire world community supported us, applauded us in that effort. I \nthink we had 30 countries that were involved in the coalition aligned \nagainst Iraq in 1990, 1991, 1992. That is what President Clinton \ninherited.\n  Well, what has happened since? Let me walk you through what has \nhappened since.\n  Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis and the Iraqi Government have really \nbaffled the Clinton administration and, in my opinion, they have beaten \nthe Clinton administration if you look at their objectives.\n  I will show you. The war was in 1991. They were producing over 2 \nmillion barrels of oil per day in 1990. After the embargo, they \naveraged--in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, about 4- or 500,000-\nbarrels per day. We really curtailed their production. Basically, we \nhad the implied reward that said, if you will allow arms control \ninspectors--if we know that you are not building weapons of mass \ndestruction, we will allow you to produce more oil, there won't be an \nembargo, but we have to know that you are not building weapons to \nexport throughout the world.\n  What did this administration do? Well, we had a conflict. Actually it \nhappened in 1994 and 1995; Iraq amassed about 80,000 troops near the \nKuwaiti border. We started activating troops. We said, well, we \nwouldn't let this stand; we will respond militarily, if necessary, and \nthen the problem went away. How did they go away? In April of 1995, the \nUnited Nations approved Resolution 986, and this resolution allowed \nIraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every 6 months, $4 billion of oil \nper year.\n  Well, you might notice, all right, this happened in April of 1995. \nTheir oil infrastructure took awhile to be rebuilt, but, as a result of \nthe U.N. resolution, a couple of years later they doubled their oil \nproduction. And this was supposedly to get their cooperation. We didn't \nhave to go to war at the time. We were able to, supposedly, have arms \ncontrol inspectors, and so they had a little cooperation.\n  In March of 1996, Iraq blocked inspections. In June of 1996, we \npassed U.N. Resolution 1060 that deplores the refusal of Iraqi \nauthorities to allow access to sites designated by UNSCOM. In August, \nIraq launched a campaign against the Kurds. The United States launched \na few cruise missiles. The crisis continues. Our arms control \ninspectors are continually denied access.\n  In June of 1997, Iraq demands that UNSCOM finish their business. In \nJune, the United Nations passed a resolution that demands--demands--\nIraq comply fully with UNSCOM. In October of 1997, Iraq bars American \ninspectors totally. In October, the United Nations passed Resolution \n1134 which condemned Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM access to certain \nsites. Boy, the United Nations is standing tough.\n  In November of 1997, we passed another resolution, Resolution 1137. \nWe, again, condemned Iraq because they wouldn't allow these arms \ncontrol inspectors to have access. We are getting close to finding \ntheir weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now, this is only a year ago. A year ago in January this \nadministration was sending 35,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. We are \ngetting ready to go to war again. We are going to have a significant \nstrike. We had significant debate in this body: Is this the right thing \nto do? Will this bring about compliance? The administration is getting \nclose to going to war. And then what happened? The standoff continues. \nThe inspectors are not allowed access to any of these\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\nsites. And then you might remember, the Secretary General of the United \nNations, Kofi Annan, well, he flies to Baghdad and they come to an \nagreement. Peace is at hand. Arms control inspectors will be allowed \nback in.\n  Well, guess what. There was a little deal made that not too many \npeople were aware of. I venture to say there weren't two colleagues in \nthe Senate who were aware the administration already cut a deal with \nIraq and on U.N. Resolution 1153, they allowed Iraq to sell $5.2 \nbillion worth of oil every 6 months; in other words, allowed Iraq to \nmore than double its oil sales.\n\n  This is in February of last year. One year ago, February of 1998, the \nadministration signed a deal. We are getting ready to go to war with \nIraq because they wouldn't let us have our arms control inspectors in, \nand all of a sudden we delegate the authority to the Secretary General. \nHe runs to Baghdad. They signed a deal. Everybody is shaking hands. War \nis avoided. Everybody can be at ease--no real problems now. We have an \nagreement. We have Kofi Annan's signature. We have the Iraqis saying \nthey are going to comply; they are going to let in arms control people. \nAnd, yes, there was a little deal that they could double oil sales, the \nIraqis could double their oil exports to as much as $5.2 billion of oil \nevery 6 months. That was February, a year ago, 12 months from this \ntime.\n  What happened last August? Let's see. Last August, the Iraqis stopped \ninspectors again. Now, they have done this repeatedly.\n  What happened in September and October? They announced they would no \nlonger cooperate. We withdrew the inspectors because they weren't doing \nanything. They were sitting in hotel rooms. They weren't allowed to \nhave any inspections. And so we started saying this is not \nsatisfactory.\n  President Clinton, again, he is talking tough--we are going to go to \nwar. We are going to bomb them. We have the international community on \nour side now because they kicked the arms control inspectors out. We \nhave the international community on our side. We are ready to go.\n  Well, the administration wasn't ready to go to war so we will give \npeace a little more of a chance. And we gave peace a little more of a \nchance, but they still didn't cooperate. We negotiated more. And so in \nSeptember the United Nations passed another resolution demanding Iraq \ncooperate. That was in September.\n  In November, we passed another resolution, U.N. Resolution 1205. We \ndemanded that Iraq cooperate. And then in December we had 3 days of \nbombing, December 17, 18, and 19. Iraq didn't cooperate. We had 3 days \nof bombing. Some people called them the impeachment bombings. They \nhappened to be on the day of impeachment. Maybe that is coincidence; \nmaybe it isn't. I don't know.\n  So we had 3 days of bombing. Boy, that taught them a lesson because \nthey weren't complying, and we are going to make sure they are going to \ncomply. So we bombed them for 3 days. And then what happened? And I \ndon't know if anybody can read this or not, but then on December 23 \n``U.S. Offers To Raise Crude Sales Cap.'' Just days after the bombing, \nClinton administration officials are negotiating to lift the oil sales \ncap.\n  My point is that we have rewarded Iraq three times in the past for \nnoncompliance with arms control inspectors by raising the oil sales \ncap. In April of 1995, we allowed them to go from a total embargo to \nwhere they could sell $2 billion of oil every 6 months.\n  That was in April of 1995. Why? Because they weren't allowing the \ninspectors. Then in February of 1998--again, we are ready to go to war, \nKofi Annan, negotiates this deal that will allow them to double it \nagain. So, yes, we had a promise that the inspectors would be allowed \nto have access. Maybe they had access for a few months. The inspectors \nstart getting close to finding something and Saddam Hussein kicks them \nout again. We threatened to go to war again. This time we actually did \nbomb them for 3 days and then, guess what. Days later, we can't wait; \nwe run back and say, hey, we are going to reward you for your \nnoncompliance. That has been the administration's policy dealing with \nIraq. Let's reward their noncompliance with arms control inspectors. \nLet's reward them; we will let them sell more oil. And that is exactly \nwhat has happened.\n  This was the administration's statement days after the bombing. But \nit is interesting. And this was made by Tom Pickering.\n  Incidentally, I might mention, Mr. President, we are trying to get \nthe administration to testify at a hearing, and they have been very \nreluctant to do so. But I think we have a commitment from Secretary of \nEnergy Richardson, and I hope we will have Secretary Albright, or at \nleast Under Secretary Pickering to testify, to explain this position.\n  His statement is interesting. It says:\n\n       Outlining U.S. policy in the wake of last week's airstrikes \n     against Iraq, Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering \n     said the United States would be prepared to review the \n     economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian \n     Gulf War if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gives guaranteed \n     cooperation to U.N. weapons inspectors. If not, the sanctions \n     will remain in place in perpetuity and the United States will \n     use force as needed to block weapons development.\n\n  In other words, if Iraq doesn't give cooperation, we are going to \nguarantee that those sanctions will remain in place forever. That was \nour administration's policy on December 23, just days after the \nbombing.\n  Well, guess what. I am critical of this administration. Their policy \nhere, 3 weeks later, on January 14--again in the Washington Post, it \nsays, ``Gore Signals Flexibility on Iraq Sanctions; France Proposes \nEnding Oil Embargo, Changing Weapons Inspections.''\n  But guess what. Vice President Gore proposed eliminating weapons \nsanctions. That is our own Vice President who said that. Three weeks \nafter we said we would never lift sanctions unless we had total \ncooperation, we had the Vice President of the United States talking \nabout--I will just quote part of the article:\n\n       A ceiling on how much oil Iraq can sell to provide \n     humanitarian aid to its people should be lifted and the \n     approval process streamlined, Vice President Gore said \n     tonight. . . .\n\n  ``The ceiling should be lifted.'' He didn't say in exchange for \ncooperation. He didn't say in exchange for having arms control \ninspectors in. He just said we should lift it. That is very \ninconsistent, totally overriding what the Under Secretary said 3 weeks \nbefore, but totally consistent with what this administration has done.\n  What this administration has done--Saddam Hussein has tested them. He \nhas pushed them up to the edge of going to war, defied arms control, \ndefied the international community and the arms control community--by \nkicking the inspectors out. We would talk tough, and then at the last \nsecond we would say, ``Well, wait a minute, just give us a little \ninspection, let us have some inspections, let us do it, and you can \nsell more oil.''\n  So what has happened? The Iraqis have done just that. Their oil sales \nhave gone way up. Guess what. They have no inspections--none--zero. \nThey are selling as much oil today as they were prior to the war. That \nis 95 percent of their currency that they earn for all sorts of things.\n  The administration will say this is only used for food or \nhumanitarian reasons. Hogwash. Money is fungible. If they are ready to \ntake care of humanitarian needs with this money, that means with the \nother money they have, they can use that to buy arms and weapons and \nanything else they desire--maybe more castles that they happen to have.\n  So the administration's policy has been a total disaster. Here is \njust the oil production charts. It shows for years, 1996 and so on, \nthey were only producing 550,000 barrels a day. Then the administration \npolicy where they allow more and more changes--and you notice now we \nare up to over 2\\1/2\\ million barrels per day, exactly 2 million \nbarrels a day more than it was in 1996. That has also had the \nconsequence of glutting an already flooded market and is driving a lot \nof producers totally out of business--totally out of business.\n  We have a depression going on right now in the oil industry. You have \n111 oil rigs running today. Last year we had 372. You go from 370 rigs \nto 111 in 12 months, and part of the reason happens to be this \nadministration's policy dealing with Iraq.\n  So I have some concern on what is happening with the domestic oil \nindustry. But my biggest concern is that the administration has had a \nhabit of rewarding Iraqi noncompliance with\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nmore oil sales. Now the administration's policy, as stated by the Vice \nPresident of the United States, is we should not have a cap on oil \nsales.\n  Incidentally, we do not need--or, they don't say this, but we do not \nhave arms control inspectors in; so there is no connection. We are not \nsaying, ``Hey, you can sell all the oil you want to; all you have to do \nis make sure we have access, have arms control inspection; then we'll \ntake all the embargo off.'' That should be our policy. But until they \ndo that, we should keep the embargo on. Let's put a little squeeze on.\n  I said, ``What are we doing today?'' We are flying daily flights over \nthe no-fly zones. They are shooting at our pilots. Thank goodness they \nhaven't been successful yet. But how successful is our policy? We have \nalready proven to Saddam Hussein, if he denies us, we will reward him. \nThat is what we have done. This is what this administration has done \nthroughout their policy.\n  Our administration policy has been pretty poor in dealing with Iraq. \nWe have continued to reward their noncompliance, going all the way back \nto April 1995, and I think it has made the world a lot more dangerous \nas a result. Saddam Hussein is able to produce all the oil he wants. He \nis able to generate the moneys he needs, able to build the weapons of \nmass destruction without anybody checking him whatsoever--not the \nUnited States, not the United Nations. As a result, the world is a much \nmore dangerous place.\n  The administration should be held accountable for their failed \npolicies in Iraq. I also think it is important that we speak up now so \nwe don't have failed policies in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the newspaper articles \nand tables to which I referred printed in the Record, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 23, 1998]\n\n               U.S. Offers to Raise Iraqi Crude Sales Cap\n\n                         (By Thomas W. Lippman)\n\n       The Clinton administration offered yesterday to allow Iraq \n     to export more crude oil to raise money for food and \n     medicine, but held out little prospect that Iraq can escape \n     from other U.N. economic sanctions any time soon.\n       Outlining U.S. policy in the wake of last week's airstrikes \n     against Iraq, Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering \n     said the United States would be prepared to review the \n     economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian \n     Gulf War if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gives guaranteed \n     cooperation to U.N. weapons inspectors. If not; the sanctions \n     will remain in place ``in perpetuity'' and the United States \n     will use force as needed to block weapons development, he \n     said.\n       Given the administration's conviction that Saddam Hussein \n     will never give the inspection force known as UNSCOM the \n     unfettered access that the United States and Britain demand--\n     a view supported by official Iraqi pronouncements this week--\n     Pickering's statement amounted to a declaration that Russia, \n     France and other advocates of modifying the inspection system \n     and the economic sanctions will confront strong U.S. and \n     British opposition.\n       Senior U.S. officials have made clear that they will not \n     return to the previous situation in which Iraq promised to \n     cooperate with inspectors and then obstructed their work, \n     controlling the agenda and forcing Washington to choose \n     between military force or breaking its word to defend the \n     inspections.\n       Pickering's tone, however, was conciliatory toward the \n     Security Council. He welcomed Russia's announcement that its \n     ambassador to Washington, recalled last week for \n     ``consultations,'' will return this week.\n       He also raised the possibility of U.S. assent to an \n     increase in the amount of crude oil Iraq is allowed to sell \n     through U.N.-supervised channels to buy food and medicine. \n     Now Iraq is permitted to sell $5.2 billion of oil every six \n     months.\n       Administration officials described Pickering's remarks as \n     part of an effort to assuage anger in the Security Council \n     about the four days of U.S. and British airstrikes.\n       Russia in particular has complained that the strikes \n     circumvented the will of the Security Council and violated \n     international law. Foreign ministry spokesman Vladimir \n     Rakhmanin said in Moscow yesterday that ``there is now a \n     chance to reaffirm the leading role of the Security \n     Council,'' an important objective for Russia because its veto \n     in the council is one of its few sources of diplomatic \n     leverage over Washington.\n       France, which also opposed the strikes, has proposed a \n     modification of the inspection system to make it more \n     palatable to Iraq. Both countries have called for the \n     replacement of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler, who is \n     anathema to the Iraqis.\n       Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John W. Warner (R-\n     Va.) said the president should ``seize the initiative'' to \n     make a deal with the Russians, French and other nations to \n     restructure UNSCOM.\n       But Pickering said UNSCOM was created to be a technically \n     competent weapons inspection force and should not be replaced \n     by an alternate mechanism developed for political reasons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Post, January 14, 1999]\n\nGore Signals Flexibility on Iraq Sanctions--France Proposes Ending Oil \n                 Embargo, Changing Weapons Inspections\n\n                          (By John M. Goshko)\n\n       United Nations, Jan. 13--A ceiling on how much oil Iraq can \n     sell to provide humanitarian aid to its people should be \n     lifted and the approval process streamlined, Vice President \n     Gore said tonight as Security Council members searched for \n     agreement on how to deal with Iraq in the aftermath of a \n     U.S.-led bombing campaign.\n       France proposed ending the embargo on Iraqi oil sales and \n     replacing intrusive weapons searches by the United Nations \n     with a plan that would ensure that Iraq does not acquire more \n     of the weapons of mass destruction forbidden by the council \n     following Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Until \n     now, the focus of U.N. efforts has been on locating and \n     destroying any prohibited weapons in Iraq's existing arsenal.\n       Iraqi resentment of that policy caused President Saddam \n     Hussein's government to defy the inspectors from the U.N. \n     Special Commission (UNSCOM) and led to American and British \n     air and missile strikes against Iraq from Dec. 16 to 19. \n     Since then, the defiant Iraq government has refused to permit \n     UNSCOM to return, and the U.N. council has been divided about \n     how to coax or force Iraq to resume cooperation.\n       The division has been especially deep among the Security \n     Council's five permanent members, each with the power to veto \n     any decision. Gore's speech tonight to the Israel Policy \n     Forum in New York was designed to show U.S. openness to the \n     flexibility France, Russia and China have sought as a way to \n     ease the crippling economic sanctions.\n       ``The United States is looking at ways to improve the \n     effectiveness of humanitarian programs in Iraq, including \n     lifting the current ceiling on funds which can be used to \n     purchase food and medicine,'' Gore said of the oil-for-food \n     program, now capped at slightly more than $5 billion a year.\n       The goal is twofold: to keep the permanent Security Council \n     members, which also include Britain, united, and to \n     demonstrate that the fight is with President Saddam Hussein, \n     whom Gore called ``a ruthless dictator ruling unjustly,'' and \n     not with the Iraqi people themselves.\n       ``It was Saddam's regime that for four long years, at great \n     cost and human suffering, refused to allow his people the \n     benefits of this program,'' Gore said. ``Saddam has \n     consistently shown he has cared more about developing weapons \n     of mass destruction than developing the welfare of his \n     people.''\n       Gore's remarks reflected a position stated by other \n     administration officials soon after the bombings began last \n     month: The United States would agree to lift the ceiling on \n     oil exports for humanitarian needs but will not go as far as \n     lifting the sanction entirely. Gore added that U.N. approval \n     of what Iraq can purchase with its modest oil profits, which \n     can take weeks or months, should be revised to speed the \n     approvals.\n       Earlier today, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin \n     said the French proposal contains ``some positive elements \n     that deal with the essential task of ensuring that Iraq does \n     not rearm and is disarmed.''\n       The French plan calls for:\n       Long-term weapons monitoring under a ``renewed control \n     commission'' that would either replace or substantially \n     modify UNSCOM ``so that its independence will be ensured and \n     its professionalism strengthened.'' Monitoring ``would no \n     longer be retrospective but would become preventive,'' \n     relying on sensors and television cameras to keep track of \n     what Iraq does in the future.\n       Ending the embargo on Iraq's sales and exports of oil, its \n     principal commodity.

Goshko)\n\n       United Nations, Jan. 14--The United States tried today to \n     defuse growing international criticism of American-backed \n     sanctions on Iraq by proposing eliminating the ceiling for \n     how much oil Iraq can sell abroad as long as the proceeds are \n     used to buy food and medicine.\n       The proposal was presented by acting U.S. Ambassador A. \n     Peter Burleigh as the Security Council renewed its search for \n     agreement on how the United Nations should deal\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\n     with Iraq in the aftermath of last month's U.S.-led bombing \n     campaign. The U.S. plan followed a more far-reaching proposal \n     by France that would end the embargo on Iraq oil sales and \n     replace intrusive U.N. weapons searches with a program to \n     monitor any future attempts by Iraq to obtain weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       The 15-nation council's consensus on Iraq, intact through \n     most of the decade since Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of \n     Kuwait was repelled by U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf \n     War, has crumbled in recent months because of differences \n     among the five permanent members with the power to veto any \n     decision. The divergences have pitted the United States and \n     Britain, both insistent on maintaining a hard line, against \n     Russia, France and China, which advocate a more flexible and \n     tolerant approach.\n       Burleigh told reporters that Washington does not regard its \n     proposals as ``an alternative to the French plan'' because \n     the U.S. ideas deal only with humanitarian issues and do not \n     address the question of how best to pursue Iraqi disarmament. \n     He said the United States disagrees with France's approach to \n     arms inspections, which would shift the focus of U.N. efforts \n     away from locating and destroying prohibited weapons in \n     Iraq's existing arsenal.\n       ``The U.S. government does not believe that it is \n     documented that the disarmament process for Iraq has been \n     completed,'' he said. ``It appears that the French proposal \n     makes that assumption--either that Iraq is disarmed or that \n     there is nothing further to be known.''\n       The United States, he added, believes that overseeing \n     Iraqi disarmament should continue to be the responsibility \n     of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the two \n     organizations originally assigned that job by the Security \n     Council. The UNSCOM and IAEA inspectors left Iraq before \n     last month's bombing, and Iraq has vowed that those from \n     UNSCOM, which it charges are American spies, will not be \n     allowed to return.\n       The U.S. proposals would overhaul aspects of the ``oil for \n     food'' program designed to allow Iraq to reduce suffering \n     caused by the broad U.N. sanctions on the economy. In \n     addition to liberalizing Iraq's opportunities for oil sales, \n     the U.S. proposals call for streamlining procedures for \n     approving Iraqi contracts to buy food and medicine, and \n     allowing Iraq to borrow money from an escrow account held by \n     the United Nations to finance such purchases on condition the \n     funds are repaid when Iraqi oil sales reach a higher level. \n     The plan also would expand U.N. programs for the health and \n     welfare of Iraqi children and make it easier for Iraqi \n     Muslims to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n       But the most important U.S. proposal was to end \n     restrictions on how much oil Iraq can sell under the oil-for-\n     food exemption. At present, Iraq may sell $5.25 billion worth \n     of oil every six months under tight U.N. controls. As a \n     practical matter, its oil industry, which is badly in need of \n     repair and modernization, has been barely able to produce and \n     sell about $3 billion worth of oil each six months.\n       To help alleviate that problem, Burleigh said, the United \n     States is willing to relax the scrutiny it has applied to \n     contracts for spare parts and other equipment needed to get \n     the Iraqi industry working better. But he warned that \n     Washington opposes any equipment purchases that would \n     increase Iraq's ability to refine its oil domestically \n     because the refined product could be smuggled out of the \n     country, with the proceeds being pocketed by the regime \n     rather than put to humanitarian purposes.\n       ``Our problem is with the Iraqi government; we have no \n     quarrel with the Iraqi people,'' Burleigh told reporters. He \n     repeated the frequent U.S. contention that Saddam Hussein's \n     government has failed to take advantage for the oil-for-food \n     program in order to use the propaganda value of the \n     populace's deprivation to win international support for \n     ending sanctions.\n       The growing sense in many countries that the sanctions have \n     outlived their usefulness seemed a major factor in spurring \n     the U.S. proposals. It is an open secret that a growing \n     majority of countries on the Security Council favor or are \n     leaning toward lifting the sanctions. If the trend continues, \n     many diplomats here believe the United States soon may be so \n     isolated that it would be able to maintain the sanctions only \n     by using its veto. In that case, the same diplomats predict, \n     it would be only a matter of time before Arab countries and \n     possibly France and Russia, which are in line to win \n     concessions in the Iraqi oil industry, start to break the \n     embargo.\n       By proposing measures that could relieve substantially the \n     shortages and hardships affecting the Iraqi people, the \n     United States hopes to turn aside the mounting pressure for \n     ending sanctions. And if the Iraqi government, which has \n     accepted the oil-for-food program with great reluctance, \n     fails to take advantage of any liberalized opportunities, \n     Washington, would be able to argue that the continued plight \n     of the people is the fault of Saddam Hussein.\n       Whether the U.S. move will succeed was not immediately \n     clear. Delegates from other council nations said they would \n     have to study the U.S. proposals more closely and consult \n     with their governments before making any judgments. Iraq's \n     ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, was quoted \n     by Reuters as saying the U.S. proposal was meaningless. ``It \n     is a cover up for their entire Iraq policy,'' he said.\n       Most attention for the moment was on the French plan, whose \n     elements were made known to council members earlier in the \n     week and have been the subject of informal discussion among \n     various delegations. Delegates said privately that given the \n     strong U.S. opposition to ending sanctions outright and \n     Washington's continued insistence on tough inspections, there \n     seems little chance of the French plan being accepted in \n     anything like its present form.\n       But as French diplomats said, the potential value of their \n     plan is as ``a catalyst'' that might stimulate fresh thinking \n     about Iraq and eventually lead to a narrowing of the \n     differences that recently have paralyzed the council.\n\n\n                              IRAQ TIMELINE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Iraq                              US response\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1990:\n  Aug.--Iraq invades Kuwait...............

Mr. President, this Congress, now that it will turn its \nattention to the committee structure and the agenda that will be \ndeveloped in the authorizing committees and Appropriations Committee, \nwill talk about a lot of different issues, will describe many different \npriorities. Among those priorities will be, for example, a piece of \nlegislation we just passed in the Senate dealing with military pay. I \nassume that very soon there will be a national missile defense bill \nthat will come to the floor that will be subject to dramatic and \ninteresting debate, and there are a range of these kinds of issues. I \nwant to raise one issue today that I think we ought to act on with some \npriority.\n  There is a program that not many people know of called Walking \nShield. It is a program to move houses that are surplus houses \nscheduled to be demolished on our military bases when those houses are \nto be replaced with more modern houses. Instead of demolishing the old \nhouses, they are now moved out increasingly under the project Operation \nWalking Shield and moved to Indian reservations where there is a \ndesperate need for good housing.\n  Operation Walking Shield is a wonderful program that takes houses \nthat would have been demolished and moves them to a foundation \nsomeplace on an Indian reservation to provide housing for those \nAmericans who do not have housing.\n  We have a real emergency in this country, particularly on Indian \nreservations, dealing with housing, health care, and education.\n  I want to read a few paragraphs from a letter to describe this \nemergency and why this Congress must respond to it with some priority \nand why I hope the President will do the same.\n  I want to read about a woman named Sarah. Her name was Sarah Swift \nHawk. Sarah died January 2. Sarah Swift Hawk died on the Rosebud Indian \nReservation in South Dakota. She froze to death. Let me read to you a \nletter that describes the circumstances leading to Sarah's death:\n\n       The night of January 2 was truly a dreadful night for the \n     Swift Hawk family. They had run out of propane to heat their \n     house. They also had no wood for their wood stove, although \n     they tried desperately to obtain some wood, but without any \n     success.\n       The Swift Hawk house is but one of 100,000 terribly \n     substandard houses that exist on our nation's Indian \n     reservations. The house had only thin plastic sheeting \n     covering two large openings where windows were supposed to \n     be. As night fell, and the temperature plummeted from 16 \n     degrees below zero to 45 degrees below zero, Sarah's daughter \n     and her son-in-law, who live in the same house with their six \n     children, put two blankets on Sarah in an attempt to keep her \n     warm. The mother then took the other two blankets they had, \n     and placed them over her six children who were all huddled \n     together on the floor where she and her husband would also \n     sleep. Since there was only one cot in the house, that bed \n     was given to Sarah who was the grandmother in the family. \n     Everyone else in the Swift Hawk family has to sleep on the \n     floor because the family is too poor to buy any furniture.\n       When the Sun came up on Sunday morning, January 3rd, the \n     daughter got up from the floor to check on her mother, and \n     she found that her mother had died during the night, frozen \n     to death as a result of exposure to extreme cold. \n     Fortunately, the body heat from the parents and the children, \n     all huddled together on the floor, kept them alive that \n     terrible night.\n       Sarah Swift Hawk's needless death is repeated again and \n     again on our nation's Indian reservations, particularly those \n     in the Northern Plains States.\n\n  This is a letter from Phil Stevens. Phil Stevens runs the program \ncalled Walking Shield. I have met with him a number of times, helped \nthem on legislation to try to move some houses to Indian reservations. \nI have seen the joy on the faces of those who received a home--one put \non a foundation for them--a home that they could move into for the \nfirst time, a home for their children. But, frankly, there is just a \ntrickle--a few hundred homes here and\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nthere to meet the needs that are so desperate of people like Sarah \nSwift Hawk and her family.\n\n  When you hear stories like this you think, well, that happens in a \nThird World country someplace, someone laying down and freezing to \ndeath in their home. This wasn't a Third World country, it was in our \ncountry.\n  The poverty in these areas is so desperate, housing so inadequate, \nthe health care so minimal and the education needs so substantial. And \nfrankly, we have so many other priorities that folks come to the floor \nof the House and the Senate and they debate this or that with great \ngusto, and as we do, Sarah Swift Hawk dies, frozen to death in a house, \na house without windows, a house with thin plastic sheets where windows \nshould have existed at 45 degrees below zero.\n  Is that a shame? Yes. I think it is shameful that this happens in our \ncountry. This is not some mysterious illness for which there is not a \ncure. We know this happens, and we know how to address these questions.\n  I hope President Clinton and the 106th Congress will decide that \nthese are emergency conditions that exist in housing, health care, and \neducation on our Indian reservations and that we ought to address them.\n  I have spoken on the floor previously about a third grader in a \nschool in Cannon Ball, ND, a young Native American girl who said to me, \n``Mr. Senator, will you be building us a new school?'' Because that \nyoung third grade Indian child goes to a school that is not fit. It is \nnot a school that Members of the Senate would send their children to, \nand it is not the fault of the school board, not the fault of the \nsuperintendent, and not the fault of the teachers who are trying very \nhard.\n  This is a school without a tax base, 150 kids, one water faucet, two \nbathrooms. They cannot connect to the Internet because about half the \nschool is too old, too condemned, not able to access the wiring. This \nis a school that is in desperate need of repair. One of the rooms has \nsewer gas seeping up into it that requires the room to be evacuated \noccasionally because they can't keep children in a room where the sewer \ngas keeps backing up. That is the kind of school we have a third grader \nwalk through the door of, and we say to that third grader, ``This is \nyour school.''\n  Are we proud of that? I don't think so. Ought we do something about \nit? Does that young third grader's life depend on us doing something? \nIt does, and we should.\n  We all know the problems in health care. I just met with a group a \nfew minutes ago, this afternoon. Let me just tell you about health care \nfor a moment. This group was talking about foster children. On one of \nthe reservations, a young 4-year-old boy had been in two foster homes \nand was being moved again, and the caseworker noticed some substantial \nstench when he was in the vicinity of the 4-year-old boy.\n  What was it that smelled so bad? A 4-year-old boy wearing a cast on \nhis arm because he had a broken arm, but through two foster homes no \none had bothered to take him back to the doctor and the cast had been \non 6 months. He had gangrene on his arm. Now, is that an emergency in \nhealth care? I think so. It is just a symptom, just the tip of the \niceberg of massive problems --massive problems--that exist in health \ncare, education and housing.\n  You know, I am talking now about the problems on Indian reservations. \nI want to tell you about pinning medals one day on the pajamas of an \nIndian named Edmond Young Eagle, a Native American who grew up on the \nStanding Rock Reservation, Fort Yates, ND, a proud member of the \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe.\n  He went overseas to fight for this country--Africa, Europe--fought \nfor America in the Second World War. And if you look at the Indian \npopulation of this country and the percentage of veterans they have and \nwho fought in our country's wars, you will find a very high percent of \nthe Indian population went off to fight for this country. Edmond did--\nfought across the world in the Second World War.\n  When I met Edmond, he was dying, laying in a VA hospital. His family \nhad contacted me and said Edmond had never received his medals for his \nservice in the Second World War. They wanted to know if there was any \nchance to get these medals he was owed from the Defense Department \nbefore he died. I got the medals and I took them to the VA hospital on \na Sunday morning in Fargo, ND.\n  Edmond Young Eagle had lung cancer. I did not know it that Sunday \nmorning, but 7 days later Edmond Young Eagle would die from lung \ncancer. But that Sunday morning they cranked up his bed to a sitting \nposition, and he was wearing his pajamas. And in a ceremony, witnessed \nby his doctors and nurses and his sisters and some people who had come \nfrom the Old Soldiers Home, I pinned medals on Edmond Young Eagle's \npajamas, the medals he had earned for his service to our country in the \nSecond World War.\n  And this man dying of lung cancer said to me, ``You know, this is the \nproudest day of my life.'' I thought to myself, what a paradox it is \nthat this man, who served his country honorably in the Second World \nWar, fought for America's freedom, and then never had much the rest of \nhis life, at the end of his life, lying in the hospital, suffering from \nlung cancer, felt so strongly about his service to his country and was \nso proud of receiving medals from his country for his service to \nAmerica that he said it was one of the proudest days of his life.\n  We have a responsibility, it seems to me, to the memory of Edmond \nYoung Eagle, to the third grade girl that I talked about going to a \nschool that ought to be improved, to the memory of Sarah Swift Hawk, \nwho goes to sleep in a house at 45 below zero, and dies in her sleep, \nfreezes to death, we owe it to these folks--to their memories, to their \nchildren--we owe it to them to do something about these issues on an \nemergency basis.\n  There are a lot of things that we will debate back and forth on the \nfloor of this Senate, as I said--defense policy, education policy, \nhealth care policy--so many issues day after day. But these are the \nkinds of things that we must put at the front of the line, to say \npeople ought not to be freezing to death in our country because they \nrun out of fuel in the winter, because they live in houses that ought \nnot be inhabited in the winter, because they do not have housing, \nbecause they do not have health care. We can do something about this.\n  Let me conclude again by saying, I am trying to see that the White \nHouse determines this is a priority and an emergency, that we have an \nemergency, a housing emergency and health care emergency on our Indian \nreservations that we ought to address.\n  This isn't a case where any of us can just say, well, gosh, that is \nsomebody else's problem. It is not somebody else's problem.\n  When we have young children who are not receiving the medical \nattention they need, who are put in foster homes that are unsafe and \nwhere they are beaten--I ve told a story about a young girl with her \nnose broken, hair pulled out at the roots, her arm broken in a foster \nhome, placed in a foster home by one worker who had 150 cases to work \non.\n  So you put a child at age 3 in a foster home without understanding \nwhat kind of home this is. And then there is a drunken party, and a 3-\nyear-old girl gets her arm broken, her nose broken, and her hair pulled \nout by the roots. Is that what we want in this country? Of course not. \nIt is our responsibility to address these issues. And it is, indeed, an \nemergency when a 3-year-old girl is beaten, when a third grade girl is \ndenied an adequate education, when a grandmother named Sarah Swift Hawk \nfreezes to death. These are emergencies. And we need to do something \nabout them.\n  I am hoping the White House will declare these as emergencies. And I \nam hoping the Congress will understand that we can, with a small \ninvestment, make life so much better for a lot of folks who matter in \nthis country--folks like Edmond Young Eagle--who have served this \ncountry with great distinction and great honor. In their memory, and \njust because it is the right thing to do, our country has a \nresponsibility to decide this is a priority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Dr. Carter G. Woodson was the son of \nformer slaves. He believed passionately that the solution to injustice \nwas education. If Americans from different backgrounds could learn to \nsee our similarities and appreciate our differences, he believed, we \ncould end the fear that is at the heart of racial discrimination.\n  So, in February 1926, Dr. Woodson proposed the first Negro History \nWeek as a way to preserve African American history and promote greater \nunderstanding among all Americans. Over the years, as the civil rights \nmovement progressed, Negro History Week evolved into what we now know \nas Black History Month.\n  This month, as our nation once again pauses to reflect on the \nachievements and experiences of African Americans, we celebrate the \nbirthdays of several renowned leaders, including Frederick Douglass, \nRosa Parks, and Barbara Jordan. We also celebrate the founding 90 years \nago of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \none of this century's most powerful engines for social and economic \njustice.\n  It is right and fitting that we acknowledge such famous people and \nimportant milestones. But it is also important to recall the \ncontributions of other African Americans who were less well known, but \nwho contributed much to their communities. Today I want to pay tribute \nto two such men from my home state of South Dakota: Oscar Micheaux and \nRoss Owens.\n  Oscar Micheaux was a gifted, early filmmaker who settled in Gregory, \nSouth Dakota, in the early 1900s. His company, the Micheaux Film \nCorporation, was responsible for producing films that ran counter to \nHollywood's negative portrayal of African Americans at that time.\n  Ross Owens was a 1925 graduate of my alma mater, South Dakota State \nUniversity. Not only was he inducted into SDSU's Athletic Hall of Fame, \nbut his masters thesis, ``Leisure Time Activities of the American Negro \nPrior to the Civil War'', became a classic in African American history \nand physical education.\n  One can only wonder what else Mr. Micheaux and Mr. Owens might have \nachieved had they been born later, after the civil rights movement \ntoppled many of the barriers to equality that existed during their \nlifetimes.\n  Today, thanks to the vision of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, \nThurgood Marshall and John Lewis, as well as countless other Americans \nwhose names are less well known but whose courage was no less real, \nmany of those barriers are gone. Our nation no longer tolerates legal \ndiscrimination. We no longer permit injustices like poll taxes, \n``separate but equal'' schools, and segregated public facilities. We \nhave moved closer to that ideal on which our nation was founded: that \nall men--and women--are created equal. And we are all better for it.\n  Today, as our country thrives, millions of African Americans are \nsharing the benefits of the best economy in decades. But not all \nAfrican Americans have been given the opportunity to share in America's \neconomic progress. Not all of the barriers have been torn down. There \nis still work to be done. As we prepare to enter the new century, we \nmust remain committed to equal educational opportunity, and economic \nand social justice--for all Americans.\n  This month, as we celebrate Black History Month, let us recall the \nwords of the poet Langston Hughes, who wrote of a land ``where \nopportunity is real, life is free, and equality is in the air we \nbreathe.'' And let us rededicate ourselves to finishing the task of \nestablishing that land here, in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2002-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 4, \nThe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' (SSAM) Bill of Rights \nAct of 1999. This bill addresses critical personnel and retention \nissues in our nation's armed forces and hopefully will arrest the \naccelerating decline in military readiness. I commend the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and \nthe Committee as a whole for reporting this legislation.\n  I have been concerned for quite some time with declining defense \nbudgets and increased deployments overseas. Those who defend the United \nStates often are the first casualties of budget cuts here at home, even \nas they have been deployed overseas more frequently than ever before. \nDeclining morale in our armed forces and diminished military readiness \nare national security legacies this Administration is leaving, legacies \nI hope the Senate will begin reversing with the passage of S. 4.\n  Our military is hemorrhaging due to poor morale, plentiful private \nsector opportunities in a robust economy, and burdensome deployment \nschedules. The pay and benefit provisions in S. 4 will be critical to \narrest declining morale and diminished readiness. As General Hugh \nShelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, stated before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last September, ``. . . we must act soon to send a \nclear signal to the backbone of our military, our mid-grade \ncommissioned and noncommissioned officers, that their leadership and \nthis Congress recognize the value of their service and their sacrifices \nand that we have not lost sight of our commitment to the success of the \nall-volunteer force.''\n  Mr. President, the Administration has taken too long to address the \nmorale and retention problems undermining the readiness of our armed \nforces. Senior Pentagon officials downplayed evidence of growing \npersonnel and readiness problems for months, but finally began \naddressing these issues squarely before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee last September. General Shelton stated that ``. . . our \nforces are showing increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal \ninitially, and now measurable, evidence indicates that our readiness is \nfraying and that the long-term health of the total force is in \njeopardy.''\n  A cursory survey of declining defense budgets and increased \noperations around the world certainly provides the factual background \nto support General Shelton's statement. For many leaving the forces \ntoday, military compensation and benefits simply do not justify \nextended deployments away from home.\n  Our military is doing more with less. Defense spending has declined \nin real terms by 27 percent since 1990. Military procurement spending \nhas declined by a staggering 54 percent during that same time period. \nIn the midst of this dramatic downsizing, the pace of operations abroad \nhas risen dramatically. In the 1990s, operational missions increased \n300 percent while the force structure for the Army and Air Force\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nwas reduced by 45 percent each, the Navy by approximately 40 percent, \nand the Marines by over 10 percent. President Reagan deployed U.S. \nforces 17 times during his eight year term. During his four-year term, \nPresident Bush deployed U.S. forces 14 times. During the six year \ntenure of President Clinton, however, the U.S. armed forces have been \ndeployed over 46 times. Contingency operations during this \nAdministration have exacted a heavy cost (in real terms): $8.1 billion \nin Bosnia; $1.1 billion in Haiti; $6.1 billion in Iraq.\n  Diminished resources, inadequate benefits, and increased deployments \nare taking a serious toll on the health of our armed forces. Our Air \nForce pilots defeat Iraq's forces soundly on the battlefield, but \nSaddam is winning a war of attrition when it comes to pilot retention. \nThe Air Force has experienced a 14 percent decline in readiness since \n1996 and ended 1998 with a 700 pilot shortfall that could grow to 2,000 \npilots by 2002. Air Force second-term reenlistment rates have dropped \n13% in the last 5 years.\n  The Navy was 7,000 recruits short in 1998 and reports diminished \ndeployed readiness due to personnel shortages, such as a 9% shortfall \nin junior Surface Warfare Officers. The non-deployed readiness of \ncarrier air wings is at its lowest level in a decade.\n  Retention rates for critical personnel in all services is suffering. \nDeclines in retention of critical personnel since 1995 are very \ntroubling: Air Force enlisted aircrew with 7 years service declined \nfrom 83 to 55 percent; Air Force AWAC personnel with 5-8 years service \ndeclined from 56 to 35 percent; Army aircraft armament personnel with 8 \nyears service declined from 72 to 47 percent; Army chemical operations \nspecialists with 5-8 years service declined from 69 to 51 percent; \nMarine aircraft avionics technicians with 9-12 years service declined \nfrom 76 to 63 percent; and Navy electronic technicians with 9-12 years \nservice declined from 77 to 63 percent.\n  The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' (SSAM) Bill of Rights \nAct of 1999 addresses these problems on several fronts. The legislation \ncontains important provisions to address immediate needs and \nestablishes longer-term mechanisms to improve retention of military \npersonnel. The bill provides for an across the board pay increase of \n4.8 percent. The pay table is reformed to benefit critical mid-career \npersonnel the most. Retirement system reform gives military personnel \nwith 15 years of service the option of remaining in the Redux \nretirement plan and taking a $30,000 cash bonus or returning to a pre-\nRedux system with retirement at 50 percent of base pay and no COLA \ncaps.\n  Retirement opportunities also are enhanced by allowing military \npersonnel to contribute 5 percent of their base pay tax-free to a \nThrift Savings Plan (TSP). A special retention initiative is also \nprovided where the Secretary of Defense can choose to offer 5 percent \nmatching TSP contributions to critical personnel for six years in \nreturn for a six year commitment. Finally, there is a special \nsubsistence allowance to address the intolerable condition of 12,000 \nmilitary personnel on food stamps. In the U.S. military, the finest \nfighting force in the world, there should never be families who are so \npoorly provided for as to need food stamps. The monthly subsistence \nallowance in this legislation, in addition to other pay reforms, will \nhelp end this disgraceful treatment of thousands of military personnel.\n  The need for this legislation cannot be more obvious. Our troops \nmaintain a constant presence in the Persian Gulf, East Asia, and \nEurope. Now in Bosnia two years past the original deadline, American \nsoldiers could face yet another prolonged nation-building exercise in \nKosovo if this Administration has its way. These troops have been asked \nto achieve more missions with fewer resources and less manpower, and \nthe signs of fraying readiness and declining morale are mounting.\n  In addressing current readiness and funding problems, Administration \nofficials repeatedly have said personnel issues were their first \npriority. General Shelton testified last September: ``. . . if I had to \nchoose the area of greatest concern to me, I would say that we need to \nput additional dollars into taking care of our most important resource, \nthe uniformed members of the armed forces.''\n  General Shelton is right to place the highest priority on our \nmilitary personnel. The defense of this country, in the final analysis, \nis essentially a personnel issue. Admiral Chester Nimitz stated in \n1950: ``Our armaments must be adequate to the needs, but our faith is \nnot primarily in these machines of defense but in ourselves.'' General \nShelton seems to concur with that statement when he says: ``The best \ntanks, the best planes, the best ships in the world are not what makes \nour military the superb force that it is today . . . Advanced \ntechnology and modern weapons are important . . . But even the finest \nhigh-tech equipment will never be the determining factor on the \nbattlefield. The most critical factor for both current and future \nreadiness are our men and women . . . in uniform today.''\n  Our military personnel are our greatest resource, and our failure to \ntake care of them our greatest oversight. No soldier should have to \nworry about feeding his family as he defends his country. No military \nfamily should be repeatedly divided by constant deployments.\n  We entrust our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with the \nresponsibility given to our nation as a whole: the defense of liberty. \nHow we provide for those men and women in uniform reflects on how \nseriously we take that mission, on how seriously we safeguard the \nblessings of liberty. I urge passage of this legislation to improve \nmuch-needed benefits for those who defend the United States and the \ncause of freedom abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2002-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2003-S2004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, every February, since Dr. Carter G. \nWoodson first initiated the idea in 1926, Americans have celebrated the \ncontributions of African-Americans to our history, literature, arts, \nsciences, politics and every other facet of American life. What was in \nthe beginning only a week-long event, has blossomed into a month-long \ncelebration.\n  This year's theme, as selected by the Association for the Study of \nAfro-American Life and History (ASALH), is ``The Legacy of African-\nAmerican Leadership for the Present and the Future.'' This theme \ncaptures one of the primary objectives of Dr. Woodson in creating this \nannual celebration. Dr. Woodson believed that you must look back in \norder to look forward. He dedicated his entire life to the research and \ndocumentation of African-American history, and his efforts were \nintended to educate and inspire contemporaneous and future generations \nof Americans.\n  In keeping with this theme and Dr. Woodson's vision, I rise today to \nshare with my colleagues of the Senate and the American people a few of \nthe legacies of outstanding African-Americans from Maryland. While this \nis not an exhaustive listing, it exemplifies the legacy of African-\nAmericans in the areas of science, engineering, abolitionism, \nliterature, religion, theater, education, civil rights, law, business, \nathletics, diplomacy and politics. I believe you will find--as I have \nfound--their stories and accomplishments inspiring, and it is my \nfervent hope that today's African-American youth will find in these men \nand women role models to inspire their own efforts as we move into the \n21st Century.\n  Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) of Ellicott's Mill, Maryland is \ncredited with building the first clock in America in 1753. He was an \ninventor, scientist and surveyor who played an important role in the \nlayout and design of our nation's capital city.\n  Harriet Tubman (1820-1913) of Dorchester County, Maryland escaped \nfrom slavery and was responsible for assisting more than 300 slaves \nreach freedom in the north through the underground railway.\n  Francis E.W. Harper (1825-1911) of Baltimore, Maryland was the first \nAfrican-American writer to have a published short story. She also had \nher poetry and other verse published, including a novel in 1892.\n  Billie Holiday (1915-1959) of Baltimore, Maryland is to this day \nregarded as one the greatest jazz vocalists in history, and as one of \nAmerica's premier artists of the 20th Century.\n  Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960) of Baltimore, Maryland was a \ndistinguished author, folklorist and anthropologist.\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\n  Charles Randolph Uncles (1859-1933) of Baltimore, Maryland became the \nfirst African-American priest ordained in the United States on December \n19, 1891, beginning a line of American ministers that has included \nMartin Luther King, Jr. and the Reverend Jesse Jackson.\n  Eubie Blake (1883-1983) of Baltimore, Maryland was a popular ragtime \npianist and composer who first learned to play the piano at age six and \nwent on to break color barriers on Broadway and theaters across the \nnation.\n  Mary Church Terrell (1864-1954) of Annapolis, Maryland was an \noutstanding educator and early civil rights leader.\n  Edward Franklin Frazier (1894-1962) of the Eastern Shore of Maryland \nwas a teacher of mathematics, professor of sociology and author who \ncreated and furthered the academic knowledge and understanding of the \nAfrican-American community.\n  Clifton Wharton (1899-1990) of Baltimore, Maryland became the first \nAfrican-American foreign service officer named chief of an American \nmission overseas when he was appointed U.S. Minister to Romania in \n1958.\n  Leon Day (1916-1995), a Hall of Fame baseball player from Baltimore, \nMaryland, was one of the most consistently outstanding pitchers in the \nNegro Leagues during the 1930's and 1940's. His consistency was \ninterrupted only by two years of service in the Army during World War \nII where he distinguished himself on Utah Beach during the Allied \ninvasion of France.\n  Reginald F. Lewis (1942-1993) of Baltimore, Maryland created first \nAfrican-American law firm on Wall Street and led the first African-\nAmerican owned company with annual revenue exceeding $1 billion.\n  Thurgood Marshall (1908-1993) of Baltimore, Maryland served as chief \ncounsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople Legal Defense and Educational Fund (NAACP-LDF) at a time when \nthe NAACP brought, argued and won Brown v. Board of Education, the \nseminal 1954 civil rights Supreme Court case. He went on to serve his \nnation as a federal Appellate Court judge, Solicitor General, and the \nfirst African-American member of the United States Supreme Court.\n  I am also sorry to report that Maryland recently lost one of its \nlegal and political leaders when Judge Harry A. Cole passed away \nearlier this month. Judge Harry A. Cole was both the first African-\nAmerican to hold the office of an Assistant State Attorney General in \nMaryland, and the first African-American named to the Maryland Court of \nAppeals, which is my State's highest court. During his fourteen year \ntenure on the Court of Appeals, Judge Cole distinguished himself with \nhis scholarly and independent opinions, and we will miss him dearly in \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, as this short account makes evident, Maryland is and \nhas been proud to be the home of some of America's greatest African-\nAmericans. These are people who did not let economic or racial barriers \nstop them from reaching their goals or achieving their dreams. These \noutstanding individuals, and many others from Maryland and across the \nUnited States, have opened doors and set high standards for later \ngenerations of African-Americans. Most importantly, however, these are \npeople who continue to serve as role models for all Americans.\n  Indeed, the State of Maryland continues to be blessed and enriched \nwith outstanding African-American leaders who have built on Maryland's \nrich African-American legacy. I speak here of such individuals as \nBaltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and NAACP President and CEO Kweisi Mfume.\n  I would like to observe that the State of Maryland is currently \nbenefiting from a continued growth in our African-American population. \nBetween 1990 and 1997, when the last set of complete figures were \navailable from the Census Bureau, the number of African-Americans \ncalling Maryland ``home'' grew to 1.4 million--an increase of 200,609 \npeople. This makes Maryland the state with the eighth largest African-\nAmerican population in the United States. Nearby Prince George's County \nwas second in the nation in terms of growth during this seven-year \nperiod with 68,325 new African-American residents.\n  Mr. President, in closing, Maryland is fortunate to have such a rich \nlegacy of African-American leadership as well as a growing population \nof young African-American men and women to whom this legacy will \nprovide inspiration and examples. As I noted at the outset, Dr. Woodson \nbelieved in looking back in order to look forward. As I look back at \nthe deeds and accomplishments of the Marylanders listed above, and of \nthe many outstanding African-Americans who have contributed to American \nscience, engineering, abolitionism, literature, religion, theater, \neducation, civil rights, law, business, athletics, diplomacy and \npolitics, I see much to inspire our forward march into the next \ncentury, during which I hope we will eradicate forever the scourge of \nprejudice and racial bias from our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2003-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2004-S2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEATH OF LAUREN ALBERT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on February 18, 1999, Pennsylvania lost \none of its finest citizens, with the death of Lauren Albert.\n  I had the pleasure to know Mrs. Albert. She was the mother of three \nwonderful children, Stuart, Elliot, and Emily and the husband of one of \nPennsylvania's finest orthopedic surgeons, Todd J. Albert, M.D. For \nseventeen years, Lauren had served at the side of Richard I. Rothman at \nthe Rothman Institute and Reconstructive Orthopedic Associates. She was \na leader in our community.\n  As fate would have it, Lauren and her husband Todd were traveling \nwith eight other Pennsylvanians, including my son Shanin and his wife \nTracey. Also on the trip were Barbara and Richard Barnhart, Leslie and \nAl Boris and Jaimie and David Field.\n  Lauren was killed when the Land Rover in which she was a passenger \nwas caused to tumble down a mountainside of the High Atlas Mountains. \nHer husband and the Barnharts were passengers in the same vehicle.\n  I was notified of the accident as soon as the party had access to a \ntelephone. Contemporaneously, the Department of State, our Ambassador \nin Rabat, Edward Gabriel and our Consul general in Morocco, Evan G. \nReade, Casablanca, were notified.\n  Consul Reade, accompanied by other Embassy officials, immediately \nflew to meet the Americans in nearby Ouerzazate.\n  Although Consul Reade had been in Morocco for only 8 months, he \nimmediately assumed control of the situation and worked to solve \ncomplex and pressing problems.\n  First, there was a significant question of the medical stability of \nthe three surviving passengers. Consul Reade and I worked in tandem \nwith the Department of Defense, particularly Colonel Joe Reynes, \nExecutive Secretary to the Secretary of Defense. Over the next several \nhours, well through the night, local time, Colonel Reynes worked \ndiligently to place a military medical aircraft in Europe on alert to \nfly to Morocco. An enormous amount of work was undertaken with our \nmilitary's European command, the State Department, Moroccan officials, \nConsul Reade in Ouerzazate and Ambassador Gabriel in Rabat.\n  In the final analysis, a medical evacuation was not needed. \nNonetheless, it was most reassuring to know that our military could be \ncounted upon to assist.\n  Second, Consul Reade, working in connection with others in the State \nDepartment, were instrumental in accomplishing the rapid evacuation of \nthe three injured passengers as well as the remainder of the party from \nMorocco. This was accomplished through detailed coordination and \nairport assistance for four commercial flights enabling all to return \nhome safely by 5:30 p.m. on the following day.\n  Third, Consul Reade arranged for the return of the body of Lauren \nAlbert to Pennsylvania. For numerous reasons, this process is highly \ncomplicated. Consul Reade arranged, with the assistance of the Morocco \nofficials, to have Mrs. Albert's body returned to Pennsylvania on \nSunday, February 21, 1999. This permitted a timely funeral and burial, \nwhich was very important to the Albert family.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize the superb assistance of Lt. Colonel \nDriss Ferar, Commandant of the Morocco Police in the Ouerzazate region. \nColonel Ferar was notified of the accident within minutes. He sped to \nthe scene in the High Atlas Mountains, an hour and\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\na half away from his headquarters. He immediately assumed control and \neffectuated the safe return of the party to Ouerzazate that night. \nColonel Ferar made sure that the entire party was comfortable and led \nDr. Albert, the tour director, and my son to his office which served as \na center for all the operations that evening and well into the night. \nColonel Ferar worked on the matter without interruption and without \nattending to any of his other important duties until 2:00 a.m. In \naddition to offering his valuable assistance in all aspects of this \ntragedy, Colonel Ferar was also unfailingly courteous and helpful. He \nhad his family make dinner for all of the concerned, which was brought \ninto the Police Headquarters. He offered his wisdom and counsel to Dr. \nAlbert. Since the party has returned to the United States, Colonel \nFerar has forwarded a gift to the Albert family.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning S. 4, the military pay and benefits bill. Senator Warner, \nthe esteemed new chairman of the Armed Service Committee, has begun \nwhat I'm sure will be a distinguished tenure by addressing an issue of \ncritical importance. I don't know if there is a more vital resource in \nthis nation than its men and women in uniform.\n  Without question, certain services have a recruiting and retention \nproblem. For a variety of reasons, officers and enlisted members are \nleaving the Army, Navy, and Air Force in droves, and these services are \nhaving problems bringing new people on board. Serious questions remain \nunresolved about the cause of this problem, or its best solution, yet \nwe will probably vote out the bill this week without those answers, and \nwith little concern for its fiscal impact.\n  I am extremely concerned that this bill came out of the Armed \nServices Committee without the benefit of a single hearing and with \nlittle understanding of its effects on the budget. The rush to pass \nthis bill is perplexing. We would normally address military pay raises, \nretirement reform, and the other bill provisions during consideration \nof the annual defense authorization bill. This course only makes more \nsense given the uncertainty we face regarding the budget impact of this \nbill. It would give the Senate ample opportunity to answer the myriad \nquestions surrounding the bill's cost and budget implications.\n  Mr. President, there are some significant budget concerns raised by \nthis bill. It increases both discretionary spending and entitlement \ncosts, and all of its costs are heavily back loaded.\n  According to CBO, S. 4 increases discretionary spending by $40.8 \nbillion over the next 10 years. In addition, the bill's costs rise each \nyear, reaching $6.5 billion by 2009, and would continue to rise for a \nnumber of years after that.\n  The bill increases entitlement costs by $13.2 billion over the next \n10 years. Again, this figure does not fully reflect the eventual price \ntag as costs rise over time. CBO estimates that when the provisions of \nS. 4 are fully phased in, the entitlement costs for pensions would \nresult in increased costs of $5 billion a year. Similarly, the \nadditional costs for so-called readjustment benefits, essentially \neducation benefits, would rise, and by 2009 would increase by $2.5 \nbillion per year.\n  According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, when fully \nin effect, the bill as a whole would cost at least $15 billion per \nyear, and possibly more. Most notably, none, let me repeat that, Mr. \nPresident, none of this is offset.\n  Due to these effects on the budget, the bill is subject to not one, \nbut three 60-vote points of order: (1) It exceeds the Armed Services \nCommittee's allocation for entitlement spending for fiscal years 1999 \nthrough fiscal year 2003; (2) It breaches the revenue floor by \ndecreasing income tax revenues from the Thrift Savings Program \nprovision; and (3) It has PAYGO problems because none of the new \nmandatory spending and tax revenue losses are offset.\n  Mr. President, strictly from a budget point of view, regardless of \nthe pay and pension policies in the bill, this can be fairly \ncharacterized as a budget buster. An eventual cost of $15 billion per \nyear is large, and at the very least should be considered as part of an \noverall budget, not rushed through before we have passed a budget \nresolution.\n  There are other concerns, Mr. President. The biggest question is \nwhether this bill will actually improve recruitment and retention. Just \nthis week, the General Accounting Office offered preliminary data on a \nstudy showing that money has been overstated as a factor affecting \ndecisions to stay in or leave the military. Instead, GAO found, in a \nsurvey of more than 700 service members, that issues like a lack of \nspare parts; concerns with the health care system; increased \ndeployments; and dissatisfaction with military leaders have at least as \nmuch effect on retention, if not more, than money. GAO is expected to \nfinish the report in June.\n  Not only that. The Defense Department and the Congressional Budget \nOffice are expected to have their own reports in the coming weeks and \nmonths. Why not wait until then? Let's make sure we're doing the right \nthings to maintain the world's best armed forces.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to address some specific provisions in the \nbill. As we are all now well aware, the military pension system was \nchanged in 1986. At the time, many, including those in President \nReagan's Defense Department, argued that the pension system encouraged \nmany of our servicemembers to leave the services early. They had the \nbenefit of several years of study and hearings to reach that \nconclusion.\n  My late colleague from Wisconsin, the former Secretary of Defense Les \nAspin, devoted much of his career to shaping the world's best and most \nfeared military. At the time we changed the military pension system, he \nvoiced considerable concern that the pension benefits were so generous \nto those with 20 years of service, and still at a relatively young age, \nthat they provided incentive to leave for the private sector, rather \nthan stay in the service.\n  Our former Armed Services Committee Chairman, Sam Nunn, stated that \n``returning to the old system would reduce--not strengthen--the \nwillingness of personnel to remain in the service.'' That is a heady \nstatement from a colleague whose judgment on defense issues is still \nwidely respected by those serving in this body today.\n  Just back in October, then-Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, the \ncommittee's ranking member, proclaimed that any change to the pension \nsystem should be subject to ``careful analysis.'' As yet, I haven't \nseen one. And I would like to see that careful analysis before moving \nforward with this bill.\n  I have heard from the men and women out on the front lines. According \nto what I've heard, they are leaving because of ever-increasing \ndeployments to uncertain destinations, ever-widening time away from \ntheir families, and dwindling advancement opportunities. Like anyone \nelse, they want to see a better quality of life.\n  I won't disagree with the view that many servicemembers need a raise. \nAnd I firmly believe that they should receive one, especially the \nenlisted folks, many of whom could be getting more money by flipping \nburgers at the closest fast food joint. These men and women have chosen \nto represent our country. They deserve to be paid adequately.\n  Ultimately, though, Mr. President, too many questions about this bill \nremain unanswered. I, and I hope many of my colleagues, would like to \nknow how this bill will affect our budget now and in the future. We \njust extricated ourselves from a budget quagmire. Shouldn't we have all \nthe answers about a bill that will cost $55 billion over the next 10 \nyears before we vote on it? I just seems like common sense\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nto me. If we were to find that this bill won't harm Social Security and \nother important programs, and it will actually improve recruitment and \nretention, I would support it fully. Short of those answers, I cannot \nsupport putting our nation's budget on the precipice of disaster.\n  Mr. President, we have time this year to hold hearings; to hear from \nofficers and enlisted men and women; to hear from service chiefs; to \nreceive expert studies. There is no reason to rush this important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2005-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT (CZMA) \n   FOR FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the Biennial Report to Congress on the \nAdministration of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of the Office \nof the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for fiscal years \n1996 and 1997.

A bill to provide that ``Know Your Customer'' regulations \nproposed by the Federal banking agencies may not take effect unless \nsuch regulations are specifically authorized by a subsequent Act of \nCongress, to require a comprehensive study and report to the Congress \non various economic and privacy issues raised by the proposed \nregulations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             the financial institutions privacy act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``American \nFinancial Institutions Privacy Act of 1999.'' This legislation will \ndelay the implementation of the ``Know Your Customer'' regulations \nproposed by the federal banking agencies. Additionally, this \nlegislation would require these agencies to perform a comprehensive \nstudy, to be submitted to Congress in 180 days, on the privacy, freedom \nof association and economic issues implicated by these regulations. \nOnly with Congressional authorization will these regulations be allowed \nto take effect.\n  These regulations mandate that banks identify each customer, find out \nthe normal source and use of his or her funds and then watch \ntransactions in the account to see if they deviate from ``normal'' and \n``expected'' patterns. If the unexpected transactions seem \n``suspicious'' banks are required under current law to report them to \nthe Suspicious Activity Reporting System, a federal database that can \nbe searched by the Internal Revenue Service, bank regulators, the FBI \nand other federal agencies.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from my constituents expressing great \nconcern over the privacy implications of these regulations, and I think \na resolution recently adopted by the Vermont House best expresses the \nconcerns of Vermonters. The resolution states,\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\n``. . .the regulation will result in a substantial invasion of privacy \nand an illegal search in violation of innocent customers' rights. . . \n.'' I will include a complete copy of this resolution in the Record.\n  The stated purpose behind these rules is to guard the banking system \nagainst harm from those who would launder money from drugs and other \ncriminal activities. This is an admirable goal and one that is \nimportant in our continuing battle against crime. However, these \nregulations have moved beyond just a tool used to combat crime and into \nthe realm where the government needs to know all of your personal, \nfinancial information. This is an unacceptable change.\n  Mr. President, the study is a necessary part of this legislation and \nwill give Congress the factual basis to evaluate the effects of this \nregulation on people's privacy and freedom of association, as well as \nits economic implications. These facts will allow Congress to properly \nevaluate the regulations and reach a final determination on the \nregulation's ultimate fate. The study will also give the federal \nbanking agencies time to consider clarifications to the regulations, or \nrescind them.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of \nthe American Financial Institutions Privacy Act of 1999 and help stop \nthis privacy infringement on all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      State of Vermont--J.R.H. 35\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), \n     the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the \n     Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the Federal Reserve \n     have proposed to issue a new regulation requiring banks to \n     develop and maintain ``Know Your Customer'' programs, and\n       Whereas, as proposed, the regulation would require each \n     bank to develop a program designed to determine the identity \n     of its customers, determine its customers' sources of funds, \n     determine the normal and expected transactions of its \n     customers, monitor account activity for transactions that are \n     inconsistent with those normal and expected transactions, and \n     report any transactions of its customers that are suspicious, \n     and\n       Whereas, in order to carry out the proposed regulation, \n     banks will be forced to probe into the legitimate activities \n     of its customers and into the sensitive private affairs of \n     its customers, and\n       Whereas, the proposed ``Know Your Customer'' program would \n     substantially change the relationship between banks and their \n     customers, and\n       Whereas, the regulation will result in a substantial \n     invasion of privacy and an illegal search in violation of \n     innocent customers' rights under the constitutions of both \n     the United States and Vermont, and\n       Whereas, the proposed regulation is clearly beyond the \n     scope of authority granted the agencies by Congress, now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives:\n       That the FDIC should not be allowed to issue this ``Know \n     Your Customer'' regulation, and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send a \n     copy of this resolution to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the \n     Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, the \n     banking committee of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the banking committee of the United States \n     Senate and Vermont's congressional delegation.\n       Which was read and, in the Speaker's discretion, placed on \n     the Calendar for action tomorrow under Rule 52.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Lieberman, and \n        Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 468. A bill to improve the effectiveness and performance of \nFederal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal financial \nassistance application and reporting requirements, and improve the \ndelivery of services to the public; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999'', \nlegislation that was championed in the previous Congress by my friend \nand predecessor, Senator John Glenn. As a Governor, I supported this \nbill as an important step toward detangling the web of duplicative \nfederal grants available to States, localities and community \norganizations. As a Senator, I am pleased to pick it up where Senator \nGlenn left off. I would also like to thank Senator Thompson, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Durbin for joining me as original cosponsors of \nthis bill.\n  Scores of programs, often administered by the same federal agency, \nhave similar purposes but are subject to different application and \nreporting requirements. This unnecessary duplication of effort wastes \ntime, paper, and does nothing to improve program performance for the \nbenefit of our constituents. The Federal Financial Assistance \nManagement Improvement Act is intended to streamline the grant \napplication process, allowing those who serve their communities to \nfocus on the job at hand--not on page after page of paperwork. The \nlegislation directs federal agencies to simplify and coordinate the \napplication requirements of related programs. The result, I hope, will \nbe service to the public which is better, faster and more effective \nthan before.\n  In other words, today in this country, if you want to apply for \nFederal assistance, every agency has a different form. If you have to \nreport on what you are doing with that Federal assistance, every agency \nhas a different form. We want to make those forms uniform across the \nboard, which we know will relieve a lot of pressure and paperwork on \nthe folks who are involved in these programs.\n  Another important component of this bill is the requirement that \nagencies develop a process to allow State and local governments and \nnon-profit organizations to apply for and report on the use of funds \nelectronically. Using the Internet as a substitute for cumbersome \npaperwork is a welcome innovation in the way the federal government \ndoes business, and I am pleased that the Federal Financial Assistance \nManagement Improvement Act is leading the effort.\n  We need to bring technology into the Federal Government and allow \npeople to do the same thing that they do when they are dealing with the \nprivate sector.\n  This bill was crafted in the last Congress by Senator Glenn after \nbipartisan, bicameral negotiations with the Administration, and while I \nwas sorry that it was not enacted before the end of the 105th Congress, \nI am pleased to be able to introduce it today. The legislation is \nsupported by the National Governors' Association and others in the \nState and local government and non-profit community because of the real \npotential it has to reduce red tape and improve services to our \ncommunities. I urge all my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support from State and local government organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Federal \nFinancial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999. As a strong \nbeliever in our federalist system of government, I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation, which will cut red tape and \nwaste in Federal grant and other assistance programs that impact State \nand local government, as well as nonprofit organizations. It is fitting \nthat my good friend from Ohio, George Voinovich, is now providing \nleadership on this effort in the Senate. As a governor and Chairman of \nthe National Governors' Association, George Voinovich strongly \nsupported this bill from outside Congress. While we reported the bill \nout of the Governmental Affairs Committee and passed it through the \nSenate last year, unfortunately it did not become law. It's time to get \nthe job done.\n  This legislation will improve the performance of Federal grant and \nother\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nassistance programs by streamlining their application, administration, \nand reporting requirements for grant recipients--including State, local \nand tribal governments and nonprofit organizations. The Federal \nagencies, with guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, would \ndevelop plans within 18 months to streamline application, \nadministrative and reporting requirements, develop uniform applications \nfor related programs, develop and expand the use of electronic \napplications and reporting via the Internet, demonstrate interagency \ncoordination in simplifying requirements for cross-cutting programs, \nand set annual goals to further the purposes of the Act.\n  Agencies would then consult with outside parties in developing their \nplans. The agencies would submit their plans and annual reports to the \nDirector of OMB and to Congress, and they could be made a part of other \nmanagement reports required under law. In addition to overseeing and \ncoordinating agency activities, OMB would develop more common rules to \ncut across programs and would develop a release form to allow grant \ninformation to be shared across programs.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by many organizations representing \nour State and local government partners, including the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nthe National League of Cities, the Council of State Governments, and \nthe National Association of Counties. It is a good government, common \nsense initiative. Let's pull together and pass this bill into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \n        Baucus):\n  S. 469. A bill to encourage the timely development of a more cost \neffective United States commercial space transportation industry, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           commercial space transportation cost reduction act\n\n         Council of State Governments, International City/County \n           Management Association, National Association of \n           Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures, \n           National Governors' Association, National League of \n           Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n                                                February 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Thompson, Lieberman, Voinovich, and Durbin: \n     On behalf of the elected leaders of the respective \n     organizations of Governors, legislators, mayors, county \n     officials, and city managers, we are pleased that you will be \n     introducing the Federal Financial Assistance Management \n     Improvement Act. This bill was passed by the Senate last year \n     and has the strong support of all our organizations.\n       The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget \n     (OMB) to reevaluate its array of over 75 crosscutting \n     regulations that govern all funds going to state and local \n     governments. We support a requirement that OMB establish lead \n     agencies to develop uniform common rules for crosscutting \n     regulations, base data information for multiple grants to the \n     same state or local government, and electronic filing of most \n     intergovernmental paperwork.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership for these reforms and \n     urge all Senators to support passage of your bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Thomas R. Carper, State of Delaware, Chairman, \n           National Governors' Association; Representative Dan \n           Blue, North Carolina State House of Representatives and \n           President, National Conference of State Legislatures; \n           Commissioner Betty Lou Ward, Wake County, North \n           Carolina, President, National Association of Counties; \n           Mayor Deedee Corradini, Salt Lake City, Utah, \n           President, The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Bryce (Bill) \n           Stuart, City Manager, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, \n           President, International City/County Management \n           Association; Mayor Clarence Anthony, South Bay, \n           Florida, President, National League of Cities; Senator \n           Kenneth McClintock, Puerto Rico Senate, Chairman, \n           Council of State Governments.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I take the time today, Mr. President and my colleagues, \nto introduce a bill which I happen to think addresses a very important \nissue that this Nation is facing; and that is the question of trying to \ndevise a system where the United States can continue to be the world's \nleader in the space launch business.\n  Every day, every month, more and more satellites around the world are \nbeing put into service. I daresay that most people really do not follow \nthe details of how this is accomplished, but I do know that over the \nlast several months people in this country have heard a great deal \nabout Chinese rockets, Ukrainian rockets, Russian rockets and all the \nproblems that they have been involved with related to the U.S. \naerospace industry.\n  One may wonder, why would a U.S. company have to use a Ukraine launch \nvehicle or a Chinese launch vehicle or a Russian launch vehicle or a \nEuropean launch vehicle in order to launch a U.S. satellite to serve \nthe technological and communications needs of the world. The reason is \nnot that hard to figure out when you look at the fact that these \ncountries that I just mentioned are not countries that are under the \nsame economic obligations that we are. Many of those are not free \nmarket economies. Many are still government-run economies. Many of \nthose countries have governments that have put a great deal of money in \ntheir launch industries and are now able to provide those launch \nvehicles for use at a cutrate or subsidized price.\n  I do not think that is particularly good for our country to have to \nbuy space transportation on a Ukraine rocket to launch a U.S. \nsatellite. When those rockets malfunction, then we are in a problem \narea trying to tell them based on our technological expertise why the \nfailure happened. Our companies could get into trouble because of the \nrisk that they are sharing with them technology that could be used for \nmilitary purposes.\n  So I, for one, do not think I would want to drive a Ukrainian car let \nalone ride in a Ukrainian rocket. But that is what is happening because \nof a situation where we do not have enough access in the private \nindustry to U.S.-built space transportation vehicles that can launch \nU.S.-built satellites for communications purposes.\n  We have learned that one of the reasons is the fact that there is \ninadequate private sector funding for U.S. companies to engage in \nbuilding space transportation vehicles for this purpose. It is, of \ncourse, a high-risk business. This is much more risky than building a \nship or building a car or building just about anything else. A lot can \ngo wrong. So it is a high risk. And there is inadequate funding in the \nprivate sector.\n  To solve this problem, what do you do? Do you make the Government \ntake it over? Do you make the Government own the launch vehicles and \nmake the Government pay for the building of the launch vehicles? In our \nsociety the answer is no. But I think that the legislation that I am \nintroducing today, along with Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, sets up \na program which would be a loan guarantee program where the U.S. \nGovernment can pattern in the space transportation industry what we \nhave done very successfully in the shipbuilding industry under what is \nknown as a Title XI shipbuilding loan guarantee program, where the \nFederal Government comes to a qualified builder who is having a \ndifficult time getting adequate financing because of the nature of the \nindustry, and that the Federal Government will be in a position to \nguarantee the loan to a company which company would go out into the \nprivate market and borrow the money but have the loan guaranteed by the \nFederal Government. Under that scenario, we have built literally \nhundreds and hundreds of vessels, probably thousands, through the Title \nXI loan guarantee program.\n  What I am proposing in the ``Commercial Space Transportation Cost \nReduction Act of 1999'' is to set up a loan guarantee program which \nwould be patterned after the Title XI Shipyard Loan Guarantee Program. \nWe would vest the Secretary of Transportation in our Government with \nthe administrative responsibilities for the program operations. The \nlegislation would initially provide up to $500 million of funding for \nthe loan guarantee program. That would represent the possibility of \ngenerating up to $5 billion in loans for U.S. space transportation \ncompanies to engage other U.S. companies and U.S. workers in building \nspace transportation vehicles for use in our society.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. And by having that type of a system, I think that we \nwould give our private companies the ability to compete with all of \nthese other companies in countries which have their governments \nsupporting them in these areas.\n  We have had a number of Senators who have expressed an interest in \nparticipating with us in this legislation. Let me just mention Senator \nLott, Senator Bacchus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Graham of Florida and \nSenator Landrieu of Louisiana. I hope--and now that the bill has been \nintroduced, that the Commerce Committee can have some hearings on it--\nthat we can continue to improve it and move forward with establishing \nsomething that will allow the private sector of the United States to \ncontinue to be, and even increase the ability to be, the world leader \nin space transportion. In particular, the ability to launch our \nsatellites with our vehicles and not have to rent space from the \nRussians or from the Chinese or from the Ukrainians or from any other \npart of the world. This is a vitally important industry, and the United \nStates should be the technological leader now and for the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States commercial space transportation \n     vehicle industry is an essential part of the national economy \n     and opportunities for U.S. commercial providers are growing \n     as international markets expand.\n       (2) The development of the U.S. commercial space \n     transportation vehicle industry is consistent with the \n     national security interests and foreign policy interests of \n     the United States.\n       (3) United States trading partners have been able to lower \n     their commercial space transportation prices aggressively \n     either through direct cash payments for commercially targeted \n     product development or with indirect benefits derived from \n     nonmarket economy status.\n       (4) Because United States incentives for space \n     transportation vehicle development have historically focused \n     on civil and military rather than commercial use, U.S. launch \n     costs have remained comparatively high, and U.S. launch \n     technology has not been commercially focused.\n       (5) As a result, the U.S. share of the world commercial \n     market has decreased from nearly 100% twenty years ago to \n     approximately 47% in 1998.\n       (6) In order to avoid undue reliance on foreign space \n     transportation services, the U.S. must strive to have \n     sufficient domestic capacity as well as the highest quality \n     and the lowest cost per service provided.\n       (7) A successful high quality, lower cost U.S. commercial \n     space transportation industry should also lead to substantial \n     U.S. taxpayer savings through collateral lower U.S. \n     government costs for its space access requirements.\n       (8) The key to maintaining United States leadership in the \n     world market is not another massive government program, but \n     rather provision of just enough government support on an \n     incremental and timely basis to enable the more cost \n     effective U.S. private sector to build lower-cost space \n     transportation vehicles.\n       (9) Private sector companies across the United States are \n     already attempting to develop a variety of lower-cost space \n     transportation vehicles, but lack of sufficient private \n     financing, particularly in the early stages of \n     development, has proven to be a major obstacle, an \n     obstacle our trading partners have removed by providing \n     direct access to government funding.\n       (10) Given the strengths and creativity of private industry \n     in the United States, a more effective alternative to the \n     approach of our trading partners is for the U.S. government \n     to provide limited incentives, including loan guarantees \n     which would help qualifying U.S. private-sector companies \n     secure otherwise unavailable private ``bridge'' financing for \n     the critical developmental stages of the project, while at \n     the same time keeping government involvement at a minimum.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       Therefore the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure availability of otherwise unavailable private \n     sector ``bridge'' financing for U.S. private sector \n     development of commercial space transportation vehicles with \n     launch costs significantly below current levels;\n       (2) and, as a result--\n       (A) to avoid undue reliance on foreign space transportation \n     services;\n       (B) to reduce substantially United States Government space \n     transportation expenditures;\n       (C) to increase the international competitiveness of the \n     United States space industry;\n       (D) to encourage the growth of space-related commerce in \n     the United States and internationally; and\n       (E) to increase the number of high-value jobs in the United \n     States space-related industries.\n\n     SEC. 4.

UNITED STATES COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION \n                   VEHICLE INDUSTRY LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--There shall be a United \n     States Commercial Space Transportation Vehicle Industry Loan \n     Guarantee program to provide loan guarantees to support the \n     private development of multiple qualified United States \n     commercial space transportation vehicle providers with launch \n     costs significantly below current levels.\n       (b) Administration of Program.--The program shall be \n     carried out by the Secretary of Transportation under a \n     streamlined application process pursuant to the terms of this \n     Section and any regulations that may be promulgated \n     hereunder, in consultation with other U.S. Government \n     officials, and private sector representatives, as necessary, \n     to ensure fair, effective and timely program administration.\n       (c) Scope of Program.--\n       (1) Temporary Government Support.--The United States \n     Commercial Space Transportation Vehicle Industry Loan \n     Guarantee program is intended to provide loan guarantees to \n     support financing of qualified commercial space \n     transportation vehicle development ventures during their \n     startup phases and is not intended as a permanent source of \n     financing for such ventures. Applications for guarantees \n     under this program must include specific plans for the timely \n     transition from guaranteed financing to standalone private \n     sector financing as soon as the venture becomes commercially \n     viable.\n       (2) Exclusion of space launch sites.--The program does not \n     provide for loan guarantees pertaining to the construction, \n     reconstruction, or reconditioning of space launch sites.\n       (3) Exclusion of evolved expendable launch vehicle \n     program.--The United States Commercial Space Transportation \n     Vehicle Industry Loan Guarantee program shall not remove, \n     restrict, or replace funding provided by the Department of \n     Defense to commercial providers participating in the Evolved \n     Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program. Commercial \n     providers already receiving Department of Defense funding for \n     the development of specific expendable launch vehicles under \n     the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program shall not be \n     eligible to apply for loan guarantees pertaining to this same \n     program, under the United States Commercial Space \n     Transportation Vehicle Industry Loan Guarantee program.\n       (4) Small business set aside.--Depending upon the number of \n     applications, not less than ten percent and up to 20 percent \n     of the loan guarantee fund shall be set aside for small \n     businesses as defined by the Secretary. In no event shall a \n     single commercial provider be the sole beneficiary of loan \n     guarantees available under this Act.\n       (5) Competition encouraged on initiatives attempting to \n     meet unique u.s. government specifications.--When possible \n     and economically feasible, in order to allow U.S. taxpayers \n     to receive the benefits and disciplines of private sector \n     competition, the Secretary shall administer the loan \n     guarantee program to permit the participation of multiple \n     United States space transportation vehicle commercial \n     providers that are targeting unique U.S. government \n     specifications.\n       (6) Nondisclosure of confidential materials.--Materials \n     that are submitted by a United States commercial space \n     transportation vehicle provider to the Secretary in \n     connection with an application submitted under the United \n     States Commercial Space Transportation Vehicle Industry Loan \n     Guarantee program and deemed by the commercial provider to be \n     confidential, and that contain trade secrets or proprietary \n     commercial, financial, or technical information of a kind not \n     customarily disclosed to the public, shall not be disclosed \n     by the Secretary to persons other than Government officers, \n     employees or contractors notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law.\n       (d) Sunset.--This Act shall sunset 10 years from date of \n     enactment.\n\n     SEC. 102. FUNCTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       The Secretary shall carry out the following functions--\n       (a) Consultation.--Consultation, to the extent deemed \n     necessary for effective implementation of the Act with \n     appropriate federal agencies, Congressional, and space \n     transportation industry representatives, and members of the \n     risk management industry concerning--\n       (1) assessments of international competition, potential \n     markets for space transportation vehicles, and availability \n     of private investment captial;\n       (2) recommendations of commercial entities, partnerships, \n     joint ventures, or consortia regarding effective \n     implementation of the loan guarantee program; and,\n       (3) recommendations on how to make U.S. government space \n     access requirements more compatible with U.S. commercial \n     space transportation assets.\n       (b) Program Management.--Management of the loan guarantee \n     program consistent with the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 103. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) The Act authorizes an annual appropriation of the sum \n     of $400,000,000 to be deposited in a Fund to be used by the \n     Secretary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of \n     the Act. The Fund will be reduced by the Cost to the \n     Government (as defined) of each loan guarantee extended by \n     the Secretary as further described in Section 104(f). As an \n     Obligor releases its government guarantees on the schedule \n     agreed to up front with the Secretary, this Cost to the \n     Government shall be reduced or eliminated, thus replenishing \n     the Fund for new guarantees.\n\n     SEC. 104. AUTHORIZATION OF SECRETARY TO GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS\n\n       (a) Principal and Interest.--The Secretary is authorized to \n     guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, the \n     payment of the interest on, and the unpaid balance of the \n     principal of, any obligation which is eligible to be \n     guaranteed under this Act. A guarantee, or commitment to \n     guarantee, made by the Secretary under this Act shall cover \n     100 percent of the amount of the principal and interest of \n     the obligation.\n       (b) Security Interest.--No obligation shall be guaranteed \n     under this Act unless the obligor conveys or agrees to convey \n     to the Secretary a security interest such as the Secretary \n     may reasonably require to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Private Insurance.--If the Secretary determines that \n     other potential measures, as described in this Act, are not \n     sufficient to provide adequate security, the Secretary, as a \n     condition of processing or approving an application for \n     guarantee of an obligation, may require that the obligor \n     obtain private insurance with respect to a portion of the \n     government's risk of default by the obligor on the \n     obligation, including both the amount of the obligation still \n     outstanding and the accrued interest. Such private insurance \n     may be funded from the proceeds of any obligation guaranteed \n     under this Act. If the obligor fails to renew such private \n     insurance on a timely basis, the Secretary may take such \n     action as deemed necessary, with regard to seizure of \n     security interest conveyed by the obligor or the assessment \n     of additional fees to the obligor, to ensure that the \n     appropriate insurance renewal is obtained without delay.\n       (d) Pledge of United States.--The full faith and credit of \n     the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees \n     made under this Act with respect to both principal and \n     interest, including interest, as may be provided for in the \n     guarantee, accruing between the date of default under a \n     guaranteed obligation and the payment in full of the \n     guarantee.\n       (e) Proof of Obligations.--Any guarantee, or commitment to \n     guarantee, made by the Secretary under this Act shall be \n     conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligations for \n     such guarantee, and the validity of any guarntee, or \n     commitment to guarantee, so made shall be incontestable. \n     Notwithstanding an assumption of an obligation by the \n     Secretary under section 106 (a) or (b) of this Act, the \n     validity of the guarantee of an obligation made by the \n     Secretary under this Act is unaffected and the guarntee \n     remains in full force and effect.\n       (f) Determination of Estimated Benefit and Cost to \n     Government for Loan Guarantee Program.--\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n       (1) The Secretary shall in consultation with the private \n     risk management industry and consistent with the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a et seq.)--\n       (A) establish in accordance with this subsection a system \n     of risk categories for obligations guaranteed under this Act, \n     that categoriezes the relative risk of guarantees made under \n     this Act with respect to the risk factors set forth in \n     paragraph (3); and\n       (B) determine for each of the risk categories a risk rate \n     equivalent to the cost of obligations in the category, \n     expressed as a percentage of the amount guaranteed under this \n     Act for obligations in the category.\n       (2) Before making a guarantee under this section for an \n     obligation, the Secretary shall apply the risk factors set \n     forth in paragraph (3) to place the obligation in a risk \n     category established under paragraph (1)(A).\n       (3) The risk factors referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) \n     are the following:\n       (A) The technological feasibility of the proposed venture \n     and the magnitude of its projected overall space launch cost \n     reduction;\n       (B) The period for which an obligation is to be guaranteed, \n     such period not exceeding 12 years;\n       (C) The amount of obligations which are guaranteed or to be \n     guaranteed, in relation to the Total Capital Requirement of \n     the proposed venture;\n       (D) The financial condition of the applicant;\n       (E) The availability of private financing, including \n     guarantees (other than the guarantees issued pursuant to this \n     Act) and private insurance, for the proposed venture;\n       (F) The projected commercial and government utilization of \n     each space transportation vehicle or other article to be \n     financed by debt guaranteed pursuant to this Act (including \n     any contracts, letters of intent, or other expressions of \n     agreement under which the applicant will provide launch \n     services using a space transportation vehicle or other \n     article financed by debt guaranteed pursuant to this Act);\n       (G) The adequacy of collateral provided in exchange for a \n     guarantee issued pursuant to this act;\n       (H) The management and operating experience of the \n     applicant;\n       (I) Commercial viability of the business plan for the \n     venture of the Obligor;\n       (J) The extent of private equity capital in the project;\n       (K) The applicant's plans for achieving a transition from \n     Government-guaranteed financing to private financing;\n       (L) The likelihood that the venture would serve an \n     identifiable national interest;\n       (M) The likelihood that the successful completion of the \n     project would result in savings that would offset anticipated \n     Government expenditures for space-related activities;\n       (N) The likelihood that the project will open new markets \n     or result in the development of significant new technologies;\n       (O) other relevant criteria; and\n       (4) The amount of appropriated funds required by the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 in advance of the \n     Secretary's issuance of a guarantee of an obligation, or a \n     commitment to guarantee an obligation, may be provided, in \n     whole or in part, by a non-Federal source and deposited by \n     the Secretary in the financing account established under the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 for obligation guarantees \n     issued by the Secretary. These non-Federal source funds may \n     be in lieu of or combined with Federal funds appropriated for \n     the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990. The non-Federal source funds \n     deposited into that financing account shall be held and \n     applied by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of \n     the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, in the same manner as \n     that legislation controls the use and disposition of \n     Federally appropriated funds. Non-Federal source funds must \n     be paid to the Secretary in cash prior to the issuance of any \n     guarantee or commitment to guarantee an obligation. The \n     payment of said non-Federal source funds shall not, in any \n     way, relive any entity from its responsibility to meet any \n     other provision of this Act or its implementing regulations \n     relating to the application for, issuance of, or \n     administration of a guarantee of an obligation.\n       (5) In this subsection, the term ``cost'' has the meaning \n     given that term in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 \n     U.S.C. 661a).\n\n     SEC. 105.

The aggregate principal amount of \n     obligations which have more than one space transportation \n     vehicle as security for the guarantee of the Secretary under \n     this Act may equal, but not exceed, the sum of the principal \n     amount of obligations permissible with respect to each space \n     transportation vehicle.\n       (2) If the security for the guarantee of an obligation by \n     the Secretary under this Act relates to more than one space \n     transportation vehicle, such obligation may have the latest \n     maturity date permissible under subsection (b) of this \n     section with respect to any of such space transportation \n     vehicles: Provided, that the Secretary may require such \n     payments of principal, prior to maturity, with respect to all \n     related obligations as he deems necessary in order to \n     maintain adequate security for the guarantee.\n       (d) Restrictions.--\n       (1) Restriction on used space transportation vehicles.--No \n     commitment to guarantee, or guarantee of an obligation may be \n     made by the Secretary under this Act for the purchase of a \n     used space transportation vehicle unless--\n       (A) the used space transportation vehicle will be \n     reconstructed or reconditioned in the United States and will \n     contribute to the development of the United States commercial \n     space transportation vehicle industry; and\n       (B) the reconstruction or reconditioning of the used space \n     transportation vehicle will result in a magnitude of \n     projected space transportation cost reduction comparable to \n     that which development of new space transportation vehicles \n     would be required to project, in order to be eligible for \n     guarantee of obligations.\n       (e) Application and Administrative Fees.--\n       (1) The Secretary may assess a fee for applications for \n     loan guarantees submitted under this Act and/or a fee for \n     administration of an obligation under this Act.\n       (2) Application fees under this subsection shall be \n     assessed and collected at the time a U.S. commercial space \n     transportation vehicle provider submits an application for \n     loan guarantees under this Act. Administrative fees under \n     this section shall be assessed and collected not later than \n     the date of issuance of the debt guaranteed pursuant to this \n     Act.\n       (3) Administrative fees collected under this subsection \n     shall not exceed one-eighth of one percent of the guaranteed \n     amount of the face value of the debt covered by the \n     guarantee.\n       (4) A fee paid under this subsection is generally not \n     refundable. However, an obligor shall receive credit for the \n     amount paid for the remaining term of the guaranteed \n     obligation if the obligation is refinanced and guaranteed \n     under this Act after such refinancing.\n       (5) A fee paid under this subsection shall be included in \n     the amount of the actual cost of the obligation guaranteed \n     under this Act and is eligible to be financed under this Act.\n       (6) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary for salaries and expenses to carry out the \n     responsibilities under this title.\n       (f) Additional Requirements.--Obligations guaranteed under \n     this Act and agreements relating thereto shall contain such \n     other provisions with respect to the protection of the \n     financial security interests of the United States as the \n     Secretary may, in his or her discretion, prescribe.\n\n     SEC. 106. DEFAULTS.\n\n       (a) Rights of Obligee.--In the event of a default, which \n     has continued for thirty days, in any payment by the obligor \n     of principal or interest due under an obligation guaranteed \n     under this Act, the obligee or his agent shall have the right \n     to demand (unless the Secretary shall, upon such terms as may \n     be provided in the obligation or related agreements, prior to \n     that demand, have assumed\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\n     the obligor's rights and duties under the obligation and \n     agreements and shall have made any payments in default), at \n     or before the expiration of such period as may be specified \n     in the guarantee or related agreements, but not later than \n     ninety days from the date of such default, payment by the \n     Secretary of the unpaid principal amount of such obligation \n     and of the unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment. \n     Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or \n     related agreements, but not later than thirty days from the \n     date of such demand, the Secretary shall promptly pay to the \n     obligee or his agent the unpaid principal amount of said \n     obligation and unpaid interest thereon to the date of \n     payment: Provided, That the Secretary shall not be required \n     to make such payment if prior to the expiration of said \n     period he shall find that there was no default by the \n     obligor in the payment of principal or interest or that \n     such default has been remedied prior to any such demand.\n       (b) Notice of Default.--In the event of a default under a \n     mortgage, loan agreement, or other security agreement between \n     the obligor and the Secretary, the Secretary may upon such \n     terms as may be provided in the obligation or related \n     agreement, either:\n       (1) assume the obligor's rights and duties under the \n     agreement, make any payment in default, and notify the \n     obligee or the obligee's agent of the default and the \n     assumption by the Secretary; or\n       (2) notify the obligee or the obligee's agent of the \n     default, and the obligee or the obligee's agent shall have \n     the right to demand at or before the expiration of such \n     period as may be specified in the guarantee or related \n     agreements, but not later than 60 days from the date of such \n     notice, payment by the Secretary of the unpaid principal \n     amount of said obligation and of the unpaid interest thereon. \n     Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or \n     related agreements, but not later than 30 days from the date \n     of such demand, the Secretary shall promptly pay to the \n     obligee or the obligee's agent the unpaid principal amount of \n     said obligation and unpaid interest thereon to the date of \n     payment.\n       (c) To Complete, Sell or Operate Property.--In the event of \n     any payment or assumption by the Secretary under subsection \n     (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary shall have all \n     rights in any security held by him relating to his guarantee \n     of such obligations as are conferred upon him under any \n     security agreement with the obligor. Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, \n     or disposal of property by the United States, the Secretary \n     shall have the right, in his discretion, to complete, \n     recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, \n     operate, charter, or sell any property acquired by him \n     pursuant to a security agreement with the obligor. The terms \n     of the sale shall be as approved by the Secretary.\n       (d) Actions Against Obligor.--In the event of a default \n     under any guaranteed obligation or any related agreement, the \n     Secretary shall take such action against the obligor or any \n     other parties liable thereunder that, in his discretion, may \n     be required to protect the interests of the United States. \n     Any suit may be brought in the name of the United States or \n     in the name of the obligee and the obligee shall make \n     available to the United States all records and evidence \n     necessary to prosecute any such suit. The Secretary shall \n     have the right, in his discretion, to accept a conveyance of \n     Act to and possession of property from the obligor or other \n     parties liable to the Secretary, and may purchase the \n     property for an amount not greater than the unpaid principal \n     amount of such obligation and interest thereon. In the event \n     that the Secretary shall receive through the sale of property \n     an amount of cash in excess of the unpaid principal amount of \n     the obligation and unpaid interest on the obligation and the \n     expenses of collection of those amounts, the Secretary shall \n     pay the excess to the obligor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bond, \n        Mr. Graham, and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 470. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-exempt private activity bonds to be issued for highway \ninfrastructure construction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the highway innovation and cost savings act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President today, I am introducing legislation which \nwill allow the private sector to take a more active role in building \nand operating our nation's highway infrastructure. The Highway \ninnovation and Cost Savings Act will allow the private sector to gain \naccess to tax-exempt bond financing for a limited number of highway \nprojects. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nMoynihan, Warner, Bond, Graham, and Gorton have agreed to join me in \nthis effort.\n  In the United States, highway and bridge infrastructure is the \nresponsibility of the government. Governments build, own, and operate \npublic highways, roads and bridges. In many other countries, however, \nthe private sector, and private capital, construct and operate \nimportant facilities. These countries have found that increasing the \nprivate sector's role in major highway transportation projects offers \nopportunities for construction cost savings and more efficient \noperation. They also open the door for new construction techniques and \ntechnologies.\n  It is incumbent upon us to look at new and innovative ways to make \nthe most of limited resources to address significant needs. To help \nmeet the nation's infrastructure needs, we must take advantage of \nprivate sector resources by opening up avenues for the private sector \nto take the lead in designing, constructing, financing and operating \nhighway facilities.\n  A substantial barrier to private sector participation in the \nprovision of highway infrastructure is the cost of capital. Under \ncurrent Federal tax law, highways built and operated by the government \ncan be financed using tax exempt debt, but those built and operated by \nthe private sector, or those with substantial private sector \nparticipation, cannot. As a result, public/private partnerships in the \nprovision of highway facilities are unlikely to materialize, despite \nthe potential efficiencies in design, construction, and operation \noffered by such arrangements.\n  To increase the amount of private sector participation in the \nprovision of highway infrastructure, the tax code's bias against \nprivate sector participation must be addressed.\n  The Highway Innovation and Cost Savings Act creates a pilot program \naimed at encouraging the private sector to help meet the transportation \ninfrastructure needs for the 21st Century. It makes tax exempt \nfinancing available for a total of 15 highway privatization projects. \nThe total face value of bonds that can be issued under this program is \nlimited to 15 billion dollars.\n  The fifteen projects authorized under the program will be selected by \nthe Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of \nTreasury. To qualify under this program, projects selected must: serve \nthe general public; assist in evaluating the potential of the private \nsector's participation in the provision, maintenance, and operation of \nthe highway infrastructure of the United States; be on publicly-owned \nrights-of-way; revert to public ownership; and, come from a state's 20-\nyear transportation plan. These criteria ensure that the projects \nselected meet a state or locality's broad transportation goals.\n  This proposal was included in the Senate's version of last year's \ntransportation reauthorization bill. Unfortunately, it was dropped \nduring the conference with the House.\n  The bonds issued under this pilot program will be subject to the \nrules and regulations governing private activity bonds. Moreover, the \nbonds issued under the program will not count against a state's tax \nexempt volume cap.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by Project America, a coalition \ndedicated to improving our nation's infrastructure, the American \nConsulting Engineers Council, the Bond Market Association, the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association, the Institute of \nTransportation Engineers, and the ITS America.\n  I hope that this bill can be one in a series of new approaches to \nmeeting our substantial transportation infrastructure needs and will be \none of the approaches that will help us find more efficient methods to \ndesign and to build the nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important \ninitiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text and a \ndescription of the bill be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Highway Innovation and Cost \n     Savings Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAX-EXEMPT FINANCING OF QUALIFIED HIGHWAY \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Treatment as Exempt Facility Bond.--A bond described in \n     subsection (b) shall be treated as described in section \n     141(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\n     1986, except that section 146 of such Code shall not apply to \n     such bond.\n       (b) Bond Described.--\n       (1) In general.--A bond is described in this subsection if \n     such bond is issued after the date of enactment of this Act \n     as part of an issue--\n       (A) 95 percent or more of the net proceeds of which are to \n     be used to provide a qualified highway infrastructure \n     project, and\n       (B) to which there has been allocated a portion of the \n     allocation to the project under paragraph (2)(C)(ii) which is \n     equal to the aggregate face amount of bonds to be issued as \n     part of such issue.\n       (2) Qualified highway infrastructure projects.--\n       (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the term \n     ``qualified highway infrastructure project'' means a \n     project--\n       (i) for the construction or reconstruction of a highway, \n     and\n       (ii) designated under subparagraph (B) as an eligible pilot \n     project.\n       (B) Eligible pilot project.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall select \n     not more than 15 highway infrastructure projects to be pilot \n     projects eligible for tax-exempt financing.\n       (ii) Eligibility criteria.--In determining the criteria \n     necessary for the eligibility of pilot projects, the \n     Secretary of Transportation shall include the following:\n\n       (I) The project must serve the general public.\n       (II) The project is necessary to evaluate the potential of \n     the private sector's participation in the provision, \n     maintenance, and operation of the highway infrastructure of \n     the United States.\n       (III) The project must be located on publicly-owned rights-\n     of-way.\n       (IV) The project must be publicly owned or the ownership of \n     the highway constructed or reconstructed under the project \n     must revert to the public.\n       (V) The project must be consistent with a transportation \n     plan developed pursuant to section 134(g) or 135(e) of title \n     23, United States Code.\n\n       (C) Aggregate face amount of tax-exempt financing.--\n       (i) In general.--The aggregate face amount of bonds issued \n     pursuant to this section shall not exceed $15,000,000,000, \n     determined without regard to any bond the proceeds of which \n     are used exclusively to refund (other than to advance refund) \n     a bond issued pursuant to this section (or a bond which is a \n     part of a series of refundings of a bond so issued) if the \n     amount of the refunding bond does not exceed the outstanding \n     amount of the refunded bond.\n       (ii) Allocation.--The Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall \n     allocate the amount described in clause (i) among the \n     eligible pilot projects designated under subparagraph (B), \n     based on the extent to which--\n\n       (I) the projects use new technologies, construction \n     techniques, or innovative cost controls that result in \n     savings in building or operating the projects, and\n       (II) the projects address local, regional, or national \n     transportation needs.\n\n       (iii) Reallocation.--If any portion of an allocation under \n     clause (ii) is unused on the date which is 3 years after such \n     allocation, the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of the Treasury, may reallocate such \n     portion among the remaining eligible pilot projects.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Summary of Highway Innovation and Cost Savings Act\n\n       The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates a \n     substantial shortfall in funding for meeting our highway and \n     bridge infrastructure needs, even with the increased \n     investment levels under TEA 21. Closing the gap will require \n     full access to private capital as well as government \n     resources.\n       Existing tax laws discourage private investment in highway \n     infrastructure by making lower cost tax-exempt financing \n     unavailable for projects involving private equity investment \n     and private sector management and operating contracts.\n       Today, U.S. companies, which have invested billions of \n     dollars in foreign infrastructure projects, have participated \n     in only a few such projects in the United States. This pilot \n     program will demonstrate the benefits of bringing the full \n     resources of the private sector to bear on solving our own \n     nation's transportation needs for the 21st century.\n       Increasing the private-sector's role in major highway \n     transportation projects offers opportunities for construction \n     cost savings and more efficient operation, as well as opening \n     the door for new construction techniques and technologies.\n       A substantial barrier to private-sector participation in \n     the provision of highway infrastructure is the cost of \n     capital. Under current Federal tax law, highways built and \n     operated by government can be financed using tax exempt \n     financing but those built and operated by the private sector \n     cannot. As a result, public/private partnerships in the \n     provision of highway facilities are unlikely to materialize, \n     despite the potential efficiencies in design, construction, \n     and operation offered by such arrangements.\n       To increase the amount of private-sector participation in \n     the provision of highway infrastructure, the tax code's bias \n     against private-sector participation must be addressed, or \n     the benefits that the private-sector can bring to \n     infrastructure development will never be fully realized.\n       Highways, bridges, and tunnels are the only major category \n     of public infrastructure investment where projects involving \n     private participation (commonly referred to as private-\n     activity bonds) are denied access to tax-exempt debt \n     financing. See Attachment.\n\n\n                       pilot program under hicsa\n\n       Tax-exempt financing for up to 15 projects is made \n     available under this pilot program. The aggregate amount of \n     bonds issued under this program is limited to $15 billion.\n       Pilot projects are to be selected by the Secretary of \n     Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, based on the following criteria: the project must \n     serve the general public; the project must be necessary to \n     evaluate the potential of the private sector's participation \n     in the provision of highway transportation infrastructure; \n     the project must be located on a publicly-owned right-of-way; \n     the project must be publicly owned or the ownership of the \n     project must revert to the public; and the project must be \n     consistent with transportation plans developed under Title 23 \n     U.S.C.\n       Benefits resulting from the private sector participation \n     include those resulting from using alternative procurement \n     methodologies (including design-build and design and design-\n     built-operate-maintain contracting), shortening construction \n     schedules, reducing carrying costs, transferring greater \n     construction and operating risk to the private sector, and \n     obtaining from contractors long-term warranties and operating \n     guaranties.\n       Private investors and operators are encouraged under this \n     program to achieve efficiencies in design, construction, and \n     operation by affording them a share in the project's net \n     returns.\n       Projects will be subject to applicable environmental \n     requirements, prevailing state design and construction \n     standards and applicable state and local labor laws similar \n     to any other transportation facility financed with tax-exempt \n     bonds.\n       In the absence of this program, state and local governments \n     could still build these projects with conventional tax-exempt \n     financing, but at greater cost, on delayed time schedules, \n     without contribution of private equity capital and without \n     transferring to the private sector long term operating and \n     maintenance risk.\n\n                   TAX-EXEMPT BONDS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Private\n                                              Governmental    activity\n                                                  only          bonds\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFacility:\n  Airport...................................

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues to \nintroduce the Highway Innovation and Cost Savings Act of 1999. As you \nknow, last year on June 9, President Clinton signed into law, the \nTransportation Equity Act of 1998. TEA 21 established many new \nprograms, and a new budget treatment for highways. Throughout the \ndebate on TEA 21, I always focused on one goal: to be able to promise \nmy constituents that by 2003, the last year of TEA 21, our roads and \nbridges would be in better shape than they are today. In 1991, when \nISTEA passed, I was not able to make that pledge, because I knew that \nthe United States Department of Transportation had already estimated \nthat the level of funding in the ISTEA bill would not close the gap \nbetween highway needs and money to meet those needs.\n  TEA 21 was a landmark piece of legislation. TEA 21 established a new \nbudget category for funding the highway program which calls for funding \nlevels each year to match the intake of gas taxes the year prior. This \nwill be the first year we test the philosophy that we can commit to \nspending user fees exclusively to keep up the system. Unfortunately, \nthis amount of funding is still not enough to maintain the quality of \nroads in Florida or any other state. Traditional grant programs will \nnot be able to ever meet the infrastructure needs of the nation. We \nmust look at innovative solutions to our congestion problems. We need \nto use innovative methods to finance construction projects. We need to \nget the private sector involved in transportation improvements.\n  The distinguished Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and I worked very hard to develop and implement an innovative \nfinancing program called transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Act (TIFIA). TIFIA was incorporated into TEA 21 and is now \nbeing implemented by the United States Department of Transportation. \nThe program\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nwill extend federal credit to major, high cost transportation projects \nso as to enhance the project's ability to acquire private credit. The \nTIFIA program authorizes $530 million to be extended in federal credit \nover six years. The $530 million can be used to leverage up to $10.6 \nbillion in private loans and lines of credit. The TIFIA program offers \nthe sponsors of major transportation projects a means to amplify \nfederal resources up to twenty times. The objectives of the program are \nto stimulate additional nonfederal investment in our Nation's \ninfrastructure, and encourage private sector participation in \ntransportation projects.\n  Mr. President, I am very excited about the prospects for the TIFIA \nprogram. I believe that Congress must continue to look for new and \ninnovative ways to meet our nation's infrastructure needs. I believe \nthe bill we are introducing today, the Highway Innovation and Cost \nSavings Act of 1999 (HICSA), will be another tool in the financing \ntoolbox. HICSA creates a pilot program which allows tax-exempt \nfinancing for up to 15 transportation projects. The amount of bonds \nissued under the pilot will be limited to $15 billion. The projects for \nthe pilot will be selected by the Secretary on Transportation based on \nnumerous criteria.\n  HICSA will encourage more private sector investment in highway and \nbridge construction by making lower cost, tax-exempt financing \navailable. Under current law, other forms of public infrastructure, \nsuch as airports and seaports, are eligible for tax-exempt debt \nfinancing for projects with private capital. Highway, bridge, and \ntunnel projects are not eligible for this type of financing. Increasing \nthe private sector's role in major highway projects will not only help \nto close the needs gap, but will also open the door for new cost saving \ntechniques in construction and the use of new technologies.\n  U.S. companies continually invest billions of dollars in foreign \ninfrastructure projects, but have only participated in only a few \nprojects in the United States. Why should American companies feel the \nneed to invest their money overseas, when the United States is in such \ndesperate need of funds for roads. American companies want to invest in \nAmerican infrastructure. HICSA will demonstrate the benefits of private \nsector involvement in infrastructure projects, and will finally \nestablish the private sector as an honored partner in building the road \nto the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I want to be able to travel to Florida and tell my \nconstituents that in 2003, their roads and bridges will be in better \nshape than they are today. I believe with the combination of TEA 21 \ntraditional grant funding, new programs like TIFIA, and clearing \nhurdles in the tax code with HICSA, we will be well on our way. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee \nto pass this much needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 471. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 60-month limit on student loan interest deductions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR STUDENT LOAN INTEREST\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the tax deduction for student loan interest. Senators Baucus, \nJeffords, Collins, Cochran and Abraham are joining me in introducing \nthis legislation.\n  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax deduction for student loan \ninterest was eliminated. This action, done in the name of fiscal \nresponsibility, blatantly disregarded the duty we have to the education \nof our nation's students. This struck me and many of my colleagues as \nwrong. Since 1987, I have spearheaded the bipartisan effort to \nreinstate the tax deduction for student loan interest. In 1992, we \nsucceeded in passing the legislation to reinstate the deduction, only \nto have it vetoed as part of a larger bill with tax increases. Finally, \nafter ten long years, our determination and perseverance paid off. \nUnder the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we succeeded in reinstating the \ndeduction. In our success, we sent a clear message to students and \ntheir families across the country that the Congress of the United \nStates understands the financial hardships they face, and that we are \nwilling to assist them in easing those hardships so they can receive \nthe education they need.\n  In 1997 we took steps in the right direction, and did what had to be \ndone. Regrettably, due to fiscal constraints, we were not able to go as \nfar as we wanted to go. The nation was still in a fiscal crisis at that \ntime. In order to control costs, we were forced to limit the \ndeductibility of student loan interest to only sixty loan payments, \nwhich is equivalent to five years plus time spent in forbearance or \ndeferment.\n  This restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. Many of \nthese borrowers are students who, due to limited means, have borrowed \nmost heavily. The restriction discriminates against those who have the \nhighest debt loads and lowest incomes. It makes the American dream \nharder to achieve for those struggling to pull themselves up--for those \nwho started with less. It is unjust.\n  Today, our situation is vastly different. In these times of economic \nvitality and budget surplus, we have a responsibility to do what we \nwere unable to do before. Student debt is rising to alarming levels, \nand additional relief must be provided. We must eliminate the sixty \nmonth restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest and \nshow that the United States Congress stands behind all of our nation's \nstudents in their endeavors to better themselves.\n  Eliminating the sixty payment restriction will bring needed relief to \nsome of the most deserving borrowers. The restriction weighs heavily on \nthose who, despite lower pay, have decided to dedicate themselves to a \ncareer in public service. We will be rewarding civic virtue as we \nprovide relief to these admirable citizens.\n  Additionally, eliminating this restriction will eliminate difficult \nand costly reporting requirements that are currently required for both \nborrowers and lenders. In supporting our nation's students, we will \nalso be cutting costly bureaucracy.\n  Currently, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must have an adjusted \ngross income of $40,000 or less, or $60,000 for married couples. The \namount of the deduction is gradually phased out for those with incomes \nbetween $40,000 and $55,000, or $60,000 and $75,000 for married \ncouples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at $1000, and \nwill cap out at $2500 in 2002.\n  Many in our country are suffering from excessive student debt. More \ncan and must be done to help them. In this time of economic plenty, it \nis our duty to invest in our students' education. Doing so is an \ninvestment in America's future. To maintain competitiveness in the \nglobal marketplace, America must have a well-educated workforce. By \neliminating the sixty payment restriction on the deductibility of \nstudent loan interest we recommit ourselves to education and to \nmaintaining the position of this country at the pinnacle of the free \nworld.\n  The administration supports this direction as well. In his 2000 \nbudget, President Clinton has proposed to eliminate the sixty payment \nrestriction on the deductibility of student loan interest, starting \nafter 1999. Our legislation takes a more fair and inclusive approach by \nincluding payments between 1997 and 1999, which the administration \nleaves out.\n  I urge members to join us in this effort to relieve the excessive \nburdens on those trying to better themselves and their families through \neducation by expanding the tax deduction for student loan interest \npayments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 472. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide certain Medicare beneficiaries with an exemption to the \nfinancial limitations imposed on physical, speech-language pathology, \nand occupational therapy services under part B of the Medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      The Medicare Rehabilitation benefit improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nRehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\n1999 with my colleague, Senator Reid. This legislation will enable \nseniors to receive medically necessary rehabilitative services based on \ntheir condition and health and not on arbitrary payment limits. We \nintroduced similar legislation last Congress.\n  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 is a very important \naccomplishment and one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in \nour rush to save the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress \nneglected to thoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on \nrehabilitative services would have on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech-\nlanguage pathology therapy services received outside a hospital \nsetting. This provision became effective January 1, 1999, and after \njust 31 days of implementation, an estimated one in four beneficiaries \nhad exhausted half of their yearly benefit. According to a recent \nstudy, these limitations on services will harm almost 13 percent or \n750,000 of Medicare beneficiaries because these individuals will exceed \nthe cap. While many seniors will not need services that would cause \nthem to exceed the $1500 cap, others, like stroke victims and patients \nwith Parkinson's disease, will likely need services beyond what the \narbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who \nneed rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced \nto pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital \nsetting.\n  The bill I am introducing would establish certain exceptions to the \n$1500 cap, for beneficiaries who have medical needs that require more \nintensive treatment than this benefit limit would allow. The Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services would be required to \nimplement the exceptions, and providers would be required to \ndemonstrate medical necessity based on the criteria outlined in the \nbill. In essence, the bill attempts to accomplish the primary goal of \nthe $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but without harming the Medicare \nbeneficiary. Payment is based on the patient's condition and not on an \narbitrary monetary amount. Help us provide access to services for those \nbeneficiaries who will need these services or risk further \ncomplications, establish a system that makes sense, and still achieve \nthe budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing Medicare \nbenefits.\n  Please join me and my colleagues in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional materials be printed in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such report shall be \n     included in the report required to be submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 4541(d)(2) of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 (42 U.S.C. 1395l note).\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999--Summary\n\n       This bill will provide certain Medicare beneficiaries with \n     an exemption based on medical necessity to the financial \n     limitation imposed on physical, speech-language pathology, \n     and occupational therapy services under part B of the \n     Medicare program. It will also direct the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a study on the \n     implementation of such an exemption, and then submit a report \n     to Congress that includes recommendations regarding \n     alternatives to such financial limitations.\n       The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 imposed a $1500 cap \n     on all therapy effective January 1, 1999. There is a combined \n     $1500 cap for physical and speech-language pathology and a \n     separate $1500 cap on occupational therapy services received \n     outside a hospital setting. An estimated 750,000 \n     beneficiaries will reach the cap this year. These patients \n     may be victims of stroke, brain-injury, or other serious \n     conditions requiring additional services.\n       This bill establishes certain criteria in order for \n     Medicare beneficiaries to be eligible for an exemption from \n     the $1500 cap and allows the Secretary of HHS to establish \n     additional criteria if necessary. The criteria include:\n       (1) the beneficiary must be diagnosed with an illness, \n     injury, or disability that requires additional physical, \n     speech-language pathology, or occupational therapy services \n     that are medically necessary in a calender year, or\n       (2) the beneficiary has a diagnosis that requires such \n     therapy services and has an additional diagnosis or incident \n     that exacerbates his/her condition (ie: diabetes), which \n     would require more services, or\n       (3) the beneficiary will require hospitalization if he/she \n     does not receive the necessary therapy services, or\n       (4) the beneficiary meets other requirements determined by \n     the Secretary of HHS.\n       The bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to conduct a \n     study and to report to Congress two years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. This study will include:\n       (1) the number of Medicare beneficiaries that receive \n     exemptions to the cap;\n       (2) the diagnoses of the beneficiaries;\n       (3) the types of therapy services that are covered due to \n     such exemptions;\n       (4) the settings in which services are provided; and\n       (5) the number of beneficiaries that reach the $1500 cap.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         American Speech-Language-\n\n\n                                          Hearing Association,\n\n                                 Rockville, MD, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: The American Speech-Language-\n     Hearing Association\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\n     (ASHA) is pleased to support the ``Medicare Rehabilitation \n     Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.'' ASHA is the professional \n     and scientific organization of more than 96,000 speech-\n     language pathologists, audiologists, and speech, language, \n     hearing scientists. Our members provide services in a number \n     of practice settings, including hospitals, clinics, private \n     practice, and home health agencies.\n       There is a clear need for exemptions from the Medicare \n     financial limitations for beneficiaries receiving outpatient \n     rehabilitation services. Since the provision went into effect \n     on January 1, 1999, ASHA has received numerous calls and \n     letters of concern from our members regarding the problems \n     created by the financial limitation. Patients are actually \n     refusing medically necessary treatment for fear that they may \n     have a more acute episode or injury later in the year and \n     want to keep their $1500 ``banked'' for such a possibility. \n     Essentially, the cap's arbitrary limit is indirectly forcing \n     patients to inappropriately ration needed care that we \n     believe will ultimately cost the Medicare program more.\n       A patient who requires both speech-language pathology \n     services and physical therapy services is placed in a true \n     dilemma. If the patient who has suffered a stroke chooses to \n     receive speech-language pathology services, the patient may \n     not have sufficient funding for physical therapy at the \n     conclusion of the speech-language pathology treatment. \n     Conversely, the patient who selects physical therapy may not \n     have adequate funding for the speech-language pathology \n     services. A third situation arises when the patient receives \n     both rehabilitation services concurrently and the programs \n     for both are inadequate because the financial limitation is \n     not sufficient for receipt of both health care services.\n       I am enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to Congress \n     that ASHA received early this year from a family member whose \n     mother is receiving speech-language pathology services for a \n     swallowing disorder. Ms. Carol Eller McCaffrey of Lawrence, \n     Kansas, begins her letter with:\n       ``I am the daughter of an 87-year-old woman whose brain \n     stem stroke left her unable to swallow or speak well and \n     weakened her right side, and whose quality of life will \n     suffer greatly with $1500 Medicare cap.\n       ``The new cap will all but completely discontinue . . . \n     treatment thus requiring increased hydration through an \n     alternative feeding tube which we have left intact for these \n     emergencies. Taking away the very important . . . therapy \n     causes the need for more nursing care. Also, her quality of \n     life is `down the tubes' when mother is unable to eat and \n     drink comfortably.''\n       This is but one example of the problems that arise because \n     of the arbitrary Medicare financial limitation. As 1999 \n     progresses, there will undoubtedly be more examples of \n     difficulties caused by the cap unless legislation such as \n     yours can restore reasonable benefits in the program.\n       The members of the American Speech-Language-Hearing \n     Association are committed to improving the health and safety \n     of those who suffer communication and related disorders. Your \n     legislation will make it possible for more Americans to \n     receive the care they need. ASHA commends you for your \n     efforts to seek a remedy to the cap that ensures patient \n     access to medically-needed services through the ``Medicare \n     Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Donna Geffner,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 1, 1999.\n       Honorable Congressional Leaders: I am not a professional in \n     the medical world nor am I very knowledgeable about the \n     logistics of medicare. I am the daughter of an 87 year old \n     woman whose brain stem stroke left her unable to swallow or \n     speak well and weakened her right side and whose quality of \n     life will suffer greatly with the $1500.00 medicare gap.\n       With them help of our speech and physical therapists, \n     Mother has come a long way. Although she still doesn't speak \n     well, she eats normal food in the dining room with fellow \n     residents. Mother has a problem with thin liquids that causes \n     choking and probable aspiration. A new treatment called Deep \n     Pharyngeal Neuromuscular Stimulation (DPNS) is being taught; \n     our speech therapist has treated Mom with DPNS, resulting in \n     a 90% improvement. In my mother's case, the problem is that \n     several months after treatment, the benefits wear off. \n     Periodically, Mother needs another round of DPNS.\n       The new cap will all but completely discontinue this \n     treatment thus requiring increased hydration through an \n     alternative feeding tube which we have left intact for these \n     emergencies. Taking away the very important DPNS therapy \n     causes the need for more nursing care. Also, her life quality \n     of life is ``down the tubes'' when mother is unable to eat \n     and drink comfortably.\n       Mom also needs continual assertive physical therapy to keep \n     her strength up but the guidelines, even before the medical \n     cap, require a decrease in her function to qualify for \n     treatment. So, periodically, as Mother weakens, therapists \n     have to start over. This seems backwards to me. I thought \n     that as a nation, we were making great strides in the care of \n     our elderly and disabled. In my opinion, the recent medicare \n     cap is a huge backslide. Does the left hand of the government \n     know what the right hand is doing? And look who's suffering? \n     Obviously those making the rules have not had personal \n     experiences in this area.\n       The paperwork for all medical personnel is already \n     overwhelming. Our professionals are spending more time with \n     paper than with patients! All this, I presume, to try and \n     thwart cheaters. I feel the cheaters are the minority and it \n     all comes down to punishing the patients.\n       You are smart people. Come up with a reasonable way to deal \n     with this situation without losing sight of what is truly \n     important--the patients.\n       Private pay is exorbitant--Have you checked? There is no \n     way normal families can take up where medicare leaves off.\n       Please, rethink this decision to cap medicare part B \n     benefits.

Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the more than 74,000 \n     members of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) \n     and the patients our members serve, I am writing to express \n     our strong support and appreciation for your leadership in \n     introducing the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement \n     Act of 1999.''\n       As you know, section 4541(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 imposes annual caps of $1,500 per beneficiary on all \n     outpatient rehabilitation services except those furnished in \n     a hospital outpatient department. The new law has been \n     interpreted to establish two separate limits--$1,500 cap for \n     physical therapy and speech-language pathology services and a \n     separate $1,500 cap for occupational therapy services. These \n     limits are effective for services rendered on or after \n     January 1, 1999.\n       APTA maintains concern with the impact this limitation on \n     services will have on Medicare beneficiaries who require \n     physical therapy treatment. Senior citizens and disabled \n     citizens eligible for Medicare benefits suffering from a \n     range of conditions including stroke, hip fracture, \n     Parkinson's Disease, cerebral palsy and other serious \n     conditions that require extensive rehabilitation may not be \n     able to access the care they require to resume normal \n     activities of daily living due to the present limitation on \n     coverage. Enactment of your legislation provides the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     the authority to establish exceptions to the present $1,500 \n     cap for patients with conditions that would likely exceed \n     such a limitation on coverage. APTA applauds the inclusion of \n     this provision.\n       APTA maintains concern that the $1,500 cap is completely \n     arbitrary and bears no relation to the medical condition of \n     the patient nor the health outcomes of the rehabilitation \n     services. There exists absolutely no medical or empirical \n     justification for such a cap. The caps are by definition \n     completely insensitive to patients with chronic injuries and \n     illness or who have multiple episodes of care in a given \n     calendar year. Enactment of your legislation would provide \n     relief from the $1,500 annual cap for Medicare beneficiaries \n     who experience multiple episodes of care in a given calendar \n     year for services that are deemed medically necessary. APTA \n     applauds the inclusion of this provision.\n       APTA maintains concern that the $1,500 cap dramatically \n     reduces Medicare beneficiaries' choice of care giver. Under \n     the present statute, beneficiaries who have exceeded their \n     cap in need of additional rehabilitation services are \n     restricted from receiving care from facilities other than \n     outpatient hospital departments. This restriction is a \n     notable step backward in Congress' efforts to expand access \n     to care, especially in rural and urban underserved \n     communities. Enactment of your legislation would better \n     ensure access to a wide range of community settings in which \n     Medicare beneficiaries could receive care, to include \n     rehabilitation agencies, Comprehensive Outpatient \n     Rehabilitation Facilities, and physical therapy private \n     practices. APTA applauds the inclusion of this provision.\n       Lastly, APTA continues to object to the inclusion of \n     physical therapy and speech-language pathology under the same \n     $1,500 cap. Confusion has surrounded the interpretation of \n     how the $1,500 cap is to be applied. As the Medicare Policy \n     Advisory Committee (MedPAC) reported to Congress in its July \n     1998 report, 70 percent of outpatient therapy expenditures \n     under the program are for physical therapy services, while 21 \n     percent are for occupational therapy, and 9 percent for \n     speech therapy. The combination of physical therapy and \n     speech therapy has no rational basis. Speech therapy is a \n     distinct and separate benefit provided under the Medicare \n     program and should not be included as a part of the physical \n     therapy benefit. While your legislation does not clarify this \n     issue, APTA is hopeful that Congress will address this issue \n     with common sense clarifications as it considers Medicare \n     revisions this year. APTA will continue to work with you to \n     achieve this end.\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\n       Physical therapists across Iowa and the nation applaud your \n     leadership on this important issue. Passage of the Medicare \n     Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999 can ensure \n     that patients in need of outpatient physical therapy services \n     receive appropriate care in the setting of their choice \n     without the fear of exceeding their coverage. APTA stands \n     ready to assist you in any way to ensure that swift enactment \n     of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Nancy Garland, Esq.,\n     Director of Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the American Health \n     Care Association, long term care providers, and those for \n     whom we provide care, I'm writing you to commend you on your \n     leadership in introducing legislation designed to protect \n     America's most frail and elderly from the adverse effects of \n     arbitrary caps on certain medical services.\n       One of the provisions contained in the 1997 Balanced Budget \n     Act (BBA) has the potential to harm senior citizens who rely \n     on Medicare for their health care needs. Congress changed \n     Medicare by imposing arbitrary annual limits of $1500 for \n     outpatient rehabilitation services. This includes a $1500 cap \n     on occupational therapy and a $1500 cap on physical therapy \n     and speech-language-pathology combined. Arbitrary caps do not \n     reflect the real rehabilitation needs of Medicare \n     beneficiaries and target the sickest and most vulnerable.\n       Your efforts will protect senior citizens suffering from \n     common medical conditions such as stroke and hip fractures. \n     These seniors may not be able to obtain the rehabilitative \n     care they require to resume normal activities of daily living \n     because the $1500 limits are too low to pay for the services \n     which responsible medical practice deem necessary.\n       Once again, thank you for taking the lead to redress the \n     problem posed by these arbitrary caps. On behalf of the \n     American Health Care Association, we commend you and stand \n     eager to assist you in your efforts.\n           Sinceerely,\n                                                    Bruce Yarwood,\n     Legislative Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The American Occupational\n\n\n                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,\n\n                                  Bethesda, MD, February 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the 60,000 members of \n     the American Occupational Therapy Assn., I would like to \n     commend and thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.\n       The financial limitation on outpatient rehabilitation, \n     including occupational therapy, imposed by the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 was, in AOTA's view, a misguided attempt \n     to constrain Medicare costs which is having a harmful effect \n     on patient care. The payment limitation interposes government \n     between a patient and a health care provider; it restricts \n     patient choice, and could have the unintended consequence of \n     exacerbating patient conditions causing Medicare cost \n     increases.\n       Your bill will allow for patients such as those with \n     multiple injuries, illnesses or disabilities; those with more \n     than one incident of need in a year and, through the \n     Secretary's authority to establish criteria, those whose \n     diagnosis or condition requires extensive therapy to receive \n     the treatment which the Medicare coverage criteria guarantees \n     them.\n       AOTA has been very concerned that individuals with \n     condition such as severe strokes, spinal card injury, \n     traumatic brain injury, extensive fractures, severe burns, or \n     diseases such as Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis will be \n     restricted in their access to needed occupational therapy \n     before the rehabilitation process is completed. Your bill \n     will allow for these and other individuals to have access to \n     appropriate care.\n       Your efforts will move policy forward and establish some \n     necessary protections for Medicare beneficiaries. AOTA \n     appreciates your efforts to ameliorate the impacts of this \n     unwise policy.\n       We look forward to working with you as the bill moves \n     through the legislative process. Please contact me if I can \n     be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Christina A.

Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: The National Association of \n     Rehabilitation Agencies (``NARA'') strongly endorses the \n     Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999 and \n     applauds your initiative in introducing this important \n     legislation. NARA represents over 225 Medicare-certified \n     rehabilitation agencies which provide physicial therapy, \n     speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy services \n     to hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries annually.\n       The $1500 financial limitation on outpatient rehabilitation \n     services, as established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     constitutes an arbitrary limit on the amount of services \n     which a Medicare enrollee may receive. The caps bear no \n     relation to the patient's medical need for rehabilitation \n     services nor the beneficial health outcomes which would flow \n     from the provision of such services. The most pernicious \n     aspect of the limitations is that they will deprive Medicare \n     patients who are most in need of rehabilitation--e.g. stroke \n     victims and those suffering from traumatic brain injury--of \n     the very care they require.\n       You legislation is a workable and realistic solution to \n     many of the patient care and access problems caused by the \n     $1500 limitations. NARA's members are deeply appreciative of \n     the time and effort which you and your staff have expended in \n     developing the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement \n     Act of 1999. NARA pledges to work with you to ensure that \n     this critical proposal becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Larry Fronheiser,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Private Practice Section, American Physicial Therapy \n           Association,\n                                Washington, DC, February 23, 1999.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: The Private Practice Section of the \n     American Physical Therapy Association has carefully reviewed \n     your proposed legislation, the Medicare Rehabilitation \n     Benefit Improvement Act of 1999, and is pleased to express \n     its support for this legislation.\n       The membership of the Private Practice Section is comprised \n     of physical therapists in independent practice who, for many \n     years, have been subject to a financial limitation on the \n     amount which Medicare will pay for their services furnished \n     to any Medicare beneficiary. As a result, the Section's \n     members understand all too well the harmful effects which the \n     arbitrary $1500 caps will have on Medicare beneficiaries who \n     require outpatient rehabilitation services. Your proposal is \n     a sensible and practical approach to protecting those \n     patients.\n       Your legislation is entirely consistent with the Private \n     Practice Section's goals and objectives for ensuring that \n     Medicare beneficiaries have access to all necessary \n     rehabilitation services. Accordingly, we are pleased to \n     proffer our commitment to help secure its enactment.\n       That you for your leadership on this essential piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Lisa Wade,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                    Support of Long Term Care,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Association \n     for the Support of Long Term Care (NASL), we applaud your \n     leadership and your colleagues who have joined you in the \n     introduction of legislation entitled the ``Medicare \n     Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999.'' You have \n     developed a rational, good policy that will help \n     beneficiaries who would otherwise be limited in their \n     availability of rehabilitation services.\n       The National Association for the Support of Long Term Care \n     (NASL) is an organization that represents over 150 providers \n     offering services in the long term care setting. We work \n     daily with patients who need rehabilitation services and this \n     limitation is hurting seniors access to services. There are \n     seniors in America who are already reaching the cap and they \n     need additional services that are medically necessary. These \n     are seniors who have had strokes. These are seniors who have \n     Parkinson's disease. These are seniors who have had hip \n     replacements and an additional illness. Senator Grassley, we \n     want to thank you for helping these patients get services \n     that are medically necessary.\n       We are ready to help you share information about the \n     adverse effects of this cut in benefits that was enacted in \n     the BBA in 1997. We are certain that this was not the intent \n     of the law--and now that it is implemented, seniors will be \n     denied care. Your legislation will go a long way to ensure \n     that the most disadvantaged and ill seniors will get the care \n     that they need. The stroke patient that needs speech-language \n     pathology to learn how to swallow will get care. The \n     Parkinson's patient who is learning how to walk with an \n     exacerbating illness will get physical therapy in order to \n     improve.\n       Again, we applaud your leadership and strongly support this \n     legislation. Please feel free to call on us for support and \n     help.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Peter Clendenin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Easter Seals,\n\n\n                                     Office of Public Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Easter Seals is very pleased to support \n     the introduction of the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit \n     Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation begins to \n     eliminate damaging limitations on needed\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\n     therapy services for Medicare beneficiaries. Easter Seals is \n     committed to assisting you and your colleagues to improve and \n     enact this critical measure.\n       Easter Seals is dedicated to assisting children and adults \n     with disabilities to live with equality, dignity, and \n     independence. Each year, Easter Seals 106-affiliate network \n     serves more than one million people nationally. Thousands of \n     Medicare beneficiaries and their families rely on Easter \n     Seals for community-based physical therapy, occupational \n     therapy, and speech-language pathology services. Without such \n     services, these beneficiaries would experience diminished \n     health, function, and quality of life.\n       Current Medicare policy limiting payment for outpatient \n     medical rehabilitation services to $1,500 for occupational \n     therapy and $1,5000 for physical therapy and speech-language \n     pathology services combined is out-of-step with the real \n     medical needs of a significant share of Medicare \n     beneficiaries. It will cause beneficiaries with serious \n     medical needs resulting from illness, injury, and disability, \n     including stroke, traumatic brain injuries, total joint \n     replacement, and other serious conditions, to forfeit needed \n     care or seek such care in less cost-effective, often \n     inappropriate institutional settings.\n       For many Easter Seals Medicare clients the impact of \n     current policy is devastating. One client's situation, if \n     constrained by a $1,500 cap, illustrates this point.\n       Eighty-four-year old Richard H. lived independently with \n     his wife when, on February 27, 1997, he experienced a serious \n     stroke. Prior to the stroke he had high blood pressure, heart \n     disease, and diabetes. The stroke paralyzed his left side, \n     seriously impaired his vision, and left him very depressed.\n       Physical therapy helped him learn to move independently and \n     to walk safely again. Occupational therapy retrained him in \n     the tasks of daily living, including preparing food, \n     toileting, and home safety. Speech and swallowing therapy \n     eliminated his choking on food, which presented a high risk \n     of aspiration pneumonia. This therapy, combined with much \n     determination and effort by Richard and his wife, has enabled \n     him to resume living independently at home.\n       The doctors, therapists and family agree that without this \n     full course of medical rehabilitation, Richard would now be \n     helpless, severely depressed, and confined to a very \n     expensive nursing home for care. The current Medicare policy \n     limiting medical rehabilitation therapy services under the \n     $1,500 cap, with no exemptions, would have deprived Richard \n     of 62% of his needed rehabilitation treatment.\n       Easter Seals believes that the ``Medicare Rehabilitation \n     Benefit Improvement Act of 1999'' is a necessary, timely, and \n     thoughtful approach to correcting serious problems for \n     Medicare beneficiaries requiring comprehensive services. \n     Easter Seals will work with you and your Senate colleagues to \n     refine this legislation, as appropriate, and promote its \n     enactment into law.\n       Thank you very much for your commitment to assuring \n     Medicare beneficiaries the services that they need to live \n     healthy, productive lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Randall L. Rutta,\n                             Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the ``Medicare \nRehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999''. This legislation is \ndesigned to protect our sickest, most vulnerable seniors from the \nadverse effects of arbitrary limits on crucial rehabilitative services.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) created annual caps for two \ncategories of therapy provided to beneficiaries under Medicare Part B: \na $1500 annual cap on physical therapy and speech language combined; \nand a separate cap for occupational therapy. These arbitrary limits on \nrehabilitation therapy were hastily included in the BBA without the \nbenefit of Congressional hearings or thorough review by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration. As a result, the $1500 limits bear no \nrelation to the medical condition of the patient, or the health \noutcomes of the rehabilitative services.\n  The $1500 caps would create serious access and quality problems for \nMedicare's oldest and sickest beneficiaries. Senior citizens who suffer \nfrom common conditions such as stroke, hip fracture, and coronary \nartery disease, will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative services \nthey need to resume normal activities of daily living. A stroke patient \ntypically requires more than $3,000 in physical therapy alone. \nRehabilitation therapy for a patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis \nor ALS costs even more. Without access to outpatient therapy, patients \nmust remain in institutional settings longer, be transferred to a \nhigher cost hospital facility, or in some cases, just go without \nnecessary services.\n  Coverage for rehabilitative therapy should be based on medically \nnecessary treatment, not arbitrary spending limits that ignore a \npatient's clinical needs. During the 105th Congress, I joined with \nSenator Grassley to introduce legislation that would correct this \nproblem. The ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of \n1999'' builds on our effort to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to the crucial therapy services they need.\n  Our bill establishes criteria by which Medicare beneficiaries would \nbe eligible for an exemption from the $1500 cap. According to our bill, \nany beneficiary who would require hospitalization if he did not receive \nthe necessary therapy services would be allowed to exceed the cap. \nBeneficiaries suffering from a diagnosis that requires therapy services \nand has an additional diagnosis that exacerbates this condition would \nalso be eligible for therapy services above the $1500 limit. In \naddition, any beneficiary that is diagnosed with an illness, injury, or \ndisability that requires additional physical, speech-language \npathology, or occupational therapy services that are medically \nnecessary will receive the therapy services he or she requires. \nFinally, our bill gives the Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary the flexibility to establish additional criteria if \nnecessary.\n  The $1500 therapy caps penalize our most frail and elderly citizens. \nNot only does allowing our seniors to have access to critical \noutpatient therapy services makes sense, it is the right thing to do. I \nurge you to join me in protecting Medicare's most vulnerable \nbeneficiaries by supporting the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit \nImprovement Act of 1999''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 473.

A bill to increase penalties and strengthen enforcement of \nenvironmental crimes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      the environmental crimes act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I am introducing my first bills as \na United States Senator. I said over the last year that the picture \nthat I want to keep at the forefront of my mind is that of families \nsitting around their kitchen table paying their bills, planning for \nretirement, affording a home, paying for college for their children, \nand discussing the quality of their local schools.\n  Today I am introducing my first bills for those families at the \nkitchen table. And let me tell you a little bit about these families. \nThey are the same in Brooklyn and Buffalo, Mt. Vernon and Massapequa, \nSyracuse and Setauket.\n  They are living in a time of both overwhelming promise and \noverwhelming challenge.\n  The promise--the upside--is that America remains indisputably the \npreeminent economy in the world. The challenge--the downside--is that \nfor most families there is a great deal of uncertainty about the \nfuture. They are concerned that forces beyond their control--rising \ncollege costs, inferior schools, struggling communities--put them \nbehind the eight-ball.\n  Their concern isn't so much that the U.S. economy will turn sour. \nIt's that they, or their town, or their children may be washed aside in \nthe economic tide. The families of Upstate New York have lived that \nreality for six years.\n  The nine bills that I am introducing today are designed to help \nfamilies deal and thrive with the changing times of a global, \ncompetitive economy.\n  I am introducing two bills to make college affordable for working \nfamilies. The Make College Affordable Act, which I am honored to \nintroduce with Senator Moynihan, makes all college tuition tax \ndeductible for families with less than $140,000 in income.\n  The Save for College Act allows families to contribute up to $2,000 \nper year in an education IRA that is tax-free when the money goes in \nand tax-free when it comes out so long as it is spent on college costs. \nFamilies earning up to $200,000 are eligible for the IRAs.\n  Let me make two points about these bills. Since 1980, the cost of \nattending college has increased at more than twice the rate of \ninflation and has risen even faster than health care. At the same time, \nthe necessity of a college education is greater now than at any time in \nour history.\n  If our country is to remain economically strong and if we want \nfamilies to be able to get ahead, then college--whether it's SUNY or \nNYU--must not put families in the poorhouse.\n  The Teachers Loan Forgiveness Act will recruit new, high quality \nprofessionals to teaching by forgiving all student loans for public and \nprivate school teachers.\n  It is expensive to become a teacher. The pay is low. And we wonder \nwhy there is a shortage of young, eager, qualified teachers to educate \nour children. We must make the teaching profession more financially \nattractive to put excellence in the classrooms.\n  The Comprehensive Pension & Security Retirement Act makes all \npensions portable. If you lose a job, if you take time off to raise a \nchild, if you change jobs--your pension will stay with you and grow. \nPension portability and reform is the most important retirement \nsecurity issue next to Social Security.\n  Specifically for Upstate New York, with Senator Moynihan I am \nintroducing the Airline Competition Act of 1999 to end predatory \npricing and to direct the Transportation Department to grant take-off \nand landing slots to underserved airports within a 500 mile radius of \nNew York. Monopolistic airfares in Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo are \nslowly strangling the economy of Upstate and the Southern Tier. I \nbelieve the days of sky-high airfares to these cites are numbered.\n  To rebuild struggling neighborhoods through homeownership I am \nintroducing legislation to offer a $2,000 tax credit to first time \nhomebuyers in Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Communities. In New \nYork, that includes the South Bronx, Harlem, and parts of Albany, \nSchenectady, Troy, Buffalo, Kingston, Newburgh, and Rochester.\n  Because women pay more for health care than men, the Equity in \nWomen's Health Act bars any health plan from discriminating on the \nbasis of gender or sexual orientation through their coverage options. \nIt also requires each health plan to include a short prospectus to \ndescribe exactly what they will and will not cover.\n  To protect consumers, the Credit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1999 \ncloses loopholes in existing law that allows credit card companies to \noffer low teaser rates that increase dramatically unbeknownst to the \ncardholder.\n  And last, the Environmental Crimes Act increases fines and penalties \nfor criminally negligent polluters and it also trains new personnel to \ninvestigate environmental crimes.\n  These are not all--but some of my priorities for the year. As I have \nsaid many times, my passion is legislating in ways that make people's \nlives better. With the impeachment over, I am anxious to get started on \nthe issues that matter to New Yorkers and all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bunning, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n        Mack):\n  S. 482. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe increase in the tax on the Social Security benefits; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            legislation to repeal the tax on social security\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise now in conjunction with the \ndistinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, and with the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, to introduce legislation which \nwill repeal the 1993 increase in the tax on Social Security benefits.\n  As my colleagues are aware, senior citizens pay Federal taxes on a \nportion of their Social Security benefits if they receive additional \nincome from savings or from work. Before 1993, seniors paid taxes on \nhalf their Social Security benefits if their combined income, as it is \ndescribed--which means their adjusted gross income and one-half the \namount of the Social Security benefits they receive--exceeded $25,000 \nfor individuals or $32,000 for couples.\n  Soon after coming into office, however, the new administration \nincreased this tax on these middle-income retirees as part of the 1993 \ntax bill. For individuals now, after that, with combined incomes \nexceeding $34,000, and couples with combined incomes exceeding $44,000, \nthe tax increase on the percentage of their Social Security benefits \nsubject to taxation went from 50 percent to 85 percent. This provision \nincreased taxes for nearly one-quarter of Social Security recipients. \nIt in large part produced an increase of 7.5 percent in the tax burden \non America's seniors, a tax increase that was more than double the 3.5 \npercent that the rest of that legislation imposed on other Americans.\n  This tax increase is unfair. It penalizes senior citizens, and it \npenalizes them for exactly the wrong reason--for saving to achieve \nsecurity in their retirement. It also unfairly punishes seniors who \nhave the capacity and choose to continue to work.\n  We are engaged, as you know, in an important debate here in Congress, \nthe debate over the future of our Social Security system. Republicans \nhave joined with Democrats in pledging to set aside the entire Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus over the next 15 years, to shore up that \nsystem, to make certain it is available for the senior citizens both of \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  At such a time, with dire warnings of impending bankruptcies still \nringing in our ears, it seems the last thing the Federal Government \nshould be doing is to discourage people from work and saving for their \nretirement.\n  Wise Americans have always saved for their retirement. They have \nsought to be independent in their old age by working hard and by \nputting aside a portion of their income. Yet the 1993 tax increase \nproposed by the President and ultimately passed into law by the \nCongress changed the rules for these wise savers. After plans and \ninvestment decisions had already been made, this proposal came in and \ndeclared that savings and hard work would be taxed significantly more \nheavily than they had been before.\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\n  As we work to shore up Social Security, we must not allow the Federal \nGovernment to punish people for working and saving. We must not allow \nthe Federal Government to tell people they might as well not save for \nretirement, that they must depend solely on Social Security benefits \nfor their well-being once they retire.\n  What is more, we should not forget that the projected Federal budget \nsurplus over the next 10 years alone is slated to reach approximately \n$2.565 trillion. We have agreed, wisely in my view, to save the bulk of \nthis surplus to shore up Social Security. But surely, at a time when we \nforesee at least $787 billion in surpluses in addition to those \nearmarked for Social Security, the Federal Government can afford, in my \njudgment, to give seniors and those planning for their retirement the \nkind of tax relief they need to prepare for their futures and to keep \nour economy strong.\n  That means, in my view, that we must repeal this onerous tax hike for \nthe sake of our seniors and for the sake of our economy as a whole. \nDiscouraging savings has always been a recipe for economic disaster \nbecause it reduces the amount of money available for investment in new \njobs and a growing economy.\n  Now is the time to reduce the extent to which Washington discourages \nsavings. It is time to repeal this tax hike so we may increase savings, \ninvestment, and the financial security of our senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has a simple purpose: It repeals the \n1993 ill-considered Social Security tax hike returning our seniors to \nthe position they were in prior to 1993.\n  It restores a modicum of fairness to our Byzantine tax structure and \nto our dealings with senior citizens. It is important legislation for \nour seniors, for our Social Security system and for the future of our \nNation, and I urge my colleagues' strong support.\n  In short, Mr. President, I think we should do everything possible to \nmake it feasible for seniors, both today and especially in the future, \nto be able to live in retirement in a comfortable way and to not solely \ndepend on the Social Security system. We know the burdens that system \nwill take.\n  By discouraging savings during people's working years, by \ndiscouraging people from continuing to work after they reach retirement \nage, we are actually, I think, undermining our chances of providing the \nkind of long-term income security that Americans deserve in their old \nage.\n  For that reason, we should, in my judgment, repeal this tax hike. We \nshould make that a priority this year, and we should then couple that \naction with other action aimed at shoring up the Social Security system \nso it not only works for today's seniors, but for the seniors of our \nfuture as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 483. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to limit consideration of nonemergency matters in \nemergency legislation and permit matter that is extraneous to \nemergencies to be stricken as provided in the Byrd rule; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Govermental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat if one committee reports, the other committee have thirty days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n                     surplus protection act of 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Graham, to introduce the ``Surplus \nProtection Act of 1999''--legislation that will reform the budget \nprocess by tightening the manner in which emergency spending \nlegislation is considered in the Senate. Not only will these reforms \nensure that there is greater accountability in the emergency spending \nprocess, but they will also ensure that the unified budget surplus we \nnow enjoy will be protected from spending raids that are designed to \ncircumvent the normal budget process--and that could undercut our \nability to utilize the surplus for strengthening Social Security.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, last year the federal \ngovernment enjoyed its first balanced budget since 1969. To be precise, \nthe federal government actually achieved a unified budget surplus of \n$70 billion in fiscal year 1998. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice (CBO), this surplus will not be a one time occurrence; rather, \nunified budget surpluses will continue to accrue during the next 10 \nyears if CBO's projections for economic growth, federal revenues, and \nfederal spending hold true.\n  While the surplus is welcome news after decades of annual deficits \nand burgeoning debt, we must never forget how easily this valuable \nnational asset can be squandered if we fail to be vigilant in \nprotecting it. For too long, the federal government treated the budget \nlike a credit card with an unlimited spending limit, and such bad \nhabits--even if broken for a few years--can quickly return, especially \nwhen there is a surplus just burning a hole in the pocket of Congress \nand the President!\n  Therefore, in an effort to ensure the surplus is protected from \nfuture spending raids, we are offering legislation today that will \ncrack down on arguably the most insidious manner in which budgetary \nspending limits and protections can be circumvented: the emergency \nspending designation. In light of the $21.4 billion in emergency \nspending that was contained in last year's omnibus bill, the need to \nprovide safeguards against the abuse of this provision--and the \nsquandering of the surplus--could not be more clear.\n  Mr. President, the emergency spending designation was created for a \nvery important reason. If a sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary \nevent occurs, the strict spending limits imposed in the budget \nresolution can be exceeded through the designation of that event as an \n``emergency.'' This exception is understandable when considering that \nthe hands of Congress and the Administration should not be tied when \nthe pressing needs of our nation override the need for strict budget \ndiscipline.\n  For instance, recent earthquakes in California, floods in the \nMidwest, hurricanes in the South, and ice storms in the Northeast--\nwhich were devastating to my home state of Maine--are all examples of \nnatural disasters that warranted the emergency designation because they \nwere completely unexpected and unforseen, and could not have been \naddressed in a timely manner through the regular budget process. By the \nsame token, the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City is an example of an \nunexpected and unforeseeable event that also warranted emergency \ntreatment.\n  Yet even as the emergency designation is necessary and warranted for \nthese and other unexpected disasters, it can also be used as a major \nloophole by those who wish to circumvent the normal budget or \nlegislative process. Rather than restricting the use of the emergency \ndesignation to only those bills or items that are truly unforseen and \nurgent, some may use this designation to either fund programs or \nprojects that are debatable as to their emergency nature, while others \nmay use emergency bills to push through unrelated legislation or \nspending programs without the normal level of scrutiny provided in the \nnormal legislative process.\n  For example, the omnibus bill adopted at the close of the 105th \nCongress contained $21.4 billion in emergency spending that came \ndirectly out of the surplus. While some of the provisions in that \npackage undoubtedly deserved the emergency designation, several items \nwere either debatably an ``emergency'' or were an outright effort to \ncircumvent the regular budget process. Specifically, the $2 billion in \nemergency funding for our three-year-old mission in Bosnia was hardly \nunexpected and should have been included in the President's budget at \nthe beginning of the year. It should not have be designated an \n``emergency'' simply to avoid the budget caps that ensure fiscal \nrestraint.\n\n  Ultimately, regardless of the manner in which the emergency \ndesignation can be misused--whether it is to fund a military operation \nthat has been ongoing for years, or to fast-track a piece of \nlegislation that has no relationship to the emergency in question--it \nis a practice that we must stop.\n  The legislation we are offering today will do just that. \nSpecifically, the bill establishes three new rules to ensure that bills \nor individual provisions receiving the emergency designation are \nsubject to careful--but reasonable--scrutiny.\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\n  The first provision--which is patterned after the ``Byrd Rule'' that \napplies to reconciliation bills--will ensure that non-emergency items \nwill not be attached to emergency spending bills by creating a point of \norder for striking these provisions. Simply put, because emergency \nspending bills are often put on a ``fast-track'' to ensure rapid \nconsideration, we should not allow non-emergency spending or \nlegislative riders to be attached to these bills in an effort to avoid \nthe normal, deliberative legislative process. To waive this \nrestriction, an affirmative vote by three-fifths of the members of the \nSenate would be required--a level that will be easily achieved for a \ntrue emergency.\n  The second provision--which is also patterned after the Byrd Rule--\nwill ensure that the validity of any item that is designated as an \nemergency--in either an emergency spending bill or a non-emergency \nbill--can be challenged by the members of the Senate. The bottom line \nis that just because an item placed in a bill is given the emergency \ndesignation does not mean it deserves that designation--and this point \nof order will ensure that members agree that the designation is \nwarranted.\n  As outlined earlier, the omnibus bill adopted at the close of the \n105th Congress contained a variety of provisions that were debatable \n``emergencies''--in particular, the funding for troops in Bosnia, \nbecause this cost was hardly unforeseen, sudden, or temporary. This \npoint of order will ensure that such provisions do not avoid budget \nscrutiny, and that the surplus is protected for Social Security \naccordingly.\n  The final provision will ensure that any legislation that contains \nemergency spending will require a three-fifths vote for final passage. \nBecause members may feel compelled to act quickly on bills that contain \neven a single item designated as an emergency, this provision will \nensure that such bills do not slide through the regular legislative \nprocess without full consideration and without more than simple \nmajority support. While the previous two points of order will prevent \nimproper abuse of the emergency designation, this requirement will \nserve as a final safeguard in the process.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that although the emergency \ndesignation is a vitally important means of ensuring the unexpected \nneeds of our nation can be addressed, it can also become a loophole \nthat subverts budget discipline, drains our new-found surplus, and \npotentially impacts our ability to strengthen the Social Security \nprogram. But with proper safeguards put in place, we can ensure that \nthis potential loophole is closed while still ensuring legitimate \nemergencies are addressed.\n  The legislation I am offering today along with Senator Graham \nprovides such thoughtful and reasonable safeguards, so I urge that my \ncolleagues support the ``Surplus Protection Act of 1999.''\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier today our colleague, Senator Snowe \nof the State of Maine, introduced legislation, of which both I and \nSenator Voinovich of the State of Ohio are the cosponsors, relating to \nreforms in the emergency appropriations law. Mr. President, I would \nlike to discuss the rationale for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, we received some good news just a few months ago. We \nlearned that after 5 years of fiscal austerity and economic growth, we \nhad transformed a $290-billion annual deficit into the first budget \nsurplus in more than a generation.\n  I am dedicated to strengthening the Nation's long-term economic \nprospects through prudent fiscal policy. The discipline that helped us \nto create favorable economic, fiscal, demographic, and political \nconditions to address the long-term Social Security and Medicare \ndeficits that will accompany the aging of our population will be fully \nrequired if we are to meet these challenges. These deficits threaten to \nundo the hard work and fiscal discipline of recent years, as well as to \nundermine our potential for future economic growth.\n  But that success, the success that we had in converting a $290-\nbillion annual deficit into this year's surplus, did not give to \nCongress a license to return to the free-spending ways of the past. \nThat absence of license is especially true since over 100 percent of \nthe surplus was the result of surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  I say over 100 percent because the only surplus we had is Social \nSecurity, and a portion of that surplus is still being applied to the \ndeficit that is being run in the general accounts, a deficit which will \ncontinue for the next 2 to 3 years. We owe it to our children and our \ngrandchildren to save this Social Security-generated surplus until \nSocial Security's long-term solvency is assured.\n  As you know, what we have been doing for the last 30 years is asking \nour grandchildren to pay our credit card bill. Now what we are saying \nto our grandchildren is that we are going to give them a secure Social \nSecurity system that will last for our generation, for their parents' \ngeneration, and for their generation--to the year 2075.\n  Unfortunately, both the last legislative action of the 105th Congress \nand the first legislative action passed by the Senate in the 106th \nCongress have made a mockery of our promise to our grandchildren. Last \nnight the Senate passed a military pay bill without simultaneously \napproving a way to fund it, an action that, if not corrected in the \nconference committee, could subtract as much as $17 billion from our \nchildren's and grandchildren's chances of having a secure Social \nSecurity system.\n  I wish I could say that last night's vote was an aberration, nothing \nmore than a momentary lapse of judgment, an inadvertent mistake in the \nhaste to turn from impeachment to legislation. Sadly, I cannot make \nthat claim. It is the second time in less than 4 months that we have \nproven ourselves willing to sacrifice future generations' well-being on \nthe altar of immediate expediency.\n  In the waning hours of last fall's budget negotiations, mid-October \n1998, we passed a $532-billion omnibus appropriations bill. Included in \nthat $532 billion was $21.4 billion in so-called emergency spending. \nSince that $21.4 billion could be approved without having to find an \noffsetting funding source, those $21.4 billion came directly out of the \nsurplus.\n  Some of you who might have been making speeches to the effect that we \nwere going to have an $80-billion surplus at the end of the last fiscal \nyear therefore had to strike out ``80'' and insert ``59'' as the amount \nof surplus we would have, because that was the figure that remained \nafter we had paid out of the Social Security surplus for $21.4 billion \nin emergencies.\n  That action would have been possibly more palatable had all of that \n$21.4 billion been allocated to true emergencies, to those kinds of \nincidents which in the past Congress has recognized as being \nappropriate to not require an offset in spending or increase in \nrevenue. While some of the $21.4 billion was used to fund what have \ntraditionally been accepted as emergencies, defined as necessary \nexpenditures for sudden, urgent, or unforeseen temporary needs, much of \nthe $21.4 billion was not. Let me give some examples.\n  The Y2K computer problem, the problem that at the turn of the \nmillennium our computers might be rendered inoperative because of the \nfailure to account for the new century, received $3.35 billion of the \n$21.4 billion. It is hard to argue that it took us until October of \n1998, and then under urgent duress circumstances, to wake up to the \nfact that the millennium was coming and that there might be a problem \nwith our computers. In fact, here in the Senate, our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives and in the executive branch, as well as in the \nprivate sector community and State and local governments, had been \naware of and working on this problem long before October of 1998.\n  Another smaller example of a nonemergency emergency was $100 million \nthat was appropriated for a new visitors center here at the Capitol. A \nnew visitors center has been under consideration for a decade or more--\nhardly an emergency that just came to our attention in October of 1998.\n  These expenditures might have been desirable, might have been \nappropriate, but to label them ``emergency,'' and therefore remove them \nfrom the fiscal discipline requiring offsetting spending or additional \nrevenue to support them, threatens to undermine the safeguards that we \nhave built in to protect our Social Security surplus.\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\n  This budgetary sleight-of-hand was also used to increase funding for \nprojects that had already been funded through the traditional \nappropriations process. For example, after previously allocating $270.5 \nbillion to the Department of Defense in the emergency appropriations \nprovision without any offsetting spending reductions or revenue \nincreases, Congress provided an additional $8.3 billion in \n``emergency'' defense spending in the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  That is not all. Because these pseudoemergency spending provisions \nwere included in an omnibus appropriations conference report--that is, \na bill that was the result of reconciliation of differences between the \nSenate and the House--then, under the normal rules governing a \nconference report, that legislation was not subject to amendment. \nTherefore, there could be no motion made that would have removed, \nreduced, or otherwise modified the provisions that were labeled as \n``emergency appropriations.''\n  Members of the Congress were left with an unpalatable choice: Shut \ndown the Government in mid-October of 1998 by failure to pass this \nsignificant appropriations bill that covered approximately one-third of \nthe Federal budget, or steal from our children's and grandchildren's \nSocial Security surplus. Mr. President, that is not a choice; that is a \nnational disgrace. It is vital that we institute an emergency spending \nprocess that responds expeditiously to true emergencies without \nmaintaining this open door to abuse. We must establish procedural \nsafeguards to deter future Congresses from misusing the emergency \nspending procedures. We should not attach, as an example, any emergency \nspending to nonemergency legislation.\n  We should not designate emergency spending measures that do not meet \nour own definition of an emergency.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I am pleased to join with \nSenator Olympia Snowe of Maine in introducing legislation that will \nprotect our newly won budget surplus from false emergency budgetary \nalarms. Senators Snowe, Voinovich and I are introducing the Surplus \nProtection Act to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974. This will limit consideration of nonemergency \nmatters in emergency legislation.\n  Specifically, we propose the following three reforms: First, to \ncreate a point of order, similar to the Byrd rule which currently \nexists, that prevents nonemergency items from being included in \nemergency spending. This will enable Members to challenge the validity \nof any individual item that is designated an emergency without \ndefeating the entire emergency spending bill.\n  Second, we would require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate for \npassage of any bill that contains emergency spending, whether it is \ndesignated an emergency spending bill or not. This will encourage \nCongress to either pay for supplemental appropriations or make certain \nthat they do, in fact, represent a true emergency, as that term has \nbeen defined.\n  And third, to make all proposed emergency spending subject to a 60-\nvote point of order in the Senate. This rule will help to prevent \nnonemergency items from ever being included in emergency legislation by \nproviding a forum in which they can be appropriately challenged on the \nSenate floor.\n  Even if passed, our legislation would not be the total cure for \nCongress' apparent addiction to emergency spending. In the short term, \nit is vital that we immediately replenish the surplus with the funds \nthat were ``borrowed'' last fall.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. We have a challenge before us in \nthe next few weeks to recoup to the Social Security surplus those funds \nthat were improvidently labeled as emergency spending and thus became \nthe means by which the Social Security surplus was raided last October. \nWe will face that challenge when we deal with the budget resolution and \nsubsequent appropriations bills.\n  The day after the passage of the Omnibus Appropriations Act on \nOctober 21, 1998, I wrote the President and asked that the Federal \nGovernment commit itself to restoring funding for the nontraditional \n``emergency'' items which were included in that omnibus legislation. I \nmust state with disappointment that I have not yet received a response. \nSo, in January, I again wrote to the President and made the same \nrequest for a commitment to fiscal discipline. Once again, I have not \nreceived a response.\n  On January 18, 1999, Roll Call published an opinion piece which I had \nwritten in which I asked the President to address this subject in his \nState of the Union Address. Mr. President, he did not.\n  Fortunately, the U.S. Constitution says that the Congress need not \nwait for the President. We can and must take steps necessary to restore \nthe budget surplus to its previous levels, and we must do that now, \nbefore the urge to spend the surplus becomes a full-fledged addiction.\n  We must also realistically fund existing emergency accounts. While \nthe Congress cannot anticipate the precise nature or cost of future \nemergencies, we do know that emergencies will occur. For instance, \nCongress prospectively budgets an annual amount not to exceed $320 \nmillion in emergency funding for the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency disaster relief fund. That is the good news. Now the bad news.\n  Over the past 12 years, the average emergency outlays from the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief fund have exceeded \nby $1.7 billion per year. What we have consistently done is underfund \nthe account based on 12 years of experience, so that we have mandated \nthat we are going to have unfunded emergencies. It would be as if \nhomeowners consistently underinsured their homes or the contents of \ntheir homes, knowing that when the disaster struck, they were not going \nto have sufficient funds to rebuild or to recoup their losses.\n  If we are to save the surplus of Social Security, Congress should \nstop systematically underfunding the emergency accounts and, thus, \nshifting anticipated emergency spending off budget. We should require \nemergency accounts to be funded through the normal appropriations \nprocess based on our historical experience.\n  Mr. President, I join Senator Snowe in the hopes that our colleagues \nwill support this important legislation. It is vital that we assure \nthat we do not misuse our emergency spending powers. The next Congress \nthat leaves the door wide open to raids on the surplus will be the one \nthat passes on more debt and a less secure future for our children and \nour grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 484. A bill to provide for the granting of refugee status in the \nUnited States to nationals of certain foreign countries in which \nAmerican Vietnam War POW/MIAs or American Korean War POW/MIAs may be \npresent, if those nationals assist in the return to the United States \nof those POW/MIAs alive; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the bring them home alive act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Bring Them \nHome Alive Act of 1999. This bill would persuade foreign nationals to \ntake the bold steps needed to return any possibly surviving American \nPOW/MIAs home alive. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Gregg \nand Helms as original cosponsors.\n  With the passage of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' \nBill of Rights Act of 1999, the Senate this week has made great strides \nin providing for the men and women of our armed forces. I am continuing \nthis effort today.\n  This bill would grant asylum in the United States to foreign \nnationals who personally deliver a living American POW/MIA from either \nthe Vietnam War or the Korean War to the United States. Citizens of \nVietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China, or any of the states of the former \nSoviet Union who deliver living American POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War \nwould be granted asylum here. Similarly, citizens of North Korea, \nChina, or any of the states of the former Soviet Union who deliver \nliving American POW/MIAs from the Korean War would also be granted \nasylum. Of course, that foreign national's immediate family, including \ntheir spouse and children, would also be granted asylum in the U.S. \nsince their safety, and even their lives, would most likely\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\nbe imperiled by such a daring rescue of surviving American POW/MIAs.\n  While some may doubt that any American POW/MIAs from these two wars \nremain alive, official U.S. policy distinctly recognizes the \npossibility that U.S. POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War could still be \nalive and held captive in Indochina. As the Defense Department's \ncurrent position states:\n\n       Although we have thus far been unable to prove that \n     Americans are still being held against their will, the \n     information available to us precludes ruling out that \n     possibility. Actions to investigate live-sighting reports \n     receive and will continue to receive necessary priority and \n     resources based on the assumption that at least some \n     Americans are still held captive. Should any report prove \n     true, we will take appropriate action to ensure the return of \n     those involved.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today supports this official position and \nenables the possibility of bringing any surviving U.S. servicemen home \nalive.\n  Since the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, there have been reports of \nlive sightings of American POW/MIAs being held in Indochina. While the \nmajority of these live-sightings have been resolved over the years, and \nhave decreased in recent years, the possibility of Americans still \nbeing held remains. Two Russian translations of Vietnamese documents \nwere discovered in Soviet archives in 1993 which contain detailed \nstatistics indicating that approximately twice as many American POWs \nwere being held by Vietnam in late 1972 than were actually ever \nreturned to the United States.\n\n  Furthermore, the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs' final \nreport in 1993 concluded that about 100 U.S. POWs that were expected to \nbe returned by Vietnam were never returned and that at least some of \nthem may still be alive and held captive in Indochina.\n  It is also possible that American POW/MIAs are still being held in \nNorth Korea. A few years ago a 1996 Defense Department internal report \nwas uncovered that concluded that between 10-15 POW/MIAs may still be \nalive and held against their will in North Korea.\n  The Bring Them Home Alive Act includes the states of the former \nSoviet Union, for just cause. Longstanding rumors that American POW/\nMIAs from both the Vietnam War and the Korean War were transferred to \nthe Soviet Union were recently reinforced by the memoirs of recently \ndeceased Soviet General Dmitri Volkogonov. As reported in a January 12, \n1999, Washington Times article, Gen. Volkogonov wrote of seeing a \nsecret KGB document from the 1960s outlining a plan to transfer U.S. \nPOWs being held in Vietnam to the Soviet Union. The goal of this secret \nKGB plan was ``to bring knowledgeable Americans to the Soviet Union for \nintelligence (gathering) purposes.'' During a Congressional Delegation \nvisit to Russia late last year, Russian General Sergeyev tacitly \nconfirmed the existence of this document. While some officials contend \nthis plan was never carried out, this is far from certain. In addition, \nthe cumulative weight of compelling circumstantial evidence supports \nthe assertion that American POWs were also transferred to the Soviet \nUnion during the Korean War.\n  Finally, a key section of this bill would help spread news of the \nBring Them Home Alive Act around the world. This is needed to help make \nsure that the key foreign nationals who need to hear about this act, do \nso. My bill calls on the International Broadcasting Bureau to use its \nassets, including Worldnet Television and its Internet sites, to spread \nthe news. The bill also calls on Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia \nto participate.\n  If this bill leads to even one long-held POW/MIA being returned home \nto America alive, this effort will be well worth it, 10,000 times over. \nEven though it has been many years since these two wars ended, they \nhave not ended for any Americans who may have been left behind and are \nstill alive. As long as there remains even the remotest possibility \nthat there may be any surviving POWs, we owe it to our Soldiers, \nSailors, Airmen and Marines, and their families, to do everything \npossible to bring them home alive. This is the least we can do after \nall they have sacrificed.\n  Key groups involved in Veterans and POW/MIA issues have endorsed this \nlegislation, including the National Vietnam & Gulf War Veterans \nCoalition, the VietNow National POW/MIA Committee, and the Coalition of \nFamilies of Korean and Cold War POW/MIAs. Naturally, I welcome any \nadditional endorsements that any of the other important organizations \ninvolved in POW/MIA related issues may wish to provide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bring \nThem Home Alive Act of 1999, the Washington Times article, and the \nletters of endorsement be included in the Record. I urge my colleagues \nto support passage of this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bring Them Home Alive Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Curt Weldon said he is upset by the claim of the Duma \n     member who told him about the State Department comments \n     during a meeting in Moscow last month.\n       ``During a conversation, the official told me `I can tell \n     you, we were told by your government, your State Department, \n     not to pursue these issues,' '' Mr. Weldon, Pennsylvania \n     Republican, said in an interview.\n       The statement bolsters private criticism by some Pentagon \n     officials that the State Department is refusing to press the \n     Russian government to investigate cases of missing Americans.\n       Pentagon officials told The Washington Times last month \n     that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright delayed for \n     months contacting senior Russian officials about a secret KGB \n     plan to transport ``knowledgeable Americans'' to the Soviet \n     Union during the late 1960s for intelligence purposes.\n       Mrs. Albright also failed to raise the issue directly with \n     Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is now prime \n     minister, during several meetings. Mr. Primakov would have \n     had direct knowledge of the secret plan while he was director \n     of Russian intelligence in the early 1990s.\n       Mr. Weldon said he is investigating the claim and has \n     written to Mrs. Albright asking for an explanation.\n       The Russian official was not identified by name, but Mr. \n     Weldon said the official had worked on the U.S.-Russian Joint \n     Commission on POWs headed by retired Russian Gen. Dmitri \n     Volkogonov. The Duma members told Mr. Weldon about the \n     problem in a private meeting.\n       ``His accusation is quite disturbing in light of the \n     administration's initial reluctance to aggressively pursue \n     the matter with the Russian government,'' Mr. Weldon states \n     in a Jan. 6 letter to Mrs. Albright, ``I urge that you \n     investigate this charge and inform me of your findings.''\n       Ann Johnson, a State Department spokeswoman, said the \n     matter was ``looked into,'' but no one in the State \n     Department relayed such a message to any Duma members.\n       Asked if Mrs. Albright would raise the issue of the POW \n     document during her upcoming meetings with Russian officials \n     in Moscow, Miss Johnson said the agenda has not been set. \n     ``We do look forward to getting a look at the results of the \n     Russian investigation of this matter, as Prime Minister \n     Primakov promised Vice President [Al] Gore in Kuala Lumpur in \n     November,'' she said.\n       Gen. Volkogonov, who died in December 1995, disclosed in a \n     memoir published in September that he had uncovered the \n     secret plan by the KGB intelligence service during the late \n     1960s ``to bring knowledgeable Americans to the Soviet Union \n     for intelligence purposes.''\n       After the plan was disclosed by The Times in November, \n     White House spokesmen initially said President Clinton would \n     not raise the issue in meetings with Mr. Primakov set for \n     late November in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Later, the White \n     House reversed its position and said the president would \n     bring up the issue if talks at the POW commission in Moscow \n     failed to resolve the matter.\n       After Mr. Clinton canceled his trip to Malaysia because of \n     the crisis with Iraq, Mr. Gore raised the issue with Mr. \n     Primakov.\n       Mr. Clinton said in a letter to a POW activist last month \n     that he is ``very concerned'' about the Russian plan ``given \n     that American personnel were held as POWs in Southeast Asia \n     during this same period.'' He promised to ``press'' the \n     Russians to provide answers.\n       The president stated in a Dec. 18 letter to Delores Alfond, \n     chairman of the National Alliance of Families, that his \n     administration is trying to find out about the authors of the \n     KGB plan, whether it was carried out, and ``the names of any \n     Americans who were transferred.'' If the plan was not carried \n     out, ``we have requested documentation that convincingly \n     proves this point,'' he said.\n       Mr. Weldon said in his letter to Mrs. Albright that he was \n     encouraged by the administration's discussions, ``but I \n     remain deeply disappointed that you deferred pursuit of this \n     matter for so long after it first came to your attention.''\n       ``With hundreds of U.S. POW-MIAs still unaccounted for, we \n     must aggressively pursue all evidence which might help us \n     determine their fate,'' he said. ``The United States has no \n     basis on which to turn its back on information which may lead \n     us to closure on the POW issue. Nor should we fear \n     repercussions from the Russian government, as it will not \n     suffer the reputation of its predecessor's excesses, but may \n     actually enhance its own reputation by fully disclosing the \n     fact.''\n       Mr. Weldon said that Mrs. Albright should investigate the \n     Duma official's charge and ``reaffirm the strong U.S. \n     commitment to leave no stone unturned in the effort to \n     determine the fate of all U.S. POWs.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                VietNow National Headquarters,\n\n                                  Rockford, IL, February 18, 1999.\n     Hon.

There \n     is reason to believe that some of these fellow Americans are \n     still alive. Your approach to gain their release, as outlined \n     in your bill titled ``The Bring Them Home Alive Act of \n     1999'', is viable and provides incentive for those who may be \n     able to secure our POWs release to do so.\n       I have written my two senators, Boxer and Feinstein, with a \n     request that they join your effort and cosponsor your bill.

One of the most important goals of our Coalition \n     is the return of any living missing American servicemen in \n     Southeast Asia.\n       Your legislative initiative of introducing the ``Bring Them \n     Home Alive Act of 1999'' is the right bill at the right time. \n     This bill will grant asylum or refugee status to any foreign \n     national that helps bring out a live American prisoner of war \n     (POW) from the Vietnam War.

A bill to provide for the disposition of unoccupied and \nsubstandard multifamily housing projects owned by the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                          urban homestead act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Urban Homestead act, \na bill designed to reform the way in which the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development (HUD) disposes of unoccupied and substandard \nhousing stock.\n  In summary, the Urban Homestead Act would require HUD, every six \nmonths, to publish in the National Register a complete listing of all \nsingle, and multi-family housing stock that has been in the \nDepartment's inventory for at least six months. Further, HUD is \nrequired to publish a complete listing of all substandard housing stock \nin the same manner. Locally based community development corporations \nwould then be allowed to petition HUD for possession of these \nproperties. HUD would be required to transfer the properties to the CDC \nfree of cost.\n  There are few more obnoxious examples of government inefficiency and \nineffectiveness than that of HUD's inability to address the housing \nneeds of low-income families. HUD is notorious for its bloated \nbureaucracy and malfeasance in administering our nations public housing \nassistance programs. Nowhere is this ineptitude more glaringly obvious \nthan in HUD's disposition of housing stock.\n  In our nation's inner cities, there are thousands of quiet heroes, \nstruggling against and conquering near-insurmountable obstacles in \nefforts to revitalize their communities. They are winning the battle \none house, one street, one neighborhood at a time.\n  These organizations are as unique as the communities and \nneighborhoods in which they work their magic. It is their ability to \nadapt to the local demands of their neighborhoods which is the key to \ntheir success. However, one challenge which is the same, regardless of \nwhat community they are operating in, is the vacant house. These \nabandoned houses play host to all types of criminal activity. They are \ncrack houses, centers of gang activities, and prostitution. You name \nit. The abandoned house has become a symbol of urban blight.\n  I ask my colleagues, who do you think is to blame for this outrage? A \nslum lord, or an absentee owner, perhaps a greedy land speculator? In \nsome instances, this may be the case. But a principal culprit \nresponsible for kneecapping the efforts of these neighborhood heroes is \nnon-other-than the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Many of \nthese homes are the product of FHA foreclosures. They are the product \nof lax lending habits and pathetic administration of the HUD property \ndisposition program.\n  Well, Mr. President, it is my intention to put HUD out of the \nslumlord business. The legislation I introduce today sends a very \nsimple message to HUD. They have six months to get a property on the \nmarket and sold. If they fail to get the job done, they're going to \nhave to turn the property over to a CDC and they'll get the job done \nfor them.\n  By channeling these properties into the hands of CDCs providing home \nownership opportunities to low-income families, we will be \naccomplishing several important objectives. First, we will be placing a \nvaluable resource into the hands of not-for-profits who may otherwise \nlack the capital resources to purchase the housing stock. Secondly, we \nget the property back in circulation. In doing so, it ceases to be a \ncenter for criminal activity and a symbol of blight. Finally, and most \nimportant, these organizations will use this housing stock to do what \nHUD has failed to accomplish. They will provide low-income families a \npiece of the American dream--a chance at home ownership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the punishment of methamphetamine \nlaboratory operators, provide additional resources to combat \nmethamphetamine production, trafficking, and abuse in the United \nStates, and for other purposes, to be Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  determined and full engagement against the threat of meth (``defeat \n                              meth'') act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we live in a time of unparalleled \nprosperity. The stock market continually hits new highs, while \nunemployment and gasoline plunge to record lows. This prosperity brings \nmany blessings, chief among them material comfort. But sometimes \nprosperity can mask problems as well as solve them. As Francis Bacon \nsaid, ``Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and \nadversity is not without comforts and hopes.'' Prosperity can breed \napathy and complacency, weakening a society's ability to respond to the \nchallenges facing it. And as for adversity, it is only when people \nrealize the true extent of their challenges that they can overcome \nthem.\n  One of the greatest challenges we face is drugs, especially the \nrecent rise in the production and use of methamphetamines. Despite the \ncontinued challenge drugs present, we have not heard enough about this \nproblem recently. This administration has chosen not to make it a \npriority. A few years ago, Democrat Representative Charles Rangel \nlamented this administration's inaction on the drug war: ``I've been in \nCongress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any \nadministration that's been so silent on this great challenge to the \nAmerican people.'' Former Drug Czar William Bennett agrees, having \ntestified before our colleagues in the House of Representatives that: \n``The Clinton Administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs.'' We \nhave gone from an era of ``just say no'' to an era of ``I didn't \ninhale,'' and the numbers concerning youth drug use show that these \ncontrasting messages make a difference.\n  While the financial numbers continue to move in the right direction, \nthe numbers concerning youth direction have gone in the wrong \ndirection. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who had tried \nillegal drugs was a shocking 54%--133% of the level in 1992. This \nfigure, which had decreased during the 1980s, increased in the 1990s. \nSimilarly, in 1998, the reported illicit drug use by 12th graders in \nthe last 30 days was more than 177% of the level seven years earlier.\n  What is particularly alarming is the drastic increase in the use of \nheavy drugs by teenagers. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who \nused cocaine in the last 30 days was 178% of the level in 1992. \nMoreover, the percentage of heroin use was 250% of the 1992 level. The \nplain facts are that drug use among our nation's youth is far too \ncommon and becoming more so. Our nation appears to be sliding backward \nfrom the strides we made in the 1980s.\n  The increases in drug use among our children are alarming. Our \nchildren are our greatest asset and they are at great risk from drugs. \nThey are the most vulnerable members of our society. And, more than any \nother group, young people face the highest risk of being lost to drugs \nforever.\n  The more than half of the nation's high school seniors who have \nalready tried drugs run much greater risks of future drug use than \ntheir peers. According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, \nthose who do not try drugs by their mid-twenties are unlikely ever to \nuse drugs. Protecting our children from drugs is the best way to stop \nadults from using drugs.\n  The challenge before us--protecting our children from drugs--becomes \never more difficult in a society plagued by divorce, single-parent \nhouseholds, diffuse communities, and the never-ending beat of ``live \nfor today'' messages coming from our culture. Every one of these \nfactors makes it harder to impart the right messages to the next \ngeneration and to keep our children off drugs.\n  Protecting our children from drugs is more difficult than ever. In \nthe last few years, a new enemy has emerged to join the other, more \nfamiliar, threats of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. That new threat is \nmethamphetamine or ``meth,'' a dangerous, addictive substance that is \nruining lives and weakening communities across this great land. Meth is \nto the 1990s what cocaine was to the 1980s and heroin was to the 1970s. \nAnd the problem is growing exponentially, in both Missouri and the \nnation at large. In 1992, DEA agents seized 2 clandestine meth labs in \nthe State of Missouri. By 1994, there were 14 seizures. That was \nserious enough. However, in 1997, they seized 421 labs.\n  Meth ensnares our children, endangers us all, and causes users to \ncommit other crimes. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used \nmeth was double the 1992 level. Meth-related emergency room incidents \nare up 63 percent over that same period. The National Institute of \nJustice released a report just a couple of months ago that showed meth \nuse among adult arrestees and detainees has risen to alarming levels \nacross the country.\n\n  Meth is one of the most serious drug problems in our nation--and, in \nstates like Missouri--it remains the most serious problem. Just ask the \nMcClelland family in Kansas City. Their 11-year-old daughter was \nbludgeoned to death by a family friend who was high on meth. Her \nmurderer admitted to beating her in the head repeatedly with a claw \nhammer after she resisted his sexual advances.\n  This is not an isolated incident. Meth kills. Law enforcement \nofficers in Missouri refer to it as a triple threat. It can kill the \nuser; it can make the user kill and, in many cases, even its production \ncan kill.\n  Meth labs have been called toxic time bombs because volatile \nchemicals are mixed in the manufacturing process. There have been \ndozens of lab explosions. There are also numerous cases of meth abusers \nbooby-trapping their abandoned labs, resulting in serious injuries to \nlaw enforcement agents. Even when not booby trapped, abandoned labs are \nlike toxic waste dumps. Clean up is both dangerous and expensive.\n  Meth production poses a unique challenge to law enforcement because \nof the difficulties in effective interdiction. Although some meth comes \nin the United States from Mexico, much of it is home produced from \nreadily-available materials. It can be manufactured in clandestine labs \nand even in the kitchen of a moving RV--a literal moving target for law \nenforcement. Meth also can be manufactured in batches large or small. \nLaw enforcement officials in Missouri have told me that as we have \npoured more resources into the fight against meth, some meth cooks have \nresorted to smaller and smaller batches to reduce the chances of \ndetection. Other law enforcement officers report meth operations that \ncontract out the various steps in the manufacturing process to \ndifferent sites to reduce the chances of detection.\n  Meth also has some unique attributes which appeal to users. Smoking \nmeth produces a high that lasts 8 to 24 hours. Cocaine, in contrast, \nproduces a high that lasts for 20 to 30 minutes. Meth appeals not only \nto those looking for an extended high. It appeals to vanity as well. \nMeth suppresses appetite and is enticing to young adults trying to lose \nweight.\n  While meth is different from other drugs in some ways--more \ndangerous, more difficult to police--at its core, it is the same as \nother narcotics in that it imposes costs. According to Bill Bennett, \nthe use of drugs ``makes every other social problem much worse.''\n  Meth contributes to a host of societal ills--violence, unemployment, \nhomelessness, family breakup. I have heard too many stories of \nneglected children all but abandoned in a home turned into a meth lab. \nThere are enough threats to our children that we do not need meth \nadding to our burden.\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\n  I want to fight the scourge of meth because of the violence it \ncauses. I want to fight meth because of the costs it imposes, on \nsociety and on families, on taxpayers and on communities. But there is \nanother factor that motivates my opposition to meth: I want to fight \nmeth because its use and production is wrong. And too few people are \nwilling to stand up these days and call drugs wrong.\n  This laissez faire attitude leads to too much permissiveness on the \nsubject of drugs. And permissiveness on drugs imposes terrible moral \nand psychic costs on America's youth.\n  In fact, much of our current predicament stems for the permissive \nattitudes that emerged from the 1960s. The decay of enforcement that \nbegan in the 1960s helped to cause the problems of the succeeding \ndecades.\n  Make no mistake. Enforcement is an extremely effective tool in \ndiminishing drug use. During the 1960s and 1970s, the period coinciding \nwith the dawn of this country's second great drug crisis, incarceration \nrates plummeted from 90 per 1,000 arrests in 1960 to only 19 per 1,000 \narrests by 1980. Laws are what protects society from anarchy. And when \nwe choose not to enforce our laws, our laws lose their effectiveness, \nand the bulwark against anarchy withers.\n  While our society too often tends towards laxness, we also have a \nhistory of responding to challenges. America has never faced a problem \nthat has proven too great for us to meet or too big for us to tackle. \nThe meth challenge, while daunting, is no exception. If we make a \ndetermined and full engagement in our war against meth, we will win. We \nwill defeat meth.\n  In my four years in the United States Senate, I have fought the \ngrowth of meth trafficking. In the last Congress, I introduced the \n``Trafficking Penalties Enhancement Act'' to provide more severe \npenalties for manufacturing, trafficking, or importing meth. That \nlegislation, which was signed into law last fall, increases prison \nterms for meth possession to a 10-year minimum for possession of 50 \ngrams of meth or more, and a 5-year minimum for 5 grams or more. That \nlaw also made more meth crimes eligible for the death penalty in \nsituations in which a murder is committed in conjunction with the meth \noffense. In light of the triple threat nature of meth, the availability \nof the death penalty is particularly relevant and appropriate.\n  In order to protect residents of public housing, I worked with my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, to place a ``one strike and your \nout,'' lifetime ban from public housing premises for individuals who \nmanufacture or produce methamphetamine.\n  I also worked to set up a regional High-Intensity Drug Trafficking \nArea (or HIDTA) that covers Missouri. More recently, I organized a \nbipartisan effort by the Missouri congressional delegation that led to \nincreased funding for anti-meth initiatives, including resources for \nlaw enforcement and lab cleanup. These steps are all important. When I \ntalked with representatives of Missouri law enforcement earlier this \nweek, they underscored that these programs are having a positive effect \nin the fight against meth. But winning the battle against meth once and \nfor all will take continued hard work and effort.\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to take the next step in the fight \nagainst meth, the Determined and Full Engagement Against the Threat of \nMeth Act, or the ``DeFEAT Meth Act'' for short.\n  My anti-methamphetamine legislation will have five main components.\n  First, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to adjust its \nguidelines to increase penalties for meth crimes. In the last Congress \nwe were able to raise the mandatory minimum sentences for meth \ntrafficking crimes involving over 5 grams. This provision complements \nlast year's legislation by increasing penalties for meth crimes that do \nnot come under the mandatory minimums, and adding a special sentencing \nenhancement for meth crimes that endanger human life. This provision \ncompletes the process of imposing appropriate and severe penalties on \nthose who wish to tear apart the very fabric of our society by \ndistributing meth.\n  Second, my legislation will provide law enforcement officers with \nmore resources for combating meth. Specifically, it is time to \nauthorize more funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration's meth \ninitiative. This funding is essential. In order to stop the spread of \nmeth, the DEA needs to hire more agents, and provide additional \ntraining for state and local law enforcement officers. These agents \nwill participate in the DEA's comprehensive plan for targeting and \ninvestigating meth trafficking, production and abuse. The DEA also \nneeds to provide additional support for local law enforcement. When law \nenforcement busts a meth lab, they are taking over the equivalent of a \ntoxic waste dump. The serious and unique problems cleanup problems \ncreated by meth demand a serious and unique response.\n  Third, we need to educate our children about the dangers of meth. \nWhile DEA interdiction is vital, we also need to educate parents, \nteachers, and children--who may not yet be familiar with the dangers of \nmeth--about the size of the threat. We should authorize new funding for \nprograms to educate parents and teachers of the dangers of \nmethamphetamine. Missouri law enforcement officers estimate that as \nmany as 10% of high-school students know the recipe for meth. We must \nmake sure that 100% of them know that meth is a recipe for disaster.\n  Fourth, we need to recognize that, more than any other narcotic, meth \ncan be made all too easily, in home grown laboratories, with readily-\navailable chemicals. To counteract this problem, we must ensure that \nthe list of banned precursor chemicals used to make meth is kept up to \ndate. It seems that when a precursor chemical is added to the list, \nmeth cooks figure out how to manufacture meth with a new unlisted \nchemical. We must remain vigilant in the battle against meth. After \nconsulting with people on the front line--in the crime labs in \nMissouri--we have proposed adding two new precursor chemicals: red \nphosphorous and sodium dichromate.\n  Finally, the bill amends the federal drug paraphernalia statute to \ncover meth. The current law covers paraphernalia used to ingest a \nnumber of specific drugs including marijuana and cocaine. It does not \ncover meth. There is no basis for this differential treatment, and the \nbill adds meth to the statute.\n  This comprehensive plan is an essential step in the war against meth. \nWhile no plan will not stop the spread of meth overnight, we must \ncontinue the long process of stopping this onslaught. Defeating meth \nwill be a struggle that takes place in schools, in communities, in \nchurches, within families. We must teach the next generation the danger \nof drugs and give them alternatives to the easy short term answers that \ndrugs provide.\n  Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have overcome other \nchallenges in the past and we can conquer this one as well. In fact, \nthe history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing \npeople's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All we need to \nsucceed is to marshal our will and channel the great indomitable \nAmerican spirit. The experience of the past few years demonstrates that \nyou cannot win the war on drugs with a half-hearted effort. However, \nexperience also shows that we can win if we commit to a determined and \nfull engagement against the threat of drugs. This bill provides full \nengagement. With it, we will meet the meth challenge and we will defeat \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the conducting of certain games of chance shall not be treated as \nan unrelated trade or business; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           Federal unrelated business income tax legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, at the beginning of this session, I, along \nwith Senator Roth and others, introduced S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All \nAmericans Act, which calls for a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut on \nthe federal income taxes of hard-working Americans.\n  If enacted, this will be the largest middle-class tax relief since \nPresident Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts. I believe this legislation is \nimperative for our economic security and growth in the new millennium. \nI will address this issue more fully later this week.\n  But today I also rise to introduce four bills representing some other \ntax relief priorities on which I hope we can also focus in this \nCongress. These bills will help reform our tax system and will help to \nterminate some unfair and unjust tax provisions in the Tax Code, again, \nwith the aim and the goal of allowing working Americans to keep a \nlittle bit more of their own money rather than sending it to \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, the first bill I am introducing today, the National \nTax Rebate Act, requires the Government to refund taxes collected to \ntaxpayers when Federal revenue grows faster than the income of working \nAmericans.\n  The rationale for this legislation is simple: and that is, the \nFederal Government's taxes should not grow faster than working \nAmericans' income. Our\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\ngrowing tax burden should not reduce the standard of living that we \nwork hard to achieve. This legislation will ensure that it does not.\n  Eighteen of the last 19 Democrat-controlled Congresses passed tax \nincreases. President Clinton's whopping $241 billion tax increase in \n1993 was the largest tax hike we have had. We had only two Federal \npersonal income tax rates at that time. They were 15 and 28 percent, \nthose under President Ronald Reagan.\n  Today, after President Clinton has been in office for 6 years, we \nhave five Federal tax brackets. The top one has reached nearly 40 \npercent. More hard-working, middle-income families have been pushed \ninto higher tax brackets because of an unfair tax system. So we have \ngone from two brackets of 15 percent and 28 percent to now five tax \nbrackets, the highest being nearly 40 percent. No wonder Washington's \nincome is growing and growing much faster than the income of the \ntaxpayers. That is one reason why we have a surplus in Washington \ntoday, because incomes have gone up for Americans, and Washington has \ntaken a larger share of that in the form of taxes.\n  Thanks to our exceptionally strong economy, more Americans are \nworking today, and are earning more than ever before as a result. \nGovernment data show that real median family income is now at a near-\nhistoric high and per capita income is at a record $19,241.\n  We should not be here penalizing those who work long and hard to \nachieve the American dream of higher earnings and better jobs by \nslapping higher taxes on them.\n  Unfortunately, a large share of the newly earned income of hard-\nworking Americans has not been spent on family priorities but siphoned \noff by Washington.\n  The progressive Federal tax system created by Washington allows \nFederal Government income to grow faster by taking a larger bite from \nany newly earned income increases. That is because it pushes us into \none of these higher tax brackets.\n  According to Scott Hodge, a leading economist at Citizens for a Sound \nEconomy, total personal income since 1993 has grown by an average of \n5.2 percent a year, while Federal taxes have grown by 7.9 percent a \nyear--so taxes have grown 52 percent faster than personal income \ngrowth.\n   In fiscal year 1998 alone, federal taxes grew 70 percent faster than \npersonal income.\n   Mr. President, this is not justifiable. Uncle Sam's income should by \nno means grow faster than the income of the people who earn it.\n   While broad-based tax relief for every American, such as S.3, would \ncertainly correct the unfairness of the tax system, we need a mechanism \nthat ensures Washington's income will never grow faster than the income \nof taxpayers.\n   This is all my legislation does. It limits federal taxes by \nprohibiting the growth rate of federal revenues collected for any \nfiscal year from exceeding the average growth rate of personal income \nof working Americans.\n  Set a guidepost. Set a marker as to how fast Washington should grow \nin the money it collects and spends.\n  It requires a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate to \nwaive this limit. Whenever Washington's tax revenues grow faster than \nthe personal income of working Americans, an automatic national tax \nrebate will be triggered as a result.\n  The federal government must refund taxpayers the excessive taxes pro \nrata based on liability reported on federal income tax annual returns \nfiled in the previous tax year.\n  The national tax rebate is not a new idea. A number of states, such \nas Florida and Missouri, have either statutory laws or constitutional \namendments requiring state governments to give back tax money if the \nrevenue exceeds these limits.\n  My own State of Minnesota is currently deciding how best to refund \nexcess tax collection to Minnesota taxpayers.\n  If it works at the state level, there is no excuse for the federal \ngovernment not to adopt a similar mechanism.\n  By passing this simple tax limitation and rebate legislation, \ntaxpayers will be fully protected and better represented in Washington.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation would repeal taxation of our \nsenior citizens' Social Security benefits.\n  As you know, Mr. President, Social Security benefits were exempt from \nthe federal income tax since the creation of the program.\n  They were never taxed by the Federal Government. Retirement benefits \nshouldn't be.\n  But as Social Security encountered a financial crisis in early 1980s, \nCongress began taxing Social Security benefits, and thus causing \nfinancial hardship to many seniors.\n  The amount of taxable benefits was the lesser of one-half of Social \nSecurity cash benefits or one-half of the excess of the taxpayer's \nprovisional income over the thresholds of $25,000 per single person and \n$32,000 for couples.\n  In 1993, when President Clinton needed more money to fund his new \nspending programs, he increased the taxable proportion of Social \nSecurity benefits from 50 to 85 percent for Social Security recipients \nwhose threshold incomes exceed $34,000 for singles and $44,000 for \ncouples.\n  These two tax increases have seriously injured a significant number \nof senior citizens. In fact, a quarter of recipients are affected by \nthis provision, creating enormous financial hardship for them as well.\n  I believe taxation on Social Security benefits is wrong and unfair \nbecause Social Security benefits are earned benefits for many senior \ncitizens. Federal income tax is paid when Social Security contributions \nare made to the program. Taxing Social Security benefits is clearly \ndouble taxation.\n  In other words, those benefits are paid when the money is put into \nSocial Security, and now the government wants to tax them again as it \ntakes the money out.\n  In addition, Congress never intended to tax Social Security benefits \nwhen it first established the program. In fact, for half a century \nSocial Security benefits were exempted from federal taxes.\n  Millions of senior citizens who planned for their retirement based on \ntheir understanding of the Social Security law were penalized. As the \ntax rate continues to grow, the incomes of more and more senior \ncitizens are falling along with their standard of living.\n  This tax hurts seniors who choose or must work after retirement to \nmaintain their standard of living or to pay for costly health insurance \npremiums, medical care, prescriptions and many other expenses which \nincrease in retirement years.\n  It also discourages today's workers to save and invest for the \nfuture. It won't help protect Social Security for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I believe this is not acceptable.\n  Repealing all taxation on Social Security benefits would reverse this \ntrend, and help responsible senior citizens. The federal government has \nentered into a sacred covenant with the American people to provide \nretirement benefits once contribution commitments are made.\n  It is the government's contractual duty to honor that commitment. The \ngovernment cannot and should not change the covenant without consent of \nthe people whom these changes would affect.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this bill deals with a relatively smaller \ntax matter. This bill calls for exemption of additional charitable \ngambling activities from the Federal unrelated business income tax \n(UBIT).\n  As you know, Mr. President, the fundamental difference between \ncharitable gambling and regular gambling is where and how the profit is \nspent.\n  Most of the income derived from charitable gambling games is spent in \ncommunities to fund charitable activities such as the Boy and Girl \nScouts, Head Start, and many city and school programs that help local \nresidents and students.\n  In my State alone of Minnesota, more than 1,500 local charities \nconduct a variety of games such as bingo and pull tabs, and in doing so \ncontribute some $75 million per year to their local communities.\n  Beneficiaries include youth recreation and education, as well as \norganizations serving the sick and disabled, and many other community \nprograms, as well.\n  My state leads the nation in charitable non-profit gaming, but some \n35 other states are involved in similar activities.\n  In 1978, President Carter signed into law a bill that classified \nbingo income as related business income.\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\n  As a result, this charitable game is not subject to the Federal UBIT. \nBut the law did not include other forms of charitable gambling. \nConsequently, the income of these charitable gambling games is taxed \nunder the UBIT.\n  Taxes take a big bite out of charitable gambling income and seriously \nundermine the ability of nonprofit organizations to provide charitable \nassistance.\n  Now, while the IRS has not collected UBIT on these charities as they \nanticipate Congressional action, without my legislation, the IRS could \nbegin collections in the near future. My legislation would remove this \nuncertainty as charities attempt to go on with their good works.\n  This legislation is not controversial. It should have bipartisan \nsupport. In the last Congress I introduced a similar bill with Senator \nWellstone which the Senate adopted. I hope we can pass it again in the \n106th Congress.\n  The last bill I am introducing today would provide a tax incentive \nfor small business employers to set up pension plans for their workers.\n  Working Americans' retirement security is based on Social Security, \nprivate pensions, and personal savings. But even though Social Security \nis fast approaching a financial crisis, our national savings rate \nremains among the lowest, and many workers do not have company pension \nplans to help make up the Retirement Benefits.\n  Despite recent congressional action to improve private pension plans, \nthe complexity of qualification requirements under current law and the \nadministrative expenses associated with setting up retirement plans, \nincluding the SIMPLE plan, remain significant impediments to widespread \nimplementation of employer-based retirement systems, especially for \nsmall business.\n  This is particularly true for small employers with less than I 00 \nemployees, for whom the resulting benefits do not outweigh the \nadministrative costs.\n  Consequently, only 42% of individuals employed by small businesses \nnow participate in an employer-sponsored plan, as opposed to 78% of \nthose who work for larger businesses.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing the Small Employer Nest Egg \nAct of 1999. This legislation will create a new retirement option for \nsmall business owners with 100 or fewer employees.\n  It would allow the same level of benefits both to employers and \nemployees as larger employers who maintain traditional qualified plans. \nUpon retirement or separation of service, employees would receive I00% \nof their pension account value.\n  To offset the high costs associated with starting a pension plan, my \nproposal calls for a tax cut equal to 50% of the administrative and \nretirement education expenses incurred for the first five years of a \nplan's operation.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, \nproviding millions of jobs nationwide. Small business owners want to \nhelp their employees save for their retirement.\n  Yet, because of the costs, many are unable to do so and, also, \nbecause of the rigid Government policies and, again, the administrative \ncosts that go with it.\n  This legislation, I believe, will help millions of workers begin \nbuilding their retirement security. I urge the support of my colleagues \nfor the four bills I have offered today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

\nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was invested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of \n     America drew heavily upon the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our representative \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the founders of the modern Greek state modeled \n     their government after that of the United States in an effort \n     to best imitate their ancient democracy;\n       Whereas Greece is one of the only 3 nations in the world, \n     beyond the former British Empire, that has been allied with \n     the United States in every major international conflict this \n     century;\n       Whereas the heroism displayed in the historic World War II \n     Battle of Crete epitomized Greece's sacrifice for freedom and \n     democracy as it presented the Axis land war with its first \n     major setback and set off a chain of events which \n     significantly affected the outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 1999, marks the 178th anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 1999, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a resolution \nalong with 49 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 1999, as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democrary.''\n  One hundred and seventy-eight years ago, the Greek people bagan a \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient \nGreeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme \npower to govern was vested in the people. Our founding Fathers drew \nheavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient \nGreece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson \nproclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the \nlight which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, \nthen, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of \ntheir efforts to return to that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosphy, science, \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government. \nIt is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, \nwith overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Senate \nresolution designating March 25, 1999 as ``Greek Independence Day.'' \nMarch 25 marks the 178th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution \nwhich freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire.\n  America is composed of a wide variety of cultures, joined together by \ntheir belief in fundamental principles of human dignity. Through their \narts, literature, culture, food and dance, Greek-Americans have \ncontributed to the diversity and strength of the United States. \nImmigration from Greece first started in 1767 and then began in earnest \nin the late 19th century, when 1,309 immigrants arrived at Ellis Island \nbetween 1890 and 1900. A steady stream continued during the ensuing \ndecades, especially during the Greek Civil War from 1944 to 1949. I am \nproud to represent the state of Michigan which boasts a large Greek-\nAmerican community.\n  Greece, the birthplace of philosophy and of democracy, has given the \nworld Plato and Aristotle, Homer and Sophocles. Greeks have brought \ntheir rich tradition to America, making our nation stronger. I join the \nGreek-American community in Michigan and throughout our nation in \ncelebrating this anniversary of the modern revolution which brought \nfreedom to the Greek people.\n  I take great pleasure in cosponsoring a resolution designating March \n25, 1999 as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of \nGreek and American Democracy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2034-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 51--PROVIDING FOR MEMBERS ON THE PART OF THE SENATE \n   OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE \n                                LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL, from the Committee on Rules and Administration, \nreported the following original resolution:\n\n                               S.

Res. 53\n\n       Whereas approximately 10 percent of all public schools \n     reported at least 1 serious violent crime to a law \n     enforcement agency over the course of the 1996-97 school \n     year;\n       Whereas in 1996, approximately 225,000 students between the \n     ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in \n     schools in the United States;\n       Whereas during 1992 through 1994, 76 students and 29 non-\n     students were victims of murders or suicides that were \n     committed in schools in the United States;\n       Whereas because of escalating school violence, the children \n     of the United States are increasingly afraid that they will \n     be attacked or harmed at school;\n       Whereas efforts must be made to decrease incidences of \n     school violence through an annual remembrance and prevention \n     education; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages school administrators in the \n     United States to develop school violence awareness activities \n     and programs for implementation on March 24, 1999: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 24, 1999, as ``National School \n     Violence Victims' Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     designating March 24, 1999, as ``National School Violence \n     Victims' Memorial Day'' and calling on the people of the \n     United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nwhich is very much related to the educational crisis in our country. \nThis resolution will designate March 24 as National School Violence \nVictims' Memorial Day and encourage the citizens of our Nation to honor \nand remember the victims of school violence on that day.\n  The resolution also will encourage our school administrators to \nconduct programs on that day designed to prevent any further \noccurrences of school violence.\n  I am deeply saddened that the introduction of such a resolution is \neven necessary.\n  No words can ever adequately express the incredible shock, horror, \nand grief that struck me when I heard the news reports of the tragedy \nwhich left 5 dead and 11 wounded at the Westside Middle School in \nJonesboro, AR.\n  No words will ever be able to completely convey the cruel and \nsenseless loss that the families and friends of Natalie Brooks, Paige \nAnn Herring, Stephanie Johnson, Brittheny Varner, and Shannon Wright \nexperienced on March 24, 1998.\n  And no words will ever be able to sufficiently honor Shannon Wright's \nmemory and her heroic sacrifice. I know that the actions she took to \nprotect her students at the cost of her own life will forever be \nremembered. Her actions were motivated out of love for her students and \ntouched the lives of thousands of Arkansans, one of whom, Ms. Jennifer \nMorris, a student in Harrisburg, AR, was so inspired by Ms. Wright's \nloving and courageous sacrifice that she wrote and asked me to \nintroduce legislation which would create a National Shannon Wright Day.\n  Tragically, other communities, other families, and other friends know \nthe pain of such senseless losses as well.\n  Paducah, KY, Pearl, MS, Richmond, VA, Springfield, OR, Edinboro, PA, \nare just a few of the communities that will forever remember the tragic \nresults of school violence.\n  According to the Departments of Education and Justice, over the \ncourse of the 1996-1997 school year 10 percent of all public schools \nreported at least one serious violent crime to a law enforcement \nagency; and in 1996, 225,000 of our students between the ages of 12 and \n18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in our schools. Between 1992 \nand 1994, 76 students and 29 nonstudents lost their lives in murders or \nsuicides committed in American schools.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the percentage of our students who are afraid \nthat they will be attacked or harmed at school is rising dramatically.\n  I am not here today to discuss the causes and solutions to school \nviolence. Rather, I am simply here to honor and remember the victims of \nschool violence. Many of my colleagues who cosponsored this resolution \nhave differing approaches on what we do to solve the problem. Many have \ndifferent ideas on what the causes and solutions to school violence \nare. However, we all agree that we must end this violence in our \nclassrooms and restore the peace that our children once had in their \nhearts and are entitled to enjoy once again.\n  Accordingly, I now introduce this resolution to create National \nSchool Violence Victims' Memorial Day to ensure that we remember and \nthat we honor those who have been victims of school violence and do all \nthat we can to remove violence from our schools and restore peace in \nthe hearts of our students.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a Senate \nResolution to designate March 24, 1999 as National School Violence \nVictims Memorial Day.\n  Just last week I spoke to the Montana State Legislature and \nintroduced an education action plan, a major part of which is making \nsure our kids are safe in America's schools. While I was home I saw \nSteve Bullock. Steve works for our Attorney General, and every time I \nsee Steve I remember his step-brother, Jeremy.\n  You see, Jeremy was 11. He and his twin brother Joshua left for \nschool together as they always did. The day was April 12, 1994. Jeremy \ndidn't come home from school that day. He was shot and killed on the \nplayground, leaving a family and a community forever changed.\n  By recognizing March 24th as National School Violence Victims \nMemorial Day we will be honoring the memory of Jeremy Bullock and \ncountless other children, families and communities by saying clearly, \nwith one voice that we as Americans will meet the challenge of \neradicating violence from our schools.\n  It is, in many ways a challenge to decide what kind of a people we \nare. A challenge to stand up for peace and safety against violence and \nhatred. This is about remembering the victims of school violence and it \nis about what we are going to do in their names.\n  The easy reaction to this kind of senseless violence is to cast blame \nand to turn our communities into one big episode of the Jerry Springer \nshow. But we have as a nation, more often than not, chosen what has \nhistorically been the more difficult road. The road to peace through \ndialogue, understanding and compassion. That is what National School \nViolence Victims Memorial Day is all about.\n  Seventy five years ago, Mahatma Ghandi put it this way. He said ``I \ndiscovered that pursuit of truth did not permit violence being \ninflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by \npatience.''\n  We must use this day to teach and to learn. We must talk about the \n225,000 victims of violent crime. We must act to make schools safer for \nparents, teachers and students and we must learn from our mistakes.\n  And we are always learning. Learning the lessons of the past, \ncommitted to using that knowledge to build a better tomorrow. So let us \nenact this resolution, resolved to working together as one community of \npeople to make America a better place. A place where patience wins out \nover bloodshed and where truth, as Ghandi said, does not permit \nviolence.\n  And let us always remember Jeremy Bullock. For though he is gone, his \nmemory will help fuel our work. When I think of Jeremy I am always \nreminded of a poem called For The Fallen that goes this way:\n\n     They shall not grow old, as we that are left to grow old:\n     Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n     At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will \n           remember them.\n\n\n           \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2035-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2036-S2038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 54--CONDEMNING THE ESCALATING VIOLENCE, THE GROSS \n   VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ATTACKS AGAINST CIVILIANS, AND THE \n  ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN SIERRA \n                                 LEONE\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Biden, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Wellstone, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. Res. 54. A resolution condemning the escalating violence, the \ngross violation of human rights and attacks against civilians, and the \nattempt to overthrow a democratically elected government in Sierra \nLeone; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       Whereas the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) \n     military junta and the rebel fighters of the Revolutionary \n     United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone mounted a campaign of \n     ``Operation No Living Thing'' in 1997 and have recently \n     renewed the terror;\n       Whereas the atrocities and violence against the citizens of \n     Sierra Leone, which include forced amputations, raping of \n     women and children, pillaging farms, and the killing of the \n     civilian population, has continued for more than 8 years;\n       Whereas the AFRC and RUF continue to kidnap children, \n     forcibly train them, and send them as combatants in the \n     conflict in Sierra Leone;\n       Whereas the Nigerian-led intervention force, Economic \n     Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), which has deployed \n     nearly 15,000 troops to Sierra Leone, has made a considerable \n     contribution towards ending the cycle of violence there, \n     despite the fact that some of its members have engaged in \n     violations of humanitarian law;\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n     (UNHCR) estimates that in 1998 more than 210,000 refugees \n     fled Sierra Leone to Guinea, bringing the total number of \n     Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea to 350,000, in addition to \n     some 90,000 Sierra Leonean refugees who sought safe haven in \n     Liberia;\n       Whereas the refugee camps in Guinea and Liberia are at risk \n     of being used as safe havens for rebels and staging areas for \n     attacks into Sierra Leone;\n       Whereas the humanitarian crisis in Sierra Leone has reached \n     epic proportions with people dying from lack of food and \n     medicine; and\n       Whereas the escalating violence in Sierra Leone threatens \n     stability in West Africa and has the immediate potential of \n     spreading to neighboring Guinea: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the President and the Secretary of State to give \n     high priority to aiding in the resolution of the conflict in \n     Sierra Leone and to bringing stability to West Africa, \n     including active participation and leadership in the Sierra \n     Leone Contact Group;\n       (2) condemns--\n       (A) the violent atrocities committed by the Armed Forces \n     Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United \n     Front (RUF) throughout the conflict, and in particular its \n     attacks against civilians and its use of children as \n     combatants; and\n       (B) those external actors, including Liberia, Burkina Faso, \n     and Libya, for contributing to the continuing cycle of \n     violence in Sierra Leone by providing financial, political, \n     and other types of assistance to the AFRC or the RUF, often \n     in direct violation of the United Nations arms embargo;\n       (3) supports continued efforts by the regional peacekeeping \n     force, ECOMOG, to restore peace and security and to defend \n     the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone;\n       (4) recognizes that basic improvements in ECOMOG's \n     performance with respect to human rights and the management \n     of its own personnel would markedly improve its effectiveness \n     in achieving its goals and improve the level of international \n     support needed to meet those goals;\n       (5) supports appropriate United States logistical, medical \n     and political support for ECOMOG and notes the contribution \n     that such support has made thus far toward achieving the \n     goals of peace and stability in Sierra Leone;\n       (6) calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and \n     respect for human rights, and urges all members of the armed \n     conflict in Sierra Leone to engage in dialogue to bring about \n     a long-term solution to such conflict; and\n       (7) expresses support for the people of Sierra Leone in \n     their quest for a democratic, prosperous, and reconciled \n     society.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer S. Res. 54 with \nregard to the escalating violence, the gross violation of human rights \nand attacks against civilians in the West African country of Sierra \nLeone. I am joined in this effort by my colleagues, Senators Frist, \nBiden, Jeffords, Wellstone, and Feinstein.\n  This resolution expresses in the strongest terms the condemnation of \nthe ongoing atrocities committed by rebel forces in Sierra Leone, \nincluding forced amputations, the rape of women and children, the \npillaging of farms, and the murder of unarmed civilians. It urges all \nparties in the brutal violence to cease hostilities and engage in a \ndialogue to bring about a lasting solution that will support the people \nof Sierra Leone in their quest for a democratic, prosperous, and \nreconciled society. It further calls upon the President and the \nSecretary of State to give high priority to solving the conflict and \nsupporting United Nations efforts to monitor respect for human rights \nand humanitarian law by all parties to this deplorable situation.\n  Mr. President, since it gained independence in 1961, Sierra Leone has \nendured a series of military regimes and rebellions in struggles over \neconomic and political power. However, the latest round of violence is \nunique in the scale and brutality of the attacks On innocent civilians. \nLet me provide a little history to help set the stage for the current \nhuman tragedy faced by the people of Sierra Leone. In May 1997, a group \nof military officers, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) \nseized power. During their nine month tenure, the AFRC joined forces \nwith the armed rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to form a regime \ncharacterized by serious human rights abuses and a complete breakdown \nof the rule of law. In response to this situation, in February 1998 the \nEconomic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a \nNigerian-led African peacekeeping force that helped restore stability \nto neighboring Liberia, forced the AFRC/RUF out of power, restoring \nPresident Ahmad Kabbah, who had been elected in March 1996 in Sierra \nLeone's first multi-party elections in almost three decades. Since \ntheir ouster, the AFRC/RUF forces have waged an increasingly vicious \nstruggle against the weak Kabbah government. The situation is further \ncomplicated by the apparent participation by neighboring governments, \nLiberia and Burkina Faso, in supporting the rebel forces. Libya, too, \nhas been identified as providing support to the rebels.\n  In recognition of the unacceptable state of human rights and the \nmassive humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war, the United \nNations took action in July 1998, when the Security Council established \nthe UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for an initial period \nof six months, until January 1999. UNOMSIL, formed of up to 70 military \nobservers and a small medical unit, was tasked with monitoring the \nmilitary and security situation in the country, including the \ndisarmament and demobilization of former combatants, and the adherence \nto international humanitarian law. Unfortunately, a rebel assault on \nthe capital in January forced the evacuation of UNOMSIL to neighboring \nGuinea.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult for most of us to comprehend the \nextent and the brutality of the human crisis in Sierra Leone. The \nUnited Nations has estimated that over 400,000 Sierra Leoneans have \nfled the fighting, either as refugees to neighboring Guinea and Liberia \nor to camps for the internally displaced. Conditions for both \ninternally displaced persons and refugees are often severe due to a \nlack of access to camps and poor security conditions.\n  Mr. President, words cannot adequately describe the horrors that have \nbeen waged by the AFRC/RUF forces, which have included some of the most \nheinous acts ever committed in wartime. Human Rights Watch estimates \nthat thousands of Sierra Leonean civilians have been raped, \ndeliberately mutilated (often by amputation), or killed outright by the \nAFRC/RUF. In February 1998, these rebel groups launched two loosely \norganized campaigns of terror, ``Operation No Living Thing'' and \n``Operation Pay Yourself,'' designed to loot, destroy, or kill anything \nin the path of the combatants. During these campaigns, rebel fighters \nwere encouraged to actively target women and commit sexual violence, \nincluding rape. Children, too, have not been spared from the gross \nviolations of human rights committed by both sides to the conflict. The \nAFRC/RUF has abducted as many as 2,500 children--probably in the \nthousands--for use as laborers, fighters, and in the case of girls, \nsexual prisoners. They have abducted many children, some as young as \neight or ten years old, and turned them into some of the rebels' \nfiercest fighters.\n  In December, the Chairman of the UN Security Council's Sierra Leone \nSanctions Committee stated that it was hard to find words strong enough \nto describe the atrocities committed by the\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\nrebels. He cited instances where AFRC/RUF forces have cut off body \nparts with large machetes or burned civilians alive. He estimated that \nmore than 4,000 people had been summarily executed or mutilated, just \nsince April. Given the restrictions on access to a significant portion \nof the country, these numbers are likely just the tip of the iceberg.\n  The scope of the catastrophe is overwhelming, yet it is even more \nheart rending when viewed through the lens of the stories of individual \nexperiences. International human rights groups have interviewed \nhundreds of survivors of the violence, each with a tale of suffering \nthat is incomprehensible to many Americans. One woman described how she \nwas captured, cut with a machete by a child rebel, had her hand \namputated, and was left to bury her own hand. A reporter for the \n``Herald Guardian'' reported seeing rebels cut off the foot of a boy \nand then execute him, with the final words of ``You're too tall.'' \nAnother woman recounted being captured, beaten, raped, and having the \nbacks of her ankles sliced just below the Achilles tendon to ensure \nthat she could not run away. Hundreds of Sierra Leoneans, who have \nswelled the refugees ranks in border camps in Guinea and Liberia, have \nsimilar stories.\n  Mr. President, although the bulk of the condemnation must go to the \nrebel forces of the AFRC and the RUF, the Kabbah government is itself \nno paragon of liberty and the rule of law. In particular, the Kamajor \ncivilian defense forces affiliated with the Kabbah regime have been \ncited for indiscriminate killings and torture. Many of the more than \n2,000 prisoners in Sierra Leone have been held under the 1998 Public \nEmergency Regulations, which provide for indefinite detention without \ntrial. Section 13 of the same Public Emergency Regulations even \ndeclares that ``disturbing reports'' by the media are punishable \noffenses. Further exacerbating human rights abuses, government prisons \nare often overcrowded, unsanitary, and lacking in health care and the \nregular provision of food.\n\n  In other examples, the High Court of Sierra Leone sentenced to death \ntwenty-seven civilians convicted of treason, including five journalists \nand a seventy-five-year-old woman. International observers questioned \nthe appropriateness of the treason charges for the journalists, and \ncriticized the lack of a right to appeals in sentencing by the military \ncourt. In October, the government of Sierra Leone executed by firing \nsquad, without benefit of an appeal process, twenty-four soldiers.\n  Unfortunately even elements of the otherwise admirable ECOMOG forces \nmust also shoulder some of the responsibility for the devastation that \nwracks Sierra Leone. According to international humanitarian groups, \nshelling by ECOMOG during its assault on Freetown, Sierra Leone's \ncapital, in February 1998, took a high toll on civilians. Its forces \nhave also obstructed humanitarian assistance and some members may seek \nto prolong their mission in order to exploit the conflict for economic \ngain.\n  Mr. President, it is unconscionable to allow this situation to \ncontinue without exerting every effort to help resolve the conflict \nthat generates such atrocities. While no other country or international \norganization can impose a settlement on Sierra Leone, it is incumbent \nupon us to offer our assistance in ending the catastrophic violence. We \nmust call on the combatants to come to the negotiating table, and on \nneighboring governments to cease their support for the rebel forces \nthat have prolonged Sierra Leone's political and humanitarian agony. We \nshould be prepared to support such a process through provision of \nadditional logistical support to the regional peacekeeping force and \nthrough encouragement of a renewed commitment for UNOMSIL to carry out \nits mandate. To provide for a long term solution, we must also actively \nsupport multinational humanitarian operations to address the wide-\nranging needs of a displaced and brutalized population. But even if the \nhumanitarian disaster can be stemmed, we must not walk away until there \nis the prospect of a government that adheres to the rule of law and \nsupports the universally recognized standards of human rights.\n  Mr. President, it does not please me to have to introduce this kind \nof resolution here in the Senate. But I believe it is important for the \nSenate to be on record in strong condemnation of the atrocities \ncurrently raging in Sierra Leone. I hope we can all move quickly to \npass this resolution through the Committee on Foreign Relations and \nthrough the full Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the resolution \nbeing submitted by Senator Frist and Senator Feingold condemning the \nescalating violence and violation of human rights in the nation of \nSierra Leone. The past six weeks we have seen the end to peace and \nsecurity in that country as a result of the renewed offensive by the \ncombined forces of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council military \njunta, known as the AFRC and a rebel group known as the Revolutionary \nUnited Front, or RUF in a effort to once again overthrow the \ndemocratically elected government of Sierre Leone.\n  The Economic Community of West African States stepped in almost a \nyear ago, sending its Military Observer Group, called ECOMOG, to \nrestore President Tejan Kabbah to power. Since that time, ECOMOG has \nbeen the sole thin line standing between notoriously inhumane AFRC/RUF \nforces and the fall of the democratically elected government.\n  Unfortunately on January 6 of this year, the AFRC/RUF once again \nattacked Freetown and continued waging an inhumane and unbelievably \nbrutal war on the civilian population in the countryside. There are \ndisturbing reports both in the media and from our embassy in Sierra \nLeone that the AFRC/RUF has rounded up civilians including men, women \nand children for the purposes of torture and mutilation. AFRC/RUF \nsoldiers use machetes to amputate one or both hands, feet, ears, arms, \nand fingers of their civilian victims.\n  These reports indicate that victims are sometimes instructed to take \na severed limb, body part or note to the government or ECOMOG stating \nthat the government should replace the amputated body part, and that \nECOMOG should leave Sierra Leone. These atrocities are carried out \nregardless of age or gender, and do not appear to be ethnically or \nreligiously motivated.\n  Women and girls are kidnaped and forced into sexual slavery. Some \nkidnap victims are used as labor in rebel camps. Boys and young men are \ncompelled to join the AFRC/RUF as soldiers against their will. \nWitnesses say that children as young as seven years have been forcibly \nrecruited by the rebels.\n  The result of the escalated violence has been the exodus of over \n450,000 people into neighboring Guinea and Liberia. Nearly twice as \nmany are wandering around within the borders of Sierra Leone, their \nhomes and villages destroyed, vulnerable to further attacks from \ninsurgents, without access to food or medicine.\n  With the help of external actors who are acting in direct violation \nof a United Nationals arms embargo, the AFRC/RUF has been able to \neffectively sustain its assaults against civilians and ECOMOG troops. \nHowever, the AFRC/RUF has demonstrated no organized political platform \nor agenda. It enjoys no popular support among the people of Sierra \nLeone. In short, this group can accurately be described as a band of \nwell armed, determined thugs.\n  I applaud the administration for providing aid to ECOMOG. However, as \nI wrote to the Secretary of State this week, and as this resolution \nindicates, the United States can and should do more to support ECOMOG \nfinancially. While ECOMOG is far from perfect, it is the only thing \nstanding between the civilian population the fall of the duly elected \ngovernment to indiscriminate, brutally violent AFRC/RUF forces.\n  It is for all of the above reasons that I join my colleagues Senators \nFrist and Feingold in sponsoring this resolution.\n  In addition to condemning the heinous actions of the AFRC/RUF rebels \nand the involvement of external actors in support of the rebels, the \nresolution urges the Administration to continue to give a high priority \nto solving this conflict.\n  Thousands of innocent men, women and children have been wounded, \nmaimed and killed in the past months alone. We must do all we can do to \nbring about a swift and long-term political solution to this war. This \nis the\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\nonly way to put a decisive end to the suffering of the population of \nSierra Leone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2036-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nsubject of the Meat Labeling Act of 1999. This measure, introduced \nearlier this year by South Dakota Senator, Tim Johnson, would require \nthe country-of-origin labeling of beef, lamb, and pork prior to their \nsale at a retail level in the United States.\n  This bill will protect the consumers--who right now have no way of \ntelling what country their meat is coming from--and come to the aid of \nan industry which has had to face severe competition from foreign \ncountries in recent years.\n  Mr. President, last year, the U.S. agriculture industry faced \ndevastating losses. Bad weather, pest infestation, decreased demand \nstemming from the Asian financial crisis, and increased imports, \nespecially from Canada, all contributed to the record low prices in \nnearly every sector.\n  In Wisconsin, the hog industry took a big hit as cash prices dropped \nan average of 55%. Incomes were slashed, farms were sold for pennies on \nthe dollar, and over 600 producers left the business.\n  This year, the Asian crisis continues, as well as the financial \nproblems in Russia, in Brazil and other countries. The truth is that \nthe market for U.S. agriculture products is bleak and it does not \nappear to be changing anytime soon.\n  America's meat producers face not only tough global competition from \nabroad, but a big disadvantage here at home, because their products \naren't marked ``made in the USA.''\n  That means consumers can't distinguish a U.S.-grown pork chop from a \nMexican one. This raises health and safety concerns, since meat-\nhandling standards in other countries may not be as stringent as our \nown, and it means that consumers can't choose to put their buying power \nbehind American farmers in the check-out aisle.\n  Right now the only guidance consumers do have is misleading at best--\nsince many of us would assume that a steak that carries a USDA \ninspection and grade label is U.S. produced. But in many cases, this \ncouldn't be farther from the truth. That steak could be from Mexico, \nCanada, or Nicaragua. And for a variety of reasons, I think \nWisconsinites want to know if the pork chop they are buying is from \nMarquette or Mexico.\n  Recent scares over food imported from foreign countries make this \nissue more important than ever to consumers. Cases of disease and \nnumerous\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nproblems with the quality of some foreign products make it all the more \nvital that we provide our consumers with as much information as \npossible so that they may make informed decisions about the food they \npurchase for themselves and their families.\n  Mr. President, this measure is supported by the Administration and \nprominent agriculture groups like the National Farmers Union, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, and the National Cattlemen's Association to name \na few. Most importantly, this measure is supported by American \nconsumers. In January, a survey conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide showed \nan overwhelming percentage of Americans, 78%, want to know more about \nthe origin of the meat they purchase.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure. \nI urge you to give your constituents the right to know more about the \norigin of the food they buy and to allow them the opportunity to make \nchoices that support their nation's agriculture industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2038-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL TRIO DAY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the celebration of National TRIO Day on February 27th. The \n99th Congress designated the last Saturday in February as the day to \ncelebrate these very important and successful federal programs designed \nto raise the educational aspirations of students by providing services \nthat help them overcome social, cultural, and other barriers to success \nin higher education.\n  Currently, two thousand colleges, universities, and community \nagencies sponsor TRIO programs. More than 780,000 lower-income middle \nschool, high school, and adult students benefit from the services of \nsuch TRIO programs as Talent Search, Upward Bound, and Student Support \nServices. Not only do students personally benefit from their \nparticipation in higher education, but also our nation benefits from a \nbetter-educated population motivated to serve their communities and \ntheir country.\n  My home state of Maine has one of the country's lowest rates of \nparticipation in postsecondary education. The fifteen TRIO programs \noperating in Maine are working successfully to increase this number. \nEach year, these programs serve 6,000 students, building their \naspirations for higher education and providing them the counseling, \nconfidence, and academic support they need to pursue higher education.\n  Father James Nadeau, a native of my hometown in Aroostook County, is \na graduate of the Bowdoin College Upward Bound program. His story tells \nwhy the TRIO programs are so important. His parents did not have the \nopportunity to pursue an education beyond the eighth grade. Father \nJim's participation in Upward Bound changed his life and opened up a \nworld of opportunity to him.\n  Beginning in 1977, Father Jim spent three summers enrolled in Upward \nBound and then attended Dartmouth College and studied in France and \nScotland. Subsequently, he studied for five years at the Gregorian \nUniversity in Rome and received two graduate degrees in theology. His \nministry has spanned from Mother Teresa in Calcutta to school children \nin Portland, Maine and continues to affect lives all over the world. He \nis an excellent role model for the youth of Maine and remains a \nterrific example of the success of the TRIO programs. There are many \nsimilar stories of TRIO graduates in all professions and walks of life. \nThese are stories of successful, educated individuals who were \nintroduced by a TRIO program to the endless possibilities that become \nattainable through education.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to visit TRIO programs in their \nstates as I have done in Maine. You will see for yourselves why these \nprograms are vital to our efforts to promote equal educational \nopportunity for all our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2039-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2039-S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MONTANA IS PROUD OF THE BOZEMAN HIGH SCHOOL BAND\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize an outstanding group of Montana students. Recently, the \nBozeman High School Marching Band and Color Guard earned the \nopportunity to perform in the Rose Bowl Parade in Pasadena, CA. By the \nsounds of the crowd of onlookers, it is safe to say that they stole the \nshow. It was a beautiful day for a parade, and the Bozeman High School \nMarching Band and Color Guard took advantage of the opportunity to make \na name for themselves. Over the past few years, Montana students have \ntruly become competitive in academics, athletics, and the arts. The \nBozeman High School band is just one of the many examples where Montana \nstudents are gaining national recognition. There are few appearances by \nMontana High Schools at events of this caliber, but rest assured, there \nare many more to come.\n  Under the direction of Russ and Loralee Newbury, these students \nworked extremely hard to prepare for this prestigious event. They \nrepresented their school, city, county, and state with great enthusiasm \nand talent. I know that I speak for the people of Bozeman and the State \nof Montana when I say that I am very proud of these students. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate every one of these \nstudents on a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I ask that articles from the Bozeman Daily Chronicle \nof December 29, 1998, and January 2, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n           [From the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Dec. 29, 1998]\n\n                       California, Here They Come\n\n                          (By Gail Schontzler)\n\n       Three hundred Bozeman High Marching Band members boarded \n     charter planes in the wee hours Monday morning to fly to Los \n     Angeles in advance of Friday's big Tournament of Roses \n     Parade.\n       Two hundred lucky friends and family members flew down with \n     them and will be able to see the New Year's Day parade in \n     person. The rest of us will just have to try to catch the \n     band on TV.\n       Two television networks, CBS and NBC, and one available \n     only by satellite, Home & Garden TV, plan to carry the 110th \n     Tournament of Roses Parade.\n       The parade itself begins at 9 a.m. MST and that's when NBC \n     plans to begin its 90-minute coverage. CBS will start at 8 \n     a.m MST with an hour-long pre-parade show. Home & Garden TV \n     is the only station that will carry the entire parade live \n     and uninterrupted, but you have to be a satellite subscriber \n     to receive its programming.\n       So when's the best time to try to see the Bozeman band? \n     According to the official parade program, Bozeman is \n     scheduled to march in spot No. 71 out of the 103 parade \n     entries, right after a group of fezwearing Shriners on \n     horseback.

But the band's boosters did their best to \n     make Bozeman sound colorful.\n       In the advance publicity sent to the parade organizers and \n     the Home & Garden channel, Bozeman listed its famous alumni \n     as actor Gary Cooper and New York Giants middle linebacker \n     Corey Widmer, ``who played trumpet in the band''; reported \n     that Bozeman High was named one of the nation's top 10 \n     schools by Redbook magazine; and said it snows every month in \n     Bozeman.\n       The marching band has practiced in weather as low as 10 \n     degrees with 40-mph gusts of wind blowing snow down the \n     sousaphones,'' the school reported. ``Airplane hangers are \n     preferred practice sites in such weather.''\n       It also boasted that Bozeman is the fly-fishing capital of \n     the world and that Bozeman led the state in National Merit \n     Scholars in 1997 and 1998.\n       Bozeman will be competing for air time with the likes of \n     the Los Angeles Unified All District High School Honor Band, \n     which reported logging 100 miles around Dodger Stadium to get \n     in shape for the parade, and the Lincoln High School Band \n     from Stockton, Calif., one of the nation's asparagus-growing \n     leaders.\n       To hear the bands and see the flower-covered floats, one \n     million people will line the five-and-a-half-mile parade \n     route, according to the Pasadena Police Department. Many will \n     bring sleeping bags and camp overnight.\n       In honor of the end of the century, this year's Rose parade \n     will have four grand marshals, actress and diplomat Shirley \n     Temple Black, David Wolper, who produced ``Roots,'' a friend \n     representing the late baseball great Jackie Robinson and \n     astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who walked on the moon.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Jan. 2, 1999]\n\n        Bozeman High Band Takes its Place in Rose Parade History\n\n                         (By Ann Arbor Miller)\n\n       Pasadena, Calif.--Instruments in hand, shoelaces double-\n     knotted and hair tucked inside hats topped with red and black \n     plumes,\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n     the Bozeman High School Marching Band took its place in \n     parade history.\n       The band, 298 teen-agers strong, marched the five-and-a-\n     half mile route Friday through the heart of this Southern \n     California city.\n       ``I'm felling awesome,'' said junior Brandon Warwood during \n     a brief break eight blocks from the end of the 110th \n     Tournament of Roses Parade. ``I could do this all day.''\n       An estimated one million spectators, seated in stadium \n     bleachers, lawn chairs and on the curb, lined the streets for \n     the New Year's Day spectacle. They took to the roof tops of \n     local businesses and apartment buildings. They built \n     makeshift bleachers with stepladders and wooden boards, \n     topping the seats with blankets for padding.\n       Many shouted praise and cheers for the Bozeman band, whose \n     members wore their stately, wool uniforms of black, red and \n     silver.\n       ``Go Bozeman.''\n       ``Looking good.''\n       ``Happy New year.''\n       ``Take the cold weather home with you.''\n       Parade-goers left a trail of confetti, silly string and \n     tortillas along the parade route.\n       Bozeman's appearance here was a first in the school's \n     history and is certainly a rarity among Montana high schools. \n     Many young musicians were still trying to comprehend their \n     arrival here during the hour before the parade start at 9 \n     a.m.\n       ``It doesn't seem real,'' said freshman Jamie Booth. ``It \n     is so much bigger than any parade we've ever been in.''\n       For Jeff Knacht, a 1998 Bozeman High graduate, Friday's \n     event was a chance of a lifetime.\n       ``We actually get to do it--a little nowhere town in \n     Montana,'' said an amazed Knacht, one of half a dozen or so \n     recent graduates asked to rejoin the band for this parade.\n       A full moon shone over the group as it made its way from a \n     hotel in Buena Park, Calif., to Pasadena in the early \n     morning. The band arrived in Pasadena at 8 a.m. MST, sleepy \n     and groggy after the more than an hour drive.\n       On one of seven buses carrying band members to the parade \n     the sounds of the Beach Boys and Aretha Franklin blared from \n     the charter's sound system, courtesy of a Los Angeles radio \n     station. The music prompted some musicians to dance in the \n     aisle and sing along.\n       But the students' attention soon turned to more important \n     tasks like adjusting chin straps and warming up their hands.\n       Band director Russ Newbury called a last minute check for \n     all instruments.\n       A sense of nervousness and excitement loomed as band \n     members settled in their positions and waited to take spot \n     No. 71--behind the Araret Shrine Mounted Guard and its 17 \n     horses and in front of an impressive float with a giant pair \n     of Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n       Augel Medina, of California, knows the importance of a good \n     seat. His grandson spent the night babysitting eight empty \n     chairs on Colorado Boulevard to ensure the family had good \n     views of the floats and bands.\n       ``It's more fun to be closer,'' Medina said. ``You can talk \n     to the participants and even shake their hands.''\n       Bozemen's marchers earned high marks from Medina, who \n     admitted he's a huge fan of a good parade.\n       ``It is always a beautiful day for a parade,'' he said.\n       Almost two hours after the Bozeman band began this parade \n     trek, members passed a child holding a Magna Doodle that \n     read: ``Almost there.''\n       Minutes later, the Bozeman High School Marching Band \n     completed its journey with sore feet, much pride and a \n     desperate thirst for water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2039-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MOTHER GERALDINE WRIGHT'S BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday to honor an outstanding individual, Mother Geraldine Marvel \nMiller Wright, on the occasion of her birthday on Sunday, February 28, \n1999.\n  Mother Geraldine Wright, the wife of one of the nation's most \nprominent Bishops, the Bishop Earl J. Wright, Sr., the mother of three \nchildren, Earl Jr., Michael and Marvie; has learned how to labor in the \nministry standing beside her husband and helping him in the work. This \ntask is not new to Mother Wright--her lineage is made up of a host of \nleaders. Her father was a Bishop, her brother is a Bishop, and she has \na brother-in-law who is also a Bishop.\n  Mother Geraldine Wright is an extraordinary example of what one can \nachieve through tenacity and a giving and loving heart. Through her \nlove for God, family, church, and others, Mother Wright has made an \nimpact in the lives of many hurting people. She untiringly stands by \nher husband's side, she visits and ministers to the sick, encourages \nothers, helps others, gives to others, prays for others, but most of \nall, she is a trainer and builder of others. Training individuals to \nlove God and work for the Lord seems to be one very important aspect of \nher calling.\n  Along with being the First Lady and Director of the Women's \nDepartment of Greater Miller Memorial Church of God in Christ and the \nDavis Memorial Church of God in Christ, Mother Wright is also a \nDistrict Missionary in the New Creation District of the Second \nEcclesiastical Jurisdiction of Southwest Michigan. She is the Founder \nof the Geraldine Marvel Miller Wright Institute for Women in the \nMinistry, which is one of Mother Wright's most outstanding \naccomplishments. This Institute serves as a catalyst of change in the \nlives of many young women who have dedicated their lives to the service \nand calling of the Lord Jesus Christ. Proverbs 31:28-30 sums up Mother \nGeraldine Wright best. It reads as follows:\n\n       Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband \n     also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done \n     virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, \n     and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she \n     shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let \n     her own words praise her in the gates.\n\n  So let it be known on this day, Sunday, February 28, 1999, that \nMother Geraldine Marvel Miller Wright has been a leader of women and \nhas impacted this nation and world, has left an indelible mark on the \nhistory of mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2040-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I note with great pride that the \nPresident has announced his intention to nominate Mr. Bill Lann Lee, a \nnative of my State of California, to be Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights in the Department of Justice.\n  The Senate will recall that Bill Lann Lee was nominated for this post \nmore than a year and a half ago, in July 1997. His nomination died in \nthe Judiciary Committee at the end of the 105th Congress. The majority \nof that Committee denied the full Senate a vote on the nomination \nbecause it knew Bill Lann Lee would have been confirmed if a vote had \nbeen taken.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Judiciary Committee will not make the \nsame mistake twice. Bill Lann Lee is fully qualified for this position. \nIndeed, I believe that he is the best person for the position. His \npersonal history and his professional credentials both make him the \nperfect candidate to be Assistant Attorney for Civil Rights.\n  Bill Lann Lee was born in Harlem, the son of immigrants. He learned \nearly in life about patriotism, from his father, who volunteered for \nmilitary service in World War II in order to serve the adopted country \nthat he loved so much. Bill Lee also learned from his parents, who ran \na laundry, the value of hard work, a good education, and commitment to \nexcellence.\n  Bill Lee spent most of his 24-year legal career with the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, which was founded by Thurgood Marshall. He \nalso spent several years in the 1980's working for the Center for Law \nin the Public Interest. Throughout his career, Bill Lee has \ndemonstrated a talent for consensus building--surely one of the most \nimportant attributes for the top civil rights job.\n  Elected officials and other leaders from both parties have strongly \nendorsed Bill Lann Lee, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, \nwho said, in a letter to the White House: ``Mr. Lee has practiced \nmainstream civil rights law. He does not believe in quotas. He has \npursued flexible and reasonable remedies that in each case were \napproved by a court.''\n  He has the endorsement of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, which wrote: ``. . . as the Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, he will remain fully cognizant of the need and \nexpectations of the people of the U.S. to be provided effective, \nefficient and fair law enforcement services. . . . he will do his \nutmost to ensure that honest and hardworking police officers are not \ntarnished by the acts of a few miscreants.''\n  I join the many people across the country--lawyers, law enforcement, \nelected officials, and others--who want the Senate to finally confirm \nthis splendid nominee for this very important post.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2040-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n                     TRIBUTE TO FRED B.

I commend his outstanding achievement.\n  Fred is the President of Center Paper Products Company in Manchester, \nNew Hampshire. His company employs forty-five people and is a fixture \nin the Manchester business community. He is described by his business \nassociates as a very generous, thoughtful businessman. His company, \nthat was passed on to him from his father, continues to grow and \nthrive.\n  Fred has always tempered his business success with a great devotion \nto volunteerism. His own philosophy, ``Service to one's community is an \nintegral part of his company's culture,'' has been readily apparent in \nhis actions through the years. Fred has constantly maintained a record \nof service to his community that is highly admirable. He has been \nactive in organizations from his college alumni association to the \nannual Christmas party for students and families at Notre Dame College.\n  As a former small business owner, I understand the demands of running \na business. I commend Fred for his diligent work in his business as \nwell as the devotion he has shown to the community.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those \nmen and women who have made the world we live in a better place through \ntheir advances in engineering. February 21-27 is the 49th annual \nobservance of National Engineers Week to increase public awareness and \nappreciation of the engineering profession and of technology. Thousands \nof engineers, engineering students, teachers, and leaders in government \nand business participate each year.\n  Engineering is so intertwined in our everyday activity that it can \noften be taken for granted. The National Society of Professional \nEngineers and a consortium of more than 100 engineering, scientific and \neducation societies and major corporations are working to increase the \npublic's awareness during this week.\n  This year's theme, ``Engineers: Turning Ideas into Reality,'' will \nfocus on participants interesting with children from elementary to high \nschool through demonstrations and question and answer sessions. Seventh \nand eighth-grade students are invited to design future cities and build \nthree-dimensional scale models with the help of their teachers and \nvolunteer-engineer mentors. The National Engineering Design Challenge \nwill team up high school students to design, build, and demonstrate a \nworking model of a new product. And the Discover E program will reach \nmore than five million elementary, junior and senior high school \nstudents to help them discover how engineering is applied in math, \nscience and technology. Over 40,000 engineers nationwide will work with \nthese students through hands-on activities in the classroom.\n  In Minnesota, ``Discover E! in Minneapolis'' was held on February 23 \nwith the help of engineering students from the University of Minnesota \nand engineers from local businesses visiting 5th and 6th graders. The \nstudents were able to explore mechanical, biomedical, and environmental \nengineering through demonstrations and discussions about work and \nstudies.\n  This week honors the birthday of one of the nation's first engineers, \na surveyor named George Washington. It also recognizes the countless \nother engineers who have influenced nearly every aspect of our lives \nwith their dedicated work and numerous technological advances. Their \ncontributions to science include discoveries, for example, that have \nresulted in the development of ultra-lite materials such as Kevlar, and \nenvironmentally beneficial technologies such as a wastewater treatment \nsystem that effectively recycles 100% of all wastewater.\n  Schools have focused their teachings on the body of scientific \nknowledge, often times neglecting the process of discovery that \nengineers use to help create the new advances for our modern world. \nWith the support of groups such as NASA and Minnesota-based 3M, \nprograms during Engineers Week will integrate this process of discovery \nand the use of technology into mathematics, science, language arts, and \nother topics. I am a strong supporter of exposing our children to the \nworld around them and hope this awareness will get them involved and \nspark interest in the future of engineering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2041-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2041-S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, three years ago this month, \nCongress and the President hailed the enactment of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. This piece of legislation was intended \nto increase competition, expand consumer choice, foster new \ntechnologies and create new jobs. The Act contemplated the achievement \nof these goals through reliance on the marketplace rather than on a \nsluggish and burdensome regulatory mandate.\n  The implementation of the Act by the Federal Communications \nCommission has sailed way off course. Congress provided the universal \nservice program as a means of ensuring that residents of rural and \nhigh-cost areas receive the same high quality services and the same \naffordable rates as their urban counterparts. Yet universal service, \none of the most important topics addressed in the Act, remains \nvirtually unchanged by the FCC after three years despite the \nCommission's statutory responsibility to finish universal service \nreform in a ``single proceeding'' and within 15 months of passage of \nthe Act. The FCC did complete a small part of the universal service \nmandate, the program bringing advanced services to schools and \nlibraries. However, the Commission continues to ignore the most \nsignificant aspect of universal service reform, ``the preservation and \nadvancement of universal service'' and high-cost areas. The Act \ncommands that the Commission make the support mechanisms explicit and \npredictable. The Commission's failure to do so threatens the \naffordability of rural residential rates.\n  The uncertainty created by the FCC's failure to implement universal \nservice is perpetuating the absence of local competition, especially in \nrural areas. As a consequence, local residential competition will \nremain at the current inadequate levels until the FCC addresses \nuniversal service. Congress intended that carriers providing service to \nresidents of rural and high-cost areas would receive support for the \n``provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services'' \nwhich would otherwise be absent in these areas. Accordingly, the \nCommission must make the now implicit subsidies explicit and sufficient \nin order to fulfill Congress' mandate.\n  Congress is still looking for more competition and more choice in all \ncommunications services, especially for rural residents. Let's allow \nthe marketplace to work, which will give consumers in rural areas some \nreal choices at affordable rates.\n  Mr. President, this year Congress will consider reauthorization of \nthe FCC. I am extremely disappointed with the Commission's track record \non implementation of the Act. As we contemplate legislation to change \nthe FCC, its actions over the next several months will determine the \noutcome of our deliberations. I hope that the FCC will complete the \nuniversal service proceeding by July 1, and act in a manner consistent \nwith the Act. I will not accept a universal service proceeding that \nputs upward pressure on rural rates, and I will hold the FCC \naccountable it fails to comply with the Act.\n  Mr. President, three years ago this month, Congress and the President \nhailed the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to rise \ntoday to thank Brigadier General Randall M. ``Mark'' Schmidt for his \nservice as commander of the 366th Wing, Mountain Home Air Force Base, \nIdaho. General Schmidt has been at Mountain Home since August of 1997, \nand will soon move on to reassignment as commander, Joint Task Force, \nSouthwest Asia.\n  I have long been proud of the 366th Wing. The Wing's motto is, \n``Anywhere, anytime,'' Mountain Home is unique because it is the Air \nForce's only air intervention composite wing. The 366th is ready to \ndeploy on a moment's notice with its own integrated command, control, \ncommunications, and intelligence capabilities. The Wing is a composite \nforce already built and trained, ready to fight and intervene anytime, \nany where. However, it is clear that the reason this concept has been a \nsuccess is because of the dedicated patriots who have had the privilege \nto serve at Mountain Home. Commander Schmidt has exemplified that \ntradition.\n  By all accounts, General Schmidt's service has been nothing short of \nextraordinary. He has made the goal of ``one community'' a reality at \nMountain Home. He has integrated every airman, regardless of rank, to \nbe part of the 366th team. He puts his words into action. The biggest \ntestiment to his talent is the fine work of men and women who are part \nof the 366th. Indeed, Mountain Home and Idaho have been fortunate to \nhave him.\n  However, Commander Schmidt's talents do not come as a surprise to me. \nAs a Westerner, a former rancher, and a history buff, I have always \nbeen captivated by the pioneer spirit. It is that spirit which brought \nmany of our ancestor to America, and some of them across America to \nsettle in the West. It is that same spirit that isn't afraid of \nchallenges, hardships or hard work, which can be measured and found \nthroughout this great nation, and is at certainly home in the men and \nwomen of the United States Air Force.\n  In addition to saying thank you, let me also take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Commander Schmidt. Secretary Cohen has selected him to be \none of a small, select group of Brigadier Generals nominated for \npromotion to Major General. As he prepares to leave for the desert to \nserve on joint command, I hope and believe that he will always consider \nhimself an Idahoan.\n  General Schmidt, thank you, congratulations, and godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2042-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2042-S2044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NINTH CIRCUIT DIVISION\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

DIVISIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                   THE NINTH CIRCUIT.\n\n       (a) Regional Divisions.--Effective 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit shall be organized into 3 regional \n     divisions designated as the Northern Division, the Middle \n     Division, and the Southern Division, and a nonregional \n     division designated as the Circuit Division.\n       (b) Review of Decisions.--\n       (1) Nonapplication of section 1294.--Section 1294 of title \n     28, United States Code, shall not apply to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. The review of district court decisions \n     shall be governed as provided in this subsection.\n       (2) Review.--Except as provided in sections 1292(c), \n     1292(d), and 1295 of title 28, United States Code, once the \n     court is organized into divisions, appeals from reviewable \n     decisions of the district and territorial courts located \n     within the Ninth Circuit shall be taken to the regional \n     divisions of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as follows:\n       (A) Appeals from the districts of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, \n     Oregon, Eastern Washington, and Western Washington shall be \n     taken to the Northern Division.\n       (B) Appeals from the districts of Eastern California, \n     Northern California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, and the Northern \n     Mariana Islands shall be taken to the Middle Division.\n       (C) Appeals from the districts of Arizona, Central \n     California, and Southern California shall be taken to the \n     Southern Division.\n       (D) Appeals from the Tax Court, petitions to enforce the \n     orders of administrative agencies, and other proceedings \n     within the court of appeals' jurisdiction that do not involve \n     review of district court actions shall be filed in the court \n     of appeals and assigned to the division that would have \n     jurisdiction over the matter if the division were a separate \n     court of appeals.\n       (3) Assignment of judges.--Each regional division shall \n     include from 7 to 11 judges of the court of appeals in active \n     status. A majority of the judges assigned to each division \n     shall reside within the judicial districts that are within \n     the division's jurisdiction as specified in paragraph (2), \n     except that judges may be assigned to serve for specified, \n     staggered terms of 3 years or more, in a division in which \n     they do not reside. Such judges shall be assigned at random, \n     by means determined by the court, in such numbers as \n     necessary to enable the divisions to function effectively. \n     Judges in senior status may be assigned to regional divisions \n     in accordance with policies adopted by the court of \n     appeals. Any judge assigned to 1 division may be assigned \n     by the chief judge of the circuit for\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\n     temporary duty in another division as necessary to enable \n     the divisions to function effectively.\n       (4) Presiding judges.--Section 45 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall govern the designation of the presiding \n     judge of each regional division as though the division were a \n     court of appeals, except that the judge serving as chief \n     judge of the circuit may not at the same time serve as \n     presiding judge of a regional division, and that only judges \n     resident within, and assigned to, the division shall be \n     eligible to serve as presiding judge of that division.\n       (5) Panels.--Panels of a division may sit to hear and \n     decide cases at any place within the judicial districts of \n     the division, as specified by a majority of the judges of the \n     division. The divisions shall be governed by the Federal \n     Rules of Appellate Procedure and by local rules and internal \n     operating procedures adopted by the court of appeals. The \n     divisions may not adopt their own local rules or internal \n     operating procedures. The decisions of 1 regional division \n     shall not be regarded as binding precedents in the other \n     regional divisions.\n       (c) Circuit Division.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to the 3 regional divisions \n     specified under subsection (a), the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals shall establish a Circuit Division composed of the \n     chief judge of the circuit and 12 other circuit judges in \n     active status, chosen by lot in equal numbers from each \n     regional division. Except for the chief judge of the circuit, \n     who shall serve ex officio, judges on the Circuit Division \n     shall serve nonrenewable, staggered terms of 3 years each. \n     One-third of the judges initially selected by lot shall serve \n     terms of 1 year each, one-third shall serve terms of 2 years \n     each, and one-third shall serve terms of 3 years each. \n     Thereafter all judges shall serve terms of 3 years each. If a \n     judge on the Circuit Division is disqualified or otherwise \n     unable to serve in a particular case, the presiding judge of \n     the regional division to which that judge is assigned shall \n     randomly select a judge from the division to serve in the \n     place of the unavailable judge.\n       (2) Jurisdiction.--The Circuit Division shall have \n     jurisdiction to review, and to affirm, reverse, or modify any \n     final decision rendered in any of the court's divisions that \n     conflicts on an issue of law with a decision in another \n     division of the court. The exercise of such jurisdiction \n     shall be within the discretion of the Circuit Division and \n     may be invoked by application for review by a party to the \n     case, setting forth succinctly the issue of law as to which \n     there is a conflict in the decisions of 2 or more divisions. \n     The Circuit Division may review the decision of a panel \n     within a division only if en banc review of the decision has \n     been sought and denied by the division.\n       (3) Procedures.--The Circuit Division shall consider and \n     decide cases through procedures adopted by the court of \n     appeals for the expeditious and inexpensive conduct of the \n     division's business. The Circuit Division shall not function \n     through panels. The Circuit Division shall decide issues of \n     law on the basis of the opinions, briefs, and records in the \n     conflicting decisions under review, unless the Circuit \n     Division determines that special circumstances make \n     additional briefing or oral argument necessary.\n       (4) En banc proceedings.--Section 46 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall apply to each regional division of the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as though the division were \n     the court of appeals. Section 46(c) of title 28, United \n     States Code, authorizing hearings or rehearings en banc, \n     shall be applicable only to the regional divisions of the \n     court and not to the court of appeals as a whole. After a \n     divisional plan is in effect, the court of appeals shall \n     not order any hearing or rehearing en banc, and the \n     authorization for a limited en banc procedure under \n     section 6 of Public Law 95-486 (92 Stat. 1633), shall not \n     apply to the Ninth Circuit. An en banc proceeding ordered \n     before the divisional plan is in effect may be heard and \n     determined in accordance with applicable rules of \n     appellate procedure.\n       (d) Clerks and Employees.--Section 711 of title 28, United \n     States Code, shall apply to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, except the clerk of the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals may maintain an office or offices in each regional \n     division of the court to provide services of the clerk's \n     office for that division.\n       (e) Study of Effectiveness.--The Federal Judicial Center \n     shall conduct a study of the effectiveness and efficiency of \n     the divisions in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. No later \n     than 8 years after the effective date of this Act, the \n     Federal Judicial Center shall submit to the Judicial \n     Conference of the United States a report summarizing the \n     activities of the divisions, including the Circuit Division, \n     and evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the \n     divisional structure. The Judicial Conference shall submit \n     recommendations to Congress concerning the divisional \n     structure and whether the structure should be continued with \n     or without modification.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES; PANELS; EN BANC PROCEEDINGS; \n                   DIVISIONS; QUORUM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 46 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     Sec. 46. Assignment of judges; panels; en banc proceedings; \n       divisions; quorum\n\n       ``(a) Circuit judges shall sit on the court of appeals and \n     its panels in such order and at such times as the court \n     directs.\n       ``(b) Unless otherwise provided by rule of court, a court \n     of appeals or any regional division thereof shall consider \n     and decide cases and controversies through panels of 3 \n     judges, at least 2 of whom shall be judges of the court, \n     unless such judges cannot sit because recused or \n     disqualified, or unless the chief judge of that court \n     certifies that there is an emergency including, but not \n     limited to, the unavailability of a judge of the court \n     because of illness. A court may provide by rule for the \n     disposition of appeals through panels consisting of 2 judges, \n     both of whom shall be judges of the court. Panels of the \n     court shall sit at times and places and hear the cases and \n     controversies assigned as the court directs. The United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall \n     determine by rule a procedure for the rotation of judges from \n     panel-to-panel to ensure that all of the judges sit on a \n     representative cross section of the cases heard and, \n     notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, may \n     determine by rule the number of judges, not less than 2, who \n     constitute a panel.\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a majority of the \n     judges of a court of appeals not organized into divisions as \n     provided in subsection (d) who are in regular active service \n     may order a hearing or rehearing before the court en banc. A \n     court en banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular \n     active service, except that any senior circuit judge of the \n     circuit shall be eligible to participate, at that judge's \n     election and upon designation and assignment pursuant to \n     section 294(c) and the rules of the circuit, as a member of \n     an en banc court reviewing a decision of a panel of which \n     such judge was a member.\n       ``(d)(1) A court of appeals having more than 15 authorized \n     judgeships may organize itself into 2 or more adjudicative \n     divisions, with each judge of the court assigned to a \n     specific division, either for a specified term of years or \n     indefinitely. The court's docket shall be allocated among the \n     divisions in accordance with a plan adopted by the court, and \n     each division shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction \n     over the appeals assigned to it. The presiding judge of each \n     division shall be determined from among the judges of the \n     division in active status as though the division were the \n     court of appeals, except the chief judge of the circuit \n     shall not serve at the same time as the presiding judge of \n     a division.\n       ``(2) When organizing itself into divisions, a court of \n     appeals shall establish a circuit division, consisting of the \n     chief judge and additional circuit judges in active status, \n     selected in accordance with rules adopted by the court, so as \n     to make an odd number of judges but not more than 13.\n       ``(3) The circuit division shall have jurisdiction to \n     review, and to affirm, reverse, or modify any final decision \n     rendered in any of the court's divisions that conflicts on an \n     issue of law with a decision in another division of the \n     court. The exercise of such jurisdiction shall be within the \n     discretion of the circuit division and may be invoked by \n     application for review by a party to the case, setting forth \n     succinctly the issue of law as to which there is a conflict \n     in the decisions of 2 or more divisions.

Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI \nrequires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the \nCommittee and to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not \nlater than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 25, \n1999, the Committee on Rules and Administration held a business meeting \nduring which the members of the committee unanimously adopted the rules \nto govern the procedures of the committee.\n  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for \nprinting in the Congressional Record a copy of the rules of the Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  The rules follow:\n\n Rules of Procedure of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n                   title i--meetings of the committee\n\n       1. The regular meeting dates of the committee shall be the \n     second and fourth Wednesdays of each month, at 9:30 a.m., in \n     room SR-301, Russell Senate Office Building. Additional \n     meetings may be called by the chairman as he may deem \n     necessary or pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3 of \n     rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       2. Meetings of the committee, including meetings to conduct \n     hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a meeting \n     or series of meetings by the committee on the same subject \n     for a period or no more than 14 calendar days may be closed \n     to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed \n     session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F) would require the meeting to be \n     closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open \n     session by a majority of the members of the committee when it \n     is determined that the matters to be discussed or the \n     testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings--\n       (A) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (B) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (C) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (D) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (E) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (F) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)\n       3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally be \n     sent by the committee's staff director to all members of the \n     committee at least 3 days in advance. In addition, the \n     committee staff will telephone reminders of committee \n     meetings to all members of the committee or to the \n     appropriate staff assistants in their offices.\n       4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating \n     separate items of legislative business and committee business \n     will normally be sent to all members of the committee by the \n     staff director at least 1 day in advance of all meetings. \n     This does not preclude any member of the committee from \n     raising appropriate non-agenda topics.\n       5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any \n     hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3 \n     business days before the date of his or her appearance, a \n     written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an \n     executive summary thereof, in such form as the chairman may \n     direct, unless the chairman and the ranking minority member \n     waive such requirement for good cause.\n\n\n                           title ii--quorums\n\n       1.

Under no circumstances may proxies be considered for the \n     establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                           title iii--voting\n\n       1. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by \n     voice vote.\n       2. If a third of the members present so demand, a record \n     vote will be taken on any question by rollcall.\n       3. The results of rollcall votes taken in any meeting upon \n     any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the \n     committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the committee, and such report or announcement shall \n     include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the \n     votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment \n     by each member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of \n     rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)\n       4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and \n     matters before the committee.

Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI \nrequires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the \nCommittee and to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not \nlater than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On January 20, \n1999, the Committee on Governmental Affairs held a business meeting \nduring which the members of the Committee unanimously adopted the rules \nto govern the procedures of the Committee. In addition, a majority of \nmembers of the Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nadopted subcommittee rules of procedure on February 12, 1999.\n  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for \nprinting in the Congressional Record a copy of the rules of the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs and its Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n  The Rules follow:\n\nRules of Procedure of the Committee on Governmental Affairs Pursuant to \n            Rule XXVI, Sec. 2, Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n\n      rule 1. meetings and meeting procedures other than hearings\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Thursday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the chairman as he deems necessary to expedite Committee \n     business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within 3 \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, \n     a majority of the Committee members may file in the offices \n     of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     members at least 3 days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. The written notices required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event \n     that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a \n     3-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee \n     staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any \n     revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone \n     or otherwise to members or appropriate staff assistants in \n     their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be \n     in order for the Committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to \n     consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any \n     measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to \n     each member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may \n     be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at \n     least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The \n     written copy of amendments in the first degree required by \n     this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This subsection \n     may be waived by a majority of the members present. This \n     subsection shall apply only when at least 72 hours written \n     notice of a session to mark-up a measure is provided to the \n     Committee or Subcommittee.\n       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall \n     prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic \n     recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each \n     meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is \n     closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n                            rule 2. quorums\n\n       A. Reporting measures and matters. A majority of the \n     members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or \n     recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       B. Transaction of routine business. One-third of the \n     membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business, provided that one member of \n     the minority is present.\n       For the purpose of this paragraph, the term ``routine \n     business'' includes the convening of a meeting and the \n     consideration of any business of the Committee other than \n     reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or \n     recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       C. Taking testimony. One member of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of \n     sections 7(a)(1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are \n     authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction \n     of business and the taking of sworn testimony.\n       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies \n     shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.\n\n\n                             rule 3. voting\n\n       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless \n     a quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is \n     actually present.\n       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or \n     recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a \n     majority of the Committee members are actually present, and \n     the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall \n     require the\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\n     concurrence of a majority of those members who are actually \n     present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule XXVI, Sec. \n     7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all \n     measures and matters before the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or \n     matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes \n     of recording a member's position on the pending question. \n     Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or \n     Subcommittee member has been informed of the matter on which \n     he is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that he \n     be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed with the chief \n     clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the case \n     may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall contain \n     sufficient reference to the pending matter as is necessary to \n     identify it and to inform the Committee or Subcommittee as to \n     how the member establishes his vote to be recorded thereon. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       D. Announcement of vote. (1) Whenever the Committee by roll \n     call vote reports any measure or matter, the report of the \n     Committee upon such a measure or matter shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to such measure or matter by each member of the \n     Committee. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any \n     measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure \n     or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the \n     Committee report on that measure unless previously announced \n     by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a \n     tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast \n     in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by \n     each member of the Committee who was present at the meeting. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the \n     tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote \n     recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure, \n     amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E. Polling. (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, \n     may poll (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters \n     including the Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records \n     and budget; (b) steps in an investigation, including issuance \n     of subpoenas, applications for immunity orders, and requests \n     for documents from agencies; and (c) other Committee or \n     Subcommittee business other than a vote on reporting to the \n     Senate any measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on \n     closing a meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the chairman, or a Committee member or staff \n     officer designated by him, may undertake any poll of the \n     members of the Committee. If any member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he shall designate a temporary chairman \n     to act in his place if he is unable to be present at a \n     scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman (or his \n     designee) is absent 10 minutes after the scheduled time set \n     for a meeting or hearing, the ranking majority member present \n     shall preside until the chairman's arrival. If there is no \n     member of the majority present, the ranking minority \n     member present, with the prior approval of the chairman, \n     may open and conduct the meeting or hearing until such \n     time as a member of the majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARINGS PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be \n     closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into \n     closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated \n     in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to \n     be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open \n     session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     members when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or \n     hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       G  (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be \n     kept confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       G  (B) the information has been obtained by the Government \n     on a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or \n     a staff officer designated by him has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a staff \n     officer designated by him of disapproval of the subpoena \n     within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being \n     notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this \n     subsection, the subpoena may be authorized by vote of the \n     members of the Committee. When the Committee or chairman \n     authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the \n     signature of the chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee designated by the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his counsel is ejected for conducting himself in \n     such manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of the hearings; \n     nor shall this subsection be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The failure \n     of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such \n     witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n     the Committee or staff officer, at a public hearing or at a \n     closed hearing concerning which there have been public \n     reports, tends to impugn his or her character or adversely \n     affect his or her reputation may:\n       (1) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (2) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (3) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure \n     of compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the \n     Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who \n     will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or produce \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee \n     subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff.

This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk \n     shall notify all Subcommittee Members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its dates and \n     hour. If the Chairman is not present at any regular, \n     additional or special meeting, the ranking majority Member \n     present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       Five (5) Members of the Subcommittee shall constitute a \n     quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee business other \n     than the administering of oaths and the taking of testimony.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a matter \n     as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with \n     the orderly administration of such hearing, the Chairman or \n     presiding Member of the Subcommittee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he is testifying, of his legal \n     rights. Provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman may \n     rule that representation by counsel for the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, \n     obstruct, or interfere with the orderly administration of the \n     hearings; nor\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n     shall this rule be construed as authorizing counsel to coach \n     the witness or answer for the witness. The failure of any \n     witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such witness from \n     complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition \n     shall be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Subcommittee \n     subpoena.\n       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him. If the Chairman or \n     designated Member overrules the objection, he may refer the \n     matter to the Subcommittee or he may order and direct the \n     witness to answer the question, but the Subcommittee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify after he \n     has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his presence, the transcriber \n     shall certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony, and the transcript shall then be filed with the \n     Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may stipulate with the \n     witness to changes in this procedure; deviations from this \n     procedure which do not substantially impair the reliability \n     of the record shall not relieve the witness from his \n     obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights shall not be directed at him. Such request \n     shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members present at the \n     hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his own testimony whether in public or \n     executive session shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his counsel under Subcommittee supervision; a copy \n     of any testimony given in public sesssion or that part of \n     the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at \n     his expense if he so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee or by counsel of the Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     otherwise adversely affect his reputation, may (a) request to \n     appear personally before the Subcommittee to testify in his \n     own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) file a sworn \n     statement of facts relevant to the testimony or other \n     evidence or comment complained of, Such request and such \n     statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his sworn statement \n     pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his sworn statement, as well as any other matters related \n     to the subject of the investigation before the Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he deems advisable. The total compensation \n     allocated to such minority staff member shall be not less \n     than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/25/senate-section/article/S2045-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2050-S2055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Committee or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7.

Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony.

Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff may \n     tend to affect adversely his or her reputation, may request \n     to appear personally before the Committee to testify on his \n     or her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts \n     relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may \n     submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the \n     cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9 Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the \n     Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all \n     its members, met and considered the alleged contempt, \n     afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in \n     person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and \n     agreed by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such \n     recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10.

Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in \n     which such committee determines the national interest in \n     the disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the \n     executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall notify the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such \n     five-day period, the President, personally in writing, \n     notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of \n     such information, provides his reasons therefor, and \n     certifies that the threat to national interest of the United \n     States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it \n     outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may, \n     by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration. The \n     committee shall not publicly disclose such information \n     without leave of the Senate.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n       Upon conclusion of the information of such matter in closed \n     session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of \n     the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which the committee or which Members of the Senate received \n     such information under this subsection, shall disclose such \n     information except in a closed session of the Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on \n     Standards and Conduct\\1\\ to investigate any unauthorized \n     disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer \n     or employee of the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and \n     to report to the Senate concerning any allegation which it \n     finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct\\1\\ shall release to such individual at the conclusion \n     of its investigation a summary of its investigation together \n     with its findings. If, at the conclusion of its \n     investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and \n     Conduct\\1\\ determines that there has been a significant \n     breach of confidentiality or unauthorized disclosure by a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall report \n     its findings to the Senate and recommend appropriate action \n     such as censure, removal from committee membership, or \n     expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a Member, or \n     removal from office or employment or punishment for contempt, \n     in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10. Upon expiration of the Select Committee on \n     Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence \n     Activities, established by Senate Resolution 21, Ninety-\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n     fourth Congress, all records, files, documents, and other \n     materials in the possession, custody, or control of such \n     committee, under appropriate conditions established by it, \n     shall be transferred to the select committee.\n       Sec. 11. (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the head of \n     each department and agency of the United States should keep \n     the select committee fully and currently informed with \n     respect to intelligence activities, including any significant \n     anticipated activities, which are the responsibility of or \n     engaged in by such department or agencies: Provided, That \n     this does not constitute a condition precedent to the \n     implementation of any such anticipated intelligence activity.\n       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that each department and \n     agency of the United States should report immediately upon \n     discovery to the select committee any and all intelligence \n     activities which constitute violations of the constitutional \n     rights of any person, violations of law, or violations of \n     Executive orders, presidential directives, or departmental or \n     agency rules or regulations; each department and agency \n     should further report to such committee what actions have \n     been taken or are expected to be taken by the department or \n     agencies with respect to such violations.\n       Sec. 12. Subject to the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     funds shall be appropriated for any fiscal year beginning \n     after September 30, 1976, with the exception or a continuing \n     bill or resolution, or amendment thereto, or conference \n     report thereon, to, or for use of, any department or agency \n     of the United States to carry out any of the following \n     activities, unless such funds shall have been previously \n     authorized by a bill or joint resolution passed by the Senate \n     during the same or preceding fiscal year to carry out such \n     activity for such fiscal year:\n       (1) The activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and \n     the Director of Central Intelligence.\n       (2) The activities of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n       (3) The activities of the National Security Agency.\n       (4) The intelligence activities of other agencies and \n     subdivisions of the Department of Defense.\n       (5) The intelligence activities of the Department of State.\n       (6) The intelligence activities of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, including all activities of the Intelligence \n     Division.\n       Sec. 13.
