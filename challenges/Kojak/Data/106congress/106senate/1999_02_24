Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the bill.\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Sarbanes/Warner Amendment No. 19, to express the sense of \n     Congress that there should continue to be parity between the \n     adjustments in the compensation of members of the uniformed \n     services and the adjustments in the compensation of civilian \n     employees of the United States.\n       Cleland Amendment No. 6, to permit members of the Ready \n     Reserve to contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan for \n     compensation attributable to their service in the Ready \n     Reserve.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, with regard to the amendments, we are \nworking out a number of these amendments. As I said, I am optimistic \nthat this matter can be completed, hopefully by early afternoon.\n  The possible amendments still remaining are:\n  An amendment regarding Guard and Reserve participation in the Thrift \nSavings Plan, by Mr. Cleland--that is scheduled for a vote, so that \nwill soon be disposed of;\n  Modify the MGIB to permit reservists to transfer benefits to family \nmembers, Mr. Jeffords;\n  Permit RC to receive lump sum GI bill payments for certain courses, \nMr. Jeffords;\n  Civilian pay raise of 4.8 percent; that is the Warner-Sarbanes; we \nwill be voting on that momentarily;\n  Expand use of the MGIB to include prep for college and grad school \nentrance exams, Mr. Rockefeller;\n  Make food stamps and WIC available to soldiers overseas--that is, \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines overseas--Mr. Harkin;\n  Sense of the Senate re: 2-month extension of the tax-filing deadline \nfor uniformed services personnel stationed\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\noutside the United States, Mr. Coverdell;\n  Sense of the Senate regarding processing of claims for veterans \nbenefits, Mr. Bingaman;\n  Sense of the Senate regarding the possibility that provisions of S. 4 \nmay be reconsidered during the authorization or appropriations process \nby my distinguished colleague, the ranking member here, Mr. Levin;\n  Technical change to section 202, Senators Warner and Allard.\n  Now, I think that concludes it. There were several amendments by the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft; I have discussed those with him. \nAnd another one by Mr. Jeffords, and another one by Mr. Levin--I will \nbe discussing those amendments. I think it is not likely they will be \nbrought up.\n  At this time, perhaps my distinguished colleague, the comanager of \nthe bill, will have a few comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me share the optimism of my friend from \nVirginia that we will be able to complete the work on this bill by \nearly afternoon. I see no reason why we should not be able to do that. \nI hope, in fact, that we can.\n  We have a little time this morning before we start voting, which we \nwere going to divide between the proponents of the amendments, if they \nwould like some of these few minutes remaining. I know the manager will \njoin me.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. I see a Member on the floor, a \ndistinguished member of our committee, the Senator from Georgia. At the \ntime he desires recognition, it will be given.\n  Mr. President, before the Senator from Georgia proceeds to give his \nremarks, perhaps we could call on another member of the committee, the \nchairman of the Manpower Subcommittee, Senator Allard, in hopes that he \ncan talk a little bit about the hearing that the subcommittee will have \ntoday on the very issues that are in this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will withhold for a moment so we \ncould ask the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Maryland how \nmuch time they might want on their amendments. Since there are only 5 \nor 6 minutes left, perhaps we could apportion it fairly.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am in no hurry to speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia would agree if we \ncould inquire of the two Senators whether we might divide the remaining \n6 minutes between them?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. I will just say a word following Mr. \nSarbanes' remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What would my colleague propose, three 2-minute \nopportunities?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote then \nbegin at 9:50, to allow time for our two colleagues to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 6\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment to S. \n4, with my colleagues Senator Jeffords, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nLandrieu, to give the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve \nthe opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan.\n  Members of the Guard and Reserve have been participating at record \nlevels. Nearly 270,000 Reservists and Guardsmen were mobilized during \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Over 17,000 have answered \nthe Nation's call to bring peace to Bosina. Members of the Guard and \nReserve have delivered millions of pounds of humanitarian aid all over \nthe world. And, closer to home, they have responded to numerous state \nand federal emergencies. Thousands of Reservists and Guardsmen are \nserving in communities across the country and around the world every \nday.\n  I firmly believe we should recognize the contributions the Guard and \nReserve have made to our defense efforts over the years.\n  We should recognize those contributions by extending to members of \nthe Guard and Reserve the same savings opportunity we are offering \ntheir active duty counterparts under S. 4. The Guard and Reserve are an \nintegral part of our national defense strategy. We can't afford to \noverlook them.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the amendment Senator \nCleland and I have proposed. Specifically, we propose allowing our men \nand women in the Guard and Reserve the opportunity to participate in \nthe Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) in the same manner S. 4 provides to their \ncolleagues on active duty.\n  Allowing members of the Guard and Reserve to participate in the \nFederal Employees TSP is long overdue and I strongly support the \nproposal to make it law. This program is good for federal workers and \nit would benefit members of the Guard and Reserve financially for them \nto participate in the TSP. Under this system, they would be the sole \ncontributors to their accounts, much like civil servants who are under \nthe old Civil Service Retirement System. Since there would be no \nfederal match to their accounts the cost would be very low to the \nbranches of the military and to the taxpayers, as well. Additional \nsavings in individual accounts will be important to those individuals \nwho serve our Nation in regular, but temporary capacities. The payroll \ndeduction feature of the TSP is an easy way to save. The accounts are \nmanaged prudently by the Thrift Savings Board. Participation in the \nsystem is high and satisfaction with it is also very high.\n  Those of us on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committees \nhave been spending quite a bit of energy trying to encourage Americans \nto save more money. As a New Englander, I speak for my constituents \nwhen I say that we know a lot about thrift. This is a good amendment \nthat will encourage thrift and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Given that our Guard and Reserve are shouldering an increasing share \nof our world-wide missions, they should have the same savings \nopportunity that S. 4 gives to the active duty. Now is the time to \nensure that our reserve component personnel are not overlooked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment that I and Senator Warner \nand Senator Robb and Senator Mikulski have offered is before the \nSenate. This is a very straightforward amendment expressing the sense \nof the Congress that parity between Federal civilian pay and military \npay should be maintained. We should continue that parity. A comparison \nby CRS of military and civilian pay increases finds that 80 percent of \nthe military and civilian pay increases in the last 25 years have been \nidentical. Disparate treatment goes against established congressional \npolicy that has ensured parity with all those who work to serve our \nNation, whether in the Armed Forces or in the civilian workforce.\n  One of the rationales for the increase for military personnel, which \nis in this legislation which I support, has been to address the \nconcerns about retention and recruitment problems. We have comparable \nproblems with respect to the civilian service, and I think it is \nimportant to note that more and more of graduating classes indicate \nless interest in the Federal service. A GAO report in 1990 found that \nlow pay was the most cited reason for employees leaving the civil \nservice or refusing to take a Federal position in the first place.\n  Over the years, particularly in recent years, Federal employees have \nmade significant sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. The law \ngoverning Federal civilian pay has never been fully implemented since \n1994. In fact, Federal civilian workers received a reduced annual \nadjustment. The gap continues to grow, which we are very concerned \nabout. We have been through a downsizing period during which the \nFederal employees have continued to provide high-quality service. So I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this provision. It is an effort \nto achieve a first-rate public service.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am a principal cosponsor with my good \nfriend and colleague from Maryland. I likewise very strongly urge all \nSenators to support this measure. We have\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nto keep a parity situation going. It seems the Senator from Maryland \nand I have worked together two decades on this very point.\n  Mr. President, I think it will be wise if we yield back all time now \nand proceed with the vote, if that is agreeable. I hear no objection. \nSo we yield back all time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. We have an amendment pending and it is now \ntime to vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 19 previously proposed by the Senator from \n     Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Robb \n     and Ms. Mikulski.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is \nour joint intention to first hear from our distinguished colleague, a \nmember of the committee, Senator Hutchinson, and then within 10 minutes \nwe will take up, hopefully, the amendment. I think it is agreed to that \nthe Senator from Iowa will have an amendment.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. I thank you for affording me this \nopportunity to speak on behalf of what I think is very needed \nlegislation. I also applaud his efforts to begin the process of \naddressing in the committee our readiness needs, and in doing so in the \nmost expeditious way beginning with our work in early January.\n  I rise in enthusiastic support of the bill of which I am glad to be a \ncosponsor. I have only been a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee for a short period of time, but it has not taken long to \nbecome alarmed by the numerous readiness problems weakening our Armed \nForces.\n  On January 5, during my first hearing as a member of the Committee, \nthe Air Force's Chief of Staff, General Ryan, testified that by fiscal \nyear 2002, the Air Force would be short over 2,000 pilots. Overall \nreadiness rates for the Air Force have fallen 18 percent since 1996, 4 \npercent in the last quarter alone.\n  At the same hearing, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson, \ntestified that the Navy had fallen 22,000 sailors short of its fiscal \nyear 1998 recruiting goal.\n  The Navy's recruiting woes were vividly illustrated in a recent New \nYork Times article. The article described the maiden voyage of the \nU.S.S. Harry S. Truman, the Navy's newest aircraft carrier.\n  The Truman should have left port with a complement of 2,933 sailors. \nInstead, the Navy was only able to muster 2,543. That is a full 13 \npercent below what is needed.\n  The Navy and Air Forces are not the only services experiencing \nrecruiting shortfalls. The Washington Times reported in January that \nthe Army had already fallen 2,300 soldiers short of its recruiting \ngoals for the first 3 months of this fiscal year, 10,000 soldiers short \nof its congressionally authorized end-strength.\n  The Army is so concerned about this recruiting shortfall that it is \nconsidering lowering its standards, admitting more high school \ndropouts, and I think this portends serious threats to the future of \nour readiness capability.\n  Are Americans being well served when they pay billions of dollars for \nthe finest weapons systems in the world if there aren't enough highly \nmotivated, highly trained soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in \nuniform to operate that fine equipment and fine weapons systems?\n  How did we arrive at this point? Recruitment and retention shortfalls \nare squarely to blame, and there are a number of factors that have \ncontributed to today's circumstances. The military-civilian pay gap, I \nbelieve, is a major cause. That gap now stands at an estimated 14 \npercent. That is a huge handicap the military must bear when it \ncompetes with the civilian sector for high school graduates.\n  While America is fortunate to have a robust civilian economy, when it \nasks its sons and daughters to risk their lives in defense of our \nNation, it must be willing to pay a fair wage. S. 4 will go a long way \ntowards paying fair wages, thus eliminating this civilian-military pay \ngap.\n  S. 4's 4.8-percent across-the-board pay raise will help in the area \nof enlisted retention. The targeted pay raises of up to 10.3 percent \nwill help the military retain its midcareer noncommissioned officers \nand officers who\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nare leaving the services in alarming numbers.\n  But this bill, Mr. President, isn't just about throwing money at a \nproblem; it is also about fixing the mistakes of the past. S. 4 would \nrestore a 50-percent basic pay retirement benefit at 20 years of \nservice. That benefit, as we all know, was cut to 40 percent in 1986 as \npart of an effort to actually improve retention.\n  You see, in the 1980's, too many service men and women were electing \nto retire right after the 20-year mark, enjoying that 50-percent \npension while they were young enough to begin a second career. In what \nseemed to be a smart move at the time, the Congress instituted the \nREDUX system, lowering the retirement benefit for 20 years of service \nto 40 percent. Unfortunately, the legislation, as too often is the case \nin what we do, has had the opposite effect; the REDUX system's smaller \npension has encouraged people to leave the services even earlier.\n  How ironic that in 1999 the Department of Defense would be thrilled \nif service men and women left military service after only 20 years. \nThat would mean they had served more than the 12 or 13 years so many of \nour junior officers are now serving before leaving today.\n  But this bill does more than just fix some of yesterday's mistakes; \nit addresses some of today's concerns. For our men and women in \nuniform, S. 4 is about creating a brighter tomorrow as well. The \nMontgomery GI bill enhancements contained in this bill, while \ncontroversial, will do for military families what the original GI bill \ndid for our soldiers. Increasing the monthly GI plan allowance and \nallowing service members to transfer their benefits to members of their \nimmediate family will dramatically increase the accessibility of higher \neducation in this country.\n  Extending Montgomery GI bill benefits will also go a long way towards \nrecognizing the important contributions made by military families. I \nhave spoken to enough husbands and wives, sons and daughters, of \nservice members to know that a military career punctuated by overseas \ndeployments affects more than just the person wearing the uniform. \nFamilies of service members are truly part of a larger team, and they \ndeserve more than just a pat on the back and saying thanks.\n\n  Then I would add also that opening the Thrift Savings Plan to service \nmembers is another very important feature of S. 4. Allowing members to \ninvest up to 5 percent of their income in the same program open to \ncivilians will allow service members greater retirement security. As we \nhave seen, the looming Social Security crisis threatens retirement for \nmany individuals, and we know that individuals must take greater \nresponsibility for those retirement savings.\n  So as you can see, Mr. President, S. 4, while not a panacea for the \nreadiness shortfalls affecting today's military, will fix some of \nyesterday's mistakes, help us to address some of the crises we are \nfacing today, and provide a brighter tomorrow for our men and women in \nthe armed services.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee to pass this much needed legislation.\n  I once again thank and compliment the chairman of the committee for \nthe outstanding work he has done in moving this legislation forward so \nexpeditiously in this Congress.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate our new colleague \non the Armed Services Committee for those very insightful and helpful \nremarks. We are pleased that the Senator elected to join our committee, \ngiven all the other options that were open to the Senator. I thank the \nSenator very much for his cooperation on the bill, for his helpfulness, \nand we look forward to working with the Senator in the future.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator. I look forward to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I understand the Senator from West \nVirginia wishes to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my distinguished colleague from the State of \nVirginia.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 21\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for the availability of Montgomery GI Bill \n   benefits for preparatory courses for college and graduate school \n                            admission exams)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 21.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, between the matter following line 5 and line 6, \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. AVAILABILITY OF MONTGOMERY GI BILL BENEFITS FOR \n                   PREPARATORY COURSES FOR COLLEGE AND GRADUATE \n                   SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMS.\n\n       For purposes of section 3002(3) of title 38, United States \n     Code, the term ``program of education'' shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) A preparatory course for a test that is required or \n     utilized for admission to an institution of higher education.\n       (2) A preparatory course for test that is required or \n     utilized for admission to a graduate school.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair very much, as I always do, for his \nuncanny ability to maintain order in the Senate, which is unparalleled.\n  Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have an especially strong interest in issues that improve \nthe quality of life for the men and women who now serve and have \nalready served in our Nation's military forces. These brave men and \nwomen often face extreme hardships in their service to our country, and \nlater, in their efforts to successfully transition back to civilian \nlife. S. 4, the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \nRights Act of 1999,'' goes far to address some of these hardships.\n  I believe that a major impetus of S. 4 is to enhance the military's \nability to attract and retain the best young men and women to the ranks \nof America's Armed Forces. But S. 4 also has the collateral effect of \nimproving the lives of servicemembers by providing them with a much-\nneeded pay increase and eliminating the $1,200 contribution that \nservicemembers must make to the Montgomery GI bill during their first \nyear in service, while their salaries are at their lowest.\n  S. 4 will also improve these servicemembers' transition to civilian \nlife by increasing the basic monthly allowance of the MGIB from $528 to \n$600. This 12 percent increase follows on the heels of a 20-percent \nincrease last year. The Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and \nVeterans Transition Assistance--the ``Transition Commission'' or \n``Commission''--recommended such an increase in its report to Congress, \nlast month.\n  The Commission was inspired by our former colleague, Senator Bob \nDole, and provides data and recommendations on ways to improve the \ntransitional period. The Commission's report highlights the fact that \ncosts of tuition and fees for public and private educational \ninstitutions rose approximately 90 percent from 1980-1995, while the \nMGIB benefit rates only increased 42 percent from 1985 to 1995.\n  The statistics regarding education and employment for veterans are \nrevealing. Despite almost full enrollment in the program by \nservicemembers, the number of eligible veterans who take advantage of \ntheir MGIB benefits is startlingly low, only 48 percent. Less than 20 \npercent of those who use the MGIB attend private institutions. And the \nTransition Commission reports that the unemployment rate for veterans \nages 20-24 and 35-39 is higher than their non-veteran counterparts. All \nthese are reasons why I believe that there is more that we can and must \ndo.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs currently has authority to provide \nMGIB benefits for post-graduate exam preparatory courses that are \nrequired for a particular profession, such as CPA exam or bar review \ncourses. However, it does not have authority to provide for pre-\nadmission preparatory coursework.\n  The amendment I am offering would correct that disparity by allowing \nveterans to use their MGIB benefits for preparatory courses for \nentrance examinations required for college and graduate school \nadmission. It would\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nnot increase a veteran's basic entitlement or affect eligibility for \nbenefits.\n  By giving veterans the opportunity to better their admission test \nscores, this amendment would expand the choices available to veterans \nin their course of higher education. It will also improve access to the \ntop educational institutions for veterans who sometimes were not the \nbest students in high school, but are now better focused and committed \nto their education.\n  Studies by national consulting companies have shown improvement of \nover 100 points on the SAT exam and an average improvement of seven \npoints in LSAT scores for students who take exam preparatory courses. \nAt some of the Nation's top schools, scores on entrance exams can count \nfor half of the total application.\n  An article in the April 13, 1998, New Republic stated, ``Thorough, \nexpertly taught preparation can raise a student's ability to cope with, \nand hence succeed on, a particular exam. In many cases, then, test prep \ncan make the difference between getting into a topflight law school and \nsettling for the second tier.'' That is why it is critical that \nveterans have access to such courses.\n  However, many of these exam preparatory courses are quite costly. One \nnational provider charges as much as $750 for a two-month, part-time, \nSAT preparatory course. One educational advocacy group, Fairtest, \nargues that ``[t]he SAT has always favored students who can afford \ncoaching over those who cannot . . .''\n  The Transition Commission urged Congress to enact legislation that \nwould fully fund a veteran's education at a college of their choice, so \nthat veterans would not be limited by cost, but only by their own \nabilities. I believe that we should also assist veterans to enlarge the \nboundaries of their abilities. This is an investment in America's \nveterans and in America. Data from the VA shows that during the \nlifetime of the average WWII veteran, the U.S. Treasury received from \ntwo to eight times as much in income taxes as it paid out to the \nveteran in GI Bill benefits. Just imagine the return on investment from \nthis small change in law.\n  It is simply a matter of common sense. The government provides \nveterans the opportunity to get a higher education. We should now do \nwhat we can to make sure that veterans are getting the best education \nthat they possibly can, by helping them to get into the best school \npossible.\n  I am proud to offer this amendment to improve our veterans' ability \nto transition successfully from military to civilian life, and would \nlike to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services \nCommittee for their support. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor bringing this to the attention of the committee. The amendment is \ncleared on this side. It is an excellent piece of legislation. Because \nour current generation is faced with test after test after test, \nindeed, they do need some help from time to time. This amendment will \nfacilitate the use of funds which, I think, had it been envisioned at \nthe time the original legislation was written, would have been \nincluded. So the Senator has come along to help our veterans a great \ndeal. The amendment is accepted on this side.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we also commend the Senator from West \nVirginia for his amendment, and I concur with the chairman's remarks. \nThis would not materially increase in any way the costs associated with \nthe Montgomery programs, and it would also provide additional \nopportunities for service members to pursue higher education. It is \nsomething that is consistent with the legislation, and it is an \namendment which we support with enthusiasm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The amendment (No. 21) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REED. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 22\n\n            (Purpose: To make certain technical corrections)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and the Senator from Colorado and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Allard, proposes an amendment numbered 22.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 19, insert ``2000,'' after ``January 1,''.\n       On page 21, line 23, strike out ``(1)''.\n       Beginning on page 22, in the table under the heading \n     ``commissioned officers with over 4 years of active duty \n     service as an enlisted member or warrant officer'', strike \n     out the superscript ``4'' each place it appears in the column \n     under the heading ``Pay Grade''.\n       Beginning on page 27, line 25, strike out``the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services'' and all that follows through \n     ``Administration),'' on page 28, line 4.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a technical correction to section \n202 of the bill. When the Armed Services Committee drafted S. 4, it was \nour intent to permit the enlistment, reenlistment, and the REDUX bonus \nto be deposited directly into a service member's Thrift Savings \naccount. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to waive the \nlimit on annual contributions to the Thrift Savings account. S. 4 as \nreported does not include the waiver. However, after the bill was \nreported, the Thrift board, which administers the Thrift Savings Plan, \nnotified the committee that one of the additional statutory \nrequirements was necessary--and that is the purpose of this amendment; \nit corrects the unintended oversight. Therefore, I believe this \namendment is acceptable on both sides.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we agree this amendment is necessary to \naccomplish the purposes of the bill, and we support it.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 22) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REED. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think our distinguished colleague from \nIowa desires to speak to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 23\n\n (Purpose: To facilitate provision of effective assistance for members \n     of the uniformed services eligible for food stamp assistance)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and for \nmyself and Mr. Bingaman ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 23.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, strike lines 10 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     (b)(1), the Secretary concerned shall pay the member a \n     special subsistence allowance for each month for which the \n     member is eligible to receive food stamp assistance, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       ``(b) Covered Members.--(1) A member referred to subsection \n     (a) is an enlisted member in pay grade E-5 or below.\n       ``(2) For the purposes of this section, a member shall be \n     considered as being eligible to receive food stamp assistance \n     if the household of the member meets the income standards of \n     eligibility established under section 5(c)(2) of the Food \n     Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2014(c)(2)), not taking into \n     account the special subsistence allowance that may be payable \n     to the member under this section and any allowance that is \n     payable to the member under section 403 or 404a of this \n     title.\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, first I want to most sincerely compliment \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the committee, \nand the ranking member, Senator Levin, for bringing this bill to the \nfloor so expeditiously. The pay structure of the military needs to be \naddressed. We are losing too many good people.\n  Last summer I happened to find myself up in Iceland, talking to some \nof the pilots up there who are performing pretty hazardous flying duty. \nI remember I met in the Oak Club with a bunch of them. They were \npilots, highly trained--maybe they had been in 7 or 8 years--and now \nthey are getting out. A lot of them wanted to stay but simply because \nof the families they had, the pay just wasn't there. We just cannot \nafford to keep losing that many good people out of the military. So \nthis bill is long overdue, but it is welcome relief for a lot of our \nmilitary families. I think it will go a long way toward retaining a lot \nof our qualified people.\n  I know it is 4.8 percent. Frankly, if it was 5 percent, I would vote \nfor it. If it was 6 percent, I would support it. I know we have \nbudgetary constraints, but with a volunteer force like we have, and \nwith some of the duty these people have to pull now in faraway places \nfor a long period of time, not knowing what is around the corner, we \nhave kind of a different situation than it was when the two of us were \nin the military some years ago.\n  I think this is a good shot. It is needed right now. I know the \nchairman well. I know he feels very deeply about this and about the pay \nof our armed services personnel. But I hope we have an ongoing process \nto continue to look at this so we do not have these big gaps and lags \nin time when we lose a lot of our people. To whatever extent I can be \nhelpful, I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman in \nthis regard as we move ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will just yield, our good \nfriend and colleague here has a distinguished career in the Navy, in \naviation. As a pilot, he understands the risks that pilots undertake \nevery day. People always think the risks only occur in combat. Those of \nus who were in training commands many years ago know it is quite \ndifferent. Indeed, in combat are the aviators over Iraq this morning, \nenforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And pilots are awaiting \nthe instructions with regard to the fighting that is going on in \nKosovo. So this is a major piece of legislation to retain those people.\n  I would just like to rhetorically ask my good friend a question. I \nknow there is great concern among some of our colleagues, genuine \nconcern, that this bill represents an awful lot of money. But I ask my \ncolleagues, what good are the planes and the ships and the other \nequipment that we buy if there are not qualified people to operate \nthem? Am I not correct, Senator?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. And especially now.\n  In my time, I thought it was just overwhelming when I was flying a \nplane that cost $1 million.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the record, it was a F-4, wasn't it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. An F-4. I think $1 million or $1.5 million, something \nlike that for the F-4s and F-8s.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we had about 7,000 at one time, compared to the \naircraft buys of a half dozen or a dozen now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And they are up to the hundreds of millions of dollars. \nYou entrust these airplanes to the pilots that are in their twenties. \nSometimes I look at these pilots and think: Was I ever that young when \nI was flying an airplane? And these young men and women take \nextraordinary risks every day we send them off those catapults and a \nlot of times into dangerous situations. We just have to keep that in \nmind.\n\n  The Senator is right. We can build the best aircraft, and we do, and \nthey are highly sophisticated now, but unless you have that trained \nindividual, who is not only trained but dedicated and wants to stay \nthere, you are lacking something. That machine does not mean a darned \nthing. So that is why this bill is so important. Again, I compliment \nthe chairman for taking this and really pushing it through.\n  There is one thing, I say to my friend from Virginia, that came to my \nmind a couple of years ago. I am on the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee, I am not on the authorizing committee, but it came to my \nattention here 2 or 3 years ago when I got on this issue of military \npeople being on food stamps. It is just something about which I had not \nthought. It never occurred to me. It never hit me.\n  I am on the Ag Committee, and of course I have been involved in the \nFood Stamp Program, and it is a good program. The Senator in the chair \nhas been a strong supporter of the Food Stamp Program too, in the past. \nIt is a good thing. But it just hit me as wrong. There is something \nwrong when our people in uniform qualify for food stamps. For some \nreason that just did not seem right to me. So I started a process of \nlooking at it and writing letters to the Department of Defense, trying \nto get as much information as I could on this.\n  Senator Domenici and I put some language in a bill once to get some \ndata on this, as much as we could. We got bits and pieces of it, but we \nnever really got all the information we needed. But we did find out \nthat there were literally thousands of military personnel who, today, \nare on food stamps and who also get the WIC Program, the Women, Infants \nand Children Program, because they fall below that level.\n  Again, to the chairman's great foresight, he did address this in this \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to make \nit very clear--people don't try to take credit around here, but I think \nothers should acknowledge that they should receive it, and in this \ninstance Senator McCain has been the Senator on our committee who has, \ntime and time again, brought this to the attention of the committee, \nindeed the Senate as a whole. I have heard him address the American \npublic in many forums on this issue. It was his work, and, indeed, the \nPresiding Officer had a hand in this issue also, the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, the Senator from Virginia shows the gentleman\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nthat he really is by acknowledging the input of others into this issue, \nand I appreciate that. But the bill we have before us provides for a \n$180 bonus payment to any person in the armed services who qualifies \nfor food stamps. That is a great step. I applaud it. I support it \nwholeheartedly. But, again, in looking at it, I think there are some \nareas that maybe need to be addressed further, and that is the purpose \nof my amendment.\n  For example, the $180 bonus applies to service people in the country, \nin the United States, but not to service people overseas. Again, having \nserved in the military and having been stationed overseas, I can tell \nyou a lot of times it is a lot more expensive, especially if you are \nstationed in Japan or places like that where it is much more costly, \nmuch more expensive than it is for the people here in the States. So \nwhat my amendment would do would apply the $180 not just to personnel \nin the United States but to people overseas. It just extends it to them \nalso.\n\n  Second, under the bill, the process to get the bonus is they would \nfirst have to go to the food stamp office and get some paperwork done \nand show that they qualify. Then they come back to DOD and give them \nthis documentation. Then they take other documentation back to the \nUSDA. It was kind of a three-step process.\n  What my amendment says is all they have to do is go to their \npersonnel office, their paymaster for example, and say: Look, you know \nwhat my pay is. Here is my pay. You know how many dependents I have. \nThe only thing that is missing is spousal income. So they would just \ndocument what their spousal income is. The military already has records \non their dependents and their pay. And if they qualify, that is the end \nof it. They do not have to go through this bureaucratic nightmare of \ngoing to the USDA office and back and forth; it would be just a one-\nstep process. So my amendment tries to streamline that.\n  Third, again--one of these Catch-22 situations we have here--if you \nlive off base and you get a housing allowance, then that is--let me put \nit this way: It is counted in whether or not you are eligible for the \n$180.\n  What my amendment says is if you get housing allowance, that is off \nthe table, that is not counted as part of that, because in a lot of \ncases, housing allowances are eaten up by housing. It really doesn't \nadd anything to their income. That is the third thing the amendment \ndoes.\n  The last thing my amendment does is under the WIC Program, the Women, \nInfants and Children Program, if you are overseas--you can get it here, \nbut you can't get it overseas. You would get the money in lieu of that. \nI am told that the average basic WIC allowance is about $32 a month for \nfood; $10.50--is that right?--for administration. It is about $42 a \nmonth. That will be added for people who are overseas. If they were \nhere, they could get WIC, but if they are overseas, they can't get it.\n  Again, in terms of how much this costs, 2 years ago, we did have an \namendment on the bill asking the DOD to give us the numbers on WIC and \nfood stamps, and we have never received those figures from the \nDepartment of Defense. I don't know why we can't get them, but we can't \nget them. I did get a letter last August. I have to tell you, and I say \nthis in all sincerity to my friend from Virginia, this letter disturbed \nme a little bit.\n  I am going to read one paragraph of it. It is responding to section \n655 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998. It \nrequired the Department of Defense to conduct a study of the members of \nthe Armed Forces and their families who are at, near, or below the \npoverty line. It was sent to Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin last \nAugust 18.\n  Here is a paragraph that really disturbs me. I quote from the letter:\n\n       Pay raises targeted to junior enlisted grades with the \n     objective of eliminating poverty or food stamp usage are \n     expensive and not consistent with the objectives of military \n     compensation.\n\n  Wow. Not consistent with the objectives of military compensation?\n\n       The Department does not support these measures. Nor does \n     the Department support pay raises that provide greater \n     percentage increases in basic pay and/or allowances to junior \n     members. Such a policy will disadvantage the senior enlisted \n     and officer forces relative to their civilian counterparts.\n\n  I really don't understand that at all.\n\n       It will also adversely impact retention, morale, and \n     productivity.\n\n  Wait a minute, we are going to raise junior enlisted people above the \npoverty line, give them a bonus in lieu of food stamps here and abroad, \nand that will adversely impact retention, morale and productivity? I am \nsorry, I don't understand this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator allow me to state the following? I am \npersonally in favor of your amendment, and we have put a request in to \nthe Department of Defense to update the very facts you are addressing \nhere.\n  Therefore, pending receipt of that information from the Department of \nDefense, I respectfully ask that we lay your amendment aside after you, \nof course, have completed your presentation of the amendment, and then \nduring the course of the next few hours, I will keep you advised with \nregard to the information that will hopefully be forthcoming, at which \ntime the Senate can address the amendment presumably in a rollcall vote \nand hopefully sometime this afternoon. That is this Senator's \nintention.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine with this Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I assure the Senator, we are diligent in trying to pursue \nthis same information and get an update.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I will finish my statement very \nshortly, Mr. President.\n  Again, this one paragraph really bothers me. Again, I don't \nunderstand how the Department of Defense can say that:\n\n       [It does not] support pay raises that provide greater \n     percentage increases in basic pay and/or allowances to junior \n     members.\n\n  I can see in terms of basic pay, but not allowances in terms of food \nstamps, for example. Then they say it will adversely impact retention, \nmorale and productivity. I wish someone would explain that one to me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nexecutive summary from which I quoted.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Military pay is intended to be sufficient to meet the basic \n     needs of all members--this is a fundamental premise of the \n     all-volunteer force. Yet, we find that some military members \n     have pay and allowances that place them at the poverty level \n     or eligible to receive food stamps and other forms of federal \n     assistance. These findings are troublesome to many and raise \n     the question as to the adequacy of military pay. This report \n     responds to a congressional request (P.L. 105-340, sec. 655) \n     that the Secretary of Defense conduct a study of poverty and \n     the military. Specifically, Congress asked that the study \n     include:\n       An analysis of potential solutions for ensuring that \n     members of the Armed Forces and their families do not have to \n     subsist at, near, or below the poverty level, including \n     potential solutions involving changes in the system of \n     allowances for members.\n       Identification of the military populations most likely to \n     need income support under Federal Government programs, \n     including: (i) The populations living in areas of the United \n     States where housing costs are notably high; (ii) the \n     populations living outside the United States; and (iii) the \n     number of persons in each identified population.\n       The desirability of increasing rates of basic pay and \n     allowances for members over a defined period of years by a \n     range of percentages that provides for higher percentage \n     increases for lower ranking than for higher ranking members.\n       The Department has identified 451 members, less than 3/\n     100th of one percent of the military population, that could \n     potentially be at or below the poverty level. The most junior \n     of these members has a family size of 5 or greater in a grade \n     where 86% of members are single. The average age of this \n     entry grade is 19. For careerists to be below the poverty \n     level requires a family size of at least 8.\n       Eligibility for food stamps, poverty programs, and other \n     federal assistance is negatively correlated with high housing \n     costs. The Department offsets high housing costs through the \n     basic allowance for housing (BAH) and, before BAH, the \n     variable housing allowance program. Under BAH, members will \n     have exactly the same out of pocket expenditure by grade no \n     matter where in the United States they are stationed. Because \n     members receive higher allowances in high-cost areas while \n     the gross income criterion for eligibility is fixed in CONUS, \n     it is more, rather than less, difficult to receive assistance \n     benefits in high housing cost locations.\n       Members stationed overseas are not eligible for federal \n     assistance programs such as food stamps. These programs are \n     administered by state agencies within the United States and \n     there is no state sponsor in overseas locations. Overseas \n     housing and cost-of-\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\n     living adjustments are more generous than those in the U.S. \n     The overseas housing allowance (OHA) reimburses housing costs \n     fully up to the 80th percentile. That means that 80% of our \n     members have their full rent and utilities paid by the \n     allowances. Overseas COLAs supplement income to reduce \n     overseas living costs to the U.S. average.\n       Pay raises targeted to junior enlisted grades with the \n     objective of eliminating poverty or food stamp usage are \n     expensive and not consistent with the objectives of military \n     compensation. The Department does not support these measures. \n     Nor does the Department support pay raises that provide \n     greater percentage increases in basic pay and/or allowances \n     to junior members. Such a policy will disadvantage the senior \n     enlisted and officer forces relative to their civilian \n     counterparts. It will also adversely impact retention, \n     morale, and productivity. Pay compression will be further \n     aggravated by policies that attempt to lower senior enlisted \n     and officer pay relative to junior enlisted.\n       Other measures such as targeted allowances for large \n     families are also not supported by the Department. Such \n     allowances increase inequities between singles and those with \n     dependents while creating inequities betweeen members with \n     average as opposed to large families.\n       The Department does support efforts to treat members on- \n     and off-base equitably when applying for federal assistance. \n     Specifically, the Department feels that the value of inkind \n     housing received by members living on base should be included \n     in any calculation of gross income.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, lastly, the chairman, I know, is trying to \nget some figures from the Department of Defense on how much this costs. \nWe have an estimate right now that the provision in the bill itself \nthat provides for the $180 payment in lieu of food stamps will cost, at \nmost, $26 million a year through the year 2004--$26 million a year \nthrough the year 2004.\n  What Senator Bingaman and I are seeking to do is extending this \noverseas, streamlining the process--that doesn't cost anything--not \ncounting the basic housing allowance and getting the $42 a month in the \nWIC payments to troops stationed overseas.\n  Mr. President, I will bet you my bottom dollar and anything I have \nthat it will not even double it. It can't double it. It would be \nimpossible to double it because we have more people in the United \nStates than we have stationed overseas. But even if it did double, we \nare talking about $52 million a year. I think the DOD budget next year \nis something like $270 billion. We can't afford $52 million?\n  I am saying that would be the maximum if you double it. We would have \nexactly the same number of people overseas in the same pay grade than \nwe have stationed here, and we know that is not so. I await the figures \nfrom the Department of Defense to see what they say. Since they have \nalready given us an estimate of $26 million on the provision in the \nbill, I will be surprised if it comes in anything more than perhaps--\noh, I will take a guess --$35 million a year probably, just off the top \nof my head.\n  Even if it doubled it, which it can't--there is no way it can--you \nare talking about $52 million a year. I think that is a small price to \npay to make sure that none of our military people are on food stamps \nand that they are eligible to get the payment through the WIC Program \nif they are overseas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from Marilyn Sobke, president of the National Military Family \nAssociation, in which she states:\n\n       The National Military Family Association strongly supports \n     your amendment that would finally extend the benefits of the \n     [WIC] Program to eligible military families stationed \n     overseas.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Military\n\n\n                                           Family Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) strongly supports your amendment that \n     would finally extend the benefits of the Women's, Infants' \n     and Children's nutrition program to eligible military \n     families stationed overseas! As you are aware, Senator \n     Harkin, NMFA has long supported a solution to the problem for \n     these families, who lose their WIC benefits simply because \n     their country sends them to overseas duty stations.\n       The amount of mail NMFA receives from both overseas social \n     agencies and individual families regarding the need for WIC \n     benefits has increased each year, even as the number of \n     families stationed in many of these areas has decreased. We \n     thank you again for your steadfast concern for these military \n     families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Marilyn Sobke,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will set my \namendment aside and await the figures from the Department of Defense. \nIn the meantime, I hope Senators will support this amendment. It is not \ngoing to cost that much, but it has the objective of making sure that \nno one who puts on the uniform of the United States has to go down and \nstand in line to get food stamps. If nothing else, we ought to end \nthat. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, the \namendment is set aside.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would briefly like to comment on Senator Harkin's amendment and \nthen make more generalized comments on the bill overall. But first let \nme speak to Senator Harkin's amendment.\n  I commend him for his initiative. He is responding to the needs of \nthe youngest, most junior members of our military forces who need this \ntype of support not only to provide for themselves and their families \nbut to have the mental attitude and the freedom of mind, if you will, \nto commit themselves to a military career, and to do so from the very \nbeginning of their careers so they start off on the right foot and they \ndevelop successfully as professional soldiers, sailors, airmen. All of \nthis is very important. I commend the Senator for his initiative and I \nhope we can work out the budgetary aspects of this legislation and \nadopt this amendment.\n  Now let me turn to the bill in general.\n  First, let me commend the chairman and all of my colleagues on the \ncommittee for recognizing the seriousness of this problem of retention \nand recruitment. Indeed, it is a very serious problem. And this is a \nvery serious solution, because it not only provides for resources for \nrecruitment and retention, it does raise very legitimate and very \nsignificant budgetary issues which I will address as I discuss the \nissues overall.\n  Let there be no mistake, there is a retention and recruitment problem \nwithin the military services today. Each year, the Department of \nDefense is responsible for recruiting 200,000 men and women to fill the \nactive ranks of the military forces in the United States.\n\n  In fiscal year 1998, the services were only able to recruit 180,000 \nnew soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. While the Air Force and \nMarines were able to achieve their recruiting goals in 1998, the Army \nfell short by 776 personnel, and the Navy was short by a significant \nnumber, 6,892. This is a problem and it is a problem that is getting \nworse.\n  In the first 4 months of fiscal year 1999, the Marines again made \ntheir recruiting goal, and so did the Navy, but the Army fell short, \nreaching only 87 percent of its required strength level, and the Air \nForce only 94 percent of their required strength level.\n  There is a problem with recruitment. And we know if you do not get \ngood personnel to enter the military forces you cannot keep the \nstrength levels up. There is also the associated problem of retaining \nthese good individuals as they go through their military careers. Every \nservice--and many of my colleagues have pointed this out--is struggling \nto keep pilots. These are highly skilled positions. These positions are \nnot easily replaced. It takes years not only of training but of \nexperience to develop the kind of combat skills necessary for an \neffective pilot.\n  In the Air Force, for example, for every two pilots who enter the \nservice, they are finding that three are leaving. That ratio is going \nto cause profound problems going forward. As my colleague from Arkansas \npointed out, General Ryan in the Air Force estimated by fiscal year \n2002 the Air Force would be 2,000 pilots short. That is a serious \nerosion of our national security posture.\n  The Navy is experiencing the problems of recruiting and retaining \nsurface warfare officers. This causes them to extend sea duty by months \nand months and months, putting additional\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\npressure on military personnel. And it is this vicious circle, of fewer \npeople to do the job, causing those who are on active duty to do more \nand more and more, that is adding additional pressure to the retention \nproblem.\n  This legislation addresses this problem very directly and with great \ngusto. There is a 4.8-percent pay increase. And that will not only make \nthe daily lives of military personnel easier--not only give them the \nresources to provide for their families--it will also be a strong \nsymbolic gesture that will show that this Congress understands the \nvalue of our men and women in the military forces. That symbolic, as \nwell as very practical, response is very, very important.\n  Also, this legislation will reform the pay table so that we can begin \nto reward more effectively and efficiently those midlevel \nnoncommissioned officers and officers. These are the key people who \nmake our military services the best in the world. They are the squad \nleaders; they are the platoon sergeants; they are the young officers \nwho are at the front doing the job out on patrol in Bosnia and other \nplaces. It is individuals who are so important to our military \nservices. With the new pay tables, we will be able to provide better \nincentives and we hope provide better retention incentives for these \nindividuals.\n  There is another measure in this bill which is also very important, \nand that is extending the Montgomery GI bill benefits not only to \nindividual military personnel but also to their families. I must \ncommend Senator Cleland, my colleague, whose idea it was. He was the \nsource of this language. It is very powerful language, because when you \nlook at the retention problem, you find you are talking generally about \nmen and women who are in their late twenties, early thirties. They have \n12 years of active duty or so. They are also looking at their families \nand seeing children, 10, 11, 12 years old and beginning to understand \nreally--not just theoretically--but really that they have to do \nsomething to put these children through college. And this provision \nwill help them do that by allowing their benefits to be used for their \nchildren.\n\n  This bill has many commendable components. Again, it stretches the \nbudget dramatically. And that is an issue we have to deal with. But the \nprinciples included in this bill are very worthy of support.\n  Let me suggest also, though, that this issue is not just about pay \nand compensation. Recruitment and retention are not just about pay and \ncompensation. It is an important part, it might be the most salient \nissue, the one that we should deal with immediately and directly, but \nit is not the only issue, because there are many other factors that \ninfluence whether an individual will enter the military and, in many, \nmany cases, whether that individual will stay on active duty.\n  For example, there is the issue of operational tempo. We are \nstretching our military forces very, very thin. They are deployed in \ncountries around the globe. They are deployed constantly. When they \nfinish one deployment, they come home, they retrain, and suddenly, \nbefore expected in many cases, they are out once again in another \ndeployment. This puts tremendous pressure on family life, puts \ntremendous pressure on the individual service members and their \nfamilies. That is an issue we have to deal with. And we are not dealing \nwith it simply by raising pay and allowances.\n  Then there is the issue of readiness. The degree that we take money \nand put it into the personnel pay side is less money that we will have \navailable for other issues of readiness--frankly, other issues with \nregard to the equipment that they have and that they believe they must \nhave to do their jobs. That is another issue.\n  Finally, there is the issue which I alluded to about family concerns. \nThe military is changing. This is not the same military we had 20 years \nago or 30 years ago. This military is more a family organization in \nwhich it is quite likely that younger military personnel will have \nfamily and will have dependents. It is also a situation now where the \nspouses of military personnel have to work. They have to work because, \nlike so many families in America, they need two paychecks even if we \nincrease the pay.\n  But in many cases you have spouses who feel that their own \nprofessional and personal development require them to work. And it is \nvery difficult, particularly when you reach that 30-year-old mark with \nsomeone who is a spouse who has a job, for them to pick up and suddenly \nmove from one post to another. It might be a good change of assignment \nfor the military member, but it could mean the death knell of the \ncareer for the spouse. That is another factor.\n  There are limited opportunities for advancement. The military has \ngotten smaller. There is also, in this economy, the law of private \nincentive. We will never be able to pay as much money to a pilot as \nAmerican Airlines or Delta. So increasing pay is important, but we also \nhave to recognize that there are many, many other forces at work. When \nyou consider these additional factors, you also have to recognize that \nit is, I think, probably more prudent to try to do this legislation in \nthe context of the overall authorization bill and not separately. And \nit is also prudent to wait for some information and some analysis that \nwill shortly be forthcoming.\n\n  The Department of Defense, CBO, and GAO are studying these problems \nas we speak. We would be very prudent, I think, to wait for their \ninformation.\n  For example, the GAO report will indicate, we believe, that the \nbiggest complaint among military personnel--this is from a Defense Week \narticle of February 22--is not pay and allowances; it is heavy \nworkloads, job dissatisfaction, and poor health care. So, again, we are \nmoving promptly to address this issue, but a little bit more \ncircumspection might reward us with a better ultimate product.\n  We are considering this bill today. We should consider this bill \ntoday.\n  We also should be very conscious of the cost factors involved.\n  We understand that this bill will likely be about $12 billion more \nthan the President's proposal. That proposal has been fully paid for \nwithin the budget. We have to ask ourselves sincerely and reasonably, \nwill this additional increment of billions of dollars make a difference \nin recruitment and retention? Second, where will we get these funds? \nThese are legitimate questions that we have to consider.\n  Secretary Cohen is acutely sensitive of these issues. In a February \n19 letter to Senator Levin, he said:\n\n       I am concerned that until there is a budget resolution that \n     sets the defense budget level, this bill constitutes an \n     unfunded requirement on the Department. Absent an increase in \n     the topline for Defense, these items will only displace other \n     key elements of our program. It would be counterproductive \n     and completely contrary to our mutual desire not to undercut \n     our modernization effort and other readiness priorities.\n\n  Therefore, as enthusiastic as we are to see that military men and \nwomen are rewarded in pay and benefits for their great services to the \ncountry, we have to be very, very careful when it comes to this \nincrease in the amount of spending because it could result in cuts in \nother programs, in modernization programs, in other types of family-\nlike programs which might be equally important to ensure retention of \nmilitary personnel.\n  I understand and I support what we are trying to do in concept. I \nbelieve that this legislation must be changed, though, ultimately to \nrecognize the severe budgetary constraints before we can accept it as \nlaw. I hope that when this bill comes back from conference it will not \nonly have these very, very worthy elements, but it will be within a \nbudget cap that we all agree is appropriate for not only the Department \nof Defense, but for our overall efforts.\n\n  We have a responsibility to our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, \nour marines, a responsibility to our taxpayers. We have to discharge \nboth. I hope we pass this legislation, that we bring it back from \nconference in a much more constrained budgetary form. If we don't do \nthat, I very well may be compelled to oppose it at that point. Today, I \nsupport it. I support it because the principles it includes are \nimportant. They address the fundamental problem in the military. It \nwill represent, I hope, progress towards a final, more balanced \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the committee, we welcome the\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nSenators joining our committee this year. Senator Reed brings a \ndistinguished background in the military services, having been on \nactive duty himself at one point. It was an excellent statement.\n  Mr. President, I see another one of our very valued ``old-timer'' \nMembers seeking recognition, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dana Krupa, \na fellow in my office, be allowed floor privileges during the pendency \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia and \ncompliment him and the Senator from Michigan, my good friend, Senator \nLevin, for their leadership in getting this set of issues before the \nSenate and ensuring quick progress in dealing with the very real issue \nthat faces our military personnel.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 24\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding the processing of \n                     claims for veterans' benefits)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I \nask that amendment be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 24.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, after line 16, add the following:\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 501. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING PROCESSING OF CLAIMS FOR \n                   VETERANS' BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite advances in technology, telecommunications, and \n     training, the Department of Veterans Affairs currently \n     requires 20 percent more time to process claims for veterans' \n     benefits than the Department required to process such claims \n     in 1997.\n       (2) The Department does not currently process claims for \n     veterans' benefits in a timely manner.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to urge \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to--\n       (1) review the program, policies, and procedures of the \n     Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs in order to identify areas in which the \n     Administration does not currently process claims for \n     veterans' benefits in a manner consistent with the objectives \n     set forth in the National Performance Review (including \n     objectives regarding timeliness of Executive branch \n     activities); and\n       (2) initiate any actions necessary to ensure that the \n     Administration processes claims for such benefits in a manner \n     consistent with such objectives.\n       (3) report to the Congress by June 1, 1999 on measures \n     taken to improve processing time for veterans' claims.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is merely a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution regarding an element of pay and benefits to service members, \nand particularly those service men and women who have already served \ntheir country or are retired from the military service. In all of our \ndiscussions about the need to provide greater incentives for young \nAmericans to serve and to remain in the military, we can't forget how \nimportant it is for the Nation to follow through on the promises that \nwe have made to our veterans; to know that the benefits that are \npromised will be delivered is a very important tool in recruiting and \nretaining quality personnel in our military.\n  I have been disturbed, as I am sure some of my colleagues have been, \nby the recent reports in the press that have indicated that getting \nclaims by our Nation's veterans actually resolved and paid by the \nVeterans' Administration has become an increasing problem. Many \nveterans are having to wait an unconscionably long period of time \nbefore their cases have been resolved. I hear about this in my home \nState. I was there all last week and heard about it at several points.\n  I recently read of a case that originated in 1967 that has still not \nbeen conclusively resolved. Veterans in my State of New Mexico have \ncomplained that the time taken to process individual claims has grown \nconsiderably worse over the past year. We have a billboard that has \nbeen put up in our State by a veterans group complaining about this \nissue. We have had picketing at congressional offices to raise \nawareness of this issue. According to the press, the average VA claim \nhas been pending for 151 days nationwide, while in Albuquerque the \naverage has increased to 161 days.\n  I tried to look into the situation and from what I can tell, the \nprospects for improvement are fairly slim. We have significant staff \ncutbacks--at least in my State, in Albuquerque--that have made the \nproblem worse. But there have been other factors such as limited \ntraining and lack of automation in the VA that have contributed to the \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, this problem is not peculiar to New Mexico. Yesterday, \nthe Washington Post included an article that suggested the problem is \nbeing experienced in many States, if not in all. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n VA Enters `Different World' of Computers--Anti-Paper Effort To Start \n                                Locally\n\n                          (By Bill McAllister)\n\n       Shortly after he arrived in Washington to take charge of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs' notoriously troubled \n     benefit programs, Joseph Thompson gave Clinton administration \n     officials a succinct assessment. ``We're in the 14th year of \n     a seven-year modernization program.''\n       Repeatedly pilloried by Congress, the General Accounting \n     Office and senior VA officials, efforts to improve Thompson's \n     sprawling Veterans Benefits Administration are no joke. His \n     agency, which has offices in every state, has defied numerous \n     efforts to improve the speed with which it handles 2.5 \n     million veterans claims a year.\n       Today, 15 months after he took office as undersecretary for \n     veterans benefits, Thompson will announce a major initiative \n     to end the VA's dependence on the huge paper files that \n     remain the lifeblood--and the bane--of the VA's claims \n     bureaucracy. With the cooperation of seven high-tech \n     companies, the VA will initiate a pilot program to put all \n     the claims files at its Washington regional office in an \n     electronic database.\n       Thompson hopes that the program not only will speed the \n     handling of Washington area claims, but that it also will \n     give the VA ``a peek into a different world in which we are \n     going to have to live,'' a world dominated by computers. It \n     also could provide the department with the outline of a \n     national computer claims network, which Thompson says the VA \n     eventually must create.\n       The former head of the VA's New York benefits office, \n     Thompson acknowledged in an interview yesterday that his \n     ambitious plans face a lot of skepticism from Capitol Hill \n     and from veterans. Congress, which must fund any national \n     system, is demanding proof that his plans will work, Thompson \n     said.\n       Fifty-seven percent of veterans interviewed by the VA have \n     given Thompson's current benefits programs a thumbs down \n     because claims processing is painfully slow and difficult to \n     deal with. ``We know they are unhappy,'' Thompson said. ``If \n     you were seeing those numbers in a private company, you'd be \n     packing your bags.''\n       Thompson, a career VA employee whose work in New York was \n     praised by Vice President Gore and his National Performance \n     Review, won the help of a nonprofit business group called \n     Highway 1 after he pleaded for the support of private \n     industry.\n       Highway 1, composed of Kodak, Microsoft, IBM, \n     MCI Worldwide, Computer Sciences Corp., Canon and Cicso \n     Systems, was amazed to discover how much paper dominates \n     the claims process.\n       ``It was mind-blowing'' said Kimberly Jenkins, the \n     coalition's founder and chairman. ``There were stacks and \n     stacks of files, with rubber bands around them and frayed \n     paper, some dating back to the Civil War.''\n       The effort at the Washington regional office is only part \n     of Thompson's efforts to reduce the paper jam in VA benefits \n     programs. He said the agency also will distribute new \n     software designed to help veterans fill out claims \n     applications.\n       Many of the forms that the VA processes are filled out with \n     varying degrees of completeness on behalf of veterans by \n     local and state government veterans officials and by workers \n     affiliated with the large veterans service organizations, \n     such as the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans. \n     The new software should produce more complete and uniform \n     applications, Thompson said.\n       Although Congress has repeatedly demanded that the VA \n     reduce the amount of time it takes to process claims, \n     Thompson argues that merely dispatching a claim quickly is \n     not good enough. ``You can be fast or you can be slow, but it \n     you don't make the right call, you've done a disservice to \n     the veteran and to the taxpayer,'' he tells the agency's \n     11,200 benefits workers.\n       According to testimony Thompson gave to Congress last year, \n     the VA steadily reduced the amount of time it took to process \n     compensation claims from 213 days in 1994 to 133 days in \n     1997.\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n       But in 1997 the time jumped back up, and it now takes about \n     160 days to process new claims. Thompson blames the increase \n     in part on the increasingly complex types of claims that \n     veterans, such as those from the Persian Gulf War, are \n     filing.\n       The delay, however, is a major challenge for Thompson \n     because the VA has promised Gore's National Performance \n     Review that by fiscal 2000 it hopes to process new \n     compensation claims ``in an average of 92 days.''\n       In the past, VA officials could deal with demands that the \n     agency improve by redefining its work. Thompson recalled with \n     a laugh that his first VA boss told him it used to take his \n     office six months to process new claims. ``Now we have cut \n     that to 180 days,'' the official said.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me read a portion of the article which I think \ntells a lot of the story.\n\n       In the past, VA officials could deal with demands that the \n     agency improve by redefining its work. Thompson [this is \n     Joseph Thompson, at the VA administration] recalled with a \n     laugh that his first VA boss told him it used to take his \n     office six months to process new claims. ``Now we have cut \n     that to 180 days,'' the official said.\n\n  Although that is semihumorous, I do think that kind of an evasion of \nthe problem has characterized the VA for too many years.\n  The article pointed out that the Department of Veterans Affairs made \nsignificant progress in reducing the time it took to process veterans' \nclaims between the years 1994 and 1997, but since then, the processing \ntime has increased from 133 days on average to the current rate of \nabout 160 days. The administration has called for steps to reduce that, \nto get it down to an average response time of 92 days, but I am \nconcerned that the erosion of veterans' benefits, the difficulty that \nour veterans have in seeing those benefits delivered, will weigh \nagainst recruitment and retention of the quality personnel that we need \nin our Armed Forces today.\n  This amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs should conduct a thorough review of the \nprograms, procedures, and policies that govern this processing of \nveterans claims for benefits, and by June 1 of this year report to \nCongress on measures to be taken as a result of such a review.\n  I hope by that time we can identify the measures that we need to \ninclude in the authorization bill and in the appropriations bill to \nassist in this effort.\n  My hope is that the result of this review will be that we can reduce \nthis processing time to bring it down to this 92-day average time. This \nis the administration's goal under the National Performance Review, \nwhich has come up with that estimate of the length of time that can be \nachieved. Obviously, even 92 days is too long. Better training and \ntechnology and staffing would allow us to shorten that even more. But, \nfirst, let's get to the 92 days.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. As far as I know, it is agreeable to all \nconcerned. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this amendment is acceptable on this side. \nI see no need for further debate. We can move to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The amendment (No. 24) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are continuing to make progress. It is \nthe understanding of the Senator from Virginia that Senator McCain is \nen route to the floor for the purpose of making a statement about the \nbill and to present an amendment for himself and Senator Coverdell.\n  I also urge Senator Feingold to consider coming to the floor \nfollowing that. Hopefully, it will be mutually convenient.\n  Seeing no Senator seeking recognition at this time, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 4, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights. Since \nDesert Storm I have been extremely concerned that our military has been \nlosing the cutting edge and their ability to respond to crises or to \nmaintain our superiority throughout the world. We have all watched as \nour Armed Forces became increasingly unable to retain their most \nqualified warfighters, fell short of their recruiting goals, and \nsuffered severe morale problems across mission areas of each service. \nWe heard repeatedly from the Department of Defense that they ``could do \nmore with less'', until last September when the service chiefs came to \nus and confessed a very bleak picture indeed.\n\n  Even as our military has been downsized to a more streamlined force, \nthe Administration has deployed our servicemembers more and more into \nharm's way. With 6,700 troops still in Bosnia, two years after the \noriginal deadline for their withdrawal, we are preparing the ground for \nthe deployment of 4,000 additional soldiers and Marines into Kosovo. \nAnd make no mistake, Kosovo is a considerably more complicated \nsituation than existed in Bosnia. The United States does not support \nthe Kosovar Albanian goal of independence, and so recognizes the right \nof Serbia to maintain control of its territory. At the same time, the \nbrutality and utter ruthlessness with which President Milosevic has and \ncontinues to prosecute his campaign against the Albanian population of \nKosovo demands the international community take steps to compel a \ntermination of his actions. Slobodan Milosevic represents the \npersonification of a kind of tyranny we had hoped we had seen the last \nof with the death of Stalin, yet which continues to appear in places \nlike Uganda, Cambodia, and, in the 1990s, Yugoslavia. He must be \ncurtailed through forceful persuasion, not only because objective \nmorality dictates we do so, but because the Kosovar Albanians deserve \nto know that the more recalcitrant party to the talks and the \noverwhelmingly greater threat to human rights will be held accountable \nfor his actions.\n  Toward that end, the President has made a commitment to dispatch U.S. \nforces to Kosovo. It is with great reluctance that I will not oppose \nthat deployment, as the risks to U.S. national interests should the \nfighting in Kosovo spread beyond its confines could be substantial, \ninvolving our Greek and Turkish allies and other countries threatened \nwith internal dissension. But my support is qualified upon a series of \nmeasures that have yet to emerge as part of the Clinton \nAdministration's overall approach to foreign policy and the role of \nforce in support of that policy. Prior to the deployment, there must be \na clearly established set of criteria for determining the nature \nand duration of the operation. There should be an exit strategy for how \nto withdraw those forces upon the completion of a mission understood by \nour military commanders in the field as well as by the American public \nhere at home, or to extract them should fighting on the scale of that \nwitnessed over the past year resume.\n\n  Under no circumstances should U.S. forces be sent into Kosovo without \nclearly articulated rules of engagement. Peacekeeping missions are \nfraught with uncertainties regarding the identity of combatants within \ncivilian populations. Our military personnel must know that they have \nauthority to respond to threats with the requisite degree of force, and \nwithout having to go through the kind of bureaucratic and political \nnightmare that characterized the war in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. \nThere must be no dual-key arrangement. If this is a NATO operation, \nthen NATO alone should dictate when force is used to compel the parties \nto comply with their obligations. Neither the so-called Contact Group \nnor the United Nations should be permitted to insert itself into \noperational aspects of the mission. If these conditions are met, up \nfront, then I will support the deployment, albeit reluctantly.\n  And, finally, the Administration should take one other step it has \nbeen historically reluctant to take: it should indicate how it intends \nto pay for the operation. It should not, as it\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nhas done in the past, provide vague references to future supplemental \nappropriations bills and then draw the funds from existing, dedicated \naccounts. It should, even before the deployment begins, work with \nCongress to provide the requisite funds without depleting operations \nand maintenance and missile defense accounts.\n  Skepticism, in this regard, is warranted. A historically high rate of \ndeployments combined with a major reduction in overall force structure \nhas caused readiness problems in the military that threaten our ability \nto respond to future contingencies in which vital interests are at \nstake. The Administration ignored this problem for six years, and its \nfiscal year 2000 budget submission is excessively replete with budget \ngimmickry that makes me question its commitment to correct near and \nlong-term readiness problems.\n  Before I leave the issue of Kosovo, let me just state that the events \nthat just took place in France are certainly not the United States' \nfinest hour in diplomacy. The President of the United States said that \nif two--not one but two--deadlines were reached that the United States \nwould act militarily. They allowed those to pass. Somehow now a period \nof 3 weeks is supposed to take place while Kosovar Albanians consult \nwith one another to decide whether or not they will abide by certain \nprovisions of a proposed, as yet unseen peace agreement.\n  Mr. President, the United States squandered a lot of credibility \nduring this period of time, and there were a broad variety of reasons \nwhy that happened, including allowing the conduct of these negotiations \nto be supervised by others rather than the United States. But \nfundamentally there was a misunderstanding of the problem--a \nmisunderstanding of the motivation of the participants, and very \nfrankly there has been a commensurate erosion of U.S. credibility \nduring this entire series of negotiations. I do not know how it is \ngoing to come out, but I think the prospects of further bloodletting \nhave been increased as a result of these negotiations rather than the \nstated goal of them being decreased.\n  It is the growth of those problems that brings us to where we are \ntoday; that bring us to consideration of the legislation before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan bill contains a package of benefits \nfor the Armed Forces that would go a very long way to fixing the \nreadiness problems facing all the services. It combines overall pay \nincreases with retirement incentives, exciting new savings plans, and \neducational benefits. It addresses the issue of service members on food \nstamps. It is focused and balanced, and directly answers the most \npressing needs as stated by the service chiefs and service secretaries.\n  Military pay, by almost all accounts, has fallen considerably behind \ncivilian pay. Arguments can be made as to the precise pay differential, \nand at which pay grades and mission ares it is greatest, but there is \nno credible argument as to whether we need to address the pay gap. This \nis accomplished by the bill's proposed pay raise of 4.8 percent next \nyear and raises based on the employment cost index plus half a percent \nthereafter.\n  The tables that define military base pays for all ranks are archaic \nand badly in need of reform. Middle leadership positions for both \nenlisted and officers have to be rewarding. Few service members \nactually see themselves becoming the Master Sergeant of the Army or the \nChief of Naval Operations. Many, however, do aspire to the rank of Army \nLieutenant Colonel or Navy Senior Chief. Our legislation proposes a \nsweeping reform of the pay tables, rewarding service and promotion \nwithout over-compensating very senior officers.\n  The reduced retirement plan implemented in 1986, known as Redux, is a \nmajor morale issue with service members. Although no one has retired \nunder this plan, it is a constant reminder that military service is \nunder-appreciated. Even if a service member is not affected by this \nplan, it is a morale issue because many of his peers and subordinates \nare. Repealing REDUX across the board is expensive, which is why our \nlegislation gives the service member the choice of switching to the \npre-REDUX plan or remaining with REDUX and taking a $30,000 bonus, \nwhich can in turn be rolled tax-free into the thrift savings plan. Many \nservice members would choose this alternative in response to the needs \nof their family in the near term.\n  Our bill also offers service members an opportunity to save for their \nfuture. The new thrift savings plan established in this bill allows \nmembers to put aside up to 5 percent of their pay and all special \nbonuses, tax free, in a plan that does require them to serve a full \ncareer of 20 years to earn that ``nest egg''. Each service is given the \ndiscretion of matching these funds up to the full 5 percent.\n  The legislation also increases the monthly educational benefit of the \nGI Bill, allows lump sum payments up-front for school tuition, and \ncancels the servicemember's obligation to contribute the $1200 required \nto receive full benefits. Most importantly, it allows the transfer of \nthese benefits to immediate family members, a proposal that will be \nwelcomed with open arms by servicemembers struggling to put children \nthrough college.\n  Lastly, S. 4 includes a provision for a special subsistence allowance \nthat will take almost 10,000 service members off food stamps. This \nbenefit will help the most junior and most needy of our hard-working \nenlisted troops. It will remove the stigma of food stamps from the \nmilitary family and it will do so fairly, without aggravating pay \ndiscrepancies, and in an honorable manner.\n\n  Mr. President, much has been said about this bill that is flat wrong. \nS. 4, as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, is not \nsignificantly more expensive than the Administration's proposal, and, \nin fact, may well be cheaper depending on the number of service members \nwho choose to remain on the reduced retirement plan and take the \n$30,000 bonus. Seemingly subtle differences between S. 4 and the \nAdministration's proposal are not lost on our bright young fighting men \nand women. S. 4 offers half a percent higher pay raise next year, no \ncost-of-living allowance caps, the opportunity for individual thrift \nsvings plans, exciting educational benefits, and a special subsistence \nallowance that will help those most needy junior military families who \ntoday must use food stamps to make ends meet.\n  I must admit that I have great concern about the potential for \n``Christmas tree'' amendments on this bill that inflate its costs well \nbeyond what has been requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and what is \nclearly necessary to restore morals and personnel readiness. However, I \nam hopeful that any excessive or irrelevant provisions added during \nfloor debate will be fairly addressed in confrerence with the House.\n  Mr. President, our bill will have profound and immediate positive \neffects on morale and retention. In fact, I have heard from several \nservice members over the last month who are deferring their decision to \nleave their service based on what we do here in Congress. They will not \nwait forever.\n  Mr. President our military personnel need and deserve our immediate \nattention on this critical issue. These are the men and women who \ndefend our nation day and night, 365 days a year, at home and overseas. \nThey need our support and our appreciation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and to work for a streamlined process that will \nexpeditiously take the benefits of S. 4 to our fighting men and women.\n  I especially thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Warner, who decided last year that this had to be our highest \npriority. He is keenly aware of the problems of morale and retention \nthat affect our men and women in the military, which was so graphically \ndemonstrated last year when the Joint Chiefs came over.\n  Have no doubt, have no doubt, that the men and women in the military \nare watching what we do. I have already heard, as others have heard, \nthis may be delayed; that the administration wants to delay it; some of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle want it delayed; some of \nmy colleagues on this side of the aisle are saying it is too expensive; \nwe should not move forward with it.\n  Mr. President, what is more outrageous than having 11,000 enlisted \nfamilies whom we are asking to defend this Nation existing on food \nstamps? That is an outrage and an insult to all of us as Americans. \nDon't we care enough about these young men and\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nwomen that we are willing to do what we can to get them off food \nstamps, and do it quickly? Aren't we aware that the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff came over and testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee and said the reason we are not keeping these good men and \nwomen, the No. 1 reason, is because of the retirement system?\n  I read editorials in the Washington Post--I think the chairman said \nthere are two--that this is a bad idea; it affects the retirement \nsystem.\n  What in the world does the Washington Post know? I challenge the \neditorial writer of the Washington Post to go out to any of these \nships, any of these Army units, any Marine or Air Force base, and ask \nthem why they are not staying in; ask them why their morale is at a low \nthat we have not seen since the 1970s; ask them why their subordinates \nand their peers are not remaining in the military.\n  They will tell the editorial writers and the skeptics who oppose this \nlegislation, just as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did last \nSeptember, that is the No. 1 issue. You can run all the computer \nstudies, you can run all these numbers you want, you can say this \ndoesn't really matter, but, Mr. President, it does matter to them. It \ndoes matter to them. Ask any of them. And that is what we are trying to \nface here.\n  Yes, I want to join my friend, the chairman, in my concern about so \nmuch being added to this bill. A lot of these are very good things that \nare being added with these amendments, and I am sure they will play \nwell with certain constituencies. But I want to tell my colleagues, I \nhave every confidence that when we go to conference we are going to \nstrip a lot out of this, because we cannot have this thing overloaded \nto the point where it falls of its own weight.\n  The priorities we have are restoring the morale and retaining the men \nand women in the military. I would argue that almost any amendment on \nthis bill which does not directly apply to that objective perhaps \nshould be taken up another day, in the normal course of the \nauthorization bill which we will probably bring to the floor sometime \nthis coming summer. In the meantime, we cannot wait. We cannot wait.\n  I received a letter yesterday from a naval officer who said: If this \nlegislation is passed, then I and many of my colleagues will not make \nthe decision that many of us had already made, and that is to leave the \nmilitary.\n  This is an important issue. We are about to send our young men and \nwomen into harm's way again in Kosovo, whether the majority of my \ncolleagues happen to agree with that decision or not. Are we supposed \nto send them immediately into harm's way and tell them, well, we will \nhave to wait on this issue of giving you a decent pay and allowance and \na decent retirement system, at least in your view that is badly needed, \nor are we going to address those problems immediately?\n\n  I won't go into it further, but there are times when I am reminded of \nthe old Kipling poem about, ``It's Tommy this, an' Tommy that,'' but \nwhen the drums begin to roll, it is, ``Mr. Thompson, if you please.''\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to move forward as rapidly as \npossible with this legislation. Let's narrow down the amendments. Let's \nmove forward with this, with the assurance to all of our colleagues \nthat many of their worthy amendments should be addressed in a proper \nprocess.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Warner, again, along with Senator \nLevin, but especially Senator Warner whose experience and knowledge of \nmen and women in the service is unequaled by any in this body, \nincluding his dedicated service to our Nation in the military, albeit \nit was in the Spanish-American War.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my very, very dear friend and \ncolleague. Our association goes back many, many years when at one time, \nI suppose, you could consider me his boss, but those days when I was \nhis boss ended with his distinguished family of predecessors who have \nserved in our naval service with such distinction for so many \ngenerations.\n  Before the Senator departs, I want to say that earlier, in the \ncontext of the Harkin amendment, I made it very clear to the Senate \nthat that important provision on food stamps in our bill originated \nwith the Senator, and it represents a lot of study and commitment that \nthe Senator has made for a number of years on this issue; it just \ndidn't come to mind yesterday. The Senator has spoken on it many times \nto our committee, to the Senate as a whole, and, indeed, to the Nation \nas a whole. The Senator has addressed the problems associated with food \nstamps.\n  Also, the Senator mentioned the concern he has about NATO. I share a \nnumber of those concerns and particularly the relationship to the \nUnited Nations. I had a meeting early this morning with the Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and later today I will put \ninto the Record some remarks.\n  Of course, I stressed with him our deep concern about Iraq and the \nneed for greater unity of commitment and understanding in the United \nNations on that question. But I also touched on the issue that they are \nentirely separate organizations, the United Nations and NATO, and there \nare times when we work together.\n  And the Senator is quite correct in sending out a clarion call that \nas we approach the 50th anniversary and decisions relating to the \nfuture of NATO, and particularly what we call ``out-of-area missions,'' \nthat again the separability of those two organizations be kept in mind. \nI hope at some point to more formally address that issue. I have been \ndoing some research on it which I would be happy to share with my good \nfriend and colleague.\n  On Kosovo, our committee will be holding a hearing tomorrow, and I \nhope the Senator can schedule time to attend that hearing and, perhaps \nin his opening remarks in the course of the hearing, address some of \nthe very concerns that the Senator stated here today.\n\n  I thank my good friend for bringing to bear on the deliberations of \nthe committee and the Senate as a whole his years of experience in the \nmilitary. It is very important. Without it, we would be at a great \nloss. I thank my colleague.\n  If I might ask one question, there was some thought that the Senator \nwas going to offer an amendment on behalf of Mr. Coverdell. Could the \nSenator clarify that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was my understanding that Senator Coverdell would like \nto do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is going to do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I do want to help him in \ngetting these amendments narrowed down. It is time, I tell all my \ncolleagues, to move forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are ready to move this bill, I say to the Senator, but \nin fairness we have to get some further cost information. The Senator \nfrom Arizona brought up his concern about costs. The Senator is a \nwatchdog on that, and we are beginning to get that from the Department \nof Defense, particularly with the amendment of the Senator from Iowa \nregarding the extension of food stamps to overseas men and women of the \nArmed Forces. I don't know whether the Senator has a view he would like \nto add on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have not had a chance to examine it, but I would like \nto do it.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are keeping the Senator's assistant informed of the \ninformation as it comes over.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, we are proceeding with this bill apace. We understand \nthe Senator from Wisconsin is going to come to the floor shortly for an \namendment. We are anxious to move any others. There are only very few \nleft. I intend to advise the majority leader and the Democratic leader \nthat it is this Senator's objective that this bill can be passed this \nafternoon, final passage.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator seeking recognition at this \ntime, so, therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to address the bill that is \npresently before the Senate. I begin by congratulating the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator \nBingaman, for bringing this bill forward in the sense that it has \naddressed the issue of pay raise for our service people. This is \nimportant. I think we all recognize that our ability to attract in a \nvolunteer service first-class folks who are going to be willing to put \ntheir lives on the line for us requires, in turn, that we pay them a \nfair compensation which reflects the gravity of the job that they are \ndoing and the importance of the job that they are doing.\n  So the pay raise part of this bill, I think, is a very appropriate \nelement of the bill. In addition, I am very supportive of the attempts \nto address the health care issues, not only of the service men and \nwomen, but of their families, which is critical to the quality of life. \nOf course, housing needs of service individuals is also extremely \nimportant.\n  Those elements of the bill, especially the pay and the health care \nparts, are, in my opinion, steps forward, and I congratulate the \nchairman for bringing the bill forward and bringing it so promptly to \nour attention.\n  But I do have serious reservations about some other elements of this \npiece of legislation. There are two areas where I think this \nlegislation either creates a new entitlement, which is inappropriate \nand extraordinarily expensive, or actually is counterproductive to its \noverall purpose.\n  The first place that I have concern is in the area of the new \nentitlement for children of service individuals to receive, basically, \nthe GI bill benefits. This is a significant expansion of the GI \nbenefit. It has always been a superb benefit and a well-used benefit, \nbut it has only been directed at the military personnel. Now it can be \nused by the spouses and by the children of military personnel.\n  The potential costs in the outyears of this are extraordinary because \nit is an entitlement. They really are not recorded in this bill because \nthis bill only has a 5-year window, and when we get out past that 5 \nyears, this number is going to be extremely high, and I think we will \nhave, in my opinion, expanded this benefit in a way that will put great \nstrain on the Defense Department budgets, which I do not think is the \nproper way to approach this.\n  Education is important, but the GI bill has always been focused on \nthe soldier, the sailor, the airman. It is not for the children, unless \nthe soldier, the sailor or airman has died in service.\n  We do have a large panoply of other types of educational initiatives \nin our Government that are available for military children, as well as \nfor all other children, for that matter. It would be better to work an \nadditional benefit for military children through those types of \nalready-existing educational programs which are not entitlement \noriented but are discretionary oriented. In my opinion, for that \nreason, this bill has a very serious flaw.\n  The second problem this bill has, which I really do not understand \nwhy the decision was made to go in this direction, is that it reverses \nthe decision we made back in 1986 to drop the 50 percent back to 40 \npercent, the percentage of pay which a person will get on retirement \nafter 20 years. The reason we did that, and the reason it passed so \noverwhelmingly back in 1986, was because we were trying to retain \npeople in the military service. That is the reason that decision was \nmade. We saw the purpose of that pension structure, 50 percent of pay \nupon 20 years of completion of service, as being, essentially, an \nencouragement to cause people to leave the military, and they were.\n\n  So this bill reinstitutes an initiative which makes no sense if our \npurpose is to attract people and keep them in the military. I \nunderstand this bill also has a $30,000 bonus if you stay in the \nmilitary and take the 40 percent. But the fact is, going back to 50 \npercent is going to cause a lot of good officers and a lot of our more \nsenior enlisted individuals to leave the service, because their age is \nusually in the early forties when they hit that 20 years, sometimes \nyounger, but usually in the early forties, and that is the perfect time \nto go off and find a new career.\n  If you have an incentive that you are going to get 50 percent of your \npay if you go out and find a career, you have a huge incentive to leave \nthe career you are in and go out and find a new career. So it makes \nmuch more sense to stay at the 40 percent. I think it would have made a \ngreat deal more sense in this bill if we said, rather than bumping it \nback up to 50 percent, something to the effect that we are going to \nstay at 40 percent and we are going to give the military, the Defense \nDepartment, the flexibility to take the money we would have used to go \nto 50 percent and use that money to create new programs which will \nencourage people to stay in the service rather than to leave the \nservice.\n  For example, the bonus is in this bill, but certainly there are other \nthings that could be done that would encourage people to stay in the \nservice after 20 years if there were a big pool of resources available \nto the Defense Department to set up educational programs or additional \nbenefit structure programs or even a pay increase incentive program for \npeople who reach that 20 years and are thinking of retiring.\n  Instead of doing that, we are doing the exact opposite. We are saying \nwe are going to bump your percentage up to 50 percent and encourage you \nto leave the military. It makes no sense; plus, it is extremely \nexpensive. It is $2 billion and, once again, when we get outside the 5-\nyear window, the cost is very high.\n  This is an extraordinarily expensive bill. We should not \nunderestimate that it costs $45 million in discretionary money and \n$14.1 billion in new entitlement spending over the 5-year period. If \nyou were to graph it, it would go up probably horizontally on the \nentitlements side because of the new entitlements in the education \naccounts.\n  I think and I am hopeful that when the extraordinarily high quality \nleadership, which this committee has, takes a look at this bill again \nas it heads into conference, they will take a look at these two items, \nbecause these two items, in my opinion, create serious flaws in a bill \nthat otherwise is very positive and is very appropriate.\n  It seems to me that the first one is an expansion of the entitlement, \nwhich is inappropriate, and the 50 percent, which is counterproductive \nto the purposes of the bill. It would be logical if we go back and \nvisit both of those items.\n  I do have an amendment that I would be willing to offer on the second \none, the 50 percent. I am hopeful that this committee, which is so well \nled--and I do not want to slow up the bill because I think it is a \nbill, I understand, that the committee wants to move--I am hopeful the \ncommittee will take a hard look at this, and if they don't, obviously, \nI might have to resort to the amendment. But, hopefully, there will be \nan attempt to take a look at this, at least in the conference stage so \nwe can address what I think are the two flaws in this bill.\n  I thank the President for his time, and yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his remarks. He is a keen \nobserver of the budget process around here. And I recognize that we are \ngoing to have to take a look at some of these options. But it is going \nto send a strong message. And I think it is important.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  I wish to advise the Chair and all Senators that we are about to get \nsome other amendments accepted here very quickly. And if we can accept \nabout four amendments, I would hope maybe we can arrange for a break \nhere at the noon hour, and then resume early in the afternoon. But that \nis a decision that is up to the leadership at this time.\n  Mr. President, on the amendments, Senator Jeffords is on his way to \nthe floor to address two of the three he has. The first one is in \nrelation to what we call a lump-sum payment. And I am of the opinion \nthat the committee is going to accept that. And the second is an \nextended window of eligibility; that is whereby a person in the service \nhas a period of time, after they depart the service--somewhat extended \nnow--within which to make certain decisions\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nregarding their eligibility under the various GI bill provisions. So I \nhope that we can accept those two.\n  Senator Feingold has an amendment. And I think momentarily my \ncolleague, the joint manager of the bill, will address that. That \nleaves the amendment from the Senator from Iowa, the Harkin amendment. \nAnd I think we are very close to closure on that. It is being redrafted \nin a manner in which I think it can be accepted.\n  Senator?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 37, United States Code, to ensure equitable \n   treatment of members of the National Guard and the other reserve \n components of the United States with regard to eligibility to receive \n                      special duty assignment pay)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could, on behalf of Senator Feingold, who is \nunable to be here because he is in a committee hearing, to offer this \namendment on his behalf. I send it to the desk. This amendment would \ncorrect special duty assignment pay inequities between the Reserve \ncomponents and their active duty counterparts.\n  I understand this is acceptable to you, and the amendment will be \naccepted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 25.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the reading of the \namendment is dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. ENTITLEMENT OF RESERVES NOT ON ACTIVE DUTY TO \n                   RECEIVE SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Section 307(a) of title 37, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after ``is entitled to basic \n     pay'' in the first sentence the following: ``, or is entitled \n     to compensation under section 206 of this title in the case \n     of a member of a reserve component not on active duty,''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first month that \n     begins on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwill restore a measure of pay equity for our nation's Guardsmen and \nReservists. The men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are \ncornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure and \ndeserve more than a pat on the back.\n  Mr. President, as I'm certain my colleagues are well aware, the Guard \nand Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, including recent \nand on-going missions to Iraq and Bosnia. According to statements by \nDoD officials, guardsmen and reservists will continue to play an \nincreasingly important role in national defense strategy. The National \nGuard and Reserves deserve the full support they need to carry out \ntheir duties.\n  National Guard and Reserve members are increasingly relied upon to \nshoulder more of the burden of military operations. We need to \ncompensate our citizen-soldiers for this increasing reliance on the \nReserve forces. Mr. President, this boils down to an issue of fairness.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would correct special duty assignment pay \ninequities between the Reserve components of our armed forces and their \nactive duty counterparts. These inequities should be corrected to take \ninto account the National Guard and Reserves' increased role in our \nnational security, especially on the front lines. Given the increased \nuse of the Reserve components and DoD's increased reliance on them, \nReservists deserve fair pay. My amendment provides that a Reservist who \nis entitled to basic pay and is performing special duty be paid special \nduty assignment pay.\n  Mr. President, right now, Reservists are getting shortchanged despite \nthe vital role they play in our national defense. The special duty \nassignment pay program ensures readiness by compensating specific \nsoldiers who are assigned to duty positions that demand special \ntraining and extraordinary effort to maintain a level of satisfactory \nperformance. The program, as it stands now, effectively reduces the \nability of the National Guard and Reserve to retain highly dedicated \nand specialized soldiers.\n  The special duty assignment pay program provides an additional \nmonthly financial incentive paid to enlisted soldiers and airmen who \nare required to perform extremely demanding duties that require an \nunusual degree of responsibility. These special duty assignments \ninclude certain command sergeants major, guidance counselors, retention \nnon-commissioned officers (NCO's), drill sergeants, and members of the \nSpecial Forces. These soldiers, however, do not receive special duty \nassignment pay while in an IDT status (drill weekends).\n  Between fiscal years 1998 and 1999, spending for the program was cut \nby $1.6 million, which has placed a fiscal restraint on the number of \npersonnel the Army National Guard is able to provide for under this \nprogram. These soldiers deserve better.\n  Mr. President, these differences in pay and benefits are particularly \ndisturbing since National Guard and Reserve members give up their \ncivilian salaries during the time they are called up or volunteer for \nactive duty.\n  As I'm sure all my colleagues have heard, the President will propose \nan enormous boost in defense spending over the next six years; an \nincrease of $12 billion for fiscal year 2000 and about $110 billion \nover the next six years. I have tremendous reservations about spending \nhikes of this magnitude, but have no such reservations about supporting \nthis nation's citizen-soldiers in this small but important way. The \nNational Guard and Reserve deserve pay and benefit equity and that \nmeans paying them what they're worth.\n  Mr. President, according to the National Guard, shortfalls in the \noperations and maintenance account compromise the Guard's readiness \nlevels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. Failing to \nfully support these vital areas will have both direct and indirect \neffects. The shortfall puts the Guard's personnel, schools, training, \nfull-time support, and retention and recruitment at risk. Perhaps more \nimportantly, however, it erodes the morale of our citizen-soldiers.\n  Over these past years, the Administration has increasingly called on \nthe Guard and Reserves to handle wider-ranging tasks, while \nsimultaneously offering defense budgets with shortfalls of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. These shortfalls have increasingly greater effect \ngiven the guard and reserves' increased operations burdens. This is a \nresult of new missions, increased deployments, and training \nrequirements.\n  Earlier this year, Charles Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense \nfor reserve affairs, presented DoD's position with regard to the \ndepartment's working relationship with the National Guard and Reserve. \nHe stated that all branches of the military reserves will be called \nupon more frequently as the nation pares back the number of soldiers on \nactive duty. This has clearly been DoD's policy for the past few years, \nbut Mr. Cragin went a little further by stating that the reserve units \ncan no longer be considered ``weekend warriors'' but primary components \nof national defense.\n  Mr. President, in the past, DoD viewed the armed forces as a two-\npronged system, with active-duty troops being the primary prong, \nreinforced by the Reserve component. That strategy has changed with the \ndownsizing of active forces. Defense officials now see reserves as part \nof the ``total force'' of the military.\n  The National Guard and Reserves will be called more frequently to \nactive duty for domestic support roles and abroad in various peace-\nkeeping efforts. They will also be vital players on special teams \ntrained to deal with weapons of mass destruction deployed within our \nown borders. According to many military experts, this represents a more \nsalient threat to the United States than the threat of a ballistic \nmissile attack that many of my colleagues have spent so much time \naddressing.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to see some of these \nsoldiers off as they embarked on these missions and have welcomed them \nhome upon their return, and I have been struck by\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nthe courage and professionalism they display. Guardsmen and Reservists \nhave been vital on overseas missions, and here at home. In Wisconsin, \nthe State Guard provides vital support during state emergencies, \nincluding floods, ice storms, and train derailments.\n  Mr. President, we have a duty to honor the service of our National \nGuardsmen and Reservists. One way to do that is to equitably compensate \nthem for their service. I hope my colleagues agree that our citizen-\nsoldiers serve an invaluable role in our national defense, and their \npaychecks should reflect their contribution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 25) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of deliberations on the \nfloor, there have been a number of amendments to extend benefits to \nGuard and Reserve forces. And momentarily we will be considering \nadditional amendments. We are operating under a total force concept. I \nremember very well when I was in the Department of Defense working for \nthen-Secretary Melvin Laird. He really started the concept of what we \ncall ``total force.''\n  Yes, we have Reserve and Guard forces active, but it is a total force \nin a time of need. There have been extraordinary contributions by \nReserve and Guard officers, men and women, in the past decade, \nparticularly in connection with the Bosnia deployments.\n  For example, the air guard have flown, I think, approximately half of \nthe missions involved, and I would like for the Record to get the exact \nfigure on that during that period. They are still flying. Each one of \nus here in the Senate received notice of a detachment from our State \nthat is now being deployed into that theater of operations to help an \nactive duty group in the performance of their duties and perhaps even \nto relieve an active duty group so they could go back either to the \ncontinental United States or to their stations in Europe. So it is \nreally one total force now.\n  I know that Senators are concerned about the dollars involved in \nthese various pay proposals. For example, this extended window of \neligibility--that is only going to cost $5 to $10 million. That is a \nrelatively small sum to accommodate these young people as they return \nfrom a period of active duty and then have to sit down and sort out \ntheir lives and figure out when they want to take on their education. \nWhat are their family responsibilities? Perhaps they want to try a job \nbefore they go back to get additional schooling. All of these things is \na component, is going to help, in my judgment, to not only induce young \npeople to come in, in the front end, but to keep those in uniform now \nremaining on active duty so the taxpayer in America can save the \nenormity of the cost associated with training a new service person.\n  In the pilot training it goes into the multimillions of dollars to \ntrain these individuals to operate the high-performance aircraft, both \nfixed and rotary wing, that we have today. So bear with us. Those of us \nwho are on the committee, I think, have a great appreciation not only \nfor the budgetary considerations, but for the need to make these \nimprovements at this time. It is absolutely essential that we do so, \nMr. President.\n  I really appreciate the support I have gotten, particularly from the \nleadership on both sides here, and Members of the Senate who have come \nup to me. While they have concerns about the budgetary considerations, \nthey know, bottom line, that we have to fix this personnel situation. \nThere is no sense in spending millions and millions--indeed billions--\nof dollars to buy the new aircraft and ships if we do not have the \npersonnel to operate them.\n  The ships of the U.S. Navy now on deployment in the gulf region are \nundermanned because of the inability to retain the skilled personnel. \nWe simply cannot ask those aboard the ship to accept the additional \nrisk and overtime hours aboard that ship without trying to do \neverything we can back here in the Congress of the United States to \nstraighten out this problem.\n  Mr. President, I think it is just moments before Senator Jeffords \nappears on the floor. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 12 and Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have long been a strong advocate for a \nwell-educated American work-force. Vermont's quality of life is related \nclosely to the educational opportunities available to her citizens. \nEducation is a cornerstone of our healthy economy. These same notions \napply with similar effect to our men and women in the military. Modern, \ntechnologically advanced systems and complex missions depend on the \nskills and wisdom of well-educated personnel. S. 4 modestly enhances \nthe educational opportunities for our men and women on active duty. It \nshould do the same for the members of our Guard and Reserve.\n  This bill is appropriately named ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and \nMarines' Bill of Rights.'' It is appropriate because use of the term \n``Bill of Rights'' invariably suggests the concepts of fairness and \nequity.\n  Perhaps Secretary of Defense William Cohen had this in the back of \nhis mind in September of 1997 when he instructed the Department of \nDefense to eliminate ``all residual barriers, structural and cultural'' \nto effective integration of the Guard, Reserve and Active Components \ninto a ``seamless Total Force.'' Precisely one year later his Deputy, \nJohn Hamre, looked back to that day and observed:\n\n       We have made great progress integrating our active and \n     Reserve forces into one team, trained and ready for the 21st \n     century. Our military leaders are getting the message. \n     Structural and cultural barriers that reduce readiness and \n     impede interoperability between active and Reserve personnel \n     are gradually being eliminated. We must now assess the \n     progress we have made, acknowledge those barriers to \n     integration that still exist, and, most importantly, set our \n     plans into motion.\n\n  If these wise words are to have full effect we must work to rectify \nan oversight in S. 4, which, as written, enhances educational benefits \nfor a portion of our seamless Total Force but neglects the remainder. \nConsequently, to promote parity among all components of our military \nSenator Landrieu and I are offering the following two amendments:\n  The First: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve the ability to \naccelerate payments of educational assistance in the same manner \ncurrently provided in S. 4 to the Active Duty military.\n  The Second: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve who have served at \nleast ten years in the Selected Reserve, an eligibility period of five \nyears after separation from the military to use their entitlement to \neducational benefits. (Active duty military members have a ten year \nperiod.)\n  Just a few weeks ago, four Reserve Component members lost their lives \nwhen their KC-135 went down in Germany while flying active duty \nmissions for the Air Force. Death did not discriminate between Active \nand Reserve Components. Nor should S. 4.\n  The opportunity to face this ultimate risk will only increase as we \nplace greater demands on our Guard and Reserve units to participate in \nour global missions. Since Operation Desert Storm the pace of \noperations has swelled by more than 300% for the Guard alone and is \nwidely expected to climb higher.\n  We all know the value of the Guard and Reserve for missions close to \nhome. In Vermont they saved our citizens from the drastic effects of \nrecord setting ice storms last winter. Recently, other units helped \nwith hurricanes in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. They \nassist our citizens during droughts and blizzards. They enrich our \ncommunities with Youth Challenge programs and they conduct an ongoing \nwar on drugs. Just last year we added protection of the U.S. from \nweapons of mass destruction to that list, and the list keeps growing.\n  It is now time to bring their educational benefits in balance.\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\n  As many of you know, I believe in the value of life-long learning to \nour society. Access to continuing education has become an essential \ncomponent to one's advancement through all stages of modern careers. S. \n4 modestly improves this access for our brave men and women on active \nduty. It should do the same for our Guard and Reserves.\n  I urge my colleagues to help bring parity, equity and fairness to the \neducational opportunities available to all components of our military. \nThe Guard and Reserve have been called upon increasingly to contribute \nto the Total Force. They face similar challenges to recruiting and \nretention. They should have similar access to educational \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Cleland, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes amendments \n     numbered 12 and 13 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ANNUAL REPORT ON EFFECTS OF INITIATIVES ON \n                   RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I spoke with Senator Jeffords earlier \nabout being added as a cosponsor to both amendments 12 and 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator will be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendments en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 12 and 13) were agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, I have indicated that this Senator would not accept \nthe question of the transfer of amendment, the third amendment. Do I \nunderstand the Senator will not present that amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct, I will not offer that amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That completes all of the amendments of the Senator from \nVermont?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That does, and I appreciate your cooperation as well as \nthe cooperation your staff has shown in allowing us to proceed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will make a brief comment. First, I thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont for bringing these two important amendments for our Guard \nand Reserve, and I thank the chairman for accepting them.\n  I will make, just for the Record, a comment about the amendment that \nwe are unable to accept because of its fairly high cost--stipulated to \nbe about $900 million.\n  My staff has informed me and the staff for the committee on our side \nthat this seems to be a very, very important issue to the rank and \nfile. One of the more popular aspects of our bill is the fact that we \nare now going to allow, at some additional cost, but I, frankly, \nbelieve, and I think most Members on both sides believe, it is well \nworth it to allow this Montgomery GI bill to be transferred to spouses \nand children--perhaps the most important incentive for people to remain \nin the military and to be active participants for a longer period of \ntime. I hope we will consider perhaps next year, if not this year, \nextending the same benefits to the Guard and Reserve.\n\n  The retention issues are somewhat different, but let me say that the \nGuard and Reserve are very, very important components to our military \nforces as we redesign and reorganize our military and depend more on \nthe Guard and Reserve to step in, particularly in terms of our \npeacekeeping missions.\n  It is very important that we maintain good and adequate benefits for \nthe Guard and Reserve. So while we cannot accept that amendment at this \ntime, I\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nwanted to put this statement in the Record and ask our chairman to \nperhaps consider next year that we offer the same benefits to our Guard \nand Reserve unit.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I, likewise, would like to see this. But I \nhave to do what I have to do to keep the cost of this bill down. It is \nvery large at this time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Next year, we will take a fresh look. Momentarily, I will \nadvise the Senate on the balance of the amendments that the managers \nknow of. Hopefully, we can get to final passage very early this \nafternoon.\n  We still have the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and \nthat is, I am certain, going to be accepted on both sides. It relates \nto the costs. I think we will have a good estimate of the costs now \ncoming in from the Department of Defense before we ask for passage of \nthat amendment.\n  Senator Coverdell has an important amendment--a sense of the Senate--\nto codify some extension of tax filing deadlines for men and women of \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Mr. Levin may have an amendment, which is sort of generic to the \nentire bill, is my understanding. There is some indication that the \nSenator from Florida may wish to address an amendment. I have looked at \nit, and as soon as I have the opportunity to speak with him, I will \nexpress my strong concerns regarding that amendment on this bill. I \nwill withhold those comments for now.\n  Is the Senator finished?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1847-6", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I have not spoken on the bill pending before \nus, so if I need to have time yielded, I would like to speak on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' \nBill of Rights Act of 1999 is a much needed first step in fixing the \nproblems of a military that I fear has been in a death spiral, quite \nfrankly, after continued years of underfunding by the two previous \nadministrations, both this one and the previous one. It started some 10 \nyears ago, slowly, in the aftermath of the wall coming down and the \nSoviet Union being broken apart. But it has been a continuing slow \nprocess that has really started having a profound impact.\n  Now, I must say we finally got the title correct--Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, because I referred to \nit early on as the Soldiers' Bill of Rights, and I quickly heard from \nthe marines and the airmen and the others that it is for all of our \nmilitary personnel. I think this is a very important bill. It addresses \nkey areas that really have negative effects on our military and on \nretention.\n  And so right up front I congratulate the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Warner, from the great Commonwealth of Virginia, for his \nleadership. This is a perfect example of one bill that, while we were \ninvolved in the impeachment process, we had committees at work having \nhearings, developing legislation and, yes, in fact reporting bills. \nThis bill was actually reported, I think, about 3 weeks ago, and a lot \nof thought has been given to it. I know it has bipartisan support. I \nknow that there are Senators, such as the Senator from Georgia, who \nhave had input in this legislation. Senator Allard, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee has been involved; Senator Roberts has been very \nsupportive of this concept, so I want to commend them all.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator McCain.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator McCain obviously has been involved, and Senator \nThurmond. All of the Armed Services Committee members, and members that \nare not on the Armed Services Committee, have been following this very \nclosely.\n  I know there are some who say, well, maybe we should have had more \nhearings or perhaps in some areas it goes too far. I just have to say I \ndon't agree with that.\n  Budget considerations are important, always important. Finally, we \nhave gotten to a balanced budget, perhaps to the point where we will \nhave some surplus, and we want to keep it that way. We want to keep \nmoving in that direction. We want to have enough of a surplus that we \ncan return some of the overtax back to the people who earned that \nmoney, but we must keep our military strong. If we do not raise the pay \nfor our military men and women, they will not come to the military. \nThey will not volunteer. If we don't fix their pension problems, they \nwill not stay; they will leave. The pilots will leave, but even more \ndangerously the chiefs will leave and the sergeant majors and the \nmaster sergeants, the people who really make the military do its job, \nnot to diminish the administration and the generals or the newly \nenlisted. But those people who have been in there 10, 15 years, they \nare going to look at this pension system as it now stands, and they are \ngoing to say, It is not worth it; I can't do it to my family, and they \nwill get on out.\n  This needs to be done. In my opinion, it is overdue. And at a time \nwhen we are asking more and more of our military men and women with \nless and less to do the job, it would be folly--in fact, it would be \ninsanity--for us not to do this bill and do it now. We can work on some \nof the budget problems as we go along, but there is one thing that \ntakes even a higher priority, in my opinion, than budgets, and that is \nthe defense of our country. If we don't have good military men and \nwomen, good equipment, if they can't train properly, they are not going \nto be able to fulfill these missions that we have sent them off \non around the world--the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and \nthen, of course, we may be faced with difficult situations involving \nIran and North Korea, Kosovo. Who knows. And so this bill will begin \ndoing some of the things that should be done.\n\n  It authorizes a 4.8-percent military pay raise. That seems to me to \nbe the minimum we should do for them. It starts closing the 13.5-\npercent gap between military pay and the private sector wages. It \nreforms the military pay\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\ntables effective July 1, 2000, by targeting midcareer commissioned and \nnoncommissioned officers, skilled specialists considering a move from \nthe military ranks and civilian life after years of training and \ninvestment by this country into the military.\n  Very importantly, I think it revises the military retirement system \nproviding the option upon reaching 15 years of service of reverting to \nthe pre-1986 plan which provided a 50-percent base multiplier and no \ncost-of-living allowance, COLA caps, or receiving a one-time $30,000 \nbonus and remaining under the REDUX plan.\n  Perhaps you think a 50-percent base multiplier is too high. I don't. \nI don't. What is our own retirement percentage here in the Congress? \nAnd so I think this is a solution that will be very important and will \nbe welcomed by our military men and women.\n  It authorizes active duty military personnel to participate in the \nThrift Savings Plan. Once again, we do. Why shouldn't they be able to \ndo that? It encourages savings so that when they do get out, if they \ndon't have enough from their pension, at least they will have this \nlittle Thrift Savings that they have benefited from.\n  It has a special subsistence allowance for service members of the \ngrade E-5, the ones I was referring to a while ago, and below who \ndemonstrate the need for food stamps to support their families. People \nin America don't believe this. When I go around and I talk to \nconstituents in my own State and tell them that once again we have the \nsituation where we have E-5s and below in the military who are now \nhaving to go to food stamps, they don't believe it. They don't want to \nbelieve it. They want us to do something about that.\n  This allowance would provide $180 a month and remove thousands of \nenlisted families from the food stamp rolls. It revises benefits under \nthe G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery GI bill, eliminating the $1,200 \ncontribution required of members who participate in this program, and \nother benefits. And we will have to look carefully at the cost and how \nthat is going to be handled. But I think the GI bill, when we got it \nback in place, meant an awful lot to our military men and women. And \nwhen we look at the past half century in this country, talk to the \npeople who really turned this country into the strength or the power \nthat it is, it was so many of those World War II veterans who came out, \nsuch as the distinguished Senator here from the Commonwealth of \nVirginia----\n  Mr. WARNER. The GI bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. The GI bill--went to college, got an education and went out \nand built America. That is a great investment. Any time you encourage \npeople, young people, or military retirees to go get an education, you \nget your money back manyfold over.\n  This bill requires an annual report on the impact of these programs \non recruitment and retention. We don't want to just do it for the sake \nof doing it. We have a purpose here. We want to help these military men \nand women. We want to keep them in the military.\n  I wrote a letter last summer expressing my great concern about the \nsituation and how dangerous I thought the military readiness was \nbecoming. I wrote that letter to the President. And yet we have \ncontinued to have increased deployments with undermanned units, spare \nparts shortages, recruiting shortfalls, rising accident rates, and a \nmass exodus of pilots in particular.\n  So, I was expressing that concern, and hopefully it looks like it has \nhad some impact. Because, while it really does not amount to very much, \nthe administration has indicated they are willing to go along with some \nimprovements, and I hope and believe the President will sign this bill \nwhen it gets to his desk.\n  Also, a hearing that was held last fall, on September 29, before the \nArmed Services Committee. The distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond at that time, had those hearings. \nThe Chiefs came in and they acknowledged it. They gave the stories that \nreally exist. They talked about the readiness shortfalls, about us \nhaving to beg and borrow for spare parts, and recruitment problems. So \nthey signaled clearly that we had to do something.\n  I am not going to give the statistics about what is happening for the \nArmy. They are not meeting their recruiting goals. In my own State we \nhave one of the proudest National Guard activities anywhere in the \ncountry, I am sure, yet now the Mississippi National Guard is having to \nadvertise in order to get the recruits into the Mississippi National \nGuard.\n  We have pilot shortages. We have ships steaming out--I believe it was \nthe George Washington that steamed out to the Persian Gulf last May \nalmost 1,000 sailors short of the 6,000 crew and air group personnel \nthat are normally on board. We cannot allow these types of situations \nto continue.\n  In a letter to Senator Thurmond, as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I also expressed these concerns. A series of hearings on \nmilitary readiness were undertaken and quickly uncovered the range of \nproblems that the military struggled to contain in an environment of \naustere budgets. On September 29, we witnessed an unprecedented baring \nof the collective defense soul, in which every member of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff detailed alarming anecdotes about readiness shortfalls, \nabout having to take from readiness and modernization accounts to fund \nan expanding operational role, the difficulties of recruiting in the \npresent environment, and about the disillusionment and exodus of \nservicemembers after years of perceived nonsupport.\n  In an all-volunteer force, if people don't want the job, you have a \nproblem. This country cannot attract, and retain, the people we need to \nman our military today. Specifically:\n  The Army reduced fiscal last year's recruiting goal by 12,000, and \nwas still short of its new goal continuing an under manning condition \nthat has existed since 1993. Not only is quantity suffering, but \nquality also--the Army is well below its 84 percent High School \ngraduate benchmark.\n  As I said, the Navy was thousands short of its recruiting target, and \nthe aircraft carrier George Washington deployed to the Persian Gulf \nlast May was ``almost 1,000 sailors short of the nearly 6,000 crew and \nair group personnel that it normally has.''\n  Retention problems also are occurring in our Officer corps. The Air \nForce is suffering what some call a ``hemorrhaging'' of its pilot \ncorps. Air Force pilot shortages will grow to 2341 by fiscal year 2002. \nArmy pilot inventory is approximately 15 percent short of total \nrequirements. Navy Surface Warfare Officer Department Head tours have \nbeen extended from 36 to 44 months due to retention shortfalls.\n  While many would attribute the current manning problems to the robust \neconomy, I believe the situation is much more complex. We have had 3 \ndifferent reviews of our national security strategy since the end of \nthe cold war, and the end result of all these reviews has been to \nreduce the size of the force to where it is now--at its lowest level \nsince before the Korean war. These reductions have not been carried out \nwith a similar reduction in the number of missions and deployments. All \nof the missions performed during the cold war, be they the stationing \nof forces in Europe or Asia, or routine deployments at sea, are still \nbeing performed while we have had a significant growth in contingency \noperations.\n  While personnel tempo has increased significantly the pay and \nbenefits to our men and women in uniform have decreased. The pay \ndifferential between the private sector and our military has continued \nto grow--now at 13.5 percent; there are three different retirement \nsystems currently in place with each one providing less than the \nprevious one; and the medical system does not provide medical benefits \nto all that have earned them.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. military is out of balance. We need to get \nthe missions, manning, equipping, pay and benefits synchronized to \nenable us to continue with a quality force into the 21st century.\n  Today we have a very bright, talented all-volunteer force, yet we \ncannot attract the number of individuals required to adequately support \nour Armed Forces. Why? We are out of balance. Too few people are being \nasked to do more, and spend longer periods of time away from their \nfamilies.\n  We also are mortgaging our future modernization efforts to keep \nreadiness up. For example: ten years ago we talked about a 600-ship \nNavy. Today we are building only 6 to 7 ships per year\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nor enough to keep 150 ships alive. Flying hours, steaming hours, \nmaintenance, and spare parts are all under continued stress because of \ncontinued deployments.\n  It all boils down to the fact that both the personnel and equipment \nare in a downward spiral. Our quality people are leaving and they are \nnot being replaced. Similarly, the un-replaced worn out equipment is \njust becoming more worn out. The longer this spiral continues, the \nworse it becomes.\n  The problem can be fixed, but the solutions will not be easy and \nwithout pain.\n  First, it requires more discipline on part of the administration and \nthe Congress--this country cannot continue sending our military men and \nwomen around the world on every humanitarian/peacekeeping mission--just \nbecause someone in the administration thinks it is a good idea. We have \nto change our approach to using the military as the world's police \nforce. This is a philosophical problem.\n  Remember, the reason we have a military is to defend our interests \naround the world--by force of arms, if necessary. Right now, we are \nsending our military to the four corners of the globe for noble--but \nwrong--reasons. Passing out food and blankets is fine and good. But \nwhat if it costs us the ability to fight and defend our interests in \nplaces where it really counts?\n  In addition to being more disciplined, we need to add money to the \ndefense top line for pay, training, operations, and equipment. In other \nwords, we need a better balance between the missions, the manpower, the \nequipment and the defense budget than what we have today.\n  Congress has done--and continues to do--what we can to help solve the \nproblem. The United States is the leader of the world--freedom-wise, \neconomically, and militarily. Our military underwrites all the rest. My \nconcern is that we are underestimating the need for our Armed Forces in \ntoday's world and that we are not preparing to deter in tomorrow's \nworld. The answer: increase defense spending, balance short-term needs \nwith long-term investment, and tune today's spending to the needs of \nthe deploying forces. It is essential that we maintain our preeminent \nmilitary, however, I see it threatened by the current downward spiral \nin morale, personnel, and equipment that I have described.\n  When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, their highest \npriority was the federal government's role in maintaining a strong \nnational defense. They did not put a price tag on America's national \nsecurity. They knew there was no way to predict future threats and \nnational trends to our country's security.\n  If you look back at the history of our country, we have drastically \nreduced the size and strength of our military following a conflict. \nEach time we cut our defense, another trouble spot emerged and we had \nto build up to meet the challenge. Unfortunately, we are repeating the \npast, but this time it is happening on our watch.\n  So today, I am asking my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and \nthe administration, to join me in passing S. 4 quickly. Lets joint \ntogether and send our men and women in uniform a message that we care \nabout them. Lets joint together and have S. 4 ready for the President's \nsignature on Memorial Day.\n  This bill represents substantive efforts to increase military \nbenefits to help the recruitment, retention, and ultimately readiness \nproblems faced by the military. I commend Senator Warner, the new \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, for holding his first hearing \non this very important subject. The ongoing efforts by Senators Roberts \nand McCain reflect much of the foundation of this bill. And Senator \nAllard, the newly named chairman of the Armed Services Personnel \nSubcommittee, has shown his commitment to our uniformed servicemembers \nthrough his strong support. Senator Cleland of Georgia also has \nprovided substantive changes to this bill to make it better.\n  I've said it earlier and the Joint Chiefs have said it at the \nReadiness hearings--People form the backbone of the military. We must \ntake care of them first. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 is the first step that the 106th \nCongress can take to achieving this goal.\n  So, I just wanted to come to the floor and take advantage of this \nopportunity to express my concern, to express my support for this \nlegislation. I think this is the right way to begin this year as we \nlook to the issues we want to address, to start off by making sure we \nare going to have adequate pay for our military men and women, and an \nadequate pension system, and begin to reduce the readiness shortfall. I \nthink this is the proper thing to do.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the distinguished leader leaves the floor, I ask \nunanimous consent that letter to which he referred be appended to the \nportion that the Senator is putting into the Record. That was the \nengine that is taking this train over the mountain. It was way back \nlast summer I expressed to him on behalf of the committee, and indeed \nthe Senate, thanks for the leadership the Senator has given from day \none on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Office of the President, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am very concerned about the growing \n     inability of our country to man the uniformed services. Not \n     only is there difficulty in recruiting, but also in our \n     ability to retain key personnel. The Army has reduced this \n     year's recruiting mission by 12,000, which will continue an \n     undermanning condition that has existed since 1993; the Navy \n     has recently announced that it will fall 7,200 short of their \n     recruiting target, and on a recent deployment the aircraft \n     carrier George Washington was short over 1,000 sailors; and \n     the Air Force is suffering what some called a \n     ``hemorrhaging'' of its pilot corps.\n       While many would attribute the current manning problems to \n     the robust economy, I believe the situation is much more \n     complex. We have had three different reviews of our national \n     strategy since the end of the Cold War, and the end result of \n     all these reviews has been to reduce the size of the force to \n     where it is now, its lowest level since before the Korean \n     War. These reductions have not been balanced out with a \n     similar reduction in the number of missions and deployments. \n     All of the missions performed during the Cold War, be they \n     the stationing of forces in Europe or Asia, or routine \n     deployments at sea, are still being performed while we have \n     had a significant growth in Contingency Operations.\n       While Personnel Tempo has increased significantly, the pay \n     and benefits to our men and women in uniform have decreased. \n     The pay differential between the private sector and our \n     military has continued to grow, there are three different \n     retirement systems currently in place with each one providing \n     less than the previous one, and the medical system does not \n     provide medical benefits to all that have earned them.\n       Mr. President, while I believe that more money needs to be \n     allocated to our National Defense, it needs to be done \n     prudently. We need to get the missions, manning, equipping, \n     and pay and benefits synchronized to enable us to continue \n     with a quality force into the 21st century. I urge you to \n     make this a high priority of your fiscal year 2000 budget \n     request.\n       With kind regards and best wishes, I remain\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Trent Lott.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think, with the concurrence of the distinguished \nranking member, we can represent to the majority leader and Democratic \nleader we will have final passage here within a matter of a few hours, \nI hope.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is good news.\n  I might conclude by saying I had a good discussion late yesterday \nafternoon with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and he joined me \nin expressing the feeling this is going to have very broad bipartisan \nsupport. I am glad to hear that and I hope we can get it quickly \nthrough the other body and to the President for his signature. Thank \nyou for your leadership, Senator Warner, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to have this \nopportunity with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Levin, Allard, and \nothers--to support S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. I strongly agree that this bill \nrepresents an excellent step toward providing the men and women of the \nmilitary a clear signal that we the people of the United States and we \nthe\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nmembers of the Congress of the United States value their contributions, \nunderstand their needs and concerns, and understand our obligations to \nprovide for those who have answered the calling to defend our Nation.\n  The signal that we send to the people in the military and to the \npeople of the United States should be one of hope and opportunity, and \none that understands the critical needs of military members and their \nfamilies. Twenty-five years ago Americans opted to end the draft and to \nestablish an all-volunteer military force to provide for our national \nsecurity. That policy carried with it a requirement that we invest the \nneeded resources to bring into existence a competent and professional \nmilitary. Currently, all services are having various but alarming \ndifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified individuals. \nSeasoned, well-qualified personnel are leaving in disturbing numbers. \nSpecifically, the Navy is not making its recruiting goals. The Army \ncites pay and retirement, and overall quality of life as three of the \ntop four reasons soldiers are leaving. For the first time the Air Force \nis not expecting to make its re-enlistment goals, and the Air Force is \ncurrently 850 pilots short. The Marine Corps is hampered by inadequate \nfunding of the pay and retirement and quality of life accounts in \nmeeting its readiness and modernizing needs. All services, including \nthe Guard and Reserve Components, are experiencing similar recruiting \nand retention problems. These shortfalls must be addressed if our \nNation is to continue to have a highly capable, cutting edge military \nforce.\n  In fact, if we do not address these critical needs correctly, we may \nwell have missed our chance to properly provide for our National \nDefense in the 21st Century.\n  In light of our recent successful operations around the world, in the \nPersian Gulf and elsewhere, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that \nwe continue to recruit, train and retain the best of America to serve \nin our armed forces, which is the goal of this legislation. Equally \nimportant, this bill, for the first time in a long time, addresses the \nimmediate family members of our brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and \nMarines. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights \nAct of 1999 addresses the concerns of Secretary of Defense Cohen, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and Congress regarding recruiting a strong, \nviable military force for the 21st Century. It also significantly \nassists in retaining the right military personnel for the 21st Century. \nIf we fail today to address these key issues, now when we have the \ncombination of a strong economy, a relatively positive budget outlook, \nand a world which is largely at peace, we may well have missed a key \nwindow of opportunity. The bill we are introducing today goes a long \nway toward eliminating the deficiencies that we all have recently heard \nso much about from the Chiefs and a myriad of experts who are greatly \nconcerned about the readiness of our military force, especially as we \nlook a few years ahead.\n  Military experts, defense journalists, former Secretaries of Defense, \nformer Service Chiefs, former theater Commanders in Chief, research and \ndevelopment specialists and even civilian industry leaders agree: the \nnumber one factor undergirding our superpower military status is the \npeople of our Armed Forces. This critical ingredient means something \ndifferent today than it did on the beaches of Normandy, in the jungles \nof Vietnam, or in fact even on the deserts of Kuwait. Today, the people \nof our miltiary are as dedicated, as committed, as patriotic as any \nforce we have ever fielded. They are, in fact, smarter, better trained, \nand more technically adept than any who we have ever counted upon to \ndefend our Nation. Operation Desert Fox proved this fact. This \nflawless, but dangerous and stressful, operations involved 40,000 \ntroops from bases virtually around the world. Over 40 ships performed \naround the clock strikes and support. Six hundred aircraft sorties were \nflown in four days, and over 300 of these were night strike operations. \nThis massive efforts was carried out without a single loss of American \nor British life. And, this is but one operation that our military \n(active and reserve) are successfully conducting worldwide.\n\n  In contrast to this and other post-Vietnam successes, consider the \nproblems which face the people in uniform. New global security threats \nand our strong economy each exert enormous pressures on the people in \nthe military and their families. By some measures the pay for our \nmilitary personnel lags 13 percent behind the civilian pay raises over \nthe last 20 years. Yet, we ask our military to train on highly \ntechnical equipment, to commit themselves in harm's way, to leave their \nfamilies, and to execute flawless operations. Sometimes these \noperations are new and different from any past military operations, but \nthey can be just as dangerous. Meanwhile, some of our service members \nqualify for food stamps, do not have the same educational opportunities \nas their civilian counterparts, must deal with confusing and changing \nhealth benefits and/or can not find affordable housing. Something is \nbadly wrong with this picture, and the Congress and the administration \nmust work together to set things right.\n  Specifically, we need to recruit good people, continue to train them, \nand retain them in the military. This is difficult at best with the \nchanges in our society, the rapidly changing threats to our security, \nand a prosperous economy. As I heard a service member say during a \nhearing I held at Fort Gordon, GA, last year, we recruit an individual, \nbut we retain a family.\n  Some of the recruiting and retention problems of today's United \nStates military are well documented. Others need to be more thoroughly \nexplored. They all need to be addressed. The Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 is but the first \nstep. It is the beginning. I caution my colleagues that today's \nservicemen and women, and their families, are intelligent and are quick \nto recognize duplicity in the words and actions of our civilian and \nmilitary leadership. Our military's most important assets--its people--\nare leaving the military, and many of America's best are not even \nconsidering joining the military. We must proceed expeditiously, with \nfirm purpose and unified non-partisanship if we are to reverse these \ndangerous trends.\n  We must act now, but we must consider the time proven process of the \nUnited States Senate. We need to make sure that we have the proper \nhearings and discussions within the proper framework before we over-\nreact to the critical needs facing our military Services.\n  This bill responds to current data which provide some insight into \nhow we can more effectively respond to today's youth and their service \nin the military. This 106th Congress has a tremendous opportunity to \nrespond to today's military personnel problems. We must keep our focus \non current and future personnel issues, including recognizing and \nresponding to the need to retain a family. This legislation is only a \nstart.\n  Mr. President, the bill includes all three parts of the Department of \nDefense's proposed pay and retirement package. It incorporates some of \nthe recommendations made by the congressionally mandated Principi \nCommission, and it provides some additional innovative ideas for \naddressing these key personnel issues, now and into the future.\n  First, the bill provides a 4.8 percent pay raise across the board for \nall military members, effective January 1, 2000, and carries out the \nstated objective of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of \nbringing military pay more in line with private sector wages. This \nincrease raises military pay in FY2000 by one-half a percentage point \nabove the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI), and \nrepresents the largest increase in military pay since 1982. This plan \nwould provide for future annual increase in military pay of one-half \npercent above the annual increase in the ECI. Although I believe we \nshould support the Department of Defense on this issue, of providing \none-half percent above annual increase in the ECI for FY2000 to FY2005, \nour chairman and others have chose to provide more.\n\n  Another of the Joint Chiefs' recommendations included in our \nlegislation is the targeted pay raise for mid-grade officers and \nenlisted personnel, and also for key promotion points. These raises, \namounting to between 4.8 percent and 10.3 percent, which includes the \nJanuary 1, 2000, pay raise\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nand would be effective July 1, 2000. This is a powerful retention tool \nfor our Service Secretaries.\n  The third part of our legislation is a revision in the Military \nRetirement Reform Act of 1986, which would provide an option at 15 \nyears of service for a service member to return to the pre-Redux \nretirement system (50 percent basic pay benefit for military members \nwho retire at 20 years of service) or to elect to receive $30,000 bonus \nand remain in the Redux retirement.\n  I am proud to say that in addition to the pay and retirement benefits \npackage proposed by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs, our \nlegislation includes several key recommendations from the recent report \nof the Congressional Commission on Service Members and Veterans \nTransition Assistance, also known as the Principi Commission. These \nprovisions are specifically designed to assist the military services in \ntheir recruiting and retention efforts.\n  Information and data that we are seeing indicate that education \nbenefits are an essential component in attracting young people to enter \nthe armed services. This may be the single most important step this \nCongress can take in assisting recruitment. Improvements in the \nMontgomery GI Bill are needed, and our bill represents a vital move in \nthat direction.\n  In keeping with the Principi Commission, our legislation would \nincrease the basic GI Bill benefit from $528 to $600 per month and \neliminate the current requirement for entering service members to \ncontribute $1,200 of their own money in order to participate in the \nprogram. These changes should dramatically increase the attractiveness \nof the GI Bill to potential recruits, and give our Service Secretaries \na powerful recruiting incentive.\n  This legislation also adopts the Principi Commission recommendations \nto allow service members to transfer their earned GI Bill benefits to \none or more immediate family members. Mr. President, this idea is \ninnovative, it is powerful and it sends the right message to both those \nyoung people we are trying to attract into the military and those we \nare trying to retain. CBO estimates that in the long run over 500,000 \nchildren of members or former members would use the educational \nassistance each year but that level would not be reached until about \n2013. It is important that we continue to act on this piece of \nlegislation. History tells us that these chances come only once, and \nthis Nation changed drastically under the original GI Bill, and now we \nhave the chance to address future issues with this education piece of \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation includes a provision that would allow military \nmembers to participate in the current Thrift Savings Plan available to \nFederal civil servants. Under this proposal, which adopts another \nrecommendation of the Congressional Commission on Service Members and \nVeterans Transition Assistance, military members would be permitted to \ncontribute up to 5 percent of their basic pay, and all or any part of \nany enlistment or reenlistment bonus, to the Thrift Savings Plan.\n\n  Mr. President, based on our initial estimates, it is my understanding \nthat the provisions contained in this legislation will not require us \nto increase the funding for national defense above the levels in the \nPresident's FY2000-2006 Future Years Defense Plan. However, more \nprecise costing will have to be done by the Congressional Budget Office \nover the next several weeks.\n  I know that all Members of the United States Senate are committed to \nthe well-being of our service men and women and their families. They \nare doing their duty with honor and dignity. They are serving our \ncountry around the globe. They, along with their families, deserve our \ncommitment. The bill we are introducing today is fair and will ensure \nthat we continue to attract and retain high quality people to serve in \nour armed forces. It represents the beginning of a process to provide \nhope and opportunity to those who wear the uniform of our Services. The \nPresident has announced a very good plan, as has the distinguished \nmajority leader. We must move forward, together, in addressing these \nimportant personnel and readiness issues.\n  In closing, I want to recognize the leadership of Senator Warner, and \nSenator Levin, and the other members of the Armed Services Committee \nwho are cosponsoring this legislation. We are all absolutely committed \nto the welfare of our service men and women and their families. They \nprovide for us, and it is time for us to provide our obligation to \nthem. I look forward to working with Senator Levin, Chairman Warner, \nand all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in the months \nahead so that we can honor those who have honored us.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to carry out a demonstration project to provide the Department \n  of Veterans Affairs with medicare reimbursement for medicare health-\n     care services provided to certain medicare-eligible veterans)\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment, which I \nbelieve is No. 26, which is at the desk, be taken up for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 26.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment, \nwhich the Senate passed overwhelmingly last year. Senator Jeffords and \nI offered it, and, with the full concurrence of the Senate, we passed \nthis amendment which I now offer to this very excellent bill, S. 4.\n  The amendment would authorize a pilot project. One of the criticisms \nof people from my side of the aisle is we try to do everything full \nscale. I happen to believe if you have something which you think is a \ngood idea but which is not yet necessarily fully tested, that it is a \ngood idea to test it. Therefore, I think the idea of demonstration \nsites is a very good idea.\n  My amendment would authorize a pilot project to allow the Veterans' \nAdministration to do something which boards and advisory commissions \nhave been advising for years and which many of us have been supporting \nfor years and which the veterans groups all support. That is to allow \nthe Veterans' Administration to bill Medicare for health care services \nprovided to certain dual beneficiaries--people who qualify for both.\n  Senator Specter and I are together offering, as chairman and ranking \nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, an amendment. What we \nbasically do in this amendment is authorize a pilot project, as I \nindicated before, to allow the VA, for the first time, to bill Medicare \nfor health services provided to certain dual beneficiaries.\n  It is known as the VA Medicare subvention amendment or concept. And \nit has been around for a very long time, as I indicated. Our services \norganizations have been for it. Virtually every advisory body that has \never taken a look at the Veterans' Administration and its health care \nhas suggested that this has to happen.\n  In the past, many VA hospitals and clinics have been forced to turn \naway middle-income Medicare-eligible veterans who sought VA care. Last \nyear we made VA open to everybody. On the other hand, people who have \nMedicare, if they wanted to go to a VA hospital, they would have to pay \nout-of-pocket costs because Medicare would not pay for it. So Medicare \nis paying for them at one place but they are not paying for them at a \nveterans hospital where they might prefer to go, either for \nprofessional reasons, medical reasons, geographic reasons, or whatever.\n  So these VA hospitals simply did not have the resources to care for \nthem. Now, due to changes in the law, all enrolled veterans will have \naccess to a uniform, comprehensive benefit package. Yet, resources for \nveterans' health\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\ncare have not increased and, in fact, in the budget have remained \nabsolutely flat. That is another subject which I will not get into \ntoday.\n  For veterans, approval of this veterans subvention amendment would \nmean the infusion of new revenue to their health care system--not more \ncost--because remember that the Medicare which they are now getting is \nalready being paid out. It is being paid out to wherever they are \ngoing. But if they choose to go to the VA hospital, it will actually be \nMedicare, but, as I will explain in a moment, less. It will be Medicare \nminus about 5 percent. So the cost factor is very favorable.\n  For the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, a VA subvention \ndemonstration project would provide the opportunity to assess the \neffects of coordination on improving efficiency, access, and quality of \ncare for dual-eligible beneficiaries in a selected number of sites--\nlet's say, 8, 9, 10, 6, whatever it might be.\n\n  Congress would receive the results of this test study, this \ndemonstration project. You do it in various States or parts of States, \nand then you would know, how do veterans react? Do they want to keep \ntheir Medicare at the hospital they are going to already, which is not \na VA hospital, or now, if we pass this amendment as was passed in the \nreconciliation bill last year, will they decide, no, we want to go to \nthe veterans hospital because it is closer to our home, we feel more \ncomfortable there, we are among our colleagues there? And Medicare \nwould pay for it. In either event, Medicare is paying. But if they go \nto the VA hospital, under our demonstration, Medicare would pay 5 \npercent less in fact.\n  So Congress would then get the results of this test study, Mr. \nPresident. And then, once and for all, it would give us the really \nnecessary data, the experiential data, the medical data, to make \nrational policy decisions in the future about Medicare and VA's \ninvolvement: Are they going to cross fertilize in a useful way or are \nthey not?\n  In my own State of West Virginia, there are four centers of the \nVeterans' Administration. They spent nearly $5 million caring for \nmiddle-income, Medicare-eligible veterans last year. Although this is \nuseful information, I cannot provide my colleagues with the really \ninteresting piece of the story; and that is, the number of these \nMedicare-eligible veterans who are out there. Remember, there are 27 \nmillion of them. And except for about 3.3 million of them, all of them, \nif they now go to a VA hospital, will have to pay out of pocket; they \ncannot use Medicare.\n  That is what this amendment is about. So what we want to find out is, \nhow many veterans are there, who are out there now in this test area, \nwho cannot bring their Medicare coverage with them to the VA hospital \nbecause it does not do them any good and therefore they have to pay out \nof pocket? This demonstration project would encourage, hopefully, these \neligible veterans who have not previously received care at VA hospitals \nto be able to make the decision whether or not that is what they want: \nDo they want to go to Beckley or Martinsburg or Clarksburg or \nHuntington to get their health care, or do they want to stay with their \npresent health care situation?\n  As in years past, this amendment is designed to be budget neutral. To \nthat end, the Veterans' Administration will be required to maintain its \ncurrent level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans already being \nserved and would be effectively limited to reimbursement for additional \nhealth care provided to entirely new users.\n  Payments from Medicare would be, as I said, at a reduced rate--about \n5 percent less than their ordinary rate. Disproportionate share \nhospital adjustments would be excluded from all of this. Graduate \nmedical education payments would be excluded from this, not a part of \nit. A large percentage of capital-related costs would be excluded from \nall of this.\n  So, in effect, the Veterans' Administration would be providing health \ncare to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply discounted rate. It is a \npretty good deal. It is a pretty good deal. The Department of Health \nand Human Services and the Veterans' Administration would have the \nability to adjust payment rates, and, frankly, they would have the \nability to shrink or in fact to terminate the program if they did not \nlike the direction that Medicare costs were going.\n\n  In the event that all of these safeguards included in the proposed \namendment fail, an event which the VA does not anticipate will happen, \nthen Senator Specter and I, specifically in our amendment, propose caps \nto all Medicare payments to the VA at $50 million for an entire year.\n  A HCFA representative testified before the last Congress and stated \nthat the proposal will provide quality service to certain dual-eligible \nbeneficiaries and ``at the same time, preserve and protect the Medicare \nTrust Fund for all Americans.''\n  In 20 minutes I am going to the President's Commission on Medicare. \nWe are very closely looking at all of these kinds of things, although \nMedicare subvention I do not think is going to be brought up. The VA \nsubvention proposal is a very small effort compared to other recent \nchanges made to the Medicare Program and changes yet to come which may \ncome from the President's Commission. We will see. But it is enormously \nimportant for our veterans, Mr. President, and the health care system \nthat they depend upon. Regardless of any policy changes resulting from \nthe President's Commission, an excellent opportunity will remain for VA \nto test the idea of Medicare subvention.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that during the first session of the \n105th Congress, Senator Jeffords and I successfully pushed a similar, \nprecisely similar proposal, virtually similar proposal, through the \nSenate Finance Committee and the full Senate. Over the last couple of \nyears, I have tried a variety of ways to enact this proposal. We have \nconstantly met resistance. Others who favor the subvention concept have \ntried to turn this, the narrow concept of Medicare subvention, into \nsome sweeping policy changes for the delivery of VA health care. That \nis not my goal. My goal is simply to get Medicare subvention without \nany extraneous amendments and additions.\n  Again, it is a very easy concept. Let's say there are 24 million \nveterans out there now who are eligible for Medicare, and they are in \neffect eligible also to go to a VA hospital but in effect they are \nreally not, because if they go to the VA hospital they are going to \nhave to pay for their health care out of pocket. So they do not go.\n  So if you want to find out how veterans feel about the hospital that \nthey are at or the VA hospital and the health care that they are \nreceiving, the stimulus that this would cause to happen for all \ninvolved--competition in the marketplace is one way of looking at it--\nMedicare subvention makes an enormous amount of sense to the American \ntaxpayer and an enormous amount of sense to veterans.\n  This VA proposal is a way to provide quality health care to veterans \nwho are also eligible for Medicare while at the same time, as I say--\nand I am very aware of this because I am very closely connected to it--\nprotecting the Medicare trust fund.\n  So let's not delay this any longer. The veterans have wanted this a \nlong time, as I say. No group that has studied this has not suggested \nthis as an easy, obvious solution. It is extremely low budget. It is \ncapped and has all kinds of audits built into it. As I say, Medicare is \nonly going to be reimbursing the VA hospitals at 95 percent of what \nthey would ordinarily reimburse for similar services. I think it is an \nenormously important proposal. And at the proper time I will ask for \nthe yeas and the nays.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator consider asking for the yeas and nays \nnow?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia for this legislation. I support it enthusiastically. I \nalso commend our colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for the work \nwhich he has done in this field, as referred to by the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  This amendment would constitute a win-win-win situation. We \nfrequently hear about win-win, but not too often do we hear about win-\nwin-win. It is a\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nthree-time winner: First, for the veteran who would have an opportunity \nto have care at the veterans hospital of his choice when reimbursement \nis made by the Medicare funds; it would be a win for the Veterans' \nAdministration, which is very short of money; and it would be a win for \nMedicare, because Medicare would get a reduced payment of 95 percent.\n  Senator Rockefeller is ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, which I chair. We are enormously concerned about the low \nlevel of funding which has been proposed. We have a $17.3 billion \nbudget which is totally insufficient. That has led us to look to other \nsources of funds.\n  For example, the insurance premium payments, where a veteran has \ninsurance which we are trying to get paid to the Veterans' \nAdministration and to the hospital where he is treated: Here you have \nthe anomalous situation where veterans are entitled to Medicare but \nthey are not getting it, and they cannot go to a veterans hospital \nwithout paying for at least a portion of the medical care themselves in \nmany cases. This will give them the opportunity to go to the Veterans' \nAdministration hospital of their choice, to be paid for by Medicare.\n  On a personal note, my father was a veteran of World War I and \nreceived medical treatment at the veterans hospital in Wichita, KS. I \nremember as a youngster riding my bicycle to visit my father when I was \n7 years old. One of the added attractions was that they had a pinball \nmachine. It cost 5 cents in the drugstore, at a penny arcade in Wichita \nit was less expensive, but there was a free pinball machine at the \nveterans hospital. But I always went there to see my father. That was a \nlong bicycle ride. Now Wichita has extended on the east end all the way \nto the veterans hospital.\n  My father in World War II served in the Argonne Forest. He was an \nimmigrant. He walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket, \nfrom a small village in Ukraine. The family lived in a one-room dirt-\nfloor house in a village called Batchkurina. My wife Joan and I visited \nit in 1982. He had a steerage ticket to the United States. He did not \nknow that he had a round-trip ticket to France--not to Paris and the \nFolies Bergeres, but to the Argonne Forest. He was a doughboy. He rose \nto the rank of buck private. Next to his family, his greatest pride was \nserving in the U.S. Army. I have his plaque, which was the equivalent \nof the Purple Heart in World War I for wounded veterans. I thought it \nwas the Statue of Liberty knighting my father, but I later learned it \nwas a plaque given to the 100,000 veterans who were wounded.\n  My father was in an accident in 1937 when he was riding in a brand \nnew automobile and the spindle bolt broke. The car rolled over and \nrolled on to his arm. He was able to receive medical care at the \nveterans hospital. Had he not had that care, I don't know what would \nhave happened to him because 1937 was a very tough year for Americans \ngenerally, but an especially tough year for my immigrant parents who \nhad four young children to support. That experience at the veterans \nhospital in Wichita has stayed with me as sort of a hallmark of medical \ncare for America's veterans.\n  I think it is generally recognized that we do not do enough for our \nveterans. After recognizing it, we don't do very much about it. It is a \nconstant budget struggle. Last year, billions of dollars were taken \nfrom the Veterans' Administration for the highway fund. Now we are \nlooking at a very, very tight budget.\n  I have the attention of the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee who may be coming to the Department of Defense for a \nsmall loan here for veterans. This Medicare subvention would give the \nVeterans' Administration more money. It makes a lot of sense. They now \nhave it for the Department of Defense. Retirees can go to DOD hospitals \nand have it paid for by Medicare.\n  I hope we do not get into a jurisdictional battle with the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee passed this measure in the 105th \nCongress. It was dropped in conference, for reasons which we think are \nnow solved, with the House of Representatives. The DOD Medicare \nsubvention passed and has become law. We need to get this matter done \nnow on this bill which is, as we express it in the Senate, a vehicle \nwhich is moving. We need to have this funding so that when we plan our \nfinancing in the Veterans' Committee we know the kind of money we have \nand the kind of money we may expect for the future.\n  It is my hope that this matter will move forward with alacrity. We \nwill get it done, provide this funding for the Veterans' Administration \nwhich is sorely in need of funds, help out the veterans by giving them \nthe choice of where they may get their care, and assist Medicare by \nhaving this 5 percent discount.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from 12 members of the \nVeterans' Committee, with the lead signators being Senator Rockefeller \nand myself, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 17, 1998.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill and Pat: We write to urge the Committee's renewed \n     consideration of a measure that the Committees on Finance and \n     Veterans' Affairs supported last year as part of the Senate's \n     initial consideration of the Balanced Budget Act, S. 947.\n       For more than five years, Medicare-eligible veterans have \n     called for legislation that would allow them to take \n     advantage of their Medicare eligibility in the VA setting. As \n     you will recall, the Committee on Finance voted to include \n     the VA subvention demonstration measure in its initial BBA \n     package; however, the provision died in conference. The final \n     measure, Public Law 105-33, was silent on this VA provision \n     but did authorize Medicare subvention for military retirees \n     to receive care in Defense health facilities. In discussion \n     with our House colleagues and officials of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, we have learned that the reasons for House \n     opposition to the program have been addressed. We understand \n     that the House may be prepared to approve this legislation \n     later this year.\n       Medicare subvention in VA health care will provide an \n     opportunity to assess the effects of coordination on \n     improving efficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-\n     eligible veterans. Also, the Senate's proposal is budget \n     neutral. To that end, VA would be required to maintain a \n     current level of services to its present patients (including \n     those who are Medicare-eligible) and would be effectively \n     limited to receiving reimbursement for care provided to \n     additional, new Medicare eligibles. Payments from Medicare \n     would be at a reduced rate and would exclude \n     ``disproportionate share'' adjustments, graduate medical \n     education payments, and a large percentage of capital-related \n     costs. In effect, VA would provide health care to Medicare-\n     eligible veterans at a substantial discount.\n       We urge that the Committee on Finance act on and report \n     this legislation to the floor at an early date. We look \n     forward to working with you and other Members to achieve this \n     major initiative that will help America's Medicare-eligible \n     veterans receive the care that they have earned.\n           Sincerely,\n         Arlen Specter, Chairman; John D. Rockefeller IV, Ranking \n           Member; Strom Thurmond; Frank H. Murkowski; Jim \n           Jeffords; Ben Nighthorse Campbell; Tim Hutchinson; \n           Larry E. Craig; Patty Murray; Paul D. Wellstone; Bob \n           Graham; Daniel K. Akaka.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, one of the great rewards in the Senate is \nhearing stories from your fellow colleagues like we just heard about \nyour distinguished father. I say with great pride that my father also \nserved in France in World War I in the Army as a doctor. He was in the \nbattle of the Argonne Forest.\n  I am always moved when I hear those stories, and how proud both of us \nare with what our fathers achieved. How lucky we are.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the distinguished Senator will yield for a moment, my \nfather has prevailed to support his family and was in the junk \nbusiness. Many call it the scrap iron business, but it was the junk \nbusiness.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I had our paths cross a bit a few months ago \nwhen we were in the Steel Caucus. A man from Texas came in from the \nscrap business--and they have been very badly hurt by imports of steel, \nwhich I will not go into at this moment. It gave me occasion to reflect \nfor less than a minute on my experience cutting down derricks.\n  The wind would blow through the oil fields in Kansas. We lived in \nRussell, a small town noted for being the home of\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nSenator Dole. My brother-in-law Arthur Morgenstern and I would go out \nand cut down the derricks. We would sell the straight pieces of angled \niron for two and three quarter cents a pound--price control--and the \nbalance of the junk we loaded on the truck and we would take it over to \nthe railroad and the boxcar and ship it.\n  When I finished telling the tale of woe--it was a good incentive to \nbecome a lawyer--Senator Rockefeller chimed in and said, ``I have had a \nsimilar experience to Arlen Specter. My family also was in oil and \nrailroads. We owned the oil companies and we owned the railroads.''\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I was waiting to see if they had a \njunk business on the side. I expect not. I was privileged to know the \ndistinguished father of our colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, a little note of history and then I will yield the \nfloor. The Armed Services Committee, when we tried to pass a subvention \nprovision for the DOD, we had it twice, but each time the Finance \nCommittee came in and blocked that language in the Armed Services \nCommittee bill and eventually, of course, the Finance Committee did \ntake it and got it passed for the DOD.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair to recognize the distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia such that he might make some additional \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and the Presiding Officer.\n  Just three comments: No. 1, I think it is really important to \nremember that the Department of Defense now has Medicare subvention. \nDOD has Medicare subvention. And they have it on a test basis. The VA \nis asking for Medicare subvention on a test basis.\n  I ask my colleagues, is it really fair in that this is basically a \nno-cost item and perhaps a cost savings for the DOD people to have it \nand for VA not to have it when ultimately this is an enormously \nimportant test for the future of veterans' health care policy and where \nthey are going to get it.\n  Second, the point has been made--not on this floor by the people here \nbut referring to others--that this has not gone through the regular \nprocess. This has been through the regular process. Senator Jeffords \nand I introduced this yesterday. And it was introduced last year. It \npassed through the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee last \nyear, and it went through the reconciliation process last year. This \nhas been through the process. It was dropped in conference. It has been \nthrough the process. That needs to be made.\n  Third, that a veteran ought to have the right to decide where he or \nshe wants to get their health care service with their Medicare \ndollars--and it is a superb way to find out, in fact, what veterans \nthink of VA and/or their present health care service systems. It has to \nhappen. It is good policy. And it is probably a cost saving policy. \nWhen the time comes for the vote, I hope that my colleagues will vote \n``no'' on the motion to table.\n  We do a lot of talk about supporting veterans, and we do the best we \ncan. But this is a very important basically no-cost health care way to \ngive veterans something they desperately need and deserve.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague from Virginia--I \nwasn't clear; he was about to table the Rockefeller amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues whether I could have 2 minutes in support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we want to accommodate all of our \ncolleagues. I know the Senator from Florida is waiting.\n  In response to the Senator from West Virginia, he is right on target \non all three points. I agree with him. He will have this Senator's \nsupport when the time comes. But I must honor the request of the \nchairman of the committee, on which the Senator from Minnesota serves, \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota wish to speak to this amendment by \nthe Senator from West Virginia?\n  I make that request in his behalf.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his graciousness, and also Senator Graham from Florida.\n  Let me just say to Senator Rockefeller that I think the time is right \nfor his amendment to authorize a Medicare Subvention pilot project. We \nhave been through this year after year after year. We have a veterans' \nhealth care system that is really struggling with a flat-line budget.\n  My colleague from West Virginia has shown a lot of leadership on a \nlot of issues that affect the veterans community. Look, we need to at \nleast have this Medicare Subvention on a pilot project basis. We need \nto think about a stable source of funding for veterans' health care. \nGive veterans the choice whether to go to VA for their health care. It \nshould be their choice.\n  We have such a demonstration project within DOD right now. We ought \nto be able to do this within the Veterans' Administration. Veterans \norganizations feel strongly about this. This is the time to support the \nRockefeller amendment because the whole question of recruitment, and \nwhether or not young women and men want to serve in our armed services \nis directly related to how they feel they are going to be treated when \nthey are no longer in the armed services, when they are veterans. Will \nthere or will there not be support for the veterans' health care \nsystem? This Rockefeller amendment is a terribly important step in the \ndirection of making sure we have good veterans health care. And I would \nlike to include my name as an original cosponsor, if that is all right \nwith my colleague.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWellstone's name be included, as well as Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. May I ask the distinguished Senator from Virginia, is it \nappropriate to make some remarks on the amendment on the veterans \nMedicare subvention amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, of course it is appropriate, and I so \ndesire that be done.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for his comments.\n  I must say, I rise in opposition to the amendment. As the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia well knows, the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 requires the Health and Human Services Administration and \nVeterans Affairs to submit to Congress a detailed implementation plan \nfor a veterans subvention demonstration. This report has not yet been \nsubmitted to Congress and is due at the end of this year.\n  Frankly, a veterans subvention demonstration at this time would be \npremature. The Department of Defense Medicare subvention demonstration \nenacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was carefully crafted in a \nbipartisan fashion between the committees of jurisdiction in the House \nand Senate, as well as the administering Secretary to address complex \nbudgetary and design issues.\n  It is very, very important, Mr. President, that the veterans \nsubvention demonstration should undergo the same process in order to \nensure a successful demonstration for all Medicare-eligible veterans.\n  Finally, as you are aware, the Medicare Part A trust fund is facing \nan insolvency date of 2008. This is a most serious, critical matter, \nand the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare is meeting this \nafternoon to continue to address the current solvency issue.\n  I cannot overemphasize how important, in light of this problem of \nsolvency, is careful consideration of the budgetary implication \nassociated with the veterans subvention demonstration in order to \nprevent the solvency of the trust fund from being further jeopardized.\n  I will be happy to assure the parties supporting and author of this \nlegislation that we will be glad to work with them in the future in \ntrying to work out legislation that seems appropriate under the \ncircumstances.\n  As I said, it is critically important that it be carefully crafted \nbecause the Medicare legislation is in deep trouble.\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\n As I said, it faces insolvency by 2008. We have set up a special \ncommission headed by Senator Breaux to try to find a solution to \nassuring the continued solvency of this program. And to add to the \ndifficulty, the complexity of that problem, by including now a new \nproposal on veterans Medicare subvention makes little or no sense. For \nthat reason, I strongly support the motion to table suggested by the \nchairman of the defense committee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I do have an \namendment I want to bring to the floor in a moment, if that is the \ndirection we are going.\n  Let me just say to my colleague from Delaware, the argument that we \nought to wait until we see what happens with this pilot project within \nDOD is an apples-and-oranges proposition. First of all, it is going to \nbe another year before we know what happens with the DOD pilot, and, \nsecond of all, these are two different health care systems. These are \ntwo different health care systems.\n  The point is, we say it is fine to go ahead with DOD and do a \nMedicare subvention pilot project, but when it comes to our veterans--\nour veterans--that's another story. I say to my colleagues again, \nwhether or not men and women want to serve in the armed services is \ndirectly correlated to how they are going to be treated when they are \nveterans. When it comes to veterans, we should have done this a year \nago.\n  It just doesn't cut it to say, ``Well, we have to wait for another \nyear to see how the pilot works out with DOD.'' That is a very \ndifferent health care system. A year ago we should have had this \nMedicare subvention demonstration model within the Veterans' \nAdministration, and we are able to do it now. We want to do it. That is \nwhy we bring this to the floor.\n  Finally, let me point out, on the whole budget problem--Senator \nRockefeller said it--this amendment is budget neutral. These are new \nusers of the VA system. Everybody who has talked about Medicare \nsubvention has made it crystal clear that there are no negative \nfinancial implications for the Medicare trust fund.\n  I am sorry, these arguments don't cut it. If colleagues want to vote \nagainst this, they can vote against it. I will just tell you, I think a \nvote to table the Rockefeller amendment, the amendment that Senator \nJeffords has worked on, the amendment that I am very proud to support--\nI have to say it this way, and I am not playing politics--it really is \na vote against veterans.\n  In Minnesota, I don't find any topic to be more a topic of discussion \namong the veterans community than health care. I don't find any greater \nconcern than the concern as to whether or not we are going to have a \nstable source of funding for veterans' health care. This is just a \npilot project that takes us in this direction. I cannot believe my \ncolleagues are going to come out on the floor of the Senate and table \nthis. I hope we get a vote against the tabling motion.\n  Other than that, Mr. President, I don't feel strongly about it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation, \nwhich is, basically, now pending, to allow certain Medicare-eligible \nveterans to go to Veterans' Administration facilities for their care \nand to allow the Veterans' Administration to bill Medicare for those \nservices, just as a private provider would do. Seventeen of my \ncolleagues joined Senator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, and myself in \nintroducing the Veterans Equal Access to Medicare Act, S. 445. It is \nthis legislation that Senator Rockefeller now offers as an amendment to \nthis bill, and I support him.\n  America's veterans and the Veterans Health Administration are eager \nto launch this demonstration project which establishes up to 10 \ndemonstration sites around the country where this policy would be \ntested. The Department of Defense is currently running a very similar \ndemonstration project for military retirees, and the Veterans' \nAdministration is anxious to do the same for veterans.\n  Allowing veterans to take their Medicare eligibility to a Veterans' \nAdministration building gives them greater flexibility in choosing \ntheir care provider. This is good for veterans. It makes good sense, \nand it would allow the Veterans' Administration to get reimbursed for \nthe care it would provide above and beyond those veterans it is \ncurrently treating.\n  This legislation is budget neutral and is limited in scope, capping \nMedicare trust fund payments to the Veterans' Administration at $50 \nmillion per year for 3 years, payments that would otherwise go to \nprivate-sector providers.\n  Mr. President, veterans want the option of getting their Medicare-\ncovered care at the VA.\n  The VA wants the option. And we ought to move expeditiously to get \nthis demonstration project underway. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. On behalf of Senator Dorgan, I ask unanimous consent that \nAnthony Blaylock, a defense fellow serving in his office, be given \nfloor privileges during the debate on S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would defer to my colleague. I actually rise for the \npurpose of offering an amendment, but if my colleague wants to respond \nto the Rockefeller amendment, I would defer to him.\n  Mr. ROTH. I just want to say to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota that we are all sympathetic to trying to do something to help \nthe veterans hospitals. We are all interested in assuring that the \nveterans have the best care possible. But he misunderstood what I said. \nThe fact is, the study that is about to come out, which is to be \nperformed by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Veterans \nAffairs, is to submit a detailed implementation plan for a veterans \nsubvention demonstration. The purpose of it is not to await the results \nof a defense program and see how it works out. The fact is that there \nare two different systems, and what may work for defense will not \nnecessarily be efficient or effective as far as the veterans are \nconcerned.\n  All I was saying is that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does require \nthe Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs to \nsubmit a plan, and that we should not act and move forward until we \nhave that report. When we get that report, then we should be in a \nposition to create a demonstration program that meets the necessities, \nthe peculiarities, and the problems that are inherent in the current \nveterans plan.\n  So I just wanted to make clear we are not awaiting the results of the \nDepartment of Defense intervention program.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will go forward with this other amendment because I \nknow my colleagues are anxious to move along.\n  Let me just say to my colleague from Delaware, I have here a \nmemorandum of agreement between the Department of Veterans Affairs and \nHealth and Human Services to go forward with this subvention project. \nWe already have the memorandum of agreement. They are ready to go. All \nthey need is for the U.S. Senate to go on record saying we support it.\n  One more time, I will just say to my colleagues, sometimes the debate \nis all civil, but sometimes it is with some strong feeling. I think the \nveterans community is becoming very impatient with us, and for very \ngood reasons. They have every reason in the world to wonder about VA \nhealth care as they look forward to the future. And this amendment is \nbut one small step toward trying to figure out one piece of stable \nfunding. I think it is a terrible mistake to come out here and to move\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nto table this amendment. And the point I made earlier I think still \nstands.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commit to my two colleagues and friends \nhere the support of the Senator from Virginia, but I have been asked by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth--on his behalf I \nmove to table, with his commitment to try to move it in that committee.\n  I move to table.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. WARNER. It all depends on how long that will be.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will speak for 5 minutes on the bill, not on the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are not going to have a vote right now. I thank the \nSenator. I move to table the amendment and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be laid aside. Eventually we will get to the vote. We \nwill stack them after consultation with the leadership.\n  Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague, the Senator from \nFlorida, has an amendment. I want to make a few comments on the bill if \nthat accommodates his schedule. I won't be very long.\n  Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and colleague, Senator \nWarner, for his stewardship of this bill, for his chairmanship of the \nArmed Services Committee, and for his dedication to improving our \nnational defense. He has a proven record in national defense, both as a \nSecretary of the Navy and his service in the Senate. I understand the \nsupport that this bill has by colleagues, and certainly I feel \nsupportive of our military and national defense as well. I have always \nbelieved that for the Federal Government our No. 1 priority should be \nthe protection of our people, protection of our country, and the \nprotection of our freedom. This bill will help do this in some ways. So \nI support those efforts.\n  I support a lot of what is in this bill, but I don't support \neverything in this bill. I think it would be less than forthcoming if I \ndidn't express my displeasure with at least two provisions in this \nbill. Maybe by expressing that displeasure we can remedy that before \nthis bill becomes law. I say that in all sincerity. I want a lot of \nthis bill to become law.\n  Frankly, when my staff asked me earlier, ``Do you want to sponsor \nS.4, one of our first bills? It improves national defense, increases \npay.'' Well, I have 35,000 to 40,000 troops in my State, and I \ndefinitely want to increase their pay. So I support that provision of \nthe bill. When I started reading the summaries of it--and I have a copy \nof a summary and cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, \ndated February 12, 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this CBO summary be printed at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I became concerned about the cost not \njust of the pay increases, which are handled by appropriation \ncommittees every year--in other words, this bill can authorize pay \nincreases of whatever percent, but the appropriators have to come up \nwith the money to do it. They will do that within the budget cycle, and \nwe are going to pass a budget this year. So I am optimistic that will \nbe funded. It will be within the budget and it will be responsible. So, \nagain, I don't have a problem with that portion of the bill, the pay \nraise. That portion of the bill, I might mention, is $26 billion over \nthe next 10 years. It is about half of this bill. The total cost of \nthis bill is about $55 billion over the next 10 years. So I don't have \na problem with the pay raise provision.\n  I do have a problem with two of the entitlement increases in this \nbill. I think, with all due respect, they are mistakes. I think \nincreasing the military retirement percentage from 40 to 50 percent is \na mistake. Some colleagues say don't raise that. I was in the Congress \nwhen we reduced it from 50 to 40. We did that with an overwhelming vote \nof 92-1. In 1986, we reduced the military retirement schedule from 50 \nto 40 percent as part of an overall package for entitlement reform in \nthe military. It was overwhelming, 92-1.\n  Now we are getting ready to do the opposite, increasing it probably \nfrom 40 percent to 50 percent. That means that an individual can join \nat age 18 or 20, serve 20 years, receive retirement pay beginning at \nage 40 for life, and receive cost-of-living adjustments. That is very \nexpensive. Also, when they are 41 years old, they can seek other \nemployment; I expect that they would do that in most cases. So they \nwould have other employment in addition to the military retirement. It \nis a very expensive provision. In 1986, changes were made with a lot of \nwork; I think it was work that was well thought out.\n  I might note that there is a letter from the Concord Coalition, \nsigned by our former colleagues, Senator Rudman and Senator Nunn, which \nurges us not to do this, saying they worked hard and they were with \nmany of us in the Senate at that time. I will read part of it:\n\n       We understand that it has been tentatively decided to \n     include in the year-end omnibus spending bill a provision \n     substantially repealing the 1986 military pension reforms. We \n     urge you in the strongest possible terms to reject this \n     unwise, expensive, and untimely provision.\n\n  They also said:\n\n       Several commissions reported that the old pension system \n     was so generous to personnel in their early 40s with 20 years \n     of service that the pensions worked as incentives to highly \n     skilled personnel to leave the military. One of the \n     objectives of this bill is to get people to stay in the \n     military.\n\n  They also say:\n\n       Rolling back the 1986 reforms means returning to a system \n     that encourages military personnel to retire prematurely from \n     the service in their early 40s at half pay, augmented by full \n     COLAs.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this entire letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        The Concord Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1998.\n\n              Say No to Repealing Military Pension Reforms\n\n       Dear Colleague: We understand that it has been tentatively \n     decided to include in the year-end omnibus spending bill a \n     provision substantially repealing the 1986 military pension \n     reforms. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to \n     reject this unwise, expensive, and untimely provision.\n       Both of us believe unequivocally in a strong defense and a \n     responsible fiscal policy. Repealing the 1986 military \n     pension reforms will produce neither: it will weaken \n     readiness by taking funds away from more critical defense \n     needs, and it will also create serious budget problems.\n       This provision is terrible fiscal policy both near term and \n     long term. In the near term, the provision requires \n     appropriating $7.3 billion over the coming decade to pay the \n     ``employers' share'' (the accrual cost) of increasing \n     military pensions down the road. This $7.3 billion will have \n     to be squeezed out of the very tight level of appropriations \n     allowed under he 1997 discretionary caps. Remember, these \n     caps are already set to tighten spending by about 10 percent \n     in real terms between now and 2002, so finding $7.3 billion \n     will mean stinting on other priorities.\n       In the long term, by rolling back the 1986 reforms, the \n     provisions eventually would expand the stream of future \n     entitlements by about $8 billion a year. It would affect only \n     service personnel who joined the military after 1986, so its \n     full impact on pension payments would not be felt for several \n     decades.\n       The 1986 reforms were designed and approved on a bipartisan \n     basis after several years of study and hearings. They reined \n     in excessive costs and overhauled outdated aspects of the \n     pension system. They should not be lightly tossed aside in a \n     last minute omnibus spending bill. If changes of this \n     magnitude are to be made, they should be done only after full \n     consideration by the appropriate committees and full and \n     informed debate by the House and Senate.\n       Prior to passage of these reforms many experts, including \n     the Pentagon's own Quadrennial Review of Military \n     Compensation, called for change. Former Defense Secretary Les \n     Aspin noted that under the old system most military pension \n     benefits went to people were still working outside the \n     military and were not ``retired'' in the conventional sense.\n       Several commissions reported that the old pension system \n     was so generous to personnel in their early 40s with 20 years \n     of service that the pensions worked as incentives to highly \n     skilled personnel to leave the military. With the current \n     need for critical skills in the military, it is absurd to \n     encourage unskilled personnel to retire in their early 40s. \n     Returning to the old system would reduce--not strengthen--the \n     willingness of personnel\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\n     to remain in the service and therefore, in our opinion, it \n     would reduce retention rates and military readiness. Indeed, \n     there are far better ways the same appropriations dollars \n     could be used that would improve readiness and retention \n     rates.\n       This provision in no way affects former military personnel \n     who are retired today, or even active duty personnel who \n     joined the service before August, 1986.\n       Only those who were inducted after July 31, 1986 will be \n     affected. But changing the ground rules mid-stream for them \n     calls into question whether any prospective changes in Social \n     Security or other entitlement programs can ever be credible. \n     Prospective changes are purposely adopted in order to soften \n     the adjustment and give individuals time to plan ahead. But \n     if such significant changes as the 1986 military retirement \n     reforms are rolled back before they even have an impact, why \n     should citizens believe that other prospective entitlement \n     reforms actually will come to pass and make their plans \n     accordingly?\n       Rolling back the 1986 reforms means returning to a system \n     that encourages military personnel to retire prematurely from \n     the service in their early 40s at half pay, augmented by full \n     COLAs. Why not also roll back the 1984 reforms of the Civil \n     Service pension plan? Is this fair to DoD civilian personnel \n     or other government employees?\n       At a time when our nation is preparing for the fiscal \n     challenges of an aging population by debating the tough \n     choices involved in Social Security and Medicare reform we \n     can ill afford to undo one of the few tough choices about \n     long-term spending that already has been made.\n       The 1986 reforms made sense then and still make sense \n     today. But if Congress wishes to reexamine the issue, or to \n     direct appropriations in a way that would change military \n     compensation or increase readiness, it should do so with \n     proper debate and consideration, not through an ill-conceived \n     provision slipped into a mammoth year-end spending bill with \n     little consideration by the House or Senate.\n       Additional information and background on this issue is \n     available in the entitlement reform section of the Concord \n     Coalition web site at ``http://www.concordcoalition.org''.\n           Sincerely,\n     Warren B. Rudman,\n       Co-Chair.\n     Sam Nunn,\n       Co-Chair.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think the pension change--which, I \nmight mention, is an entitlement change--is not paid for in this bill \nand it costs $14 billion over the next 10 years. So it is not an \ninsignificant provision. There are also provisions in here dealing with \na thrift savings plan. I am in favor of that. I don't have a problem \nwith that. We should encourage that for military personnel. Most \nprovisions in here I agree with and some I disagree with. I think \nchanging the retirement percentage is a mistake.\n  There is another provision in the bill that Senator Cleland, I think, \nwas talking about. I compliment him. He was able to get this in the \nbill in the markup. I don't believe they had cost estimates and \nactually knew how much it would cost during the markup, but it was a \nprovision dealing with the GI bill, providing benefits, educational \nbenefits for GIs. He expanded the benefit to say it could be \ntransferred to spouses and children. What does this mean? The bill \nitself increases the GI benefit from $528 a month to $600 a month, a \nnice, generous increase. That means a GI that is in the regular service \nwith a commitment for 3 years can sign up and receive educational \nbenefits totaling $600 per month--a pretty nice benefit. That is $7,200 \nper year.\n  This bill is used by a significant number of GIs. This bill \neliminates the coshare. They have to pay, right now, $100 a month, or \nfor the first year $1,200. This bill eliminates that. I am not arguing \nabout that as much as I am about the transferability provision in this \nbill that allows the GI benefits to be transferred to spouses, and also \nto the kids.\n  I am all in favor of increasing support for our military, but I \nquestion the wisdom of this provision, which is enormously expensive. \nEnormously. The cost of this provision over the next 10 years--just the \ntransfer of the GI entitlement--is $9.8 billion. Also, I might mention \nthat in the CBO study, the last part of the page, they talk about the \ntransfer of entitlement, and they said:\n\n       CBO estimates that the provision would raise costs by about \n     $110 billion in 2000 and by $2.2 billion over the first 5 \n     years, and $9.8 billion over the 2000 to 2009 period. In the \n     long run, costs will rise to about $3 billion per year.\n\n  This is just in the transfer of an entitlement. So this is the \ncreation of a new entitlement, transferring this entitlement to spouses \nand the kids. This $600, which I believe is indexed for inflation, can \nget very expensive. So we are talking about a $7,200 benefit being \ntransferred to spouses and kids, and 10 years from now how much will \nthat be? Well, the Congressional Budget Office says it is going to cost \nabout $3 billion a year. I know that cost wasn't known--or at least I \ndon't think it was --when this bill was marked up. We know what the \ncost is now. I think we have to look at it long and hard.\n  Is this the right thing to do? Some people have said this doesn't \ncome out of the defense budget, this is not part of the defense bill, \nthis is really part of Veterans Affairs budget. It comes out of the \ntaxpayer bill. I want to take care of veterans, too, but I don't think \nwe have an obligation to veterans' children, to be providing for their \neducation to the tune of $7,200. I think we have to be very cautious \nwhen we go about expanding entitlements. Maybe I am alone in this, but \nthese entitlement increases aren't paid for. So there is a real \nconflict.\n  Most of us say we believe in a balanced budget. We run back to our \nStates and say we have balanced the budget and we have done a great \njob. Yet, increasing entitlements to the tune of increasing the \npercentage from 40 to 50 percent for military retirement, and then also \nmaking the GI bill benefits apply not only for GIs, but also for GIs' \nspouses and for children.\n  I think that is enormously expensive--very expensive. The cost of \nthis bill over the first 5 years is $17.9 billion. The cost over 10 \nyears is $54.9 billion--almost $55 billion over 10 years. About half of \nthat is pay raise. I don't have a problem with the pay raise provision, \nwith one exception. The pay raise provision that is put in says not \nonly a 4.8 pay raise, which is the most generous that we have done in a \nlong time, and it is probably overdue, but it also says for the \nforeseeable future we are going to add another half point over whatever \nthe cost-of-living index will be for the military over everybody else. \nI am not sure we should be making that decision for 10 years from now, \nor for 8 years from now. The next Congress can decide that. Maybe we \nshould say, ``Well, for the next 4 years we will give a half point \nincremental increase on top of the CPI.'' I don't think we should say \nfor every military person you will get half a percent more than \neverybody else. And then we are going to have pressure coming from the \ncivil service, and from all governmental employees saying we want just \nas much, although we have had some studies done that say they are not \nmaking as much as those in the private sector.\n  I think that provision can be very expensive, or certainly should be \nsunset or limited. So I encourage the managers of this bill to look at \nputting the sunset on the incremental cost-of-living increase that is \nnow provided. I urge them to take another look at raising the \nretirement percentage from 40 to 50 percent. I urge in the strongest \nlanguage possible to be very, very cautious about expanding the GI bill \nof rights to spouses and to their children.\n  If we are going to pass entitlement programs that cost $3 billion a \nyear, we should know it. We should recognize the cost. We should also \nbe thinking about what the spending is going to squeeze out--what area \nof the military is going to take a hit, or what area of Veterans \nAffairs. Are we not going to be able to fund veterans' health care as \nwell because that particular provision is in there?\n  So I think we need to think about it long and hard. I am confident \nthat our colleagues, who will be managing this bill in conference, will \nlook at these issues. I am very hopeful they will be addressed before \nwe see a bill brought back to the Senate floor as a conference bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 4--Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \n         Rights Act of 1999\n       Summary: S. 4 would increase various elements of \n     compensation for current and former members of the armed \n     forces. Specifically, it would increase pay for military \n     personnel, provide a special allowance for low-income \n     members, increase retirement benefits for certain members, \n     increase educational benefits, and allow members on active \n     duty to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, enactment \n     of the bill would raise discretionary spending by about $1.1 \n     billion\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n     in 2000 and $13.8 billion over the 2000-2004 period. In 2009, \n     those costs would total about $6.5 billion. Because the \n     increase in retirement benefits would apply only to members \n     who entered the service after July 1986, annual costs would \n     continue to rise for a few years after 2009. Additional \n     benefits earned under the proposal between August 1, 1986, \n     and the effective date would add about $4.5 billion to the \n     unfunded liability of the military retirement trust fund.\n       Because the bill would affect direct spending and revenues, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. Increased educational \n     benefits and higher annuities for certain military retirees \n     would increase direct spending by about $765 million a year \n     over the 2000-2004 period. In 2009 direct spending costs \n     would total about $2.6 billion. The annual direct spending \n     costs for military retirement would eventually be about 11 \n     percent higher than spending under current law. Greater use \n     of education benefits under the bill would raise long-run \n     costs by about $3 billion a year. By allowing servicemembers \n     to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, the bill would \n     lower revenues by $311 over the 2000-2004 period and about \n     $141 million by 2009. Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act excludes from the application of that act any \n     legislative provisions that are necessary for the national \n     security. That exclusion might apply to the provisions of \n     this bill. In any case, the bill contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 4 is shown in Table 1, assuming that \n     the bill will be enacted by October 1, 1999. Spending from \n     the bill would fall, under budget functions 700 (veteran's \n     benefits and services), 050 (national defense), and 600 \n     (income security).\n\n                                TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED COSTS OF S. 4, AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n                                                        [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES\n \nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Budget Authority......................       537       599       870       887       927     1,108     1,435     1,940     2,270     2,633\n    Estimated Outlays...............................       537       599       870       887       927     1,108     1,435     1,940     2,270     2,633\n    Revenues........................................       -10       -44       -67       -86      -103      -113      -120      -127      -134      -141\n \n                                                           SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS\n \nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level...................     1,089     2,196     3,118     3,505     3,980     4,373     4,852     5,422     5,952     6,548\n    Estimated Outlays...............................     1,075     2,164     3,103     3,487     3,963     4,354     4,832     5,400     5,928     6,520\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of estimate: The budgetary impact of the bill would \n     stem from three sets of provisions: those affecting military \n     retirement programs, pay of current members, and veterans' \n     education.

The Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 \n     (REDUX) governs the retirement of military personnel who \n     initially entered the armed forces after July 31, 1986. Under \n     REDUX a retiree's intial annuity ranges from 40 percent to 75 \n     percent of the individual's highest three years of basic pay. \n     Retirees with 20 years of service will receive 40 percent, \n     and the fraction will grow with each additional year of \n     service and reach the maximum at 30 years of service. When \n     the retiree is 62 years old, the annuity is raised in most \n     cases to equal 2.5 percent of the average of the highest 36 \n     months of basic pay for each year of service up to a maximum \n     of 75 percent. Also, under REDUX cost-of-living adjustments \n     (COLAs) equal the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \n     less 1 percentage point. However, when the retiree reaches \n     age 62 the annuity is raised to reflect all of the CPI growth \n     until that point, but thereafter annual COLAs continue to \n     equal the CPI less one percentage point.\n       Current law provides two different formulas for other \n     individuals who become eligible for a nondisability \n     retirement benefit but are not covered by REDUX. Military \n     personnel who first became members of the armed forces before \n     September 8, 1980, receive retired pay equal to a multiple of \n     their highest amount of basic pay; the multiple is 2.5 \n     percent for every year of service up to 75 percent. Retirees \n     who first became members of the armed forces between \n     September 8, 1980, and July 31, 1986, receive retired pay \n     based on the average of the highest 36 months of basic pay \n     and the multiplier of 2.5 percent for each year of service. \n     Annuities for both of these groups are fully adjusted for \n     changes in the CPI.\n       Repeal of REDUX/Optional Lump-Sum Bonus. Under section 201, \n     members who under current law would retire under REDUX would \n     face a choice upon reaching 15 years of service. They could \n     elect to receive a lump-sum bonus of $30,000 and retire under \n     the REDUX plan or they could forgo that payment and upon \n     retirement receive annuities under the plan in effect for \n     retirees who first became members of the armed forces between \n     September 8, 1980, and July 31, 1986. CBO estimates that \n     total costs to DoD under the provision would total about $674 \n     million in 2000 and average about $1.4 billion a year through \n     2009.\n       Accrual Costs. Prior to 2009 the primary budgetary impact \n     would stem from the payments that DoD would make to the \n     military retirement trust fund. The military retirement \n     system is financed in part by payments\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\n     from appropriated funds to the military retirement trust fund \n     based on an estimate of the system's accruing liabilities. \n     Repealing REDUX would increase payments from the military \n     personnel accounts to the military retirement fund (a DoD \n     outlay in budget function 050) to finance the increased \n     liability to the fund resulting from additional years of \n     service under a more generous system.\n       CBO estimates that the resulting increase in discretionary \n     spending from the accrual payments would average about $0.8 \n     billion by 2004 and about $1.0 billion over the next 10 \n     years. The costs to DoD would increase each year because not \n     all military personnel are covered by REDUX. Under current \n     law the percentage of the force covered by REDUX will grow \n     until everyone in the force will have entered military \n     service after July 31, 1986.\n       Accrual costs depend on many factors, including \n     endstrengths, projected years of service at the time of \n     retirement, grade structure or salary history, and projected \n     rates of military pay raises, inflation, and interest rates. \n     CBO's assumptions are consistent with the ones used recently \n     by DoD's actuaries. The estimates also assume that in the \n     long run annual pay raises are 4.0 percent, changes in the \n     CPI are 3.5 percent a year, and interest rates for the trust \n     fund's holdings of Treasury securities are 6.5 percent \n     annually. CBO's assumptions about how many individuals would \n     choose lump-sum payments instead of a higher retirement \n     annuity are explained in the following paragraph.\n       Lump-sum Payments. In addition, CBO estimates that DoD \n     would spend about $500 million a year for the lump-sum \n     payments, assuming that 50 percent of enlisted personnel and \n     about 40 percent of officers would elect to receive the lower \n     annuity in retirement. That estimate is based on DoD's \n     experience under two buy-out programs in recent years. The \n     Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) and the Special \n     Separation Benefit (SSB) were two programs that DoD used \n     extensively during the 1992-1996 period. VSI was a payment \n     over a period of years, and SSB was a lump sum payment that \n     had a lower present value than VSI. About 86 percent of \n     enlisted personnel selected SSB, and about half of the \n     officers did. Because the present value of forgoing the \n     annuity reduction under REDUX is significantly greater than \n     $30,000 and because that difference tends to be greater than \n     the difference between VSI and SSB, CBO assumes that smaller \n     fractions of officers and enlisted personnel would opt for \n     the lump-sum payment than chose SSB. The members who would be \n     affected by this provision entered service in 1986; thus, \n     they would not be eligible for the lump-sum payment until \n     2001.\n       Direct Spending Under Section 201. Section 201 would also \n     increase direct spending from the military retirement trust \n     fund by $1 million in 2000 and by about $233 million over the \n     2000-2009 period. The outlay impact before 2006 is primarily \n     due to higher cost-of-living allowances for individuals who \n     receive a disability annuity. Starting in 2006 the impact is \n     almost all due to regular retirements. In the long run, \n     direct spending for military retirement would be about 11 \n     percent higher than under current law.\n       Thrift Savings Plan. Section 202 would allow members of the \n     uniformed services on active duty for a period of more than \n     30 days to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). \n     Contributions would be capped at 5.0 percent of basic pay \n     plus any part of special or incentive pay that a member \n     receives. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \n     revenue loss caused by deferred income tax payment would \n     total $10 million in 2000, $103 million in 2004, and about \n     $141 million by 2009.\n       Special Retention Initiative. Under section 203, the \n     Secretary of Defense could make additional contributions to \n     TSP for military personnel in designated occupational \n     specialties or as part of an agreement for an extended term \n     of service. CBO estimates that the discretionary costs from \n     the resulting agency contributions to TSP would total $2 \n     million in 2000 and would increase to $28 million by 2004, \n     based on DoD's use of similar authority to award bonuses for \n     enlistment or reenlistment.\n     Compensation of military personnel\n       S. 4 contains two sets of provisions that would affect \n     compensation for those currently serving in the military. One \n     would increase annual pay raises and change the table \n     governing pay according to grade and years of service. The \n     other would increase compensation to members who would \n     otherwise be eligible for food stamps.\n       Pay Increases. Section 101 and 102 contain provisions that \n     would provide across-the-board and targeted pay raises. \n     Across-the-board pay raises would be a total of 4.8 percent \n     in 2000 and 0.5 percent above the Employment Cost Index (ECI) \n     in future years. Because those raises would be 0.5 percent \n     above the full ECI raise called for in current law, CBO \n     estimates that incremental cost would be about $197 million \n     in 2000 and average about $1.7 billion over the 200-2009 \n     period. The estimate is based on current projections of \n     military strength levels and its distribution by pay grade.\n       Additional pay raises would be targeted at personnel in \n     specific grades and with certain years of service. The \n     changes to the military pay table would increase basic pay by \n     about $189 million in 2000 and an average of about $860 \n     million annually over the 2000-2009 period, based on the pay \n     schedule and pay raises specified in the bill as well as \n     current projections of military strength levels and its \n     distribution by pay grade.\n       Special Subsistence Allowance. Section 103 would create a \n     new allowance through 2004 for military personnel who qualify \n     for food stamps. Eligibility for the allowance would \n     terminate if the member no longer qualified for food stamps \n     due to promotions, pay increases, or transfer to a different \n     duty station. In addition, a member would not be eligible for \n     the allowance after receiving it for 12 consecutive months, \n     although they would be able to reapply. CBO estimates that \n     the allowance would increase personnel costs by roughly $13 \n     million in 2000 and $26 million annually through 2004, \n     based on information from DoD on the number of military \n     personnel who currently receive food stamps.\n       CBO estimates that most of the 11,000 personnel in grades \n     E-5 or below will remain on food stamps and apply for the \n     special subsistence allowance. However, the additional $180 \n     of monthly income would reduce the average household's \n     monthly food stamp benefit by $54, resulting in savings of \n     about $7 million each year in the Food Stamp program over the \n     2001-2004 period. The special subsistence allowance might \n     also serve as an incentive for eligible but nonparticipating \n     military personnel to apply for food stamps. CBO estimated \n     that 1,500 additional service members would participate in \n     the Food Stamp program in an average month at an annual cost \n     of $2 million. Thus, this provision is estimated to result in \n     a net savings to the Food Stamp program of $3 million in 2000 \n     and $5 million each year over the 2001-2004 period.\n     Veterans' readjustment benefits\n       As shown in Table 3, the bill contains four provisions that \n     would raise direct spending for veterans' readjustment \n     benefits, specifically the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).\n       Rates of Assistance. Section 301 would raise the rate of \n     educational assistance to certain veterans with service on \n     active duty. Participating veterans who served at least three \n     years on active duty would receive as much as $600 a month \n     instead of $528 a month as under current law. Similar \n     veterans with at least two years of active duty would be \n     eligible for a maximum benefit of $488 a month, an increase \n     of $59 dollars a month. Under section 301, the cost-of-living \n     allowance scheduled for 2000 would not occur. CBO estimates \n     that this provision would increase direct spending by over \n     $100 million a year over the next 10 years, based on current \n     rates of participation in this program.\n       Termination of Member Contributions. Section 302 would \n     eliminate the contribution that MGIB participants pay under \n     current law. Unless members elect not to participate in the \n     MGIB, current law requires a contribution of $1,200 toward \n     the program. Based on current rates of participation, which \n     is nearly universal, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     result in forgone receipts of about $195 million a year.\n       Accelerated Payments. Section 303 would permit veterans to \n     receive a lump-sum payment for benefits they would receive \n     monthly over the term of their training, for example, a \n     semester in college or the period of a course's instruction \n     for other forms of training. CBO estimates that this \n     provision would increase direct spending in 2000 by about \n     $134 million and by about $27 million in 2001. Increased \n     costs would occur initially as payments from one fiscal year \n     are made in the preceding year. There would be no net effect \n     in subsequent years because in a given year payments shifted \n     to the preceding year would be offset by payments shifted \n     from the following year. CBO estimates that about 50 \n     percent of MGIB beneficiaries would elect to receive an \n     accelerated payment in 2000 and that a total of 60 percent \n     would make that election in 2001 and later years. The \n     estimate is also based on current rates of participation \n     in this program.\n\n    TABLE 3.--ESTIMATED COSTS OF PROVISIONS AFFECTING VETERANS' READJUSTMENT BENEFITS IN S. 4, AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n                                                    [Outlays by fiscal years, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Category                     1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     DIRECT SPENDING\n \nSpending Under Current Law for Veterans'       1,374     1,366     1,372     1,385     1,397     1,400     1,405     1,411     1,424     1,446     1,472\n Readjustment Benefits....................\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nProposed Changes:\n    Rates of Assistance...................         0        98       100       101       103       104       105       106       108       110       113\n    Member Contributions..................         0       197       195       195       195       195       195       195       195       195       195\n    Accelerated payments..................         0       134        27         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n \n    Transfer of Entitlement...............         0       110       281       577       592       630       805     1,129     1,612     1,899     2,200\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Subtotal--Proposed Changes............         0       539       603       873       890       929     1,105     1,430     1,915     2,204     2,508\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nSpending Under S. 4 for Veterans'              1,374     1,905     1,975     2,258     2,287     2,329     2,510     2,841     3,339     3,650     3,980\n Readjustment Benefits....................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Transfer of Entitlement. Section 304 would provide DoD with \n     the authority to allow military personnel to transfer their \n     entitlement to MGIB benefits to any combination of spouse and \n     children. CBO expects that DoD would use the authority in \n     2000 to enhance recruiting and retention and that the benefit \n     would be limited to current members of the armed forces and \n     those who might join for the first time. Over the first five \n     years almost all of the estimated costs would stem from \n     transfers to spouses, who would tend to train on a part-time \n     basis. Transfers to members' children are estimated to begin \n     in 2004, and spending for children's education would account \n     for more than half of the program's cost beginning in 2006. \n     CBO estimates that the provision would raise costs by about \n     $110 million in 2000, about $2.2 billion over the first five \n     years, and about $9.8 billion over the 2000-2009 period. In \n     the long run, costs would rise to about $3 billion a year. If \n     the benefit were awarded to current veterans, CBO estimates \n     that the costs would be a couple of billion dollars higher \n     over the 2000-2009 period.\n       CBO assumes that about 35 percent of all MGIB participants \n     would transfer their entitlement to their spouses and \n     children. Currently, about half of all MGIB participants do \n     not use their benefits, thus about 70 percent of the \n     remaining half are expected to transfer it. CBO estimates \n     that about a third of the transfers would be to spouses and \n     that eventually about 200,000 spouses each year would receive \n     a benefit for part-time training, averaging about $2,700 in \n     fiscal year 2000. CBO estimates that in the long run over \n     500,000 children of members or former members would use the \n     educational assistance each year but that level would not be \n     reached until about 2013. Full-time students would receive \n     about $5,400 in 2000 under the bill.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays and \n     governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-go \n     procedures are shown in the following table. For the purposes \n     of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the effects in \n     the current year, the budget year, and the succeeding four \n     years are counted.\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays........................         0       537       599       870       887       927     1,108     1,435     1,940     2,270     2,633\nChanges in receipts.......................         0       -10       -44       -67       -86      -103      -113      -120      -127      -134      -141\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: Section 4 of \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from the \n     application of that act any legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. That exclusion might \n     apply to the provisions of this bill. In any case, the bill \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On September 28, 1998, CBO prepared \n     a cost estimate for a proposal to repeal the Military \n     Retirement Reform Act of 1986 (REDUX). This estimate relies \n     on many of the same actuarial assumptions, models, and \n     estimates from the Office of the Actuary at DoD that CBO used \n     in the earlier estimate. However, this estimate also reflects \n     the provisions of S. 4 that would offer certain members an \n     option to stay under the REDUX system and that would raise \n     the pay base applicable to computing the costs of military \n     retirement.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost: The estimates for \n     defense programs were prepared by Jeannette Deshong (military \n     and civilian personnel) and Dawn Sauter (military retirement \n     and veterans' benefits).

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague has acquainted me with his \nconcerns from the very inception about this piece of legislation. In \nall fairness, he has spoken to us privately, and I think it is \nappropriate that his constructive criticism be shared with all \nSenators.\n  I simply say that this bill is in reaction to two hearings with the \nchairman of the committee and meetings with the members of the Joint \nChiefs. We are trying to do our best.\n  Also, I think it is important from the historical standpoint to put \nin a letter from former Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, dated \n15 November 1985, which addresses a number of the issues that my \ndistinguished colleague covered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 1985.\n     Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: The enclosed report complies with the \n     requirements of section\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n     667 of the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1986.\n       Included in the report are drafts of the two pieces of \n     legislation that would change the military non-disability \n     retirement system. Each would result in a reduction in \n     military retirement accrual funding of $2.9 billion in fiscal \n     year 1986 as mandated by the Congress. This is a 16 percent \n     reduction in military retired pay from the current system and \n     is in addition to the 13 percent reduction that was imposed \n     by the Congress in the high-three-year averaging adjustment \n     in 1980.\n       Although the Department of Defense has prepared the draft \n     legislation as required by the Congress, I want to make it \n     absolutely clear that such action is not to be construed as \n     support for either of the options for change. To the \n     contrary, the Department of Defense is steadfastly opposed to \n     the significant degradation in future combat readiness that \n     would result from the changes required to achieve the \n     mandated reduction. I am particularly concerned about the \n     potential loss of mid-level officers, NCOs and Petty Officers \n     who provide the first-line leadership and technical know-how \n     so vital to the defense mission. Unless offsetting \n     compensation is provided, our models conservatively indicate \n     that our future manning levels in the 10 to 30 year portion \n     of the force would drop below the dismal levels of the late \n     1970s when aviator shortages and shortfalls in Army NCO and \n     Navy Petty Officer leadership seriously degraded our national \n     security posture.\n       While the changes we have been required to submit \n     technically affect only future entrants, we expect an \n     insidious and immediate effect on the morale of the current \n     force. No matter how the reduction is packaged, it \n     communicates the same message, i.e., the perception that \n     there is an erosion in support from the American people for \n     the Service men and women whom we call upon to ensure our \n     safety. It says in absolute terms that the unique, dangerous \n     and vital sacrifices they routinely make are not worth the \n     taxpayers' dollars they receive, which is not overly \n     generous. I do not believe the majority of the American \n     people support this view and ask that you consider this in \n     your deliberations on this very crucial issue to our national \n     security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Caspar Weinberger.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves, \nlet me commend him for his remarks. I have many of the same concerns \nthat he has expressed. I have tried to figure out the best way to \naddress those concerns. I did not see support for addressing those \nconcerns on the Senate floor, frankly, and, therefore have not \nattempted to address some of the ones that he mentioned. I hope they \ncan be addressed in conference. I will be speaking to that later on \nthis afternoon and tomorrow, because, in fact, budget points of order \nlie to many of the matters which have been raised by the Senator from \nOklahoma. Yet, we don't have the Budget Committee here raising those \npoints of order that lie. We will be again exploring that in some depth \nlater on this afternoon, and indicating that if this comes back from \nconference with the same unpaid-for benefits, then points of order \nwould still lie. I hope if it happens that the Budget Committee folks \nwould see fit to raise points of order to lie under the Budget Act \nagainst the benefits that are not paid for; and that, if not, I will \nsurely consider raising a point of order. What the Senator from \nOklahoma said--I think I might be joining in that kind of an effort.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have some remarks to make on the bill itself, and I \nwould like to join in commending my good friend, Senator Warner, for \nthe leadership that he has already provided to raise America's \nattention to the status of our military, to the demands that are being \nplaced upon it around the world, and the need to be able to recruit and \nretain the best quality American men and women in order to sustain \nthose missions.\n  I am pleased that Senator Warner and his committee, as well as the \nPresident, have sent forward proposals to assist us in dealing with \nthis issue. I stand ready to support serious and responsible proposals. \nAlso, I must, however, join in many of the comments that have just been \nmade by our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, about specific \ncomponents of this proposal which are troubling. But it is to a \ndifferent set of issues that I want to direct my attention, and that is \nthe issue of fiscal discipline in this legislation because I fear that \nthis bill ignores the budgetary rules and principles of fiscal \nresponsibility which we have relied upon to guide us to this first \nbalanced budget that we have had in over 30 years.\n  I am concerned that as we take the action that is called for in this \nbill we would be reverting to a path of history which got this country \ninto very serious trouble. It was in the early 1980s, Mr. President, \nthat we had then a Republican in the White House and we had Democrats \nin control of the House of Representatives. Both parties decided that \nthey wanted to support a tax cut for the American people. It was very \npopular. The result was that the Republican President and the \nDemocratic House of Representatives got into a frenzy to see who could \none-up the other in terms of the larger tax cut. And the consequence \nwas that we had a tax cut which went beyond what either side had \ninitially thought was prudent and which some 15 years later resulted in \nthe United States having almost a $6 trillion deficit--a $6 trillion \nnational debt.\n  I hear echoes of that 1980s debate here today as we have the \nPresident offering one set of proposals for significant enhancement in \nmilitary compensation and pension and retirement, and now we have a \nCongress of another party outbidding the President in those same areas \nof compensation and pension and retirement. The echoes I hear today are \nnot just from the early 1980s. They are from as recent as last October.\n  We will recall we adjourned, for all practical purposes, but still \nwith a major piece of undone business in October of 1998, and that \nundone business was a substantial number of the appropriations bills \nwhich had not passed through the normal process of consideration in the \ntwo Houses, conference committees, and final vote and signature into \nlaw by the President. And so during the days of October when most of us \nwere back in our home States, we had this gigantic, what Senator Byrd \nhas referred to as a monstrosity of an appropriations bill, and \ninserted into that monstrosity was the most monstrous, in my opinion, \nof its provisions which was an emergency spending provision.\n  Emergency spending under the Budget Act has always been given special \nconsideration because we are dealing with a narrow set of unexpected \nevents that had traumatic adverse consequences on some of our people. \nIt might be a flood or a hurricane or an earthquake or other type of \ndisaster. The special provision of that emergency appropriation is \nunlike all other spending in the Federal Government; it didn't have to \nmeet the rules of fiscal discipline. You didn't have to find an offset, \nanother source of spending to reduce or a tax to increase to pay for \nemergency spending.\n  But we have been fairly disciplined in the use of that emergency \nappropriation provision, and it had served the Nation well until \nOctober of 1998 when out of this monstrous appropriations bill comes an \nemergency spending provision of almost $22 billion--$22 billion of \nemergency spending, a third to a half of it in items that had never \nbeen of the type that had warranted emergency spending designation. But \nwhen we came back here for a 1-day session in mid-October we were faced \nwith the prospect of voting up or down on this monstrosity, including \nthe emergency spending, or throwing the Government into fiscal chaos. \nAnd so reluctantly many of us, including myself, voted for that \nprovision. We did a very serious error to our Nation's commitment to \nfiscal responsibility through that legislation and particularly through \nthe emergency appropriation.\n  What concerns me, Mr. President, is that was the last act of the \n105th Congress. Now what is about to be the first act after having \ncompleted our role as triers in an impeachment trial, what is our first \nlegislative act of the 106th Congress? It is going to be to pass \nlegislation that is even to a greater degree than that emergency \nappropriation an unfunded expenditure of the Federal Government. We are \nproposing to pass a bill which at the time it was introduced had \nslightly over $14 billion of unfunded direct outlays or reductions in \nreceipts and which now by virtue of amendments adopted in the committee \nand on the floor has added another $2.5 billion of unfunded costs.\n  Mr. President, I would read from the report issued by the \nCongressional Budget Office to Chairman John W. Warner on February 12, \n1999, on page 9\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\nof the report, which I understand has been printed in the Record, the \nsection called ``Pay-As-You-Go Considerations.'' I quote:\n\n       Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for \n     legislation affecting direct spending or receipts. The net \n     changes in outlays and governmental receipts that are subject \n     to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the following \n     tables. For the purposes of enforcing pay as you go \n     procedures, only the effects in the current year, the budget \n     year, and the succeeding four years are counted.\n\n  Mr. President, in that chart it indicates that as the bill was first \nconsidered in committee, there was $14.051 billion unfunded outlays or \nreductions in Federal receipts.\n  So we have legislation here which carries with it serious historical \nbaggage, and we know exactly where that baggage took us in the 1980s. \nFrankly, Mr. President, we don't want to go back there again.\n  There is another consequence, and that is who is going to pay for \nthis baggage in this legislation. It is said, well, we have a surplus \nnow. Let's pay it out of the surplus. Well, the fact is the only \nsurplus we have is the surplus which has been generated by the Social \nSecurity trust fund, a trust fund which is generating more in receipts \nthan in outflows.\n  So, when we talk about paying for this through the surplus, let us \nunderstand that we are paying for this by a direct raid against the \nSocial Security system, since it is only through Social Security that \nany surplus exists.\n  Mr. President, this is a terrible idea. To pass this legislation \nwithout paying for it is irresponsible. It is unfunded spending. It is \na raid on Social Security. It is a clear path back to the out-of-\ncontrol deficits and constant growth in our national debt that we have \nexperienced for the last 20 to 30 years.\n  This bill is a test at the very beginning of the 106th Congress. Can \nwe be trusted to save Social Security? Can we be trusted to manage, \nwith discipline, the surplus that we have? Are we going to spend every \ncent that we can get our hands on, and do it in a way that risks the \nfuture of Social Security?\n  This bill violates the very principles of fiscal responsibility that \nwere created to achieve the balanced budget at which we have now so \nlate arrived. Where is the fiscal discipline? Why are we violating the \npay-as-you-go principle, which the Congressional Budget Office has so \nclearly indicated we are--this principle that has kept us in line and \nallowed us to achieve a balanced budget? Why are we spending the Social \nSecurity surplus before we save Social Security first?\n  The mantra of 1998 was ``Save Social Security First,'' and we \nunderstood that what that meant was that we were committed to secure \nthe Social Security system for three generations, so that some of the \nyoung people who have just joined us in the gallery, when they get \nready to retire, they would have a Social Security system. Why have we \nso quickly moved away from the principle of a secure Social Security \nsystem to the year 2075 before we spend any of the Social Security \nsurplus? Why did we violate that principle in October of 1998? Why are \nwe about to violate that principle again in February of 1999?\n  We have heard some things about the surplus. We have heard that over \nthe next 15 years we are going to have a surplus of approximately $4.7 \ntrillion, and we have heard that surplus is roughly 62 percent made up \nof Social Security surpluses, 38 percent made up of general revenue.\n  Let me tell you a couple of things about those numbers that maybe we \nhave not fully appreciated. First, the $4.7 trillion depends upon a \nwhole set of economic assumptions holding up for 15 years. I would like \nyou to test your confidence in that by going back to the year 1984, and \nseeing what the projections were to the year 1999 and then test how \naccurate those projections were.\n  We have some considerable confidence in the general range of the \nSocial Security surpluses because they are based on a percentage of \npayroll tax; they are based on outlays to a fairly known and \npredictable group of American beneficiaries of Social Security. It is \nthe non-Social Security side of the surplus that is the question mark. \nWhat we are doing, by spending the Social Security-generated surplus \nnow, is asking every current and future Social Security beneficiary to \nbe willing to take the risk that those estimates of what the general \nrevenue surplus will be 10, 12, 15 years from now will prove out to be \naccurate. That is a risk that I am not prepared to ask current and \nfuture Social Security beneficiaries to assume.\n  There is a second aspect about those numbers. There is an assumption \nthat this division of 62 percent/38 percent is a fairly consistent \nallocation. Wrong. If we divide the 15-year period over which this \nprojection has been made into three 5-year components, here is what we \nfind out: In the first 5 years, from 1999 to the year 2003, depending \non whether you are using CBO numbers or Treasury estimates, between 90 \nand 97 percent of that surplus is Social Security--90 to 97 percent in \nthe next 5 years is going to come exclusively from Social Security.\n\n  In the next 5 years, from 2004 to 2008, approximately two-thirds of \nthe surplus will be from Social Security. It is only when you get in \nthe years past the year 2009 that Social Security becomes less than \nhalf of the source of the surplus. And that occurs largely because, in \nthe year 2013, Social Security goes negative; that is, annual receipts \nwill be less than the annual outlays.\n  What we are proposing now is, in the very first year, when more than \n100 percent of the surplus is Social Security--and that is because we \nare still running a deficit in our general revenue accounts--we are \ngoing to start drawing this surplus down. Just as we did in October of \n1998 to pay for nonemergency emergencies, we are now going to be doing \nit to pay for this unfunded compensation package.\n  Mr. President, I think there is a responsible thing to do, and that \nresponsible thing to do is to pay for it. If this is an important \nnational issue, if the security of our country is at risk because of \ndeficient compensation, we should recognize that fact. We should not \nask our grandparents to pay for it by reducing Social Security; we \nshould all be prepared to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, it is my intent to offer an amendment which will cover \nthe original unfunded amount of this legislation and the unfunded \ncomponents that have been added by amendment in committee, and now on \nthe floor. I believe those numbers come to approximately $16.5 billion. \nI have asked the staff to confirm that those numbers are correct. If \nthey are correct, I will offer an amendment which has three \nprovisions--two of them are extensions of excise taxes which have now \nlapsed. They are primarily in the Superfund area. And the third is a \ntax provision which was offered and adopted by Senator Coverdell, as \npart of other legislation during the 105th Congress, and relates to the \ntaxation of foreign source income.\n  Those three provisions would produce the amount of revenue necessary \nto cover the $16.5 billion over the next 10 years of the unfunded \ncomponent of this legislation. Once I have verified the correctness of \nthe numbers, I will submit that amendment.\n  Mr. President, this will give us an opportunity to be responsible in \ntwo ways. We would be responsible to our national security by providing \nthe kind of compensation program that would attract and retain the \nquality Americans that we need in order to defend our Nation and \nadvance our national interests around the world. We would be \nresponsible to this and future generations of Americans by saying we \nwill pay for these costs, not ask that they be added to the already \nenormous credit card debt that our grandchildren are eventually going \nto have to be paying as a result of the previous absence of discipline.\n  So, we have an opportunity to redeem ourselves, and as the first act \nof the 106th Congress, not to set an example of wasteful lack of \ndiscipline, but, rather, of fiscal maturity, of fiscal responsibility, \nwhich I believe will be very well received by all of our fellow \nAmericans.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to allow Mr. Erik Lieberman \nand Ms. Rebecca Schwalbach to have the privilege of the floor during \nthe pendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has the distinguished\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nSenator from Florida sent his amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not sent an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I may?\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my intention, as soon as we verify the additional \nunfunded amendments which we have in committee and on the floor, and \ntherefore have a total of the extent of unfunded outlays under S. 4, to \nthen offer an amendment which will be sufficient to cover the full \nextent of those unfunded items. I have not yet sent up that amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. My understanding is you have not yet sent the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have not yet sent up that amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the list of \n  diseases presumed to be service-connected with respect to radiation-\n                           exposed veterans)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to speak about an \namendment that I will offer soon. I do so for purposes of moving our \ndeliberations forward in the U.S. Senate. This amendment is identical--\nalthough I may make some changes if we are able to reach a compromise--\nbut in its present form, it is identical to S. 1385, the Justice for \nAtomic Veterans Act, which I introduced in the 105th Congress. An \namended version of this bill was reported out of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee on July 28, 1998.\n  This amendment would remove some of the frustrating and infuriating \nobstacles that have too often kept veterans who were exposed to \nradiation during military service from getting the disability \ncompensation they deserve. My amendment clears the way for these \nveterans by adding some radiogenic diseases--we are now negotiating \nwhich ones--to the list of diseases that are presumed service-\nconnected. This is, colleagues, the only solution. It is the only way \nof ensuring that ``atomic veterans'' have any realistic chance of \nproving their disability claims. And our treatment of atomic veterans \nis, Mr. President, a long and sad and shameful history in our country.\n  Why am I offering this amendment now? The rationale for S. 4 is to \nrecruit young people for service in the military, and retain them by \nenhancing pay, retirement, and educational benefits.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that potential recruits may be \ninfluenced by more than just the pay and the benefits. Senator \nCleland's committee amendment certainly recognizes that one important \nfactor in recruitment and retention is the way we treat our veterans \nafter they leave the service.\n  I very much agree that the way we treat our veterans does send an \nimportant message to young people considering service in the military. \nWhen veterans of the Persian Gulf war do not get the kind of treatment \nthey deserve, when the VA budget, year after year, does not give \nveterans a stable source of funding for VA health care, when veterans' \nbenefits claims take years and years to resolve--so people are waiting \n3 years for compensation--the message that we are sending to \nprospective recruits is not a very encouraging one.\n  Making sure we treat veterans right is, in fact, the philosophy \nbehind the Rockefeller amendment. How can we attract and retain young \npeople in the service when our Government fails to honor its obligation \nto provide just compensation and health care for those injured during \nservice?\n  One of the most outrageous examples of our Government's failure to \nhonor its obligation to veterans involves the atomic veterans, \npatriotic Americans who were exposed to radiation at Hiroshima and \nNagasaki and at atmospheric nuclear tests.\n  I want to say this to colleagues. Before you consider tabling the \namendment--and I hope you do not--and before you consider your vote, \nplease examine this history with me. For more than 50 years, many of \nthese atomic veterans have been denied compensation for diseases that \nthe VA recognizes as being linked to their exposure to radiation--\ndiseases known as radiogenic diseases. Many of these diseases are \nlethal forms of cancer.\n  I received my first introduction to the plight of atomic veterans--\nand there is no issue I feel more strongly about as a Senator--from \nsome first-rate mentors, the members of the Forgotten 216th. The \nForgotten 216th was the 216th Chemical Service Company of the U.S. Army \nwhich participated in Operation Tumbler Snapper. Operation Tumbler \nSnapper was a series of eight atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the \nNevada desert in 1952.\n  About half of the members of the Forgotten 216th were Minnesotans. \nWhat have I learned from them and from other atomic veterans? What have \nI learned from their survivors? And how has this shaped my views as a \nU.S. Senator?\n  Five years ago, the Forgotten 216th contacted me after then-Secretary \nof Energy Hazel O'Leary announced that the U.S. Government had \nconducted radiation experiments on its own citizens. And for the first \ntime in public, these veterans revealed what happened to them in Nevada \nduring the tests and the tragedies and the traumas that they, their \nfamilies, and their former buddies have experienced since then.\n  Because their experiences and problems typify those of atomic \nveterans nationwide, I would like to tell my colleagues a little more \nabout the Forgotten 216th. In fact, I am proud to talk about them on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. I am pleased to take up some time talking \nabout these atomic veterans. When you hear their story, I think you \nwill agree that the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them must \nnever be forgotten again.\n  Members of the 216th were sent to measure fallout at or near ground \nzero immediately after nuclear blasts in Nevada. They were exposed to \nso much radiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while \nthey inhaled and ingested radioactive particles. They were given \nminimal or no protection by the Government. They frequently had no film \nbadges to measure radiation exposure. They were given no information on \nthe perils they faced. And now, 50 years later, we say we don't have \nthe money to provide them compensation.\n\n  After all this, they were sworn to secrecy about their participation \nin the nuclear tests. They were often denied access to their own \nservice medical records and they were provided no medical follow-up.\n  For decades, atomic veterans have been America's most neglected \nveterans. They have been deceived and treated shabbily by the \nGovernment they so selflessly and unquestioningly served.\n  If the U.S. Government can't be counted on to honor its obligation to \nthese deserving veterans, and that is what this amendment is about, how \ncan young people interested in military service have any confidence the \nGovernment will do any better by them? If we don't finally provide \ncompensation to these veterans, what does that tell young people who \nare thinking about serving in the armed services?\n  Mr. President, I believe that the neglect of the atomic veterans \nshould stop here and now. Our Government has a long overdue debt to \nthese patriotic Americans, a debt that we in the Senate can help to \nrepay. And we can repay it now. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to help repay this debt by supporting this amendment.\n  This legislation and this amendment have enjoyed the strong support \nof veterans service organizations. Both the American Legion and the \nDisabled American Veterans, DAV, provided strong letters of support to \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for its April 1998 hearing. They \nhave also written letters of support for this legislation.\n  Recently, the Independent Budget for fiscal year 2000, which is the \nbudget recommendation issued by AMVETS, DAV, PVA, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, endorsed adding these radiogenic diseases to the VA's \npresumptive service-connected list. I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my statement, the American Legion and the DAV letters of \nsupport and the relevant excerpt from the fiscal year 2000 Independent \nBudget be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me briefly describe the problem that my amendment \nis intended to address. When atomic\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nveterans try to claim VA compensation for their illness--this is the \nproblem--the VA almost invariably denies their claims. VA tells these \nveterans that the radiation doses were too low--below 5 rems. But the \nfact is, we don't really know that, and even if we did, that is no \nexcuse for denying these claims.\n  The result of this unrealistic standard is that it is almost \nimpossible for these atomic veterans to prove their case. The only \nsolution is to add the conditions in my amendment to the VA presumptive \nservice-connected list. That is what my amendment does. It covers a \nwhole range of cancers that should be a part of these diseases. They \nshould get compensation.\n  First of all, trying to go back and determine the precise dosage each \nof these veterans was exposed to is a futile undertaking. Scientists \nagree that the dose reconstruction performed by the VA is notoriously \nunreliable.\n  The General Accounting Office itself has noted the inherent \nuncertainties of dose reconstruction. Even the VA scientific personnel \nhave conceded its unreliability. And in a memo to VA Secretary Togo \nWest, VA Under Secretary for Health Ken Kizer--and I thank Dr. Kizer \nfor his courage--has recommended that the VA reconsider its opposition \nto S. 1385, in part based upon the unreliability of dose \nreconstruction.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Kizer's \nmemo be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In addition, none of the scientific experts who \ntestified at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on S. 1385 on April \n21, 1998, supported the use of dose reconstruction to determine \neligibility for VA benefits.\n  Let me tell you why dose reconstruction is so difficult. Dr. Marty \nGensler on my staff has researched this issue for over 5 years. This is \nwhat he has found.\n  Many atomic veterans were sent to ground zero immediately after a \nnuclear test with no protection, no information on the known dangers \nthey faced, no badges or other monitoring equipment, and no medical \nfollow up.\n  As early as 1946, ranking military and civilian personnel responsible \nfor nuclear testing anticipated claims for service-connected disability \nand sought to ensure that--quote--no successful suits could be brought \non account of radiological hazards. Unquote.\n  That quotation comes from documents declassified by the President's \nAdvisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments.\n  The VA, during this period, maintained classified records--quote--\nessential--unquote--to evaluating atomic veterans' claims, but these \nrecords were unavailable to veterans themselves.\n  Atomic veterans were sworn to secrecy and were denied access to their \nown service and medical records for many years, effectively barring \npursuit of compensation claims.\n  It's partly as a result of these missing or incomplete records that \nso many people have doubts about the validity of dose reconstructions \nfor atomic veterans, some of which are performed more than fifty years \nafter exposure.\n  Even if these veteran's exposure was less than 5 rems, which is the \nstandard used by VA, this standard is not based on uncontested science. \nIn 1994, for example, GAO stated: ``A low level dose has been estimated \nto be somewhere below 10 rems [but] it is not known for certain whether \ndoses below this level are detrimental to public health.''\n  Despite persistent doubts about VA's and DoD's dose reconstruction, \nand despite doubts about the science on which VA's 5 rem standard is \nbased, these dose reconstructions are used to bar veterans from \ncompensation for disabling radiogenic conditions.\n  The effects of this standard have been devastating. A little over two \nyears ago the VA estimated that less than 50 claims for non-presumptive \ndiseases had been approved out of over 18,000 radiation claims filed.\n  Atomic veterans might as well not even bother. Their chances of \nobtaining compensation are negligible.\n  It is impossible for many atomic veterans and their survivors to be \ngiven ``the benefit of the doubt'' by the VA while their claims hinges \non the dubious accuracy and reliability of dose reconstruction and the \nhealth effect of exposure to low-level ionizing radiation remain \nuncertain.\n  This problem can be fixed. The reason atomic veterans have to go \nthrough this reconstruction at all is that the 10 diseases listed in my \namendment are not presumed to be service-connected. That's the real \nproblem.\n  VA already has a list of service-connected diseases that are presumed \nservice-connected, but these 10 are not on it.\n  This makes no sense. Scientists agree that there is at least as \nstrong a link between radiation exposure and these 10 diseases as there \nis to the other diseases on that VA list.\n  The President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \nagreed in 1995 that VA's current list should be expanded. The Committee \ncited concerns that ``the listing of diseases for which relief is \nautomatically provided--the presumptive diseases provided for by the \n1988 law--is incomplete and inadequate'' and that ``the standard of \nproof for those without presumptive disease is impossible to meet and, \ngive the questionable condition of the exposure records retained by the \ngovernment, inappropriate.'' The President's Advisory Committee urged \nCongress to address the concerns of atomic veterans and their families \n``promptly.''\n  The unfair treatment of atomic veterans becomes especially clear when \ncompared to both Agent Orange and Persian Gulf veterans. In \nrecommending that the Administration support S. 1385, Under Secretary \nfor Health Kenneth Kizer cited the indefensibility of denying \npresumptive service connection for atomic veterans in light of the \npresumption for Persian Gulf War veterans and Agent Orange veterans.\n  In 1993, the VA decided to make lung cancer presumptively service-\nconnected for Agent Orange veterans. That decision was based on a \nNational Academy of Sciences study that had found a link only where \nAgent Orange exposures were ``high and prolonged,'' but pointed out \nthere was only a ``limited'' capability to determine individual \nexposures.\n  For atomic veterans, however, lung cancer continues to be non-\npresumptive. In short, the issue of exposure levels poses an almost \ninsurmountable obstacle to approval of claim by atomic veterans, while \nthe same problem is ignored for Agent Orange veterans.\n  Persian Gulf War veterans can receive compensation for symptoms, or \nillnesses that may be linked to their service in the Persian Gulf, at \nleast until scientists reach definitive conclusions about the etiology \nof their health problems. Unfortunately, atomic veterans aren't given \nthe same consideration or benefit of the doubt.\n  Mr. President, I believe this state of affairs is outrageous and \nunjust. The struggle of atomic veterans for justice has been long, \nhard, and frustrating. But these patriotic, dedicated and deserving \nveterans have persevered. My amendment would finally provide them the \njustice that they so much deserve.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in helping atomic veterans win their struggle by supporting my \namendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The American Legion encourages you to \n     cosponsor S. 1385, the Justice for Atomic Veterans Act of \n     1997, introduced by Senator Paul Wellstone.\n       The American Legion fully supports S. 1385. It grants the \n     benefit of the doubt to sick and dying veterans of the cold \n     war, and it rights the wrong of our government ignoring these \n     veterans for so many decades.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United \n     States General Accounting Office both admit that the \n     radiation dose that veterans were exposed to when assigned to \n     atomic weapon's tests is impossible to determine. Yet VA has \n     granted only 80 disability compensation claims out of over \n     18,000 filed for service connected illnesses caused by \n     radiation exposure. S. 1385 would reverse this trend.\n       Senator Wellstone's bill is short and simple. It adds to \n     the list of diseases presumed to be service connected for \n     radiation-exposed veterans. Under this bill, specific cancers \n     and other diseases known to be caused by radiation exposure \n     would become service connected for veterans exposed to \n     radiation.\n       Thank you for your continued support of America's veterans \n     and their families.\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\n     Please support and cosponsor S. 1385, the Justice for Atomic \n     Veterans Act of 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Sommer, Jr.,\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Paul David Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I write you today regarding a \n     matter of utmost importance to the more than one million \n     members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), the \n     expansion of the list of presumptive service-connected \n     disabilities for atomic veterans. Last Congress, you \n     introduced S. 1385, the ``Justice for Atomic Veterans Act,'' \n     to expand the list of presumptive disabilities for atomic \n     veterans. The DAV strongly supported the passage of this \n     legislation.\n       It is our understanding that you intend to introduce an \n     amendment on the Senate floor on February 23, 1999, to add \n     ten radiogenic disabilities to the presumptive list, as \n     originally contained in S. 1385. Again, the DAV strongly \n     supports your efforts.\n       The DAV has a long-standing resolution calling for \n     legislation to provide presumptive service connection to \n     atomic veterans for all recognized radiogenic diseases. I \n     have enclosed a copy of Resolution No. 006, passed by the \n     delegates at our National Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, \n     August 23-27, 1998.\n       Your amendment would provide for a measure of fairness, \n     equity and justice too long withheld from atomic veterans, \n     their dependents and survivors. It is shameful that our \n     Government has failed to adequately address the needs of \n     atomic veterans, their families and survivors. Your amendment \n     would correct that oversight.\n       We hope that your colleagues in the Senate will support \n     this long overdue legislation. Thank you for your efforts on \n     behalf of sick and disabled veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Andrew A. Kistler,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n       Enclosure.\n\n  Resolution No. 006--To Support Legislation Authorizing Presumptive \n             Service Connection For All Radiogenic Diseases\n\n       Whereas, members of the United States Armed Services have \n     participated in test detonation of nuclear devices and served \n     in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan following the detonation of \n     nuclear bombs; and\n       Whereas, the United States government knew or should have \n     known of the potential harm to the health and well-being of \n     these military members; and\n       Whereas, atomic veterans served their country with honor, \n     courage, and devotion to duty; and\n       Whereas, remedial legislation passed by Congress in 1984 \n     has not been effective in providing compensation to those \n     atomic veterans suffering from radiogenic diseases; and\n       Whereas, by the VA's own admission, approximately no more \n     than 50 claimants have obtained disability compensation or \n     dependency indemnity compensation pursuant to Public Law 98-\n     542; and\n       Whereas, the government has spent tens of millions of \n     dollars to provide dose reconstruction estimates which do not \n     accurately reflect actual radiation dose exposure; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Disabled American Veterans in National \n     Convention assembled in Las Vegas, Nevada, August 23-27, \n     1998, supports legislation to provide presumptive service \n     connection to atomic veterans for all recognized radiogenic \n     diseases.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Presumption of Service Connection for Radiation-Related Disabilities\n\n       Despite scientific recognition that the diseases named \n     under 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.311 (1998) may be induced by ionizing \n     radiation, VA almost invariably denies veterans' claims for \n     service connection of such diseases, and legislation is \n     therefore needed to create a statutory presumption of service \n     connection for these ``radiogenic'' diseases.\n       In 1984, Congress enacted the Veterans' Dioxin and \n     Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, Pub. L. No. \n     98-542, out of concern that deserving veterans were not \n     receiving compensation for disabilities related to dioxin and \n     radiation exposure. In accordance with that law, VA issued a \n     regulation to govern the standards for determination of \n     service connection for radiation-related disabilities. That \n     regulation, what is now Sec. 3.311, includes special \n     procedures for determining service connection for diseases \n     recognized as radiogenic. Out of thousands of claims \n     considered under these procedures, only a negligible number \n     have been allowed.\n       The available records on levels of radiation exposure \n     incredibly suggest that almost no members of the Armed Forces \n     who participated in nuclear weapons testing or the occupation \n     of Nagasaki or Hiroshima were exposed to levels of radiation \n     sufficient to cause disease. These records are controversial \n     and subject to widespread suspicion regarding their accuracy. \n     Congress has partially remedied this unfair situation by \n     enacting a statutory presumption of service connection for \n     certain of these disabilities.\n       Under the presumption, these dubious exposure records and \n     dose estimates for test participants and members of the \n     occupation forces are not an impediment to service connection \n     because Congress excluded the level of radiation exposure \n     from consideration. Veterans with the same exposures, but \n     whose radiogenic diseases are not included in the presumption \n     statute, are still virtually certain to be denied \n     compensation, however, on the basis that the level of \n     radiation to which they were exposed was too low to be \n     responsible for their disease.\n       The presumption statute, 38 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1112(c) (West \n     1991 & Supp. 1998), does not include the following diseases, \n     although they are recognized as radiogenic: lung cancer; bone \n     cancer; skin cancer; colon cancer; posterior subcapsular \n     cataracts; nonmalignant thyroid nodular disease; ovarian \n     cancer; parathyroid adenoma; tumors of the brain and central \n     nervous system; and rectal cancer.\n       Accordingly, these radiogenic diseases should be included \n     under Sec. 1112(c).\n\n\n                             recommendation\n\n       Congress should enact legislation to include in the \n     statutory presumption for service connection of radiation-\n     related disabilities lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, \n     colon cancer, posterior subcapsular cataracts, nonmalignant \n     thyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, parathyroid adenoma, \n     tumors of the brain and central nervous system, and rectal \n     cancer.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1998.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     From: Under Secretary for Health (10).\n     Subject: Request for reconsideration of the department's \n         position on S. 1385 (Wellstone).\n     To: Secretary (00).\n\n       1. I request that you reconsider the Department's position \n     on S. 1385 (Wellstone), which would add a number of \n     conditions as presumptive service-connected conditions for \n     atomic veterans to those already prescribed by law. I only \n     learned that the Department was opposing this measure last \n     night on reading the Department's prepare testimony for \n     today's hearing; I had no input into that testimony. Indeed, \n     my views on this bill have not been obtained. I would \n     strongly support this bill as a matter of equity and \n     fairness.\n       2. I do not think the Department's current opposition to S. \n     1385 is defensible in view of the Administration's position \n     on presumed service-connection for Gulf War veterans, as well \n     as its position on Agent Orange and Vietnam veterans.\n       3. While the scientific methodology that is the basis for \n     adjudicating radiation exposure cases may be sound, the \n     problem is that the exposure cannot be reliably determined \n     for many individuals, and it never will be able to be \n     determined in my judgment. Thus, no matter how good the \n     method is, if the input is not valid then the determination \n     will be suspect.\n       4. I ask that we formally reconsider and change the \n     Department's position on S. 1385. I feel the proper and \n     prudent position for the Department is to support S. 1385.\n\n                                    Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D., M.P.H.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does my colleague from Virginia have a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are ready to clear the Senator's amendment if \nwe can move along. We are anxious to get a unanimous consent so we can \ncomplete this bill. I don't want to cut the Senator off. He has my \nsupport.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will tell you, I have been in the \nU.S. Senate now for 8 years, and I love to speak when it is an issue \nthat is so important to me and so important to veterans. But if my \ncolleagues are supporting my amendment, I thank them for their support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator send that amendment to the desk so we \ncan examine the final form? I have been involved in these issues for \nsome years myself, and I am delighted to see he is helping these \nveterans.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 27.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. WARNER. We need to know, Mr. President, what is in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue reading.\n  The bill clerk continued with the reading, as follows:\n\n       On page 46, after line 16, add the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 501.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING USE OF EXTENSION OF \n                   TIME TO FILE TAX RETURNS FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   UNIFORMED SERVICES ON DUTY ABROAD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Service provides a 2-month \n     extension of the deadline for filing tax returns for members \n     of the uniformed services who are in an area outside the \n     United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for a tour \n     of duty which includes the date for filing tax returns;\n       (2) any taxpayer using this 2-month extension who owes \n     additional tax must pay the tax on or before the regular \n     filing deadline;\n       (3) those who use the 2-month extension and wait to pay the \n     additional tax at the time of filing are charged interest \n     from the regular filing deadline, and may also be required to \n     pay a penalty; and\n       (4) it is fundamentally unfair to members of the uniformed \n     services who make use of this extension to require them to \n     pay penalties and interest on the additional tax owed.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the 2-month extension of the deadline for filing tax \n     returns for certain members of the uniformed services \n     provided in Internal Revenue Service regulations should be \n     codified; and\n       (2) eligible members of the uniformed services should be \n     able to make use of the extension without accumulating \n     interest or penalties.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, American soldiers in the modern \nmilitary operate under a great deal of strain. Forced to work harder \nwith fewer resources, our men and women in uniform bear a heavy burden \ndefending our nation. This is especially true for those deployed \noverseas. Not only must these troops defend American interests, but \nthey also live under constant threat of attack and must spend months \naway from their homes and their families.\n  In addition to their duty to protect our nation's security, American \nservicemen and women still must fulfill obligations back home, such as \npaying their taxes. However, in an incredible cart-before-the-horse \nscheme that could only be found in our nation's tax code, the federal \ngovernment extends for our troops abroad the deadline for filing income \ntax forms by two months, but requires that servicemen and women still \npay interest and penalties during the extension period. In other words, \nthey must pay their tax bill before they are required to file their tax \nbill. Mr. President, this is unconscionable.\n  This sense of the Senate on uniformed services filing fairness, which \nI propose today with Senator McCain, is simple. It puts the Senate on \nrecord calling for the codification of the current two-month extension \nperiod available to our uniformed personnel and for the elimination of \nthe interest and penalties that would otherwise be charged. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates the cost of this common-sense \ncorrection at just $4 million over ten years. Mr. President, how can we \nnot afford to move forward on this matter?\n  We must show our nation's soldiers that we support them through \nconcrete action. The amendment I introduce puts the Senate on the path \ntoward making the lives of soldiers stationed overseas a little easier. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in this simple, inexpensive \ncorrection of an unfair tax law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nCoverdell's sense-of-the-Senate amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights expressing support for \nlegislation to provide a two-month interest- and penalty-free extension \nto file Federal taxes for U.S. military personnel who are on duty \nabroad.\n  I recently supported this concept as an original cosponsor of S. 308, \nthe Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act, which provided a two-month \ninterest- and penalty-free extension to file Federal taxes for U.S. \nmilitary personnel who are on duty abroad. This simple fix to an \nisolated section of our overly complex tax code is very straightforward \nand would only cost $2 million over 5 years.\n  Current Treasury regulations allow military personnel to file Federal \ntax forms on June 15 rather than April 15. However, filers who elect to \nuse this exception are still subject to interest and penalties during \nthat two-month grace period.\n  S. 308 codifies the existing Treasury regulations and adds a waiver \nof the interest and penalties that could be charged during the two-\nmonth grace period against military personnel who elect to take the \nfiling exception.\n  Military personnel serving their country overseas are often isolated \nfrom the resources necessary to prepare their tax returns. The Internal \nRevenue Service and the Department of the Treasury recognized this \nreality and provided our Nation's military personnel with a much-needed \ntwo-month grace period to file their taxes.\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\n  However, it is inconsistent to grant a grace period for filers, and \nthen penalize those who take it. These brave men and women have not \ncommitted any wrongdoing; all they are doing is serving their country.\n  Travel to remove regions is inherent to military service. In 1998 \nalone, the United States had approximately 37,000 men and women \ndeployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, if so \nordered. There were also 8,000 American troops deployed in Bosnia, and \nanother 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support of other \ncommitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 women and men \ndeployed outside of the United States, away from their primary home, \nprotecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear.\n  We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with interest and penalties merely because the \nunique characteristics of their job makes it difficult to file their \ntaxes on time. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods \nof time away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the tax code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  S. 308 will restore equity and consistency to this tax provision, \nand, at the same time, provide a small measure of tax relief to our men \nand women in the military.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Coverdell, and myself to support \nthis much-needed sense of the Senate amendment to S. 4, and to work to \nenact S. 308.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my understanding that this is cleared on the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside. I think there is broad support for this amendment. What it would \ndo is to permit people who are overseas in contingencies to file late \nincome tax returns. I think that is the only fair way to do it.\n  It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I am proud to cosponsor this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 28) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every Senator supports our men and women in \nuniform, and we all have heard the troubling retention and recruiting \nreports coming from the military. The Administration and Congress need \nto address these problems. Many items in this bill build on the \nPresident's initiative to improve compensation for our military \npersonnel. The Armed Services Committee has added other provisions that \nwill enhance our Nation's ability to attract and retain high-quality \npersonnel.\n  However, it should concern us, just as it should concern our \npersonnel in uniform, that this bill has not yet been provided for in \nthe budget. The plain fact is that this bill is being considered at the \nwrong time. We should have waited until the Senate completed its annual \nwork on a comprehensive budget framework. Social Security, Medicare, \nretirement of the national debt, discretionary spending and tax cuts \nare all issues that need to be considered at the time that we decide to \ncommit billions to defense or any other spending program. This bill \nshould have been considered in conjunction with the rest of the defense \nauthorization bill, because under the currently structured budget caps, \nthe new spending in this bill will have to be offset by other cuts in \ndefense to pay for it, and this is an enormously expensive bill.\n  Much of this bill is warranted. I will vote for it because the \neffectiveness of our military depends on the quality of its personnel. \nThis bill will improve the quality of our military, but with little \nregard for fiscal concerns. I hope that this does not become a trend in \nthe 106th Congress and I expect the final concerns to be addressed in \nconference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff and many members of this body have \nexpressed concern over the state of our military forces. One of the \nmost serious problems identified by the Joint Chiefs is the recruitment \nand retention of dedicated and highly trained personnel. This \nlegislation begins the process of rectifying that situation. Our Armed \nForces must not only be able to fight and win on the battlefield, they \nmust be able to compete for high quality personnel against robust \nprivate sector employers. I am proud to say that this bill gives our \nmilitary a much more equitable chance to recruit and retain the best \npersons this country has to offer.\n  This legislation authorizes a significant and long overdue military \npay raise. It enhances two long time staples of recruitment and \nretention; the military retirement system and the Montgomery G.I. bill. \nIt authorizes a subsistence allowance for enlisted personnel so that no \nmilitary member will be forced to live on food stamps. Finally, I am \nvery pleased that this bill includes an authorization for military \npersonnel to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan similar to the plans \nafforded other non-uniformed Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, the bill which I stand in support of today should be \nconsidered as a beginning. Congress has an explicit constitutional duty \nto see that the Armed Forces are equipped and maintained. Their unique \ntask is daunting and at times life threatening. The Congress and this \nadministration should not treat military service as just another job. \nThis bill represents the Senate's view that the personnel of America's \nArmed Forces are worth a significant investment. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  To every member of our Armed Forces, whether afloat, ashore or \nairborne, wherever they are in the world, I say thank you and well \ndone!\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: I am proud to support the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights. This legislation \nfulfills the promises made to the men and women of our armed forces.\n  Our men and women in uniform stand for everything that is good about \nour country--patriotism, courage, loyalty, duty and honor. They deserve \nour full support--not just with words but with actions.\n  I am alarmed about the problems of recruitment and retention facing \nour military. Improved pay and benefits are essential to recruiting and \nretaining the best people to serve our country. We are all concerned \nabout the problems the services are having in meeting their recruitment \ngoals. We're also troubled that so many of the highest skilled military \nchoose to retire early.\n  This legislation will address these problems. By providing a 4.8 \npercent pay increase, we will help to close the gap between military \nand civilian pay. We will provide special incentives to those serving \nin critical specialties. We will also improve educational benefits and \nhealth care for our active military and retirees.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has amended this bill to improve \nbenefits for the National Guard and Reserves. They are our nation's \n911--always ready in time of emergency at home or abroad. They deserve \nrecognition for their important role.\n  This bill also includes the Sarbanes/Warner/Mikulski amendment that \nputs the Senate on record on behalf of our federal employees. Our \ncivilian workforce is essential--whether they work at our defense \nbases, at the National Institutes of Health or at any other federal \nfacility. They have the same patriotism, honor and dedication as our \nmilitary--and they can't be left behind on pay or benefits.\n  I share my colleagues concerns about the cost of this legislation. It \nwill require tough choices and it may require some changes in \nconference. I hope that these issues will be considered in the context \nof our entire defense budget.\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\n  Mr. President, if we are to maintain the world's best military, we \nneed to invest more in our most important national security resource--\nthe men and women of our armed forces. This legislation will show that \nwe support our American military--both with our words and our actions.\n  Mr. CRAIG: Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nspeak about S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill \nof Rights Act of 1999.\n  For too long, Idahoans have been contacting me to express their \nconcerns about quality-of-life issues for service members. I am pleased \nthat this bill is a step to address some of the most urgent quality-of-\nlife needs of the men and women in uniform, and their families. It \ncontains a much needed pay raise, and reforms the current military pay \ntables. It also provides more options for retirement benefits, and \nincreases educational benefits through changes to the Montgomery G.I. \nBill. These quality-of-life improvement will help to ensure that we are \nable to recruit and retain the best personnel.\n  However, despite my support for this bill, it is important to keep in \nmind that this bill will do nothing to change one of the factors \ndriving so many of the best and the brightest away from service. This \nlegislation will not decrease the operational tempo of our troops.\n  In the last five years the President has sent U.S. forces abroad in \nmajor engagements some 50 times in comparison to 18 times during the \nReagan Administration and 14 times during the Bush Administration. To \nexacerbate the problem, the number of men and women in uniform has been \nsignificantly reduced over the last decade. Simultaneously, the number \nof deployed missions has nearly quadrupled. Not only are U.S. soldiers \nforced a work longer and harder than ever before, they are also sent on \ndeployment for longer period of time than before.\n  We continue to enforce the so-called ``peace'' in Bosnia, maintain a \npresence in Haiti, and in recent days President Clinton was virtually \npromised to deploy, on a moments notice, 4,000 soldiers again make \npeace in Kosovo.\n  Frankly, I find the Administration's eagerness to engage in non-\ntraditional military missions such as humanitarian and peacekeeping \nendeavors not only a dangerous foreign policy proposition, but \nextremely detrimental to doing the very thing S. 4 is trying to \naccomplish--ensuring real quality-of-life for service men and women. I \nwould be willing to bet that a number of soldiers might consider \nforegoing a pay raise if it meant that he or she wouldn't miss another \nThanksgiving or Christmas away from home and loved-ones.\n  Let me close by saying, I am pleased that the Senate has made this \nimportant legislation the first item of business in the new session of \nCongress. I certainly believe that the young men and women of Idalho's \n366th Wing at the Mountain Home Air Force Base deserve a raise, better \nretirement benefits, and better options for educational opportunities \nthrough the Montgomery GI Bill. However, the President must also \ncarefully consider the impact of the current operational tempo on our \ntroops, and work to better this tremendous impediment to true quality-\nof-life.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I strongly support the goals of this \nlegislation, to improve recruitment and retention rates. Those rates \nhave sagged in the last year to 18 months, and we need to do something \nabout that. After all, our nation's security depends on ensuring that \nthe military is able to recruit and retain high quality personnel.\n  President Clinton agrees with that. He's proposing to increase the \ndefense budget by $112 billion over 6 years, and he's allocated $35 \nbillion to meet the challenges of recruitment and retirement. The \nPresident's budget provides an across-the-board pay raise of 4.4 \npercent, reforms the pay table to reward personnel for high \nperformance, and modifies the current retirement system.\n  President Clinton is proposing these initiatives within a \ncomprehensive and balanced plan that enhances troop readiness and \nincreases the pace of our force's modernization. He also does it as \npart of a budget that reserves the surplus to shore up Social Security \nand Medicare, pays down the debt, and provides tax relief to average \nAmericans.\n  S. 4, on the other hand, provides a more generous pay raise, more \naggressively changes the military retirement system, creates a Thrift \nSavings Plan for military personnel, and increases GI bill benefits. \nBased on data from CBO staff, this bill will cost $7.5 billion more \nthan the President's initiatives over the next 6 years, and $19 billion \nmore over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, given my support for the underlying goals of this \nlegislation, I'm reluctant to oppose it. But I do have real concerns \nabout the way we're proceeding.\n  First, the Armed Services Committee hasn't held a single hearing to \nanalyze the causes of the current recruitment and retention problems, \nor to evaluate remedies. Many argue that increasing pay and retirement \nbenefits won't really solve the problem. GAO, CBO, and Rand are all \nconducting studies on these issues and are due to issue reports in the \nnext few months.\n  In addition, the committee has failed to say where the additional \nfunding will come from. If it comes out of other defense programs, \nSecretary Cohen fears we could end up compromising our troops' \nreadiness and DOD's modernization program. If it comes out of other \nprograms, what will that mean for programs like Social Security and \nMedicare?\n  Unfortunately, we're considering this legislation before the Budget \nCommittee has even begun consideration of a budget resolution. And \nthat's a mistake. In my view, before we approve any bill that commits \nourselves to significant new spending, we need to reach agreement on a \nbroader fiscal framework. We need to figure out how to save Social \nSecurity, strengthen Medicare, provide tax relief for ordinary \nAmericans, and make needed commitments to education and other needs.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that this legislation is not likely to \nmove in the House of Representatives any time soon. And so it probably \nwon't be sent to the President until after the broader budget debate is \nconcluded. With that understanding, I am not inclined to oppose the \nlegislation, which will send a needed signal that Congress is serious \nabout dealing with military recruitment and retention.\n  Still, Mr. President, we need to put a lot more thought into this \nbefore sending it to the President. We need to be sure we're promoting \nrecruitment and retention in a cost-effective way. And, more \nimportantly, we need to figure out how we're going to pay for this.\n  As it is, Mr. President, we're putting the cart before the horse. And \nthat, in my view, is a poor way to legislate.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, let me begin by commending the work of \nSecretary Cohen, General Shelton, and the rest of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff for recognizing the serious issues of recruitment and retention \nthat S. 4 is written to address. Let me also thank Chairman Warner, \nRanking Member Levin, Personnel Subcommittee Chairman Allard and his \nRanking Member Cleland, as well as the other members of the Armed \nServices Committee. This legislation is a tremendous effort to address \none of the most critical issues currently facing our men and women in \nuniform.\n  While I support much of the content of S. 4, I have some real \nproblems with the process we are pursuing to meet the requirements of \nour armed forces. Specifically, why are we considering this legislation \nnow before a budget resolution has been passed? Are we not tying the \nhands of both the Budget Committee as well as the Appropriations \nCommittee with this legislation? Why did we take the pay and pension \nprovisions out of the defense authorization bill? Passing this \nlegislation would commit the Senate to spending an additional $55 \nbillion between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2009. Is this a step \nwe are ready to take? Let me point out that these concerns are not \nlimited to this legislation alone. I will apply the same scrutiny to \nany bill, no matter how well-intentioned, in the future as well.\n  Which leads me to my second main concern about S. 4--its cost. $55 \nbillion is a significant amount of money, even in Washington, D.C. \nNevertheless, we have taken the opportunity during the course of debate \non this bill to add a number of costly amendments. While I\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nhave supported some of these efforts, they have been added to this \nlegislation in an ad hoc manner without any discipline. I understand \nthat this is often the nature of debate in this body, but I have a \ngreat fear we are forgetting our commitments to the budget caps, paying \ndown the national debt and general fiscal responsibility.\n  The $55 billion cost for the base text of the bill, plus the costs of \nall the adopted amendments, must come from somewhere which begs the \nquestion--from where? The answer I have been getting from my colleagues \nsupporting this bill is that the money will come from somewhere and the \ndetails will be worked out. I am not willing to accept that explanation \nat this point--I need to know details, the framework for moving ahead \nwith this kind of spending before I would be ready to support it. Do we \nplan on increasing the allocation in the budget resolution for military \nspending? Further, once an allocation level has been established, will \nthis effort force us to put other readiness and modernization efforts \naside? These questions have not been answered. I understand that \nSecretary Cohen has echoed these concerns. They should and must be \naddressed before I can support this measure.\n  Let me be clear. I strongly support the intent of this bill and would \nlike to support its content in a different package down the road. \nHowever, now is not the time to make these type of spending decisions. \nRegrettably, I will join several of my colleagues in voting against S. \n4 for budgetary reasons.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the men and women in the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, and Marine Corps continue to perform their duties superbly in \nthe defense of our nation. Today, as our nation prepares for the \npossibility of sending 4,000 marines and Army troops as part of a \npeacekeeping force for Kosovo, we must do all we can to support all our \nforces who sacrifice so much to serve and protect this country.\n  Our service men and women deserve a pay raise, and they deserve fair \nretirement benefits. If we don't make significant improvements in these \ntwo areas, we will continue to fail to recruit and retain the forces \nneeded to maintain our nation's military readiness and protect our \nnational security.\n  I voted to report S. 4 out of the Armed Services Committee, and I \nsupport this legislation. I remain concerned, however, that we are \nmoving too quickly, without adequately considering the budget impact or \nthe best means to recruit and retain our talented service men and \nwomen. Clearly, action by Congress is needed to meet the needs of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, but we have not yet adequately \nconsidered the full impact, including the long-term impact of these \npolicy changes on our troops and our defense budget.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Chiefs, \nthemselves, have testified about the need for reforms in military \nretirement plans, and they have expressed their support for a \nsignificant and much-needed pay raise. But, we have not held any \nhearings at all on the specifics of this bill.\n  Secretary Cohen expressed his concerns about the overall impact of \nthis legislation in a letter to Senator Levin last Friday. The \nSecretary said he appreciated the Senate's attention to this critical \nissue, but he also emphasized his concern about the high cost of this \nlegislation and about the lack of hearings to discuss the bill's impact \non our service men and women.\n  Our Armed Forces are facing complex challenges. Military recruiting \nhas tremendous difficulties. In the last few months, the Army and Navy \nhave announced they must reduce their recruiting standards in order to \nmeet their recruiting goals. The Air Force, facing an unusual drop-off \nin new recruits, announced that for the first time it will use national \ntelevision advertising in its recruiting.\n  Our Armed Forces are having increasing difficulty retaining highly-\nskilled personnel. Retention of mid-level officers and enlisted \npersonnel is the lowest it has been in many years. These mid-grade \npersonnel are the backbone of our Armed Forces. They lead and train new \nservice members. They provide critical continuity between high-level \ncommanders and individual soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. We \ncannot afford to lose these irreplaceable leaders.\n  Recruiting and retention are in critical condition. Our margin for \nerror is gone, and we must ensure that the policies we enact are the \nbest ones. That is why many of us have serious reservations about how \nwe are proceeding. We have too little information about whether these \nproposals are cost-effective or will do enough to boost morale, \nincrease retention, or improve recruiting.\n  We are all concerned about the readiness of our Armed Forces. But \nfurther consideration of these far-reaching proposals is essential. \nBefore this bill reaches the President's desk, we need a far better \nunderstanding of this bill's impact on our service men and women and on \nthe overall budget.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue crucial to the \nwell-being of our troops, and crucial to the defense of our nation. For \ntoo long, this administration has ignored the needs of the brave men \nand women who defend our interests and our shores. This is unfair, and \nin my view it is unwise.\n  It is unfair that, as our colleague Senator McCain has found, 11,000 \nmilitary families are currently forced to rely on food stamps to make \nends meet. When people put themselves in harm's way for their country, \nthey should not have to go on public assistance to feed their families.\n  It is unwise because it ignores the well-being of our troops. Well-\ntrained, properly motivated troops are the single most important factor \nin maintaining our national security. Without them we will not be able \nto achieve and maintain military readiness. We will not be able, as a \nnation, to fight and win.\n  Under current conditions, Mr. President, we cannot expect to maintain \nthe levels of re-enlistment, expertise and morale we need to maintain \nan effective military force. Military pay is simply too low. It is not \ncompetitive with civilian pay. And this military-civilian pay gap is \ndriving away the people we need to defend our nation.\n  For example, we lost 626 trained pilots in 1997 alone. Overall re-\nenlistments have been dropping fast. In 1997 fewer than half our troops \ncompleting their first tour of duty chose to re-enlist.\n  Mr. President, we cannot fly planes without pilots, just as we cannot \ndeploy ships or tanks or any other military hardware without the \nsoldiers and sailors who make them work. And if we cannot keep well-\ntrained pilots, soldiers and sailors, we will face increased danger to \nour troops, or weaponry and our interests in any conflict.\n  Mr. President, our men and women in uniform have a history of making \ndo, but we soon will not have enough of them to do the job of defending \nour nation and our interests in a dangerous world.\n  It is time to give our troops a raise. President Clinton has made a \nmodest proposal on this issue but frankly it is too modest. It is, as \nthey say, a day late and a dollar short.\n  That is why I was happy to join with Senator Warner and 23 other \nRepublicans in introducing the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill Of Rights'' (S. 4). This measure is key to re-\nestablishing the morale, experience and re-enlistment figures we need \nin our armed forces.\n  This legislation will increase FY 2000 pay by 4.8%. It will further \nincrease pay in those grades where retention is critical. And it will \nprovide a monthly allowance of $180 to all members of the uniformed \nservices eligible for food stamps, eliminating their need to go on \npublic assistance.\n  This legislation also will restore traditional military retirement \npay and set up civilian-style thrift savings plans to encourage more \nmen and women to make the military their career.\n  Finally, this legislation will address the increasing trouble our \ntroops face in taking advantage of their GI Bill education benefits. \nThe cost of higher education has skyrocketed, Mr. President, and GI \nBill benefits have not kept pace. Thus a growing number of veterans are \nnot making use of their education benefit, even though they have paid \n$1,200 to get it.\n  To address this situation, S.4 will eliminate the $1,200 contribution \nrequirement. It also will increase the monthly GI Bill benefit from \n$528 to\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n$600 for members who serve at least 3 years, and from $429 to $488 for \nthose serving less than 3 years.\n  We still have the greatest military in the world, Mr. President. I \nbelieve that it is time to pay a decent wage and provide decent \nbenefits to the people who keep it that way.\n  This legislation includes a requirement that the Defense Department \nreport annually on the impact of these programs on recruiting and \nretention, assuring that we can keep track of the needs of our troops. \nIn doing so I am sure they in turn will be better able to see to the \nneeds of their families and of their country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, S. 4 is a worthy attempt to address the \ngrowing problem the military is encountering in attracting and \nretaining the right men and women in the right numbers. As the \nchallenges facing us demonstrate, the effectiveness of our military, \nand its readiness to act immediately to protect our national interests, \nmust always be a priority concern of Congress. The outstanding \nperformance of our forces in Desert Fox shows that the American \nmilitary remains more than equal to any task and may in fact be the \nbest force the United States has ever fielded. Even at the height of \nthe cold war, with the largest military budgets ever, it is difficult \nto imagine those units routinely coping with the range of complex \nmilitary operations accomplished by our military today.\n  Nonetheless, our military faces readiness problems including falling \nrecruitment and retention in critical skill areas; aging equipment that \ncosts more to keep operating at acceptable levels of reliability; a \nneed for more support services for a force with a high percentage of \nmarried personnel; and frequent deployments. The Department of Defense \ndeserves credit for highlighting these problems, the administration \ndeserves credit for increasing the budget to address them and, our \ncolleagues, who have crafted this bill, deserve credit for bringing \nthese issues into clear focus.\n  This legislation is commendable in its attempt to increase resources \nto address and solve the myriad problems facing today's military \nforces, specifically pay and benefits. However, we should not do \nsomething in a hurry that we will have cause to regret at leisure. The \nmany detailed provisions in this proposed legislation have not been \nfully vetted by the services, the Joint Staff, the Secretary of Defense \nor this body. What we spend money on, is as important, as how much \nmoney we spend. We must have a plan to spend available funds wisely.\n  I believe this legislation is premature, and I will vote against it \nat this time for three reasons. First, there is no doubt that \nadequately compensating our most valuable resource, our service men and \nwomen, is the wisest use of our defense dollars. But we must also \nensure we have a sensible and executable procurement strategy for today \nand tomorrow. We must find the right balance given finite resources. \nTherefore, I believe more analysis is needed on the most favorable, \nmost cost efficient way to compensate today's force. This bill would \nadd more money, but I am not yet convinced we have a good idea of where \nmore money will work best. A case in point, historically, pilot \nretention has been difficult, and the numbers of pilots for our future \nforce is projected to be considerably less than required. This problem \nwas highlighted specifically in the recent readiness hearings. However, \neven as we prepare to redo the pay scale and improve the retirement \npay, the take rate for pilot bonuses is reportedly increasing. So, \nwhere is the best place for additional funds--redux, improved pay \nscale, further bonuses, better quality of life advancements--what makes \nthe most sense? Furthermore, we need to discuss and examine the impact \nof this proposed legislation on other government workers. What about \nthe recruitment and retention of our dedicated civilian force?\n\n  Next, as we prepare to spend money to ensure our force is compensated \nand ready, we must ask: ``ready for what?'' Which men and women do we \nmost need to recruit and retain, and are we ready for them now? If we \nspend more than we must for people and less than we should for the \ntools they need, we will create new problems. For instance, we need \nmore pilots, but we do not yet have an adequate number of aircraft to \ntrain them. Should we recruit them and then keep them ``grounded'' \nbecause we haven't funded the equipment to allow them to fly. Readiness \nin 1999 will not necessarily be readiness in the future. We must ensure \nour forces are ready to address challenges in the near term as well to \nchallenges that emerge over the longer term.\n  Finally, besides deciding how best to spend the available funds, we \nmust find the available funds. We do not know what this bill will \nactually cost. Before we act, we should know more clearly what the cost \nwill be, and where the funds will come from. Many of the provisions \noffered in this legislation differ from the Pentagon's request, adding \ncosts that must be absorbed from other programs. As the Administration, \nand Secretary Cohen have pointed out, the money projected to be added \nto the defense budget, or any foreseeable increase, will not be enough \nto completely cover current readiness increases and meet the \nmodernization requirements of all the services. With the proposed pay \nraises, higher cost-of-living adjustments and other miscellaneous items \nit is estimated that S. 4 will cost an additional $7 billion in \ndiscretionary funding through FY 2005, and absent an increase in the \ntopline for Defense, these items will only displace other key elements \nof the Defense program.\n  Furthermore, while searching for the appropriate amount of money, we \nmust demand 100% cost effectiveness, and the elimination of waste and \nredundancy. We must do the appropriate analysis and make the tough \nchoices, to include examining the possibility of closing down military \nfacilities that don't make military-economic sense any more. The \nSecretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs must be allowed to evaluate \nthis legislation, it's cost and, then ask where they would choose to \ntake the risk if it comes to that.\n  Major studies on military pay and pension issues by the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Government Accounting Organization, and the Defense \nDepartment are nearing completion, with all reports expected to be \nreleased by late spring. Upon release and examination of these reports, \nwe will be better able to judge the needs in these areas and how best \nto respond to them. I urge that instead of deciding on this legislation \ntoday, we expeditiously arrange appropriate hearings to analyze these \nideas in the context of the entire defense authorization bill. This \nbill is a great point of departure, it is not a final product. We have \nnot yet done the critical analysis to know where the priority should go \nwithin the broad category of pay and allowances to most effectively \nattract and retain the right people. We do not know how a separate bill \nof this type will impact the authorization process for other programs, \nultimately affecting the hard questions of long-term readiness.\n  So, though I strongly favor increases in pay and benefits for our \nmilitary, this bill is premature and therefore I will reluctantly vote \nagainst it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr President, over the course of the last year, we have \nheard more and more evidence that the readiness of our nation's \nmilitary force is slipping. It became a key issue when our military \nleadership began to warn of shortages of personnel in key specialties, \ngaps in weapons maintenance, disparities between military and civilian \npay, and a high pace of military operations. These and other similar \nissues have a serious effect on our ability to respond quickly and \neffectively to military conflicts. In my view, the time has come to \nrestore our nation's military readiness, starting with the morale of \nour troops.\n  When the military talks about readiness, it is referring in part to \nthe weapons, equipment, bases and support infrastructure needed to \ncarry out its missions. A declining defense budget since 1989 is the \nprime source of today's problem; it forces our military commanders to \nmake some tough choices. For example, underfunding of real property \nmaintenance and facility operations has often led commanders to \nreallocate funds meant for training to meet urgent repair needs. \nWeapons maintenance requirements have also been underestimated on a \nregular basis. Finally, our continued presence in the Persian Gulf, \nBosnia, and potential new responsibilities in Kosovo, to\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nname just a few, have stretched our military forces and our military \nbudget even further.\n  But readiness isn't just about hardware and property. It's about \nmanpower and morale. The men and women who make up our armed forces \nrepresent the best fighting force ever assembled in human history. But \nshortfalls in personnel recruitment and retention have made it \nincreasingly difficult to ensure full manning of deployed units. \nReversing these negative trends in military pay, retirement benefits, \nand recruitment must be a top priority in the 106th Congress.\n  Fortunately, the U.S. Senate is off to a good start. One of the first \nbills we will pass this year is S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act which was offered by my \nfriend and colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, the Chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  The purpose of S. 4 is simple: to improve the readiness and morale of \nthe troops who so selflessly defend our country. The first, and most \nneeded, reform included in this bill is a pay raise of 4.8% beginning \nJanuary 1st, 2000. The bill also would institute an annual pay raise \nequal to the Employment Cost Index plus 0.5%. This will help close a \nmilitary to civilian pay gap of over 13 percent.\n  Amazingly, there are members of our military whose paycheck is so low \nthey qualify for food stamps. For them, S. 4 would provide a monthly \n``special subsistence allowance'' of $180. This initiative is designed \nto dramatically improve the ``quality of life'' for the youngest and \nmost economically vulnerable military families.\n  Mr. President, when I visit Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, I often \nhear concerns about ``eroding benefits,'' especially concerning \nretirement pay. Currently, our military personnel fall under several \nseparate retirement plans depending upon the date they initially \nentered active service. The original military retirement plan called \nfor retirement pay, after 20 years of service, of 50 percent of their \nbasic pay per month. This percentage would then increase by 2.5 percent \nfor each additional year of service up to a maximum of 75 percent of \nbasic pay at 30 years of service.\n  However, in 1986, a new retirement plan was adopted that was intended \nto increase the incentive for our troops to remain longer on active \nduty. This plan, commonly called ``Redux'', lowered the percentage from \n50 percent after 20 years to 40 percent, but increased the yearly \nincreases for years of service above 20 years, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 \npercent per year up to a maximum of 75 percent after 30 years of \nservice.\n  The ``Redux'' retirement plan is very unpopular among our military \npersonnel. S. 4 would try another approach. It would give military \npersonnel on ``Redux'' the opportunity of accepting a one-time bonus of \n$30,000 to remain on the ``Redux'' retirement plan, or to elect to \nrevert to the original retirement system.\n  Finally, S. 4 would create a Thrift Savings Plan. This plan allows \nfor a ``before tax'' contribution of up to 5 percent of the member's \nbasic pay. The member can also elect to add any part of any special or \nincentive pay to their Thrift Saving Plan. In addition, the Service \nSecretaries would be authorized to make contributions to a member's \nThrift Savings Plan if that member serves in a specialty designated as \ncritical to the service. These contributions require the member to \nremain on active service for an additional six years.\n  Mr. President, since the end of the Cold War, our military forces \nhave been stretched to the limit, having to manage their resources and \nmission with an ever tightening budget. Our single most important \nresource always has been our troops, and like any resource, we have to \ncontinue to invest in them. I would like to commend the Chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Warner, for bringing S. 4 before the \nSenate. It is bipartisan legislation. It is legislation that literally \nputs people first; in this case I'm referring to the men and women in \nour military. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \nRights Act represents a much-needed, long-overdue investment in the \npeople who are asked to do so much for our country and make such \ndramatic sacrifices while defending our country. I plan to see that \nCongress makes good on this vital readiness investment in 1999 by \nworking to ensure enactment of this important legislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I am very aware of the strains on America's military \npersonnel. I have only to look at the pace of operations at Dover Air \nForce Base, in my home state of Delaware. Dover's strategic airlift and \nair cargo terminal support every single on-going operation and new \ntroop and equipment movement to Europe, Southwest Asia, and Africa. A \nquick look around the world today shows that Dover personnel are \nworking hard, alongside their colleagues throughout the force, and need \nto be recognized with adequate pay and benefits. America's military is \ndoing an exceptional job defending vital American interests in Bosnia, \nIraq, and South Korea. Our troops are also using their incredible \nlogistics skills to assist our Central American neighbors who have been \ndevastated by hurricane damage. These are just a few examples among \nmany of the United States' military working every day to create a more \nstable and safe world for all of us. In today's dynamic world, the \nmilitary's task is a demanding one.\n  With this bill, we make it clear that we understand those demands and \nthat we will continually strive to take better care of our troops. I \nhave long been concerned that we have not always adequately addressed \nthe compensation needs of our military, nor have we always provided for \npay equity. For that reason, last year I amended the Defense \nauthorization bill to include an increase in hazardous duty incentive \npay for mid- and senior level enlisted aircrews. I am pleased that this \nyear we have a comprehensive bill addressing the critical issue of \ncompensation and equity. I have said it before and I will say it again, \nthe patriotic men and women who serve in our military do not do so to \nbecome rich, but that does not change the very real needs they and \ntheir families have for adequate recompense.\n  The bill enhances the President's request for a pay raise, pay table \nreform, and changes to the military retirement system. The Joint Chiefs \nhave said repeatedly that these three steps are their top priority this \nyear. The 4.8 percent basic pay raise and the decision to increase \nfuture year raises by 0.5 percent more than the civilian raise index is \nan important step toward closing the pay gap between military and \ncivilian employees. The pay table reform, which is identical to that \nsuggested by the President, will make the pay structure more equitable \nand focused on performance.\n  Another important equity issue for the past thirteen years has been \nthe military retirement system. The changes made in the summer of 1986 \ncreated an inequity in the retirement benefits for members of the armed \nservices who chose to retire after 20 years. The end result was that \nexperienced service members decided that the reward was too small to \nstay in the service for 20 years, compared to the benefits offered in \nthe private sector and the needs of their families. This bill \ncorrects that inequity by allowing personnel to revert back to the pre-\n1986 system of receiving 50 percent of their base pay. It also provides \nan option to stay with the post-1986 system of receiving 40 percent of \nbase pay along with a $30,000 bonus. This sends an important message to \nour troops that their service and experience today are just as valuable \nand important as they were before 1986.\n\n  I want to compliment the committee, and the leadership of Senator \nCleland, for including enhancements to the Montgomery G.I. bill. The \noriginal bill was written in World War II and needed to be adapted to \nthe challenges that face members of today's military. Increasing the \nactual benefits and providing more flexibility in how they are used \nmakes it easier for service members to attain their educational goals \nfor themselves and their immediate family. In an era where education is \nincreasingly vital and expensive, these changes are long overdue.\n  I am also pleased that this bill was amended to include important \nreforms of TRICARE, the military health care\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nbenefits system. The bill will help the Department of Defense provide \nbetter services, reduce the bureaucratic hassle of obtaining those \nservices, and make sure benefits are tranportable to different TRICARE \nregions. It also provides the necessary authority to increase the \namount TRICARE reimburses providers in areas where such increases are \nneeded to keep an adequate number of qualified health care providers \navailable. Military health care systems must be able to compete with \nprivate health care systems for the services of quality providers. In \naddition, the bill will help the military better utilize its facilities \nby allowing TRICARE facilities to be reimbursed by other insurance \nagencies. It is my hope that this legislation will make it easier for \nAmerican servicemen and women to get the quality health care they and \ntheir families deserve.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I share with my colleagues a concern that we \nneed to be careful in our allocation of limited resources before we \nhave adopted a budget. It is imperative that this bill actually help \nour troops and not create new resource problems in other areas. For \nthat reason, I am also very pleased to see the requirement for the \nSecretary of Defense provide an annual report on how this bill impacts \nrecruiting and retention. This requirement will allow us to measure the \neffectiveness of the bill and make sure that we have chosen the right \nmix of incentives for the brave men and women who work so hard in \ndefense of all of us.\n  Overall, I believe this bill is an important step in support of our \ntroops. It improves pay equity and overall compensation levels. It also \naddresses inequities in the retirement system and it enhances the \nbenefit system, including military health care benefits. I support the \nbill and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I welcome a discussion in the Senate about \nmilitary pay and retirement benefits. Review of these and other quality \nof life issues in today's military is long overdue. The defense debate \nin recent years has centered on equipment procurement, readiness \nissues, and the wisdom of our nation's troop deployments and foreign \npolicy. This year we should turn to consider the men and women who \ndedicate their lives to keeping our nation safe.\n  Military service requires valor and sacrifice. It attracts a certain \ntype of individual, a person with the character to lead, the resolve to \ncomplete a task however difficult and demanding, and the willingness to \nsacrifice his or her life for fellow soldiers and country. For those \nreasons, the decision to join the military has always been unlike the \ndecision to join any other profession.\n  The unparalleled strength of our economy in recent years, and the \ngrowth of new technologies and industries, further complicate the \ndecision to serve in the military. Just as our society has entered a \nnew age of technological change, the United States Military has also \nentered a new era of digital warfare, where the machinery of battle is \nmore reliant upon silicon chips than hard steel. To keep these \nprocessors and equipment running, our military needs to attract and \nretain highly skilled, intelligent men and women.\n  Today, our Defense Department must also compete for recruits with \nMicrosoft and Price Waterhouse Coopers as well as companies in more \ntraditional industries. The Defense Department cannot do that by \noffering a second-tier pay scale which lags significantly behind the \nprivate sector. If we want the best and the brightest, we have to be \nwilling to pay them accordingly.\n  I welcome the Administration's decisions to increase military pay by \n4.4% and to renew the retirement program that offers benefits of fifty \npercent military pay for twenty years service. These policies seek to \nrestore equity in compensation for military personnel, and properly \nreward those who have committed twenty years of their lives to protect \nour nation. Yet, I do not believe the Administration's military pay \nproposal goes far enough to resolve the inequity. Therefore, I support \nS. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights \nAct of 1999, because this legislation does more to provide financial \nsecurity to our uniformed men and women.\n  My colleagues understand that the nature of pay and benefits in the \nUnited States military is unlike pay considerations within our private \nsector and compensation practices in other nations' militaries. Within \nour private sector, the issue of compensation is the primary focus for \nthe vast majority of Americans when deciding between competing job \noffers. In other nations that lack strong democratic principles and a \ntradition of rule of law, foreign leaders use relatively high pay for \nsoldiers to assure military support for their government.\n  But in the United States, pay is not the primary reason people join \nthe military. Some join for the experience of military service, for the \nmental and physical challenges that our Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarines place upon young men and women, and the sense of accomplishment \nthat comes from meeting those challenges. Some join as a means to an \neducation, to partake of the G.I. Bill and other post-service education \nbenefits. Yet, while not always the primary motivating factor, the men \nand women who serve our country always do so out of a sense of \npatriotism. They choose to commit the time and effort of their youth, \njoin organizations with unique cultures distinct from contemporary \ninstitutions, forego at least temporarily the chance for greater \nwealth, and risk physical harm and possibly death, to repay our nation \nfor the freedoms and opportunities they as citizens enjoy.\n  Money never has been and never will be the primary deciding factor \nfor people seeking to join, or deciding whether to stay, in the U.S. \nmilitary. But, on the margin--the always important margin--the size of \na military paycheck does make a difference. S. 4 may not fully correct \nthe deficiency in military pay, but it is at least a significant step \nalong the way.\n  I understand the concerns raised by many of my colleagues about the \nbudgetary ramifications of this bill. S. 4 provides a rise in pay of \n4.8% for fiscal year 2000, a substantial increase from the \nAdministration's proposed 4.4% pay raise. Either of these increases \nwill have ramifications on military procurement, on research and \ndevelopment, on operations and maintenance accounts that support \nreadiness, and other areas of the defense budget as well. Similarly, S. \n4 provides a pay raise for fiscal year 2001 and beyond of one percent \nabove the level of the Employment Cost Index. This is a statutory \ncommitment whose cost we cannot today determine with any suitable \ndegree of accuracy. While we may decide to accept these increases, the \nconsequences of these policies need to be reviewed and resolved within \nthe context of the entire defense budget.\n  Also, there are currently three studies underway examining military \npay and pension issues, conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe General Accounting Office, and the Department of Defense. These \nstudies are examining how factors other than pay such as high \noperations tempo, lack of essential material and equipment, declining \nstate of readiness, concern over military health care services, job \ndissatisfaction, and a booming civilian economy may affect the decision \nto join and remain in the military. Once we receive the conclusions and \nrecommendations of these studies, we should again revisit the issues \nsurrounding military retention and recruitment.\n  Already, as a consequence of amendments which have been attached to \nthis bill, the Senate has accepted an unfunded liability of \napproximately $16.5 billion. Currently, there are no offsets in the \nlegislation to address this liability. It is my sincere desire that \nthis issue is addressed and offsets are determined when the bill goes \ninto conference with the House. If these costs remain outstanding when \nthe bill returns to the Senate, I will have strong reservations about \nvoting for unfunded liabilities a second time. The tight caps and \nfiscal discipline I have supported throughout this decade do not start \ncreating real on-budget surpluses until FY2001. This year's surplus is \ncreated entirely by excess payroll taxes and interest on the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds. So I am concerned that the Senate is considering \nlegislation that may bust the cap so early in the legislative season. I \nencourage my colleagues to maintain our recent tradition of fiscal \ndiscipline and seek ways to pay for this bill within the current budget \ncaps.\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\n  Nevertheless, our military is only as secure as the people that \noperate the guns, ships, planes, and terminals that help keep our \nnation safe. The men and women in our Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarines are the strength of our military, not the equipment which they \nutilize. If providing some level of monetary security to our military \npersonnel means we must forsake some weapons or postpone some research, \nI believe this tradeoff will actually enhance our national security far \nmore than the alternative.\n  S. 4 goes a long way towards putting our military pay scale on the \nsame footing as private sector wages. It improves the retirement and \neducational benefits available to our military personnel. For those \nreasons, I support the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no question that America's armed \nforces are the best in the world. The men and women who serve in our \nmilitary demonstrate their courage and dedication every day, from the \nfighter pilots who are making life-threatening raids into Iraq to \ncontain the deadly forces of Saddam Hussein, to the soldiers who are \nmaintaining peace in the war-weary towns of Bosnia, to the countless \nsailors, soldiers, and airmen on lonely patrol throughout the world, \nenduring hardship and homesickness to protect their fellow Americans. \nIt is vital to our national security that we maintain the level of \nexcellence that these troops represent.\n  Of the many factors that contribute to the robustness of our \nmilitary, none is more basic than the ability to recruit and retain \nqualified, talented individuals. Without enough people to operate them, \nour mightiest weapons are worthless. Without enough people to execute \nthem, our best planned strategies are useless. Without enough people in \nuniform to defend it, our nation is at risk.\n  We ask much of the men and women who serve in our military, and of \ntheir families as well. Yet, as we have learned from the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, pay and benefit levels for members of the armed services have \nbeen slipping behind those of their civilian counterparts. Today, we \nare facing a personnel shortfall of alarming proportions. The need for \nthe legislation before us is acute. According to recent published \nreports, the Army fell 2,300 short of its recruiting goal--\napproximately a 20 percent deficit--in the first quarter of fiscal year \n1999. The Navy missed its recruitment target by almost 7,000 last year. \nThe Air Force, which has suffered a hemorrhage of pilots over the past \nseveral years, fell 400 short of its first quarter goal.\n  Many factors are contributing to the current recruitment and \nretention problems of the services, but military leaders across the \nservices and up and down the chain of command have identified pay and \nbenefits as major culprits. We need to come to grips with this problem. \nIn my state of West Virginia, approximately 9,000 men and women serve \naround the world in the active and reserve armed forces. They are \nsubject to being called away at a moment's notice to some of the most \ndangerous trouble spots on earth. The least we can do for them in \nreturn is to make sure that their families will be able to make ends \nmeet while they are deployed away from home. The least we can do is \nstrive to ensure that the monthly paychecks we issue to our men and \nwomen in uniform are comparable to that of their civilian counterparts.\n  Improving the pay and benefits of the men and women who serve in our \nmilitary is an obvious first step to help reverse the downward spiral \nin recruitment and retention, and I applaud the Chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Warner, for moving quickly to address \nthis situation. Likewise, I applaud Senator Levin, the Ranking Member \nof the Committee, for insisting that the benchmarks of prudence and \ncareful consideration be met in the bill before us. This legislation is \nnot the place for grandstanding or political one-upmanship. I am \nhopeful that as we debate this bill over the coming days, we will work \nfor the common good of our military and our nation, and come up with a \nbalanced, commonsense bill.\n  I hope, also, that we will be mindful, as we consider this bill, that \nmonetary compensation is only one factor affecting recruiting and \nretention levels in the military. Plainly put, we cannot buy the finest \nmilitary in the world. To rise to the level of excellence that the \nUnited States military has achieved requires an uncommon degree of \ndedication, self-sacrifice, and patriotism--qualities that can be \ninspired and nurtured but not bought. By all means, let us work \ntogether to improve the compensation of our men and women in uniform. \nBut let us also work together to preserve and enhance the intangible \ncompensations of military service--the honor, respect, and sense of \naccomplishment--that form the true foundation of military service.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I believe we must significantly boost \ncompensation for the men and women of our armed forces who serve this \nnation so tirelessly and effectively. The end of the Cold War has meant \nthat the numbers and types of overseas missions we ask these people to \nperform has grown. The rising number of military operations abroad \ncoupled with an extremely vibrant U.S. economy has meant the military \nservices are having a harder time attracting and keeping highly skilled \npersonnel.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs recognized this \ntroubling development last year in testimony before the Congress and \nbegan making the case for addressing the military's recruitment and \nretention problems. The examples they cited were troubling. The Air \nForce is experiencing serious shortfalls in retaining its pilots. The \nNavy is having difficulty manning its ships. The Army finds itself \ncoming up short in filling out its units. Only the Marine Corps appears \nto be faring well at the moment.\n  The President listened to our senior military officials, and he \nresponded. The President proposed a $23 billion personnel initiative in \nhis FY2000 budget to improve the military's pay and retirement \nbenefits. The President's budget would provide the men and women of our \narmed services with the largest pay raise since 1982. In addition, it \nwould reform military pay tables to reward performance, increase \nspecialty pay and bonuses to address retention issues, and restore \nretirement benefits. Just as important as this list of benefits is the \nfact that the President made these proposals while remaining faithful \nto his pledge to Save Social Security First. The President was able to \naccommodate these proposed increases without spending any of the \nsurplus in FY2000. In short, the President's proposal is fully paid \nfor.\n  Like numerous members of Congress from both political parties, I have \ngone on record in the last several months in support of the Defense \nDepartment's argument that military pay and retirement benefits need to \nbe enhanced if we are to continue to field a well-trained, highly \ncapable military. That is why, along with Senator Levin, Senator \nCleland, and many other Democratic Senators, I introduced the Military \nRecruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999--a bill to increase \npay and retirement benefits for members of the Armed Services. I am \npleased that many provisions of this legislation were included in S. 4. \nAlthough the initial Democratic and Republican proposals were slightly \ndifferent, I think we can all agree that people are the military's most \nimportant asset.\n  To see why, you need look no further than my home state of South \nDakota and the more than 3,000 active-duty personnel stationed at \nEllsworth Air Force Base. Like their counterparts at military \ninstallations around the county and throughout the world, the men and \nwomen at Ellsworth Air Force Base serve their country with pride and \ndistinction every day. Most recently, crews flying and maintaining B-1B \nbombers from Ellsworth participated in Operation Desert Fox. This was \nthe first time that B-1Bs were used in combat, and the fact that B-1B \ncrews from Ellsworth were so successful in hitting their targets is a \ncredit to their enormous commitment and dedication.\n  With dedicated people like those we see at Ellsworth and other \nmilitary installations around the world, it is easy to see why all of \nus--President Clinton, Defense Secretary Cohen, Joint Chiefs Chairman \nShelton, Democrats, and Republicans--agree that something must be done. \nTherefore, a key issue before the Senate today is how best to \naccomplish this end, how best to ensure that some of this nation's best \nand\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\nbrightest continue to pursue a career in the military?\n  However, it is not the only issue. Those who are concerned about \nhaving a well balanced, fiscally responsible defense plan must also ask \nanother question. What is the best way to provide military personnel \nwith the pay and retirement benefits they so richly deserve while \nremaining true to our other defense and domestic priorities and staying \nwithin the tight fiscal constraints we find ourselves operating under? \nIndeed, this may be the most important question we face today: how do \nwe do right by our military personnel, our other defense and domestic \npriorities, and our obligation to be fiscally responsible?\n  The bill before us today provides only a partial answer to this \ncritical question, as it spends $12 billion beyond the President's \nproposal without providing offsets for the additional spending. As I \nsaid earlier, I wholeheartedly support providing additional benefits to \nour troops, and I will vote for this bill today. What troubles me about \nS. 4, however, is that its authors have chosen to stay strangely silent \non how they will pay for the additional $12 billion in benefits.\n  Mr. President, I believe that when it comes to something as important \nas the pay and retirement benefits of our military, Congress should \nleave no questions unanswered. Fortunately, the action we take today in \nthe Senate on S. 4 is the first step in a multi-step process. The House \nmust develop its version of this bill, and differences between the \nHouse and Senate versions must be resolved in a conference. I urge the \nHouse and Senate members who participate in this process to fill in the \nblanks contained in S. 4. Our troops deserve additional pay and \nbenefits. We owe it to both the troops and the American people to show \nhow we will pay for them. I will be working hard with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to provide this answer and produce a military \npay and retirement bill of which we can all be proud.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on the Rockefeller amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Grams of Minnesota and Senator Ashcroft \nbe added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with my colleague from Michigan, and with \nthe consent of the leadership of the Senate, we would like to place \nbefore the Senate at this time a unanimous consent request, which I \nwill not make--I repeat, place--in the hopes that we can bring this \nbill to a conclusion.\n  In the future, I will ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5 \no'clock today there be 10 minutes of debate with respect to the \nRockefeller-Specter amendment No. 26, with 5 minutes under the control \nof Senator Rockefeller and 5 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. I will further ask consent that following that debate, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on a motion to table the Rockefeller \namendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Harkin \namendment No. 23, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nGraham amendment, which again would be a tabling amendment by the \nSenator from Virginia. That amendment, as yet, has not been sent to the \ndesk.\n  I will further ask that there be 5 minutes for explanation between \neach vote, to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Further, I will ask unanimous consent that my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member of this \ncommittee, be recognized for up to 15 minutes for general debate on the \nbill.\n  Finally, I will ask that following the votes listed above, the Senate \nproceed to third reading and final passage, all to occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, hopefully, we will soon be voting on final \npassage of S. 4, the military pay and benefits bill. This bill would \nsignificantly improve the pay and benefits available to our troops and \nhelp address the military recruitment and retention problems identified \nby the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The bill includes an across-the-board increase in military salaries, \ntargeted pay raises to reward performance, enhanced military retirement \nbenefits for service members who entered after 1986, enhanced education \nbenefits for service members under the GI bill, and numerous other \nbenefits. These changes should help provide fairer compensation to our \nmen and women in uniform, and I think we would all like to see them \nenacted into law.\n  As I pointed out previously, this is an extremely expensive bill, and \nit has not been paid for. This bill has not been paid for. When the \nbill came to the floor, it included provisions that would cost roughly \n$35 billion more than current law over the 6-year course of the future \nyear defense plan, the so-called FYDP. These costs include close to $24 \nbillion in pay and benefits enhancements that were funded in the \nadministration budget but almost $12 billion more in enhancements that \nwere added by the Armed Services Committee.\n  Since the bill has been in the Chamber, it has become even more \nexpensive, with the addition of many amendments increasing the benefits \nfor our men and women in uniform. These include provisions eliminating \nthe prohibition on dual compensation, authorizing participation in the \nThrift Savings Plan by members of the National Guard and Reserves, \nextending enhanced GI bill benefits to members of the National Guard \nand Reserves, expanding the use of GI bill benefits to cover \npreparation for college and graduate school entrance exams, and \nexpanding the number of soldiers eligible for the $180 per month \nspecial subsistence allowance.\n  Moreover, we have adopted an amendment offered by the Senators from \nMaryland and Virginia expressing the sense of the Congress that we \nshould extend the pay increases provided in this bill for members of \nthe armed services to the Federal civilian employees as well. If we \nwere to act in accordance with just that one provision, we would add an \nadditional $3 billion in defense spending and an additional $7 billion \nin nondefense spending, for a total of almost $10 billion of \nGovernmentwide spending over the next 6 years.\n  Now, these are worthwhile provisions which would provide real \nbenefits to the men and women who so loyally serve our country every \nday, but they have real costs attached to them, some in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars every year. Yet we have not said how we intend to \npay for them.\n\n  Do we intend to revise the budget agreement to pay for the bill \nbefore us? If the defense budget is not substantially increased, for \ninstance, we would then be faced with making deep cuts in the readiness \nand modernization accounts to pay for the changes proposed in this \nbill. Such cuts are coming at a time when our senior military \nleadership has already expressed concerns that our readiness could have \na serious impact on our national security. For this reason, the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nstated that they would support the increased benefits contained in this \nbill only if the additional money does not come out of other defense \nprograms.\n  For this reason, the Secretary of Defense wrote the Armed Services \nCommittee last week to express strong concerns about the cost of this \nbill and how it would be paid for. Secretary Cohen wrote:\n\n       S. 4 proposes even larger pay raises, higher cost-of-living \n     adjustments, and other items which are not in the budget I \n     submitted . . .\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\n     I am concerned that until there is a budget resolution that \n     sets the defense budget level, this bill constitutes an \n     unfunded requirement on the Department. Absent an increase in \n     the topline for Defense, [he wrote] these items will only \n     displace other key elements of our program. It could be \n     counterproductive and completely contrary to our mutual \n     desire not to undercut our modernization effort and other \n     readiness priorities. For these reasons, it is imperative to \n     proceed within the regular authorization process and after we \n     have agreement on a budget topline.\n\n  Secretary Cohen's letter went on to say the following:\n\n       I appreciate the Committee's intent to address the \n     legitimate needs of servicemembers regarding pay and \n     retirement. However, I am concerned that S. 4 could have the \n     opposite effect by raising hopes that cannot be fulfilled \n     until the final budget number is set. Resolving these \n     questions within the normal authorization and budget \n     processes is by far the most desirable approach.\n\n  Similarly, when Secretary Cohen and General Shelton testified before \nthe Armed Services Committee on February 3, the Secretary stated that \nany further increases to military pay and benefits should be considered \nin conjunction with the defense authorization bill. This is what the \nSecretary said:\n\n       [W]e do have to propose this as a package, because if we \n     raise expectations unrealistically and we cannot fulfill \n     them, we have done a disservice to our troops. Secondly, if \n     we are going to take it out of the readiness accounts and \n     procurement, we have also done a disservice. So the package \n     that we have put together we think makes sense and we hope \n     that any variation will be paid for, period.\n\n  Now, the package that they put together is in this bill and is paid \nfor. But the bill goes way beyond the package that is paid for and way \nbeyond the package which the Defense Department and the administration \nsent to the Congress. The bottom line is that every Member of this body \nwould like to support the improved pay and benefits in this bill. At \nleast I believe so. But at some point we are going to have to consider \nthe question of how to pay for these improvements.\n  When this bill was brought to the floor, I noted that a number of \npoints of order could be brought against it under the Budget Act, based \non many provisions of the bill which would either exceed mandatory \nspending allocations or reduce revenues or increase the deficit. Since \nthat time, we have added even more provisions which would violate the \nBudget Act, providing the basis for even more points of order.\n\n  At this time I would like to make some parliamentary inquiries of the \nPresiding Officer. My first parliamentary inquiry is as follows:\n  Is it correct that the bill that we are debating now, S. 4, is \nsubject to a point of order under the Budget Act because the bill \nexceeds the Armed Services Committee's allocation for direct spending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it correct, Mr. President, that S. 4 is subject to a \npoint of order under the Budget Act because the bill reduces revenues \nby decreasing income tax revenues in fiscal year 2000?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it correct, Mr. President, that S. 4 is subject to a \nbudget point of order because it increases the deficit in the first 5 \nyears of the current budget resolution and in the 5 years that follow, \nand therefore violates the pay-as-you-go, or PAYGO rule, by increasing \ndirect spending and reducing revenues without offsets?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And is it correct that the amendment that we adopted \nyesterday repealing the reduction in military retired pay for civilian \nemployees of the Federal Government was subject to a budget point of \norder because it increases the deficit and violates the pay-as-you-go \nrule by increasing spending without an offset?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And is it correct, Mr. President, that the amendment that \nwe adopted earlier today to allow members of the Reserve components to \nparticipate in the Thrift Savings Plan was subject to a budget point of \norder because it would decrease income tax revenues in fiscal year \n2000?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And is it correct, Mr. President, that the amendment we \nadopted earlier today to extend the window of availability of GI bill \nbenefits for the National Guard and Reserve was subject to a budget \npoint of order because it would increase direct spending without \nproviding offsets?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And finally, Mr. President, is it accurate that all of \nthese budget points of order, if made, could only be waived by a so-\ncalled supermajority of the Senate; that is, by a vote of 60 Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair for the responses to those inquiries.\n  The fact that this bill violates the Budget Act in so many different \nways helps to demonstrate the stark fact that there could be serious \nconsequences from taking up this bill as we have, outside of the normal \nlegislative cycle. Now, Mr. President, I share the desire of, I hope, \nall of our colleagues to do what we can to provide fairer compensation \nto our men and women in uniform, and to address the serious recruiting \nand retention problems which are faced by the services. However, if the \nHouse acts on this measure and it is brought back to the Senate floor \nfollowing a conference without paying for the benefits in this bill, \nmany of the same points of order under the Budget Act would still \napply. And so, if the Budget Committee members at that point fail to \nraise points of order which would be available to such a conference \nreport if it comes back to the floor without being paid for, I would \nreserve the right at that time to raise those points of order.\n\n  I think it is very important that before this bill comes back to \neither House in the form of a conference report, that any benefits in \nthis bill be paid for. No matter how much we want to enact these \nimportant provisions into law, at some point we are going to have to \npay for them. That time needs to come before final passage of any \nconference report on this bill. So I want to alert my good friend from \nVirginia that although the points of order were not raised here--the \nBudget Committee members determined, apparently, not to raise such \npoints of order even though the Budget Act is, in the first instance at \nleast, theirs to enforce--any of us can enforce it.\n  Any member of the Budget Committee, I would think, would have a \nspecial responsibility to make sure that we comply with the Budget Act. \nEach one of us has our own reasons for not raising a point of order. \nEach one of us could do so at this time.\n  I am willing to vote to permit this bill to take its next step \nwithout raising a point of order. However, if this bill is passed by \nthe House, goes to conference, and comes back with benefits not being \npaid for, it would then be my intention at that time to consider \nraising points of order, and hopefully the Budget Committee would \nconsider whether or not, in fact, the Budget Act maintenance doesn't \nrequire such points of order to be made before this bill actually is \nsent to the President.\n  I thank the Chair for his rulings and for his cooperation in response \nto my question. Again, I thank my good friend from Virginia for all of \nhis effort on this bill. Even though we do have some problems with \nhaving a bill with such a large amount of money in it that is not paid \nfor, nonetheless, I, as one Senator and ranking member, am willing to \nhave it proceed to the House with the caveat I have just shared with my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished ranking member. I am going to take it to heart, and I am \nconfident this bill can be worked, hopefully, to your satisfaction.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of the distinguished \nSenator from Florida who earlier addressed an amendment. I yield the \nfloor for such purpose.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 29\n\n            (Purpose: To provide various revenue provisions)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon I made some remarks \nconsistent with those that have just been made by the Senator from \nMichigan concerning the fact that we were,\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nas the first legislative action of the 106th Congress, about to pass a \nbill that was substantially unfunded, therefore creating not only the \nrisk to the surplus, which today is a 100-percent Social Security \nsurplus, but also establishing a dangerous precedent for future \nactions. Having so recently arrived at a balanced budget, we should not \nfritter that away the first opportunity that we have in this Congress.\n  There are a number of ways we can pay for this. We can pay for it by \nan amendment that would take funding from some other sources of the \nFederal Government, reduce those in the amount equivalent to balance \nthe expenditure in this proposal. There has been no such amendment \noffered.\n  Another way is to raise taxes to a level sufficient to offset the \nadditional spending. Mr. President, I indicated that it was my \nintention to offer such an amendment. I now send that amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 29.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end add the following:\n\n                           TITLE V--REVENUES\n\n     SEC. 501. EXTENSION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND TAXES.\n\n       (a) Extension of Taxes.--\n       (1) Environmental tax.--Section 59A(e) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Application of Tax.--The tax imposed by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1986, and before January 1, 1996, and to taxable years \n     beginning after June 30, 1999.''\n       (2) Excise taxes.--Section 4611(e) of such Code is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Application of Hazardous Substance Superfund \n     Financing Rate.--The Hazardous Substance Superfund financing \n     rate under this section shall apply after December 31, 1986, \n     and before January 1, 1996, and after June 30, 1999.''\n       (b) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) Income tax.--The amendment made by subsection (a)(1) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after June 30, 1999.\n       (2) Excise tax.--The amendment made by subsection (a)(2) \n     shall take effect on July 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 502. MODIFICATION TO FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYBACK AND \n                   CARRYOVER PERIODS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 904(c) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to limitation on credit) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``in the second preceding taxable year,'', \n     and\n       (2) by striking ``or fifth'' and inserting ``fifth, sixth, \n     or seventh''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to credits arising in taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 1998.\n\n     SEC. 503. EXTENSION OF OIL SPILL LIABILITY TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 4611(f)(1) (relating to \n     application of oil spill liability trust fund financing rate) \n     is amended by striking ``after December 31, 1989, and before \n     January 1, 1995'' and inserting ``after the date of the \n     enactment of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' \n     Bill of Rights Act of 1999 and before October 1, 2008''.\n       (b) Increase in Unobligated Balance Which Ends Tax.--\n     Section 4611(f)(2) (relating to no tax if unobligated balance \n     in fund exceeds $1,000,000,000) is amended by striking \n     ``$1,000,000,000'' each place it appears in the text and \n     heading thereof and inserting ``$5,000,000,000''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the reason for the delay is an attempt to \nget as close a verification as possible as to just what is the unfunded \namount in this legislation.\n  The best number available to us through the staffs of the majority \nand minority of the committee is $16.5 billion over the next 10 years. \nThe amendment I am offering will raise $17.9 billion over that period. \nIt consists of four items.\n  The first is a reinstatement of the environmental tax imposed on \ncorporate taxable income and deposited in the hazardous substance \nSuperfund. This was a tax that was in effect up until 3 years ago, when \nit lapsed. There have been proposals to reestablish this tax as part of \na Superfund reform bill.\n  The controversy has been more on what the nature of that reform bill \nwill be than the extension of the tax itself. So I am proposing that we \nextend this tax and, frankly, hope that before this Congress is over \nthe committee upon which the Presiding Officer and the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee sit will in fact produce a reformed Superfund \nbill.\n  The second item is a reinstatement of the excise taxes which also \nlapsed and which would, but for that, have been deposited in the \nhazardous substance Superfund bill. Both of those would be reinstated \nas of June 30, 1999.\n  The third item is a modification of the foreign tax credit carry-\nover. This was the provision the Senate adopted last year in \nlegislation that was offered by Senator Coverdell of Georgia. It did \nnot become law.\n  Under the current law, if a corporation has a tax credit based on \npayment of taxes in a third country, the company can get a 3-year \ncarry-back--that is, can apply that foreign tax credit for 3 past \ncorporate tax years--or can carry it forward for 5 years. This would \nadjust that by providing there would only be a 1-year carry-back but \nwould give a 7-year carry-forward.\n  The third is a reinstatement of the oil spill liability trust fund \nexcise tax with an increase in the trust fund ceiling to $5 billion. \nThis would be through September 30 of the year 2009.\n  Those four measures, as I indicated, over the 10-year period from \n1999 through 2008, would raise a total of $17.979 billion and would \nfully cover the projected cost of this legislation.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment so that we can achieve the dual \npurpose of seeing that we provide the compensation for our service \npersonnel while at the same time maintain the fiscal discipline which \nwe are so proud and pleased has brought us to the first balanced budget \nin 30 years, an objective that we do not want to frivolously lose.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table reflecting the estimated revenue effects of possible revenue \noffsets for this bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF POSSIBLE REVENUE OFFSETS FOR S. 4.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nbeing offered by my friend from Florida. I appreciate my colleague's \ncommitment to the fiscal responsibility that we have worked so hard to \ninstill in Congress. This is only my second month serving in the United \nStates Senate, but I certainly hope that the process we have followed \nin considering this legislation does not set a precedent for future \ndebates. I am dis-\n\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nappointed that this bill and the amendments have not been considered in \nhearings before the Armed Services Committee. And I am disappointed \nthat we are circumventing the appropriations process by considering \nthis legislation now.\n  Certainly I believe that the pay increase and other benefits for the \nmen and women who are serving our country are warranted, but I think \nwe're going about this all wrong. I spent four years in the House of \nRepresentatives where I made tough decisions to reign in our federal \ndeficit because I believe that we ought to run our country like most \npeople with common sense run their families. I thought--and still \nthink--that we should not spend money that we do not have. Have we \nalready forgotten the lessons that we learned when the debt soared past \n$4 trillion? Do we really want to take credit for helping our veterans \nand the people who continue to serve our country without making the \ntough, but responsible choices on how to pay for these programs?\n  When I first came to Congress in 1992, our country faced a $300 \nbillion annual operating deficit. We have worked hard and made \ndifficult decisions to balance the budget and today we are blessed with \na surplus. If today's process is any indication of our future actions, \nwe seem poised to squander away the surplus without taking the time to \nmake responsible choices. If we were following the rules we wouldn't be \nin this situation. The PAYGO provision enacted in 1990 set the \nframework to discipline Congress when we wanted to spend money without \ndeciding where to get it. And now it appears that we are going to \nviolate that provision because we won't make tough choices.\n  While I am very proud of the men and women who serve our country in \nthe armed forces and while I am pleased to vote in favor of programs to \nsupport them adequately, I am disappointed in this body for failing to \nfollow procedures we have set for ourselves.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may add, I would like to ask for the \nyeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has been recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to state my support for \nthe amendment offered by my distinguished friend and fellow member of \nthe Committee on Finance and simply to inform the Senate that the \nfigures he gave amounting to $17.9 billion over a 10-year period have \nbeen formally provided to the Committee on Finance by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation. These are the final arbiters of our calculations \nin tax matters. So we are talking about real revenue which we can get \nsimply by passing legislation, which we have already passed, and all of \nwhich has been proposed by the President's budget at one point or \nanother.\n  Characteristically, Senator Graham has had the good sense to advance \nan elemental but important proposition: this bill ought to be paid for. \nAs Senator Graham argued a short while ago, it would be a shame if the \nfirst bill passed by the Senate in the 106th Congress were to commence \na reversal of the fiscal discipline that produced the first Federal \nbudget surplus in three decades.\n  Perhaps memory is beginning to fail us. Thankfully, this Senator can \nstill recall standing on this floor in 1993, during debate on the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of that year. It was not easy getting \nthat great deficit reduction measure enacted, but it was the right \nthing to do. Its cumulative deficit reduction effect was some $1.2 \ntrillion over five years--twice what we expected when it was enacted.\n  We did the right thing then, and the right thing to do today is what \nthe Senator from Florida has proposed. The offsets in his amendment are \nstraightforward and ought to be non-controversial. The first would \nextend Superfund taxes; the second would reduce the carryback period \nfor the foreign tax credit (a measure that passed the Senate in 1997 \nand again in 1998), and the third would reinstate the oil spill excise \ntax--which wants to be done in any event. All told these offsets total \nabout $17 billion, enough to fully offset the costs of the bill.\n  We grant that adoption of this amendment would create procedural \ndifficulties, but surely these can be overcome on a piece of \nlegislation that enjoys such broad support. In any event what is \nimportant here is the principle. I thank the Senator from Florida for \npointing it out to us.\n  I thank the Chair, my friend, and the managers for allowing this \nintervention.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier today the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, of which my good friend and colleague from \nNew York is the ranking member, came to the floor and asked that I \ninterpose a motion to table on behalf of Chairman Roth. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I now move to table the amendment. Mr. President, I ask that \nthe vote be stacked in accordance with, I hope, what will be a UC \nrequest which I will pose as soon as I can get some clearance from my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Florida \nfor the determination which he has always shown to pay our bills, not \nto create additional burdens, debt burdens on our children and \ngrandchildren, to protect the Social Security surplus, and to do what \nis right in terms of fiscal responsibility.\n  His amendment is an important amendment. It would make this bill much \nsounder in terms of paying for the benefits that we have in this bill. \nI commend him for that vision and for his determination. I hope that \nhis amendment is not tabled. But I just want to commend him for \nputting, in very specific amendment form, a way in which we can pay for \nthese benefits now instead of just expressing the hope that they will \nbe paid for later.\n  If we follow that course, of course, the points of order which were \nreferred to before would not be in order, which would be just fine with \nme. It also would guarantee that the benefits which we now say we want \nto provide to the men and women in service--in fact, are not \nguaranteed, but make it more likely to guarantee that those benefits \nwould, in fact, flow down the road. And it is because of that \nadditional assurance which would be given the men and women through the \npassage of that amendment that I strongly support the amendment of the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if the plan is to stack this and other \namendments, could we have a period of 3 or 4 minutes prior to the vote \non those stacked amendments to review them with our colleagues before \nthey vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. I advise my colleague that there is provision for that in \nthe order which is before the Senate at the moment but not yet agreed \nto. It will be in there.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 23, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk, on behalf of Senator \nHarkin, a modification to the amendment which he previously sent to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL \n                   NUTRITION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Clarification of Benefits Responsibility.--Subsection \n     (a) of section 1060a of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``may carry out a program to provide \n     special supplemental food benefits'' and inserting ``shall \n     carry out a program to provide supplemental foods and \n     nutrition education''.\n       (b) Relationship to WIC Program.--Subsection (b) of such \n     section is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Federal Payments.--For the purpose of providing \n     supplemental foods under the program required under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture shall make \n     available to the Secretary of Defense for each of\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\n     fiscal years 1999 through 2003, out of funds available for \n     such fiscal year pursuant to the authorization of \n     appropriations under section 17(g)(1) of the Child Nutrition \n     Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786(g)(1)), $10,000,000 plus such \n     additional amount as is necessary to provide supplemental \n     foods under the program for such fiscal year. The Secretary \n     of Defense shall use funds available for the Department of \n     Defense to provide nutrition education and to pay for costs \n     for nutrition services and administration under the \n     program.''.\n       (c) Program Administration.--Subsection (c)(1)(A) of such \n     section is amended by adding at the end the following: ``In \n     the determining of eligibility for the program benefits, a \n     person already certified for participation in the special \n     supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n     children under section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1996 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1786) shall be considered eligible for the \n     duration of the certification period under that program.''.\n       (d) Nutritional Risk Standards.--Subsection (c)(1)(B) of \n     such section is amended by inserting ``and nutritional risk \n     standards'' after ``income eligibility standards''.\n       (e) Definitions.--Subsection (f) of such section is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) The terms `costs for nutrition services and \n     administration', `nutrition education' and `supplemental \n     foods' have the meanings given the terms in paragraphs (4), \n     (7), and (14), respectively, of section 17(b) of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786(b)).''.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2001, the Secretary of \n     Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the implementation of \n     the special supplemental food program required under section \n     1060a of title 10, United States Code. The report shall \n     include a discussion of whether the amount required to be \n     provided by the Secretary of Agriculture for supplemental \n     foods under subsection (b) of that section is adequate for \n     the purpose and, if not, an estimate of the amount necessary \n     to provide supplemental foods under the program.\n       On page 25, strike lines 10 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     (b)(1), the Secretary concerned shall pay the member a \n     special subsistence allowance for each month for which the \n     member is eligible to receive food stamp assistance, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       ``(b) Covered Members.--(1) A member referred to subsection \n     (a) is an enlisted member in pay grade E-5 or below.\n       ``(2) For the purposes of this section, a member shall be \n     considered as being eligible to receive food stamp assistance \n     if the household of the member meets the income standards of \n     eligibility established under section 5(c)(2) of the Food \n     Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2014(c)(2)), not taking into \n     account the special subsistence allowance that may be payable \n     to the member under this section and any allowance that is \n     payable to the member under section 403 or 404a of this \n     title.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5:15 today there \nbe 10 minutes of debate with respect to the Rockefeller-Specter \namendment No. 26, with 5 minutes under the control of Senator \nRockefeller, 5 minutes under the control of the Senator from Virginia. \nI further ask consent that following the debate, the Senate proceed to \na vote on the motion to table the Rockefeller-Specter amendment, \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Harkin amendment No. 23, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the motion by the Senator \nfrom Virginia to table the Graham amendment No. 29. I further ask \nconsent that there be 5 minutes for explanation between each vote, to \nbe equally divided in the usual form. Finally, I ask consent that \nfollowing the votes listed above, the Senate proceed to third reading, \nand final passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the Chair address the Senate with \nregard to the order placed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now going to be 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, on amendment No. 26 by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see my distinguished colleague who has 5 minutes to \npresent his case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I understand there are 5 minutes \nequally divided. I just came from the Medicare commission. What I would \nprefer to do, in that I am offering the amendment and I was not here \nwhen the chairman gave his comments about it, is to be able to respond \nto the 5 minutes and therefore be the closing speaker.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have under my control some time. But I \nsay to my good friend and colleague that, acting on behalf of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, who did address the Senate, I yield \nback my time. Does he want to take a few minutes and examine the Record \nas to what he said? I would hate to delay this vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is no reason to do that. Let me make a few \ncomments and maybe the Senator can expedite the business of the Senate \nand we can go to the vote.\n  I want to bring up one matter, Mr. President. The Senator from West \nVirginia wishes to bring up one matter which was, in fact, not \ndiscussed, but which is of some aggravation to me since it comes from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, and it was addressed to me, but I \nnever got it. I had to go to the Finance Committee staff to get it. In \nthat, they sort of attacked the whole idea of what this was going to \ncost and all the rest of it. I want to respond to that.\n  This is the cost estimate that Senator Roth was able to get from CBO \njust 1 hour ago. In fairly strong terms, I want to say that CBO ought \nto be embarrassed by their efforts, they ought to be ashamed, and I \nwant to tell you why.\n  First, my amendment is not based on a more costly House bill, as the \nCBO estimate claims.\n  It is based on the DOD subvention bill that Congress enacted and that \nDOD beneficiaries are already enjoying. So it is already out there. It \nis also based on a subvention proposal which moved through the Finance \nCommittee, moved through the Senate, and then was killed in conference \nby presumably the House, dropped in conference by the House.\n  Second, the Congressional Budget Office claims that my amendment does \nnot attempt to limit the erosion of what VA is paying now. That is not \ntrue. They cannot be allowed to get away with that. The VA currently \ncarries a substantial burden for caring for medical-eligible veterans. \nThere are substantial provisions in my amendment with Senator Specter, \nSenator Kennedy and others that they will continue to do so. Every \npossible safeguard is littered throughout our amendment--for example, \nto protect the Medicare trust fund; to be selected as a pilot site. \nThat is what I am suggesting in this amendment--only a pilot program, \nnot full scale; just a pilot.\n  If the veterans who have Medicare took it to the VA system right now \nfor health care, they would have to pay out of pocket because they \ncan't get reimbursed under Medicare law. What I am trying to do is let \nthem make the decision if they want to stay where they are or if they \nwant to go to the VA hospital; let them make the decision. It is budget \nneutral.\n  But to get back, to be selected as a pilot site--I am not talking \nabout the whole program; just a pilot site.\n  VA hospitals must receive certification that they have reliable cost-\naccounting systems in place to ensure that the VA will know that their \ncurrent level of effort to provide health care to Medicare-eligible \nveterans is good. HHS can come in and squash it.\n  We also have exactly the same data-match requirement in my amendment \nthat is in the DOD bill, which is in effect. Maybe the Congressional \nBudget Office didn't read this.\n  Also, just as a final backup position, in case in some way I am \nwrong, we have specifically in this amendment that Medicare payments to \nthe VA are capped at $50 million a year. Medicare spent $207 billion a \nyear last year. It will spend $470 billion 10 years from now, if we \ndon't do something in the commission, which I just had to leave. But \nthey are wrong to suggest what they do. That has to go on the Record.\n  I will simply conclude. I also say to the distinguished ranking \nmember and the chairman that this has been through the process. This is \na very, very good amendment, which everybody in my 15 years of \nexperience in\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nthis body, all the Medicare commissions, all the VA commissions, all \nthe future health commissions that are replete--that have looked at \nthis problem have all suggested we do Medicare subvention to give the \nveterans the choice of where they want to take their health care. Since \nthey are already getting paid Medicare anyway at a private hospital, if \nperchance they were to go to a veterans hospital, that would be fine, \nbecause it might be geographically or more collegially helpful. \nMedicare would be paying 5 percent less to that VA hospital than they \nwould be to wherever they are going now.\n  You tell me how we lose on that in the Medicare trust fund. We do \nnothing but win in terms of veterans. We have been discussing this for \nyears. We discussed it in the past before the chairman of the committee \ncorrected me on the year. He is quite right. I was quite wrong. But it \nwas 2 years ago--not last year. DOD is doing this. I would simply ask \nthat my colleagues vote against the amendment to table, because I think \nthis is a truly significant amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that John Bradley, a detailee to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs be granted floor privileges for the \nduration of the Senate's consideration of S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I find myself in a very awkward position \nin that I am going to support that--not today but eventually if this \nmotion of the Senator from Virginia prevails. Then the committee of \njurisdiction, the Finance Committee, presumably will take up this \nsubject, and hopefully enact legislation, if not identical to those of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, certainly to achieve the same goals.\n  What the Senator from Virginia is doing is very simple at this \nmoment. That is, the Senate conducts business in a certain way. We \nrespect the jurisdiction of our several committees. We respect the \nchairman of those committees to ask a fellow chairman such as myself to \nprotect the jurisdiction of that committee and to allow the Finance \nCommittee in this instance to do the legislation. That is the sole \npurpose of my motion to table, because someday the Senator from \nVirginia will cast a vote to achieve the goals that the Senator from \nWest Virginia, I think, has very properly raised today as a matter of \ngreat need to our veterans.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield \nto me for a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Indeed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished \nchairman is saying. I would only counter that in the veterans committee \nwe are rather accustomed to having our jurisdiction violated. And \nalthough, it has caused me to lose some sleep at night, I tend to make \nthat a little less important as to what is happening to the veteran, in \nwhich case I think this is enormous consideration. I further point out \nthat in this DOD bill already the VA and the veterans committee are \nalready substantially compromised. I am not objecting to that, because \nthere are substantial VA things in it. I think this is a powerfully \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I appreciate the Senator's forbearance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for those comments, my \ngood friend and colleague. It is just that, indeed, Chairman Specter, \nand the Senator from West Virginia as ranking members have come over to \naddress the issue. You made the decision. Chairman Roth, likewise, \nexamined this amendment, came over, and took a different position as \nchairman. Therefore, out of respect to him and the way that we try to \naccord jurisdiction to the committees, I continue to adhere to the \nmotion to table, and ask Senators to support that motion.\n  I yield the time, and, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Virginia to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from West Virginia. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 0, nays 100, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 24 Leg.]\n\n                               NAYS--100\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 26) was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senate will \nplease come to order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nyeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 26) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 23, as modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Virginia that we are now to have a vote on the Harkin amendment \nNo. 23, and there is 5 minutes reserved for the proponent and opponent, \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is correct. There is \n5 minutes for debate, equally divided. The Senate is not in order, so I \nask the Senator from Iowa to please withhold until the Senate comes to \norder.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in the bill there is an important provision that \nallows for $180 to be given to help the enlisted personnel who are on \nfood stamps. We have people in uniform today who are eligible for food \nstamps. There is a $180 special allowance for military personnel in the \nbill, if they are eligible for food stamps.\n\n  All my amendment does is the following. I allows military personnel \nstationed overseas to receive the same $180 special allowance as those \nliving in the United States. The bill only gives the allowance to \npeople stationed here in the United States. It also streamlines the \napplication process. Right now, if a soldier is eligible for food \nstamps, they have to go to the food stamp office and get a \ncertification, come back to the military personnel office and then go \nback to the food stamp office. My amendment allows for a one-step \nprocess. With my amendment, all they have to do is go to the military \nto get certified.\n  Secondly, my amendment allows service people living off base to have \nthe same $180 special allowance eligibility as those living on base, in \nother words, it disregards the housing allowance when determining \neligibility.\n  Next, it allows eligible military families to receive the WIC Program \nif they\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\nare overseas. Right now they can get the WIC Program only if they are \nstationed in the United States.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Order in the Chamber.\n  The Senator from Iowa may proceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I heard some people say I am harming the \nWIC Program. I disagree. You tell me how fair it is for young soldiers \nhere under the current rules. Military families living in the United \nStates are eligible for WIC, and their wives are pregnant, they have \nkids, and they are getting the WIC Program, and all of a sudden they \nare sent overseas. Once they get overseas, they are no longer eligible \nfor the WIC Program. Is that fair? They still have the same needs. All \nmy amendment says is if they are eligible for the WIC Program here in \nAmerica, they are eligible if they are shipped overseas. The DOD \nestimates maybe $10 or $20 million more per year in costs.\n  So that is all my amendment does, these modest but important \nimprovement to the underlying bill. It says that if you are a member of \nthe armed forces eligible for a $180 special allowance while stationed \nin America, you are eligible overseas. That is all it says. If you are \neligible for WIC here, you are eligible overseas. It also makes the \nprocess streamlined so you do not have to go down to the food stamp \noffice, back to the military, and back to the food stamp office just to \nqualify for the special allowance. And it treats military housing \nallowances, as far as eligibility, in a more fair manner. Under the \ncurrent bill, if you are living on the base you would be eligible for \nthe special subsistence allowance, but if you live off base you may not \nbe eligible because you have the housing allowance. But you use that \nall up for rent, anyway. This is simply not fair.\n  I think this amendment, again, is one that tries to help people in \nthe military in a fair way. I think it is embarrassing that we have \npeople in the military who have to get food stamps. What this amendment \ndoes is end that once and for all, for all military personnel, who \nshould be eligible for some special benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia intends to \nsupport the amendment. If there is any Senator desiring to use the time \nthat I have remaining, which is 2 minutes, I would be happy to yield to \nthat Senator.\n  Hearing no Senator, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. LEVIN. He does not need a rollcall.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I inquire of the proponents? Do you \ndesire a rollcall or not? You told me earlier you did.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. Voice vote. Mr. President, proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 23), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 29\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The next vote is on or in relation to the Graham \namendment, Mr. President. I do ask for the yeas and nays on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator requesting yeas and nays on the \nmotion to table?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on this motion?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that this be a 10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield my time to the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for \n2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senator Graham. I say reluctantly because I strongly agree \nwith the premise that it is important to pay for this important bill, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of \n1999.\n  However, Senator Graham's amendment is not the way to do it. This is \nan authorization bill. It is not a tax bill. And if we adopt Senator \nGraham's amendment, we turn the bill into a revenue bill. Neither \nSenator Graham's amendment nor any other potential amendments will have \ncome through the Finance Committee, which is the appropriate committee \nto review all tax legislation in the Senate.\n  But most importantly, adoption of the amendment would subject the \nentire bill to a blue slip from the House of Representatives, \neffectively dooming the important policies embodied in S. 4. So I say \nto those of you who support this important piece of legislation--and I \ndo--I think it is important that we kill this amendment; otherwise, as \nI say, it becomes a tax bill and will be blue-slipped on the House \nside.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as I have remaining to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I assume that there is going to be a vote \non this amendment. Having listened to the Senator from Delaware, and \nrecognizing that the Constitution says all revenue bills shall \noriginate in the House, I make a constitutional point of order against \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order will have to wait until the \nSenator from Florida has used or yielded back all of his time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At which time the said point of order can be \nmade.\n  Mr. GRAMM. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 2 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are about to take our first legislative \naction of the 106th Congress. Many of us who ran for election or \nreelection last November said that one of our greatest sources of pride \nwas that after 30 years of deficits and a Federal debt which had \nreached close to $6 trillion, that we had finally exercised the fiscal \ndiscipline to achieve a balanced Federal budget.\n  What are we about to do with the first vote of this 106th Congress? \nWe are about to pass a bill which will have an unfunded liability of \n$16.5 billion. That is $16.5 billion not subject to appropriations. \nThat is $16.5 billion of direct authorized spending in this legislation \nplus revenue reductions that are incident to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, that is not the message that we want to send to the \nAmerican people--that we are going to add a further indebtedness to the \nFederal Government, that we are going to start down the slippery slope \nto more deficits and more additions to our national debt.\n  We do not want to tell our service men and women that we have given \nthem these benefits, which we need to do, but that we were unwilling to \npay for them, so that for every dollar we give them, 34 cents is \nunfunded. That is not fair either to the taxpayers or to the service \nmen and women who we are trying to convince that we are going to \nsubstantially improve their service conditions so that they will join \nup and stay and serve the Nation.\n  Mr. President, what I have proposed is a simple proposition. If we \nare going to make this offer to our service personnel, let's pay for \nit. I have proposed a payment of four items. Three are tax measures \nwhich have been passed by this Congress and which have lapsed. This \nwould renew those measures. Two of them relate to the Superfund \nProgram, one of them to the oilspill liability, the fourth is a measure \nwhich was\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nincluded in a bill that Senator Coverdell brought to us last year, \nwhich passed the Senate, which makes a change in the carry-over \nprovision for foreign tax credit.\n  Those four items together will raise the funds necessary to convert \nthis blank check into a fully funded check, be responsible to the \nAmerican taxpayers, to the service men and women and, particularly, be \nresponsible to the American people who are looking to us to see if we \ncan maintain the fiscal discipline that we so recently acquired. This \nis a test of this Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the amendment before us contains several \nmajor changes to the Tax Code, changes that affect the competitiveness \nof America in the world market, changes that represent fundamental \nmodifications to the Tax Code.\n  I realize that we have taken a holiday from reality here in spending \nbillions and billions of dollars, but to come to the floor of the \nSenate in violation of the Constitution and to start rewriting the Tax \nCode when the Constitution says that tax bills shall originate in the \nHouse is taking this whole process too far.\n\n\n                     Constitutional Point of Order\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I make a constitutional point of order \nagainst this amendment in that it violates the Constitution, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the Senate's precedents, a \nconstitutional point of order must be submitted to the Senate. The \nquestion is, Is the point of order well taken?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 80, nays 20, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 25 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--80\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--20\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bryan\n     Daschle\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 80, the nays are \n20. The constitutional point of order is well-taken; therefore, the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The specific nature of a constitutional point of order \nwas that the amendment that I had offered would have effected taxation \nand therefore required that this measure be originated in the House of \nRepresentatives, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Texas care to clarify \nhis point of order?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The point of order was a constitutional point of order \nmade under the provisions of article I, which require that revenue \nbills originate in the House. The Senator's amendment changed three \nprovisions of the Tax Code and therefore violated the Constitution. As \nthe Chair ruled, under precedent, the Chair does not rule as to whether \norder stands. Therefore, we voted 80-20 to sustain that point of order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, further inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would that indicate that if there were in the underlying \nbill that is now before the Senate also measures which effected \nrevenues that the bill would similarly be subject to a constitutional \npoint of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is just against the \namendment and not against the entire bill. That is why the amendment \nfails. It doesn't apply to the rest of the bill. The order was raised \nagainst the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the question I asked was, would a \nconstitutional point of order be available against the bill because of \nprovisions which effected revenue?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to be heard on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I addressed that question to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. He assured me that it did not \nhave any provision in there that would be subject to that question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have a further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The letter from the Congressional Budget Office, \nsubmitted to Chairman Warner on February 12, 1999, on page 9, indicates \nthat there has been an effect in the change of receipts as a result of \nprovisions which are in the underlying bill. The question is, would \nthat make the underlying bill subject to the same constitutional point \nof order as effecting revenue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am advised by the Parliamentarian that, \nunder the previous order, we are at the point of third reading and \npassage of the bill without intervening action at this point in time, \nwhich would bar a point of order being raised at this point in time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Point of order, Mr. President. There was also, I believe, \nno provision in the unanimous-consent agreement we accepted that would \nhave sanctioned the constitutional point of order against the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the question has been placed to the Chair, \nand I understand the Chair is ready to rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Under the previous agreement that was in \nexistence, the point of order was allowed for and was not barred \nagainst the amendments. The previous order provided that there would \nnot be intervening action between the vote on the final amendment and \nfinal passage. Therefore, the point of order at this point in time will \nnot be allowed, and it was in order for the prior time during the \namendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Would a \nmotion asking unanimous consent that a constitutional point of order be \navailable be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator wishes to ask unanimous consent \nfor such a point of order, it would be in order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto raise a constitutional point of order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill, as \namended. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The Clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to express my profound gratitude to \nthe staffs of both the majority and minority, and to all Senators for \ntheir cooperation. I think we learned a lesson in constitutional \nhistory, thanks to Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I feel compelled to explain the reasons for \nmy vote against this bill in spite of my strong support for the goals \nfor which this bill strives. Clearly, our armed forces personnel \ndeserve the best pay and benefits that this nation can provide for \nthem. I am aware of the recruiting and retention problems being faced \nby the services, and I know that the Armed Services Committee had those \nproblems in mind as they drafted this legislation. I do believe, \nhowever, that we need to look more closely at how we can solve the \nmilitary recruitment and retention problems. That question has not been \nadequately studied. Perhaps a pay raise will stem the tide of personnel \nleaving the military. Maybe people are leaving simply because this \nnation has enjoyed several years of a strong economy. The reduced \npension could be the reason that people are leaving. The point I make \nis that we are not really sure why the military is having difficulty \nmeeting its recruitment and retention goals, and this bill seems to be \na shotgun approach to solving that problem.\n  The President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget makes allowances for the \nproblems that the armed services are facing. The proposed budget would \nincrease military pay across the board by 4.4%, there would be greater \nincreases for mid-career personnel and military pensions would be \nincreased from 40% to 50%. These changes are not minor. They will cost \nbillions of dollars over the next six years, and I applaud the \nAdministration for offering these additions to our military pay and \nbenefits programs. The difference between the President's proposal and \nthis bill is that the President's proposal is paid for in the budget. \nThis bill, on the other hand, is not funded. No one has any idea where \nthe funding will come from to pay for this bill's generous provisions.\n  I read the Congressional Budget Office's report on this legislation. \nThat report has been entered in the Congressional Record, and it \nestimates that enactment of the bill would raise discretionary spending \nby $1.1 billion in 2000 and $13.8 billion from 2000 to 2004. According \nto statements from several Senators on the floor, the amendments that \nwere added to this bill would increase the cost by a couple of billion \nmore over the next several years. To spend that amount of money when we \ndo not have a source of funding is irresponsible. To fund this bill, we \nwill have to find offsets in the defense budget, use surplus funds, or \nraid domestic spending. I oppose all of those means.\n  Several of my colleagues have expressed concern about the cost of \nthis bill. They assume, I suppose, that this bill will become more \nreasonable in conference. Perhaps they plan to oppose this bill if, \nafter conference, there is still no means to fund it. I, however, \ncannot in good conscience vote to send this bill to conference in the \nhope that it will somehow emerge vastly improved and worthy of my \nsupport.\n  Beyond the funding problems inherent in this legislation, there are a \nfew other problems I would like to address. First, the Secretary of \nDefense does not support this bill. In a letter to the Armed Services \nCommittee, Secretary Cohen stated that this bill ``could raise hopes \nthat cannot be fulfilled until the final budget number is set.'' Like \nthe Secretary, I would like to support this bill, but it would not be \nright to support this expanded package of pay and benefits for military \npersonnel now, and then, later, to decide that we are\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\nnot willing to fund the entire package. This amounts to an \nauthorization bill. The check for these funds is not written. Again, no \none knows how we are going to appropriate money to pay for this.\n  Unfortunately, there have been no hearings on this bill. I would \nthink that a $16 billion unfunded mandate deserved at least a hearing \nor two. I would have liked to have known what the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nthought of this bill's provisions. I would have liked to have seen the \nstudies that show the effect that each of these provisions has on \nrecruitment and retention. There was no testimony, and there were no \nstudies. There was just a rush to ``do something,'' and what we have \ndone here is irresponsible. The first legislation to pass through the \nSenate in the 106th Congress is a $16 billion, budget-busting, unfunded \nmandate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1864-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, currently the House Commerce Committee is \nexamining whether legislation is necessary to minimize the threat that \na national, searchable electronic database of thousands of industrial \n``worst-case accident scenarios'' will be posted on the Internet, \navailable for searching from anywhere in the world.

The issue is not whether this \ninformation is public: it is, and the FBI has suggested way to provide \nAmericans with the information while minimizing the terrorist threat. \nThe issue is selecting an information distribution system that does not \ncreate a targeting tool that terrorists can use to disastrous and \ntragic ends. However, environmental groups have threatened to use the \nFreedom of Information Act to obtain the publicize the national \ndatabase. Congress may have to act swiftly in order to address this \nissue before EPA receives the worst-case scenarios by the June 21 \nfiling date.\n  Mr. President, this is not a environmental or right-to-know issue. \nThis is an issue of national safety, and we must treat it as just that. \nCongress cannot be responsible for facilitating terrorist attacks on \nAmerican cities.

SECRETARY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning I had the opportunity to \nconfer with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is in Washington, \nD.C. holding extensive meetings. He will be meeting with the Speaker \nand other members of the Congressional leadership before returning to \nNew York.\n  This morning, we had a very broad range of discussions about the many \nthreats that face the world today, primarily weapons of mass \ndestruction. I expressed my concern about the situation in Iraq and the \ncontinued failure of Saddam Hussein to abide by the many U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolutions which require the continuing destruction of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction, as well as the capability to manufacture \nsuch weapons and their delivery systems. I stressed to the Secretary \nGeneral the urgency of the situation and the need for the Security \nCouncil to act to ensure compliance with its resolutions. In my view, \nthe future credibility of the Security Council is on the line.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the Secretary General spoke at Georgetown \nUniversity on, ``The Future of United Nations Peacekeeping.'' I found \nthe Secretary General's remarks to be very timely and thought-\nprovoking. I ask unanimous consent that the text of his speech be \nprinted in the Record. I urge my colleagues to review this speech.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Address by the Secretary-General--``The Future of United Nations \n                             Peacekeeping''\n\n       Thank you, Don, and Father O'Donovan, for those very kind \n     words.\n       I am greatly flattered by what you have said, and greatly \n     honoured to become the 18th recipient of the Jit Trainor \n     award\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, I am more than happy to speak to you \n     this evening about United Nations peacekeeping.\n       As Don has mentioned, I was head of the UN's Department of \n     Peacekeeping Operations for four years before I became \n     Secretary-General. It was a very evicting time, and on the \n     whole a very inspiring one. So the subject has remained close \n     to my heart.\n       The United Nations can, I think, fairly claim to have \n     invented both the word and the concept of peacekeeping, but \n     it did to by improvising in response to specific situations \n     and events. Not surprisingly, therefore, peacekeeping has \n     evolved over time, and has taken different forms as it \n     adapted to different circumstances.\n       Since the end of the cold war our operations have become \n     more ambitious and more complex. Almost without exception, \n     the new conflicts which have erupted since 1991 have been \n     civil ones. Although often there is outside interference, the \n     main battle is between people who are, or were, citizens of \n     the same State. This has obliged the United Nations to re-\n     define the tasks that peacekeeping involves.\n       Instead of maintaining a cease-fire while waiting for a \n     political solution to be negotiated, we are now more often \n     deployed as part of an agreed process, to help implement a \n     fledgling political settlement. This involves us in such \n     activities as collecting weapons, disarming and demobilising \n     militias, supervising elections, and monitoring--sometimes \n     even training--police forces.\n       Putting a war-torn society back together is never easy, and \n     one can seldom say with real confidence that the point of no \n     return has been achieved. But we can claim some success \n     stories. Not all the wounds of conflict have yet healed, but \n     Namibia, Mozambique, El Salvador, even Cambodia are countries \n     which have now lived several years without war, and which \n     have at least a fair chance of lasting peace, thanks to the \n     hard work of United Nations peacekeepers in the late 1980s \n     and early 90s.\n       To some extent we have been victims of our own success. In \n     the early 90s expectations ran very high, and some of the \n     assignments we were given were ones which could only have \n     been carried out successfully by much larger forces, armed \n     with heavier equipment and above all with clearer mandates.\n       The international community has drawn lessons from these \n     sad experiences, but perhaps not always the right ones.\n       In Africa, the effect was to make external powers more \n     reluctant to expose their forces. Indeed, the tragedy of \n     Rwanda was caused, in part, by fear of repeating the \n     experience of Somalia, which haunted some members of the \n     Security Council.\n       In Europe, thankfully, a different lesson was drawn. \n     External powers especially the United States, became more \n     involved, not less. We saw diplomatic skill and military \n     muscle combined--late in the day, but with great effect--to \n     produce the Dayton agreement.\n       The Implementation Force in Bosnia, and the Stabilisation \n     Force which has succeeded it, have to my mind been model \n     peacekeeping forces. Heavily armed, and authorised to use \n     their arms if challenged, they have in practice hardly used \n     them at all because their authority has not been challenged.\n       But, although authorised by the Security Council, they are \n     not United Nations peacekeeping forces, in the sense that \n     they do not wear blue helmets. As you know, they are under \n     NATO leadership.\n       But another success was the parallel operation in Eastern \n     Slavonia.\n       There too a force was deployed strong enough to intimidate \n     the local parties, so that the Transitional Authority was \n     able to see off early challenges and fulfill its mandate \n     without being dragged into combat. But this was a United \n     Nations operation in the full sense of the term. It brought \n     together a broad range of international responses--military, \n     political, and humanitarian--under the authority of a Special \n     Representative of the Secretary-General, who happened to be a \n     very distinguished American, Jacques Paul Klein.\n       The result was an integrated strategy, and the force was \n     able to withdraw on time, without leaving renewed bloodshed \n     behind it.\n       But peacekeeping is not, and must not become, an arena of \n     rivalry between the UN and NATO.\n       There is plenty of work for us both to do. We work best \n     when we respect each other's competence and avoid getting in \n     each other's way. In fact the UN Charter explicitly \n     encourages regional arrangements and agencies, like NATO, to \n     deal with regional problems, provided they do so in a manner \n     consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United \n     Nations. So I welcome NATO's role, as I welcome that of other \n     regional organizations in other parts of the world.\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\n       But few others have, or would claim to have, the same \n     operational capacity that NATO has. It is therefore \n     unfortunate that in recent years the Security Council has \n     been reluctant to authorise new United Nations peacekeeping \n     operations, and has often left regional or sub-regional \n     organizations to struggle with local conflicts on their own.\n       That puts an unfair burden on the organizations in \n     question. It is also a waste of the expertise in peacekeeping \n     which the United Nations has developed over the years.\n       As a result, the number of United Nations peacekeepers fell \n     precipitately between 1994 and 1998. If only that meant there \n     had been a drop in the need for peacekeeping, we could all \n     rejoice. But that is far from the case. If fact the overall \n     number of peacekeepers deployed around the world remains \n     roughly constant. It is only the proportion of them wearing \n     blue berets that has declined.\n       Ironically this happened just when the United Nations, with \n     the support of its Member States, was developing a sound \n     infrastructure for directing and supporting peacekeeping \n     operations.\n       It is a paradox that, in technical terms, we are better \n     equipped now that we have only fourteen thousand soldiers in \n     the field than we were five years ago when we had nearly \n     eighty thousand. And if our capacity continues to be under-\n     utilised there is an obvious risk that Member States will not \n     longer give us the resources we need to sustain it.\n       This would not matter if the peace around the world were \n     being successfully kept. But the truth is that the role \n     played by NATO in Bosnia has proved very hard for regional \n     arrangements or defence alliances to reproduce elsewhere.\n       In Africa especially, I find that local powers, and indeed \n     regional organizations, are turning more and more to the \n     United Nations for help. We must not dismantle the capacity \n     that can provide that help.\n       Of course we must be careful to avoid the mistakes of the \n     past. We must never again send a UN force, just for the sake \n     of it, to keep a non-existent peace, or one to which the \n     parties themselves show no sense of commitment.\n       That, perhaps, is the lesson of Angola, where as you know \n     civil war is now raging once again, and I have had to \n     recommend the withdrawal of the United Nations force.\n       But let us not forget the positive lesson of Mozambique, \n     which ten years ago seemed quite as tragic and hopeless a \n     case as Angola.\n       There, the presence of 7,000 United Nations troops had a \n     calming effect, helping to reassure vulnerable parties and \n     people, and to deter disruptions of the peace.\n       Conflict was successfully channelled into legitimate \n     political institutions, so that interests no longer had to be \n     pursued at the point of a gun.\n       This required working with the parties to strengthen \n     national institutions and broaden their base. And to ensure \n     that the parties could make use of the new institutions, we \n     had to help them--especially the guerrilla opposition--to \n     transform themselves from an army into a political party.\n       Had we not done that, the opposition leaders would quickly \n     have become disillusioned with the political process and \n     would have been tempted to return to the battlefield.\n       We also provided incentives for individual combatants, many \n     of whom had been pressed into service as children, had come \n     of age as fighters, and knew no other way of life.\n       And so, with a little help from the United Nations, the \n     parties in Mozambique were able to make peace. What was once \n     a violent and ruthless rebel movement has become a \n     constructive and peaceful opposition party.\n       No doubt we got some things right in Mozambique which we \n     got wrong in Angola, but surely the main difference lies in \n     the behavior of the political leaders, on both sides, in the \n     two countries.\n       So yes, we have to be cautious about taking on new mandates \n     in countries where many different interests and ethnic \n     animosities are involved.\n       But let us not nurture any illusions that regional or sub-\n     regional bodies will be able to handle these problems on \n     their own, without help from the United Nations.\n       You only have to list the countries which might make up a \n     ``regional force'' in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for \n     instance, to realize that many of them are already involved \n     in the hostilities on one side or the other.\n       Indeed, the experience of decades has shown that \n     peacekeeping is often best done by people from outside the \n     region, who are more easily accepted as truly detached and \n     impartial.\n       So I think we must be prepared for a conclusion which many \n     African leaders have already reached: that if a peacekeeping \n     force is required in the Congo, the United Nations would \n     probably have to be involved.\n       But equally we must be prepared to insist that no such \n     force can be deployed unless it is given sufficient strength \n     and firepower to carry out its assignment, and assured of the \n     full backing of the Security Council when it has to use that \n     power.\n       I see no need for it to include American troops. But I \n     think in other aspects the Bosnian model is just as relevant \n     to Africa as it is to Europe.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, increasingly, we find that \n     peacekeeping cannot be treated as a distinct task, complete \n     in itself. It has to be seen as part of a continuum, \n     stretching from prevention to conflict resolution and \n     ``peace-building.''\n       And these things cannot be done in a neat sequence. You \n     have to start building peace while the conflict is still \n     going on.\n       It is essentially a political task, but one which is part \n     and parcel of a peacekeeping role. More than ever, the \n     distinctions between political and military aspects of our \n     work are becoming blurred.\n       I have no doubt that in future we will need to be even more \n     adaptable.\n       The future of peacekeeping, I suspect, will depend in large \n     part on whether we succeed in mobilizing new forms of \n     leverage to bring parties towards a settlement.\n       In the past, when a peacekeeping operation ran into \n     trouble, the most effective response was to report this to \n     the Security Council, whose Permanent Members would then put \n     pressure on their respective proxies, mainly by extending or \n     reducing economic and military aid.\n       In today's conflicts that kind of government-to-government \n     aid is less important. Conflicting parties now finance their \n     armies with hard currency earned by exporting the commodities \n     they control.\n       How do we obtain leverage over those sources of income? It \n     may involve a new kind of relationship with the private \n     sector, where the foreign customers and backers of the \n     parties are to be found.\n       Also, given the civil nature of today's conflicts, which \n     are always in some degree a battle for hearts and minds, we \n     may need to engage on a broader front with the civilian \n     population. At the very least, we must ensure that they have \n     access to reliable and objective information, so that they \n     are not an easy prey for artificially fanned fear and hatred.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, it is sadly clear that the need for \n     United Nations peacekeeping will continue, and indeed will \n     probably grow. And it is very much in America's national \n     interest to support an international response to conflicts--\n     even those which seem remote--because, in today's \n     interconnected world, they seldom remain confined in one \n     country or even one region.\n       Take Rwanda, for example. The failure of the international \n     community to respond effectively led not only to genocide in \n     Rwanda itself, but also to the exodus of refugees and \n     combatants across the borders.\n       Because we failed to act in time, seven countries are now \n     fighting each other in a mineral-rich region which should \n     have been a prime area for investment and development. Is \n     this something the U.S. can afford to ignore?\n       Personally, I shall always be haunted by our failure to \n     prevent or halt the genocide in Rwanda until nearly a million \n     people had been killed. The peacekeeping force was withdrawn \n     at the very moment that it should have been reinforced.\n       But whether we express remorse or outrage, or both, our \n     words are of little value--unless we are sure that next time \n     we will act differently.\n       Which means that next time we will not hide behind the \n     complexities and dangers of the situation. Next time we must \n     not wait for hindsight to tell us the wisest course.\n       Nor must we set impossible conditions, thereby ensuring \n     that the Security Council takes no decision until too late.\n       We must be prepared to act while things are still unclear \n     and uncertain, but in time to make a difference.\n       We must do so with sufficient resources--including credible \n     military strength when a deterrent is necessary--to ensure \n     the mission's success and the peacekeepers' safety.\n       And once the Council has authorised an operation, \n     everyone--but especially those Council members who voted for \n     it--must pay their share of the cost, promptly and in full.\n       Only if we approach our work in that spirit, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen, can we dare hope that peacekeeping in the twenty-\n     first century will build on the achievements of the \n     twentieth.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1911-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1912-S1913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HIGH MARKS FOR MAYOR MENINO\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto Mayor Tom Menino of the City of Boston and the extraordinary effort \nhe has made over the past year to bring the Democratic National \nConvention to Boston in 2000.\n  Regardless of the outcome of this effort, all of Boston is proud of \nthe brilliant job that Mayor Menino has done in bringing the business \ncommunity and the neighborhoods of Boston together to make our city one \nof the most attractive and dynamic cities in the world. Mayor Menino \ndeserves enormous credit for highlighting Boston's great strengths--its \ndiverse heritage, its proud history, its cultural attractions, its \nconvention facilities, its transportation infrastructure, its \ntechnological capabilities and its renowned world leadership in \neducation, health care and many other impressive attributes.\n  Boston has proven itself time and again in recent years in its unique \nability to host major national and international events. And thanks in \ngreat part to Mayor Menino's outstanding efforts, Boston is in the top \nrank of cities throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\n  An editorial last Friday in the Boston Globe entitled ``An A for \nMenino's Effort'' pays eloquent tribute to the Mayor's leadership and \nachievements, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Boston Globe, February 19, 1999]\n\n                        An A for Menino's Effort\n\n       Mayor Menino banged drums, crashed symbols, and sounded \n     trumpets in his attempt to attract the 2000 Democratic \n     National Convention. But in the end the political symphony \n     will take place elsewhere, probably Los Angeles.\n       Give the mayor credit on this one. Boston suffered from a \n     dearth of hotel rooms, no previous experience with national \n     political conventions, and the huge Central Artery \n     disruption. But Menino brought Boston to the final three \n     among 28 applicants. In the process, he blended the skills of \n     corporate giants, upstart entrepreneurs, local and regional \n     public officials, and technical experts.\n       BankBoston, Fleet Financial, and Bell Atlantic deserve \n     special recognition for supporting the mayor's efforts when \n     few thought Boston could contend. These partners can be \n     called on again to attract major business and professional \n     meetings to a new convention center.\n       Boston's bid failed due to conditions beyond its control. \n     California's 54 electoral votes outrank Massachusetts' 12. \n     Equally important, the Democrats need to shore up the West \n     Coast firmly and quickly in order to allocate money and \n     muscle to Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other key \n     states if they hope to hold the presidency. No amount of \n     showmanship, corporate support, or creativity by Boston's \n     boosters could solve that problem of political calculus.\n       A frustrated Menino jumped ahead of the DNC when he \n     announced that Boston's bid had failed. The official decision \n     is not expected until early March. That gaffe might \n     disqualify Menino for the deportment prize. But the mayor's \n     reaction is understandable to all, including the outgoing \n     Democratic national chairman, Steven Grossman.\n       ``Menino threw his heart and soul into this thing,'' says \n     Grossman, a Newton businessman. ``That's what leadership is \n     all about.''\n       The mayor exhausted his political and inner resources in \n     this unsuccessful bid of the convention. But he energized \n     Boston in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1912-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pastor Jack \nand Anna Hayford as they celebrate 30 years of service to The Church On \nThe Way in Van Nuys, California. It is with great honor and distinction \nthat I commend the Hayfords for their long and outstanding service to \ntheir congregation and people of faith throughout this nation and \nliterally around the world.\n  Pastor Jack and Anna have been faithful teachers of God's Word, \ninspiring millions in their relationship with God. Their personal \nsacrifices over the past 30 years of service are exemplified by their \nrelentless pursuit to minister to others. Pastor Jack has helped bring \npastors and church leaders together at new levels of unity. His \ntireless and selfless pursuit to build bridges within the Body of \nChrist across racial divisions is to be commended.\n  Anna Hayford, a wife and mother, serves as a role-model to women in \nministry on how to balance the duties of home and church and the \ndemands of marriage and family. She is a faithful source of strength \nand encouragement to many through her teaching and counseling ministry.\n  Over the past 30 years, the Hayfords have been on a mission to bring \nunderstanding, repentance, and healing to the pain that has separated \nblack and white churches in America. As our nation looks increasingly \nfor guidance in this period of moral decay, the Hayfords provide a \nspiritual path for others to follow.\n  I wish Pastor Jack and Anna Hayford a memorable celebration of their \ncommitment to the redemptive mission of Christ. May God bless them and \nprotect them in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1913-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1913-S1916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DRAFT Y2K LIABILITY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senior Senator from Washington state, \nSlade Gorton, and I have committed to working on legislation to address \nliability issues arising out of Y2K problems. To this end, I introduced \nS. 96. As Senator Gorton and I agreed before the bill was filed, we \nhave been listening to concerns and views of the varied constituencies \ninterested in limiting wasteful litigation and encouraging prevention \nand timely remediation of Y2K problems. I am very pleased that today we \nare offering into the record a revised working draft for additional \ninput and discussion.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Y2K problem should not be \nunderestimated. Before the session began, Senator McCain and I \ncommitted to working on legislation that will allow entities to focus \ntheir efforts on remediation and prevent unproductive litigation. We \nhave solicited and obtained input from sources representing both \npotential plaintiffs and potential defendants in Y2K actions. We want \nto continue listening and working on this issue, but do not have much \ntime--the countdown had begun. The draft measure that we are putting on \nthe record today reflects principally the measure proposed by a large \ncoalition of business groups including the Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, and many others. The draft will, I hope, invite \nmore feedback, and focus the efforts of all interested parties. I \ninvite our colleagues and all interested parties to continue to provide \nus with comments and suggestions so that we can improve the measure \nbefore it is marked up by the Commerce Committee on March 3.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I intend to mark up Y2K liability legislation in the \nCommerce Committee next week so that it can be considered by the full \nSenate as soon as possible. If the bill is to serve the needs for which \nit is designed, it must be passed expeditiously. We cannot have the \nintended effect of encouraging businesses to be proactive in preventing \nY2K failures if we delay action on this bill until later in the \nsession. This bill addresses an immediate need, and the Senate must act \non it accordingly. I ask unanimous consent that the draft measure be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the draft was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Amendment--\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Forum for Y2K class actions.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The majority of responsible business enterprises in the \n     United States are committed to working in cooperation with \n     their contracting partners towards the timely and cost-\n     effective resolution of the many technological, business, and \n     legal issues associated with the Y2K date change.\n       (2) Congress seeks to encourage businesses to concentrate \n     their attention and resources in short time remaining before \n     January 1, 2000, on addressing, assessing, remediating, and \n     testing their Y2K problems, and to minimize any possible \n     business disruptions associated with the Y2K issues.\n       (3) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation \n     to assure that Y2K problems do not unnecessarily disrupt \n     interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in \n     Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses \n     prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially \n     devastating economic impact of Y2K.\n       (4) Y2K issues will potentially affect practically all \n     business enterprises to at least some degree, giving rise \n     possibly to a large number of disputes.\n       (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K \n     problems is not feasible for many businesses, particularly \n     small businesses, because of its complexity and expense.\n       (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes can only exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the Y2K date change, and work \n     against the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (7) Congress recognizes that every business in the United \n     States should be concerned that widespread and protracted Y2K \n     litigation may threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business relationships that are so important to the effective \n     functioning of the world economy, and which may put \n     unbearable strains on an overburdened and sometime \n     ineffective judicial system.\n       (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by \n     opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by \n     straining the resources of the legal system and depriving \n     deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.\n       (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K \n     disputes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-\n     consuming and costly litigation about Y2K failures, \n     particularly those that are not material. Congress supports \n     good faith negotiations between parties when there is a \n     dispute over a Y2K problem, and, if necessary, urges the \n     parties to enter into voluntary, non-binding mediation rather \n     than litigation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Y2K action.--The term ``Y2K action'' means a civil \n     action commenced in any Federal or State court in which the \n     plaintiff's alleged harm or injury resulted directly or \n     indirectly from an actual or potential Y2K failure, or a \n     claim or defense of a defendant is related directly or \n     indirectly to an actual or potential Y2K failure.\n       (2) Y2K failure.--The term ``Y2K failure'' means failure by \n     any device or system (including any computer system and any \n     microchip or integrated circuit embedded in another device or \n     product), or any software, firmware, or other set or \n     collection of processing instructions to process, to \n     calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, to store, to \n     transmit, or to receive date-related data, including \n     failures--\n       (A) to deal with or account for transitions or comparisons \n     from, into, and between the years 1999 and 2000 accurately;\n       (B) to recognize or accurately process any specific date in \n     1999, 2000, or 2001; or\n       (C) accurately to account for the year 2000's status as a \n     leap year, including recognition and processing of the \n     correct date on February 29, 2000.\n       (3) Actual damages.--The term ``actual damages'' means \n     direct damages for injury to tangible property, and the cost \n     of repairing or replacing products that have a material \n     defect.\n       (4) Economic loss.--Except as otherwise specifically \n     provided in a written contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant in a Y2K action (and subject to applicable State \n     law), the term ``economic loss''--\n       (A) means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party \n     for any loss other than for personal injury or damage to \n     tangible property (other than property that is the subject of \n     the contract); and\n       (B) includes amounts awarded for--\n       (i) lost profits or sales;\n       (ii) business interruption;\n       (iii) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the \n     defendant's wrongful act or omission;\n       (iv) losses that arise because of the claims of third \n     parties;\n       (v) losses that must be pleaded as special damages; and\n       (vi) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law); but\n       (C) does not include actual damages.\n       (5) Material defect.--The term ``material defect'' means a \n     defect in any item, whether tangible or intangible, or in the \n     provision of a service, that substantially prevents the item \n     or service from operating or functioning as designed or \n     intended.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any Y2K action in which punitive \n     damages may be awarded under applicable State law, the \n     defendant shall not be liable for punitive damages unless the \n     plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the \n     defendant acted with conscious and flagrant disregard for the \n     rights and property of others.\n       (b) Caps on Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Punitive damages against a defendant in \n     such a Y2K action may not exceed the larger of--\n       (A) 3 times the amount awarded for actual damages; or\n       (B) $250,000.\n       (2) Special rule.--In the case of a defendant--\n       (A) who--\n       (i) is sued in his or her capacity as an individual; and\n       (ii) whose net worth does not exceed $500,000; or\n       (B) that is an unincorporated business, a partnership, \n     corporation, association, unit of local government, or \n     organization with fewer than 25 full-time employees,\n\n     paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting ``smaller'' \n     for ``larger''.\n       (c) Government Entities.--Punitive damages in such a Y2K \n     action may not be awarded against a person described in \n     section 3(8)(B).\n\n              TITLE I--OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE Y2K PROBLEMS\n\n     SEC. 101. PRE-FILING NOTICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before commencing a Y2K action, except an \n     action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective \n     plaintiff with a Y2K claim shall serve on each prospective \n     defendant in that action a written notice that identifies \n     with particularity--\n       (1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to \n     have caused harm or loss;\n       (2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective \n     plaintiff;\n       (3) the remedy sought by the prospective plaintiff;\n       (4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks \n     that remedy; and\n       (5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any \n     individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the \n     dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.\n       (b) Delay of Action.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     a prospective plaintiff may not commence a Y2K action in \n     Federal or State court until the expiration of 90 days from \n     the date of service of the notice required by subsection (a).\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\n       (c) Response to Notice.--Within 30 days after receipt of \n     the notice specified in subsection (a), each prospective \n     defendant shall serve on each prospective plaintiff a written \n     statement acknowledging receipt of the notice, and proposing \n     the actions it has taken or will take to address the problem \n     identified by the prospective plaintiff. The written \n     statement shall state whether the prospective defendant is \n     willing to engage in alternative dispute resolution.\n       (d) Failure to Respond.--if a prospective defendant--\n       (1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to \n     subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection \n     (c); or\n       (2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective \n     defendant will take to address the problem identified by the \n     prospective plaintiff, then the 90-day period specified in \n     subsection (a) will terminate at the end of the 30-day period \n     at to that prospective defendant and the prospective \n     plaintiff may commence its action against that prospective \n     defendant.\n       (e) Failure to Provide Notice.--If a defendant determines \n     that a plaintiff has filed a Y2Y action without providing the \n     notice specified in subsection (a) and without awaiting the \n     expirations of the 90-day period specified in subsection (a), \n     the defendant may treat the plaintiff's complaint as such a \n     notice by so informing the court and the plaintiff. If any \n     defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice--\n       (1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other \n     proceedings in the action for 90 days after filing of the \n     complaint; and\n       (2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings \n     shall be tolled during this 90-day period.\n       (f) Effect of Contractual Waiting Periods.--In cases in \n     which a contract requires notice of non-performance and \n     provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of \n     suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of \n     delay provided in the contract is controlling over the \n     waiting period specified in subsections (a) and (e).\n       (g) State Law Controls Alternative Methods.--Noting in this \n     section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law or \n     rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of \n     alternative dispute resolution for Y2Y actions.\n\n     SEC. 102. PLEADING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (A) Nature and Amount of Damages.--In all Y2Y actions in \n     which damages are requested, the complaint shall provide \n     specific information as to the nature and amount of each \n     element of damages and the factual basis for the damages \n     calculation.\n       (b) Material Defects.--In any Y2Y action in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that a product or service defective, the \n     complaint shall contain specific information regarding the \n     manifestations of the material defects and the facts \n     supporting a conclusion that the defects are material.\n       (c) Required State of Mind.--In any Y2Y action in which a \n     claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on \n     proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of \n     mind, the complaint shall, with respect to each element of \n     that claim, state with particularity the facts giving rise to \n     a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required \n     state of mind.\n\n     SEC. 103. DUTY TO MITIGATE.\n\n       Damages awarded in any Y2Y action shall exclude \n     compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have \n     avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of \n     which the plaintiff was, or reasonably could have been, \n     aware, including reasonable efforts made by a defendant to \n     make information available to purchasers or users of the \n     defendant's product or services concerning means of remedying \n     or avoiding Y2Y failure.\n\n     SEC. 104. PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--A person against whom a final judgment is \n     entered in a Y2K action shall be liable solely for the \n     portion of the judgment that corresponds to the relative and \n     proportional liability of that person. In determining the \n     percentage of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of \n     fact shall determine that percentage as a percentage of the \n     total fault of all persons, including the plaintiff, who \n     caused or contributed to the total loss incurred by the \n     plaintiff.\n       (b) Several Liability.--Liability in a Y2K action shall be \n     several but not joint.\n\n        TITLE II--Y2K ACTIONS INVOLVING CONTRACT-RELATED CLAIMS\n\n     SEC. 201. CONTRACTS ENFORCED.\n\n       In any Y2K action, any written term or condition of a valid \n     and enforceable contract between the plaintiff and the \n     defendant, including limitations or exclusions of liability \n     and disclaimers of warranty, is fully enforceable, unless the \n     court determines that the contract as a whole is \n     unenforceable. If the contract is silent with respect to any \n     matter, the interpretation of the contract with respect to \n     that matter shall be determined by applicable law in force at \n     the time the contract was executed.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFENSES.\n\n       (a) Reasonable Efforts.--In any Y2K action in which breach \n     of contract is alleged, in addition to any other rights \n     provided by applicable law, the party against whom the claim \n     of breach is asserted shall be allowed to offer evidence that \n     its implementation of the contract, or its efforts to \n     implement the contract, were reasonable in light of the \n     circumstances for the purpose of limiting or eliminating the \n     defendant's liability.\n       (b) Impossibility or Commercial Impracticability.--In any \n     Y2K action in which breach of contract is alleged, \n     applicability of the doctrines of impossibility and \n     commercial impracticability shall be determined by applicable \n     law in existence on January 1, 1999, and nothing in this Act \n     shall be construed as limiting or impairing a party's right \n     to assert defenses based upon such doctrines.\n\n     SEC. 203. DAMAGES LIMITATION.\n\n       In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no \n     party may claim, nor be awarded, consequential or punitive \n     damages unless such damages are allowed--\n       (1) by the express terms of the contract; or\n       (2) if the contract is silent on such damages, by operation \n     of State law at the time the contract was executed or by \n     operation of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 204. MIXED ACTIONS.\n\n       If a Y2K action includes claims based on breach of contract \n     and tort or other noncontract claims, then this title shall \n     apply to the contract-related claims and title III shall \n     apply to the tort or other noncontract claims.\n\n              TITLE III--Y2K ACTIONS INVOLVING TORT CLAIMS\n\n     SEC. 301. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may not recover \n     damages for economic loss unless--\n       (1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a \n     contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is \n     a party;\n       (2) such losses result directly from a personal injury \n     claim resulting from the Y2K failure; or\n       (3) such losses result directly from damage to tangible \n     property caused by the Y2K failure (other than damage to \n     property that is the subject of the contract),\n\n     and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or \n     State law.\n\n     SEC. 302. CERTAIN DEFENSES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith; Reasonable Efforts.--In any Y2K action \n     except an action for breach or repudiation of contract, the \n     party against whom the claim is asserted shall be entitled to \n     establish, as a complete defense to any claim for damages, \n     that it acted in good faith and took measures that were \n     reasonable under the circumstances to prevent the Y2K \n     failure from occurring or from causing the damages upon \n     which the claim is based.\n       (b) Defendant's State of Mind.--In a Y2K action making a \n     claim for money damages in which the defendant's actual or \n     constructive awareness of an actual or potential a Y2K \n     failure is an element of the claim, the defendant is not \n     liable unless the plaintiff, in addition to establishing all \n     other requisite elements of the claim, proves by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the defendant knew, or recklessly \n     disregarded a known and substantial risk, that the failure \n     would occur in the specific facts and circumstances of the \n     claim.\n       (c) Foreseeability.--In a Y2K action making a claim for \n     money damages, the defendant is not liable unless the \n     plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence, in \n     addition to all other requisite elements of the claim, that \n     the defendant knew, or should have known, that the \n     defendant's action or failure to act would cause harm to the \n     plaintiff in the specific facts and circumstances of the \n     claim.\n       (d) Control Not Determinative of Liability.--The fact that \n     a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, \n     product, or component that was within the control of the \n     party against whom a claim for money damages is asserted in a \n     Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery \n     of damages in that action.\n       (e) Preservation of Existing Law.--The provisions of this \n     section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any \n     requirement under applicable law as to burdens of proof and \n     elements necessary for prevailing in a claim for money \n     damages.\n\n     SEC. 303. LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A director, officer, trustee, or employee \n     of a business or other organization (including a corporation, \n     unincorporated association, partnership, or non-profit \n     organization) shall not be personally liable in any Y2K \n     action making a tort or other noncontract claim in that \n     person's capacity as a director, officer, trustee, or \n     employee of the business or organization for more than the \n     greater of--\n       (1) $100,000; or\n       (2) the amount of pre-tax compensation received by the \n     director, officer, trustee, or employee from the business or \n     organization during the 12 months immediately preceding the \n     act or omission for which liability was imposed.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply in any Y2K \n     action in which it is found by clear and convincing evidence \n     that the director, officer, trustee, or employee--\n       (1) intentionally made misleading statements regarding any \n     actual or potential year 2000 problem; or\n       (2) intentionally withheld from the public significant \n     information there was a legal duty to disclose to the public \n     regarding any actual or potential year 2000 problem of that \n     business or organization which would likely result in \n     actionable Y2K failure.\n       (c) State Law, Charter, or Bylaws.--Nothing in this section \n     supersedes any provision of State law, charter, or a bylaw \n     authorized by State law, in existence on January 1, 1999, \n     that establishes lower limits on the liability of a director, \n     officer, trustee, or employee of such a business or \n     organization.\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\n                      TITLE IV--Y2K CLASS ACTIONS\n\n     SEC. 401. MINIMUM INJURY REQUIREMENT.\n\n       In any Y2K action involving a claim that a product or \n     service is defective, the action may be maintained as a class \n     action in Federal or State court as to that claim only if--\n       (1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by \n     applicable Federal or State law or applicable rules of civil \n     procedure; and\n       (2) the court finds that the alleged defect in a product or \n     service is material as to the majority of the members of the \n     class.\n\n     SEC. 402.

Upon remand of the \n     action, the period of limitations for any claim that was \n     asserted in the action on behalf of any named or unnamed \n     member of any proposed class shall be deemed tolled to the \n     full extent provided under Federal law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1913-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1916-S1924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIAL OF PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my opinion \nmemorandum relating to the impeachment of President Clinton be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the opinion memorandum was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n [In the Senate of the United States sitting as a Court of Impeachment]\n\nOpinion Memorandum of United States Senator John F. Reed, February 12, \n                                  1999\n\n\n                             i. conclusion\n\n       Based on the evidence in the record, the arguments of the \n     House Managers and the arguments of counsels for the \n     President, I conclude as follows: The President has disgraced \n     himself and dishonored his office. He has offended the \n     justified expectations of the American people that the \n     Presidency be above the sordid episodes revealed in the \n     record before us. However, the House Managers have failed to \n     prove that the President's conduct amounts to the \n     Constitutional standard of ``other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors'' subjecting him to removal from office.\n\n\n                       ii. statement of the case\n\n       On December 19, 1998, the United States House of \n     Representatives passed H. Res. 611,\\1\\ ``Impeaching William \n     Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, for high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The House Resolution contains two \n     Articles of Impeachment declaring that, first, the President \n     committed perjury before a Federal Grand Jury on August 17, \n     1998, and, second, the President obstructed justice in \n     connection with the civil litigation of Paula Jones.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ H. Res. 611, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., (1998) (enacted).\n     \\2\\ In the course of deliberations in the House, no witnesses \n     to the underlying events were called. The House Judiciary \n     Committee held four hearings and called only one material \n     witness, the Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr. Mr. Starr \n     testified that he was not present when any of the witnesses \n     testified before the Grand Jury. The President's attorneys \n     were allowed two days to present their defense, and they \n     called a series of expert witnesses.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the United States \n     Constitution, the United States Senate convened a Court of \n     Impeachment on January 9, 1999, and each Senator took an oath \n     to render ``fair and impartial justice.'' \\3\\ As Alexander \n     Hamilton stated in Federalist No. 65, ``what other body would \n     be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to \n     preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality \n     between an individual accused and the representatives of the \n     people, his accusers?'' \\4\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Rule XXV, Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials \n     in the United States Senate, Prepared by Floyd Riddick and \n     Robert Dove, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., S. Doc. 99-33 (August 15, \n     1986) at 6.\n     \\4\\ The Federalist No. 65, at 398 (Alexander Hamilton) \n     (Clinton Rossiter, ed., 1961) (Emphasis in original).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The obligation of the Senate is to accord the President, as \n     the accused, the right to conduct his defense fairly and, \n     while respecting the House's exclusive Constitutional \n     prerogative to bring Articles of Impeachment, to put the \n     House to the proof of its case. At the core of our task is \n     the fundamental understanding that our system of government \n     recognizes the rights of defendants and the responsibilities \n     of the prosecution to prove its case. Such a basic tenet of \n     our law and our experience as a free people does not \n     evaporate in the rarified atmosphere of a Court of \n     Impeachment simply because the accused is the President and \n     the accusers are the House of Representatives.\n       The House of Representatives submitted a certified, written \n     record of over 6,000 pages. By unanimously adopting S. Res. \n     16, on January 8, 1999, the Senate agreed to proceed with the \n     Court of Impeachment based on ``the record which will consist \n     of those publicly available materials that have been \n     submitted.'' The Senate Resolution also provided that, \n     following the presentations of the House managers, the \n     response of the President's attorneys, and a period of \n     questions by Senators, it would be in order to consider a \n     Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Depose Witnesses.\n       On January 27, 1999, the Senate voted 56 to 44, against \n     dismissing the Articles of Impeachment. On the same day, by \n     the same margin, the Senate passed a resolution, S. Res. 30, \n     allowing the Managers to depose three witnesses: Ms. Monica \n     S. Lewinsky,\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\n     Mr. Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., and Mr. Sidney Blumenthal. These \n     depositions were taken on February 1, 2, and 3, 1999, \n     respectively.\n       After Senators were provided an opportunity to view the \n     videotaped depositions, the Senate reconvened as a Trial of \n     Impeachment on February 4, 1999. At that time a motion by the \n     House Managers to call Ms. Lewinsky to the floor of the \n     Senate as a witness was rejected by a vote of 30 to 70. \n     Voting 62 to 38, the Senate agreed to permit portions of the \n     video to be used on the floor of the Senate during both a \n     six-hour ``evidentiary'' session and for closing arguments. \n     The White House declined to offer a motion to call witnesses. \n     The Senate then rejected a motion by Democratic Leader \n     Daschle to proceed directly to a vote on the Articles of \n     Impeachment.\n       On Saturday, February 6, 1999, the Senate heard six hours \n     of presentation, evenly divided, concerning the evidence \n     obtained in the three depositions. On Monday, February 8, \n     1999, the Senate heard closing arguments from the House \n     Managers and Counsel for the President. The following day, \n     the Senate voted on a motion to open deliberations to the \n     public. That motion received 59 votes, several short of the \n     supermajority required to change Senate Impeachment Rules. \n     The Senate then voted to adjourn to closed deliberations. A \n     final vote was taken on the Articles on Friday, February 12, \n     1999.\n\n\n                    iii. the constitutional standard\n\n       ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all \n     Impeachments.'' \\5\\ With these few words, the Framers of the \n     Constitution entrusted the Senate with the most awesome power \n     within a democratic society. We are the final arbiters of \n     whether the conscious and free choice of the American people \n     in selecting their President will stand.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ U.S. Const., art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 7.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     1. ``Other High Crimes and Misdemeanors''\n       The Constitutional grounds for Impeachment indicate both \n     the severity of the offenses necessary for removal and the \n     essential political character of these offenses. ``The \n     President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the \n     United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \\6\\ The clarity of ``Treason'' and \n     ``Bribery'' is without doubt. No more heinous example of an \n     offense against the Constitutional order exists than betrayal \n     of the nation to an enemy or betrayal of duty for personal \n     enrichment. With these offenses as predicate, it follows that \n     ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must likewise be \n     restricted to serious offenses that strike at the heart of \n     the Constitutional order.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ U.S. Const., art. II, Sec. 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Certainly, this is the view of Alexander Hamilton, one of \n     the trio of authors of the Federalist Papers, the most \n     respected and authoritative interpretation of the \n     Constitution. In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton describes \n     impeachable offenses as ``those offenses which proceed from \n     the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the \n     abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature \n     which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, \n     as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the \n     society itself.'' \\7\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ The Federalist No. 65, at 396 (emphasis in original).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This view is sustained with remarkable consistency by other \n     contemporaries of Hamilton. George Mason, a delegate to the \n     Federal Constitutional Convention, declared that ``high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors'' refer to ``great and dangerous \n     offenses'' or ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' \\8\\ \n     James Iredell served as a delegate to the North Carolina \n     Convention that ratified the Constitution, and he later \n     served as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. \n     During the Convention debates, Iredell stated:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ Max Farrand, ed., The Records of the Federal Convention \n     of 1787, at 550 (1966).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``The power of impeachment is given by this Constitution, \n     to bring great offenders to punishment. . . . This power is \n     lodged in those who represent the great body of the people, \n     because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of \n     great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be \n     such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary \n     tribunal.''\\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\9\\ Jonathon Elliot, Debates on the Adoption of the Federal \n     Constitution at 113 (1974).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Iredell's understanding sustains the view that an \n     impeachable offense must cause ``great injury to the \n     community.'' Private wrongdoing, without a significant, \n     adverse effect upon the nation, cannot constitute an \n     impeachable offense. James Wilson, a delegate to the Federal \n     Constitutional Convention and, like Iredell, later a Supreme \n     Court Justice, wrote that Impeachments are ``proceedings of a \n     political nature . . . confined to political characters, to \n     political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political \n     punishments.'' \\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\10\\ Michael J. Gerhardt, The Federal Impeachment Process: A \n     Constitutional and Historical Analysis at 21 (1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Later commentators expressed similar views. In 1833, \n     Justice Story quoted favorably from the scholarship of \n     William Rawle in which Rawle concluded that the ``legitimate \n     causes of impeachment . . . can have reference only to public \n     character, and official duty . . . In general, those \n     offenses, which may be committed equally by a private person, \n     as a public officer, are not the subject of \n     impeachment.''\\11\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\11\\ 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution \n     Sec. 799 at 269-70 quoting William Rawle, A View of the \n     Constitution of the United States at 213 (2d ed. 1829).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This line of reasoning is buttressed by the careful and \n     thoughtful work of the House of Representatives during the \n     Watergate proceedings. The Democratic staff of the House \n     Judiciary Committee concluded that: ``[b]ecause impeachment \n     of a President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be \n     predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with \n     either the constitutional form and principles of our \n     government or the proper performance of constitutional duties \n     of president office.''\\12\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\12\\ Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, \n     Report by the Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry, House Comm. \n     on Judiciary, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. at 26 (1974).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This view was echoed by many on the Republican side. \n     Minority members of the Judiciary Committee declared: ``the \n     Framers . . . were concerned with preserving the government \n     from being overthrown by the treachery or corruption of one \n     man. . . . [I]t is our judgment, based upon this \n     constitutional history, that the Framers of the United States \n     Constitution intended that the President should be removable \n     by the legislative branch only for serious misconduct \n     dangerous to the system of government.''\\13\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\13\\ Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, President of the United \n     States, Report of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 93rd \n     Cong., 2d Sess., H. Rep 93-1305 at 364-65 (Aug. 20, 1974) \n     (Minority Views of Messrs. Hutchinson, Smith, Sandman, \n     Wiggins, Dennis, Mayne, Lott, Moorhead, Maraziti and Latta).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     2. The Constitutional Debates\n       Adding impressive support to these consistent views of the \n     meaning of the term, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' is the \n     history of the deliberations of the Constitutional \n     Convention. This history demonstrates a conscious movement to \n     narrow the terminology as a means of raising the threshold \n     for the Impeachment process.\n       Early in the debate on the issue of Presidential \n     Impeachment in July of 1787, it was suggested that \n     impeachment and removal could be founded on a showing of \n     ``malpractice,'' ``neglect of duty'' or ``corruption.''\\14\\ \n     By September of 1787, the issue of Presidential Impeachment \n     had been referred to the Committee of Eleven, which was \n     created to resolve the most contentious issues. The Committee \n     of Eleven proposed that the grounds for Impeachment be \n     ``treason or bribery.''\\15\\ This was significantly more \n     restricted than the amorphous standard of ``malpractice,'' \n     too restricted, in fact, for some delegates. George Mason \n     objected and suggested that ``maladministration'' be added to \n     ``treason and bribery.''\\16\\ This suggestion was opposed by \n     Madison as returning to the vague, initial standard. Mason \n     responded by further refining his suggestion and offered the \n     term ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors against the \n     State.''\\17\\ The Mason language was a clear reference to the \n     English legal history of Impeachment. And, it is instructive \n     to note that Mason explicitly narrowed these offenses to \n     those ``against the State.'' The Convention itself further \n     clarified the standard by replacing ``State'' with the \n     ``United States.''\\18\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\14\\ 2 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of \n     1787, at 64-69.\n     \\15\\ Id.\n     \\16\\ Id.\n     \\17\\ Id. (emphasis added).\n     \\18\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       At the conclusion of the substantive deliberations on the \n     Constitutional standard of Impeachment, it was obvious that \n     only serious offenses against the governmental system would \n     justify Impeachment and subsequent removal from office. \n     However, the final stylistic touches to the Constitution were \n     applied by the Committee of Style. This Committee has no \n     authority to alter the meaning of the carefully debated \n     language, but could only impose a stylistic consistency \n     through, among other things, the elimination of redundancy. \n     In their zeal to streamline the text, the words ``against the \n     United States'' were eliminated as unnecessary to the meaning \n     of the passage.\\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\19\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The weight of both authoritative commentary and the history \n     of the Constitutional Convention combines to provide \n     convincing proof that the Impeachment process was reserved \n     for serious breaches of the Constitutional order which \n     threaten the country in a direct and immediate manner.\n     3. The Independence of Impeachment and Criminal Liability\n       Article One, Section three of the United States \n     Constitution provides that ``[j]udgment in Cases of \n     Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from \n     Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office or \n     honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party \n     convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n     Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to \n     Law.'' \\20\\ As James Wilson wrote, ``[i]mpeachments, and \n     offenses and offenders impeachable, [do not] come . . . \n     within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence. They are founded \n     on different principles; are governed by different maxims; \n     and are directed to different objects; for this reason, the \n     trial and punishment of an offense on an impeachment, is no \n     bar to a trial and punishment of the same offence at common \n     law.'' \\21\\ The independence of the Impeachment process from \n     the prosecution of crimes underscores the function of \n     Impeachment as a means to remove a President from office, not \n     because\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\n     of criminal behavior, but because the President poses a \n     threat to the Constitutional order. Criminal behavior is not \n     irrelevant to an Impeachment, but it only becomes decisive if \n     that behavior imperils the balance of power established in \n     the Constitution.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\20\\ U.S. Const., art.

Andrews, ed., The Works of James Wilson at 408 \n     (1896).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     4. Conclusion\n       Authoritative commentary on the Constitution, together with \n     the structure of the Constitution allowing independent \n     consideration of criminal charges, makes it clear that the \n     term, ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' encompasses \n     conduct that involves the President in the impermissible \n     exercise of the powers of his office to upset the \n     Constitutional order. Moreover, since the essence of \n     Impeachment is removal from office rather than punishment for \n     offenses, there is a strong inference that the improper \n     conduct must represent a continuing threat to the people and \n     the Constitution. It cannot be an episode that either can be \n     dealt with in the Courts or raises no generalized concerns \n     about the continued service of the President.\n\n\n                       iv. judicial impeachments\n\n       The House Managers urge that the standards applied to \n     judges must also be applied identically to the President. \n     Their argument finds particular urgency with respect to \n     Article I and its allegations of perjury. Several judges have \n     been removed for perjury, and the House Managers suggest that \n     this experience transforms perjury into a per se impeachable \n     offense.\\22\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\22\\ For example, both Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr. and Judge \n     Alcee L. Hastings were convicted on charges based in perjury.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This reasoning disregards the unique position of the \n     President. Unlike Federal judges, the President is elected by \n     popular vote for a fixed term. Popular elections are the most \n     obvious and compelling checks on Presidential conduct. No \n     such ``popular check'' is imposed on the Judiciary. Federal \n     judges are deliberately insulated from the public pressures \n     of the moment to ensure their independence to follow the law \n     rather than a changeable public mood. As such, Impeachment is \n     the only means of removing a judge. Moreover, the removal of \n     one of the 839 Federal judges can never have the traumatic \n     effect of the removal of the President. To suggest that a \n     Presidential Impeachment and a judicial Impeachment should be \n     treated identically strains credulity.\n       There is an additional Constitutional factor to consider. \n     The Constitution requires that judicial service be \n     conditioned on ``good Behavior.'' \\23\\ This adds a further \n     dimension to the consideration of the removal of a judge from \n     office. Although ``good Behavior'' is not a separate grounds \n     for Impeachment, this Constitutional standard thoroughly \n     permeates any evaluation of judicial conduct.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\23\\ ``The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, \n     shall hold their Offices during good Behavior . . .'' U.S. \n     Const., art. III, Sec. 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       We expect judges to be above politics. We expect them to be \n     inherently fair. We expect their judgment to be unimpeded by \n     personal considerations. And, we demand that their conduct, \n     both public and private, reflect these lofty expectations. \n     Judges are subject to the most exacting code of conduct in \n     both their public life and their private life.\\24\\ Without \n     diminishing the expectations of Presidential conduct, it is \n     fair to say that we expect and demand a more scrupulous \n     standard of conduct, particularly personal conduct, from \n     judges. A large part of these heightened expectations for \n     judges emerges directly from their particular role in our \n     government. They immediately and critically determine the \n     rights of individual citizens. The fates and lives of \n     individual Americans are literally in their hands. They \n     personify more dramatically than anyone, including the \n     President, the fairness and reasonableness of the law. Should \n     they falter, the foundation of ``equal justice under law'' is \n     more seriously strained than the failings of any other \n     citizen.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\24\\ The Judicial Conference of the United States publishes a \n     Code of Conduct for United States Judges, as prepared by the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Cannon 2 \n     of the Code requires federal judges to ``avoid impropriety \n     and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.'' \n     (March, 1997). This Cannon requires a Judge to act at all \n     times in ``a manner that promotes public confidence in the \n     integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.'' Perceived \n     violations of the Code could result in a complaint to the \n     Judicial Conference, which can make referrals to the House \n     Judiciary Committee.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The differences between a Presidential Impeachment and a \n     judicial Impeachment are not merely theoretical. The Senate \n     treats a Presidential Impeachment differently from a judicial \n     Impeachment in both procedure and substance. The Senate \n     routinely allows a select committee to receive testimony in \n     the trial of a judge.\\25\\ Such a delegation of responsibility \n     would be unthinkable in the trial of a President. But of even \n     more telling effect are the substantive differences between \n     Presidential and judicial Impeachments. For example, Judge \n     Harry Claiborne was Impeached and removed subsequent to his \n     criminal conviction for filing a false income tax return.\\26\\ \n     In contrast, the inquiry into the Watergate break-in \n     disclosed similar violations of the Federal Tax Code by \n     President Nixon. Yet, the Judiciary Committee of the House of \n     Representatives declined to approve an Article of Impeachment \n     with respect to President Nixon's apparent violation of the \n     Internal Revenue Code. A major factor in declining to press \n     this Article was the widespread feeling that such private \n     misconduct was not relevant to a Presidential Impeachment. \n     According to Representative Ray Thornton (D-AR), ``there \n     [had] been a breach of faith with the American people with \n     regard to incorrect income tax returns . . . But . . . these \n     charges may be reached in due course in the regular process \n     of law. This committee is not a tax court nor should it \n     endeavor to become one.'' \\27\\ Republican Representative Tom \n     Railsback (R-IL) pointed out that there was ``a serious \n     question as to whether something involving [the President's] \n     personal tax liability has anything to do with his conduct of \n     the office of the President.'' \\28\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\25\\ Rule XI, Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials \n     in the United States Senate, Prepared by Floyd Riddick and \n     Robert Dove, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., S.

(Statement of Congressman Railsback).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The reconciliation of this disparate treatment is found by \n     once again recalling the Constitution and not by simply \n     adopting the facile notion that if Impeachment applies to \n     judges then it must apply identically to the President. The \n     function of Impeachment is to remove a ``civil officer'' who \n     so abuses the particular duties and responsibilities of his \n     office that he poses a threat to the Constitutional order. \n     Furthermore, the Constitution provides an additional \n     condition on the performance of judges with the ``good \n     Behavior'' standard. The particular duties of the Judiciary \n     together with their obligation to demonstrate ``good \n     Behavior,'' renders comparison with the President inexact at \n     best.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\29\\ Various legal scholars and authoritative commentary make \n     this point. In support of the ``Judicial Integrity and \n     Independence Act,'' which would have established a non-\n     Impeachment procedure for removing judges, Senator Lott \n     submitted an article by conservative legal scholars Bruce \n     Fein and William Bradford Reynolds. Messrs. Fein and Reynolds \n     concluded ``federal judges are also subject to Article III \n     Sec. 4, which stipulates that judges shall serve only during \n     `good Behavior.' This is a stricter standard of conduct than \n     the Impeachment standard. . . .'' 135 Cong. Rec. S15269 \n     (daily ed. July 19, 1989) (quoting Fein and Reynolds, Judges \n     on Trial: Improving Impeachment, Legal Times, October 30, \n     1989.) Senator Lott also submitted a statement, by then \n     Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist, supporting \n     similar legislation in 1970, which stated that ``the terms \n     `treason, bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors' are \n     narrower than the malfeasance in office and failure to \n     perform the duties of the office, which may be grounds for \n     forfeiture of office held during good behavior.'' 135 Cong. \n     Rec. S 15270 (daily ed.

(April 9, 1970) (Statement \n     of Asst. Attorney General William H. Rehnquist, Office of \n     Legal Counsel)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Managers' argument is ultimately unpersuasive. Rather \n     than reflexively importing prior decisions dealing with \n     judicial Impeachments, we are obliged to consider the \n     President's behavior in the context of his unique \n     Constitutional duties and without the condition to his tenure \n     of ``good Behavior.''\n\n\n                        V. the standard of proof\n\n       Judicial proceedings, by definition, resolve an issue in \n     dispute. A party seeks an outcome, provided for by the rule \n     of law, and petitions for that result. The petitioning party \n     has the burden of producing evidence. After hearing the \n     evidence, the trier of fact, to some degree of certainty, \n     reaches a conclusion. The critical factor is often the degree \n     of certainty necessary.\n       American jurisprudence utilizes three standards of \n     certainty: evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and \n     convincing evidence, and a preponderance of the evidence. The \n     standard is determined by the gravity of the issue in dispute \n     and the degree of harm resulting from an incorrect decision.\n       Generally, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or to a moral \n     certainty, is required to convict an individual of a criminal \n     offense. Black's Law Dictionary defines reasonable doubt as \n     ``a doubt as would cause prudent men to hesitate before \n     acting in matters of importance to themselves.'' \\30\\ Sample \n     federal jury instructions provide that ``[a] reasonable doubt \n     is a doubt based upon reason and common sense--the kind of \n     doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. \n     Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, must, therefore, be proof of \n     such a convincing character that a reasonable person would \n     not hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of \n     his or her own affairs.'' \\31\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\30\\ Black's Law Dictionary at 1265 (6th ed. 1990) (citing \n     U.S. v.

Finally, general civil cases, which pit private \n     parties against each other, are adjudicated on the \n     preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely than not. \n     Frequently the burden of proof is determinative of the \n     outcome.\n       In an Impeachment Trial, each Senator has the obligation to \n     establish the burden of proof he or she deems proper. The \n     Founding\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n     Fathers believed maximum discretion was critical for Senators \n     confronting the gravest of constitutional choices. \n     Differentiating Impeachment from criminal trials, Alexander \n     Hamilton argued, in Federalist No. 65, that Impeachments \n     ``can never be tied down by such strict rules . . . as in \n     common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor \n     of personal security.'' \\32\\ In this regard, Hamilton also \n     recognized that an Impeached official would be subject to the \n     comprehensive rules of criminal prosecution after \n     Impeachment.\\33\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\32\\ The Federalist No. 65, at 398.\n     \\33\\ Id. at 399.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Senate precedent maintains this discretion. In the 1986 \n     Impeachment Trial of Judge Claiborne, the Senate \n     overwhelmingly rejected a motion by the Judge to adopt \n     ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' as the standard of proof \n     necessary to convict and remove.\\34\\ That vote has been \n     interpreted by subsequent courts of Impeachment as ``a \n     precedent confirming each Senator's freedom to adopt whatever \n     standard of proof he or she preferred.'' \\35\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\34\\ 132 Cong. Rec. S15507 (daily ed. October 7, 1986).\n     \\35\\ Gerhardt, The Federal Impeachment Process: A \n     Constitutional and Historical Analysis, at 42 (1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The constitutional gravity of an Impeachment trial suggests \n     that the evidentiary bar be high. As I have discussed \n     previously, the Founders viewed Impeachment as a remedy to be \n     utilized only in the gravest of circumstances by a \n     supermajority of Senators. The Constitution gives to the \n     people the right to remove a President through the electoral \n     process every four years. Only in the most extreme of \n     examples, when the constitutional order is threatened, is \n     Congress to intervene and remove our only nationally \n     elected representative. Nullification of a popularly \n     elected President is a grave action only to be taken with \n     high certainty.\n       Constitutional analysis strongly suggests that in a \n     Presidential Impeachment trial a burden of proof at least \n     equivalent to ``clear and convincing evidence'' and more \n     likely equal to ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' must be \n     employed.\\36\\ Had the charges of this case involved threats \n     to our constitutional order not readily characterized by \n     criminal charges, I would have been forced to further parse \n     an exact standard. However, for all practical purposes, the \n     Managers have themselves established the burden of proof in \n     this case.\\37\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\36\\ See Charles L. Black, Jr., Impeachment: A Handbook, at \n     14-19 (1974)\n     \\37\\ The adoption of a standard of ``beyond a reasonable \n     doubt'' in this matter should not be construed as implying \n     that the same standard must be utilized in each and every \n     Impeachment proceeding. Conduct of ``civil officers'' in the \n     performance of their official duties might pose such an \n     immediate threat to the Constitution that a less exacting \n     standard could properly be used. Any choice of a standard of \n     proof must, at a minimum, consider the nature of the \n     allegations and the impact of the alleged behavior on the \n     operation of the government.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Articles, embodied in H. Res. 611, accuse the President \n     of perjury and obstruction of justice. This allegation of \n     specific criminal wrongdoing is repeated in their Trial \n     Brief.\\38\\ Indeed, in their presentation, the Managers have \n     stated, ``none of us, would argue . . . that the President \n     should be removed from the office unless you conclude he \n     committed the crimes that he is alleged to have committed. . \n     . .'' \\39\\ The House Managers invited the Senate to arrive at \n     a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt before voting to \n     convict the President. I take them at their word.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\38\\ Trial Memorandum of the United States House of \n     Representatives, In Re Impeachment of President William \n     Jefferson Clinton, [hereinafter HMTB] (Submitted pursuant to \n     S.

Jan. 15, 1999) (Statement \n     of Mr. Manager McCollum).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       After reading their Trial Brief, listening to their \n     presentation of the evidence, viewing depositions, and \n     considering their closing argument, I conclude that the \n     President is not guilty of any of the allegations beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. I reach this conclusion mindful of the \n     admonishment of the Founders that Impeachment is not a \n     punitive, but rather a constitutional remedy. Having \n     concluded that the charges, even if proven, do not rise to \n     the level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' an analysis of \n     the specific charges is unnecessary. However, given the \n     gravity of the charges alleged, an explanation is \n     appropriate.\n\n\n                  vi. perjury allegations of article i\n\n       Article I alleges that the President committed perjury \n     before a federal Grand Jury on August 17, 1998. The charge \n     must be measured against the fact that the full House of \n     Representatives rejected an article of Impeachment charging \n     the President with perjury in a civil deposition. House \n     Judiciary Committee Republicans, citing case law, have \n     asserted that ``perjury in a civil proceeding is just as \n     pernicious as perjury in criminal proceedings.'' \\40\\ The \n     Article before the Senate is further undercut by the fact \n     that the Article fails to site, with specificity, testimony \n     alleged to be false.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\40\\ Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of \n     the United States, Report of the Comm. on the Judiciary, \n     105th Cong. 2d Sess., H. Rep. 105-830 (December 15, 1998) at \n     118 [hereafter Clinton Report].\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Perjury is a statutory crime, set forth in the U.S. Code at \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 1621, Sec. 1623. It requires proof that an \n     individual has, while under the oath of an official \n     proceeding, knowingly made a false statement about facts \n     material to the proceeding. As seasoned federal prosecutors \n     testified before the House Judiciary Committee, perjury is a \n     specific intent crime requiring proof of the defendant's \n     state of mind, i.e., the charge cannot be based solely upon \n     unresponsive, misleading, or evasive answers.\\41\\ Both the \n     House Managers and Counsel for the President have referred to \n     the statutes referenced above and agree on the elements \n     necessary to convict on a charge of perjury.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\41\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 284 (Statement of \n     Thomas P.

This dance with the law is not what one expects of a \n     President. However, it is important to realize that in \n     beginning his Grand Jury testimony, the President read a \n     statement in which he admitted being ``alone'' with Ms. \n     Lewinsky and engaging in ``inappropriate intimate'' \\43\\ \n     contact with her. Thus, unlike the testimony he provided in \n     the Jones civil deposition, the President admitted an \n     improper, consensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. It is \n     against this backdrop that the House Mangers allege perjury.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\42\\ Trial Memorandum of President William Jefferson Clinton, \n     In Re Impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton, \n     [hereinafter PCTB] (Submitted January 13, 1999, pursuant to \n     S.

Res. 611, which reported the \n     Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, that the President \n     ``willfully provided perjurious . . . testimony . . . \n     concerning one or  more of the following: (1) the nature and \n     details of his relationship with'' Ms. Lewinsky; (2) \n     ``prior perjurious . . . testimony'' given in the Jones \n     deposition; (3) ``prior false and misleading statements he \n     allowed his attorney to make'' in the Jones deposition; \n     and (4) ``his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony \n     of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence'' in \n     Jones. The facts refute some of these charges, while legal \n     analysis, precedent and common sense preclude pursuit of \n     the others.\n     1. The Nature and Details of the Clinton/Lewinsky \n         Relationship\n       With regard to the first charge of perjury, the Managers \n     fail to cite specific perjurious language in the Article; \n     however, their Trial Brief provides several allegations. It \n     asserts that the President's denial that he touched Ms. \n     Lewinsky in certain areas with a specific intent is \n     ``patently false.'' \\44\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\44\\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 53.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The most troubling evidence that the President lied in this \n     instance is Ms. Lewinsky's testimony to the contrary. While \n     Ms. Lewinsky has more credibility than the President \n     concerning the intimacies of their relationship, experienced \n     prosecutors, appointed by both Democrats and Republicans, \n     have testified that conflicting testimony of this type would \n     not be prosecuted for two reasons. First, ``he said, she \n     said'' discrepancies regarding perjury are difficult to prove \n     beyond a reasonable doubt without third party \n     corroboration.\\45\\ This is particularly true in this case, \n     where first Independent Counsel Starr and now the House \n     Managers choose to believe Ms. Lewinsky when she helps their \n     case, but impugn her testimony when she refutes their \n     accusations. Second, testimony concerning sex in a civil \n     proceeding would not normally warrant criminal \n     prosecution.\\46\\ Indeed, in her Senate deposition, Ms. \n     Lewinsky was unwilling to portray the President's testimony \n     as untruthful.\\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\45\\ The Trial Brief of the House Managers states that the \n     President's testimony is ``directly contradicted by the \n     corroborated testimony of Monica Lewinsky.'' Id. By \n     ``corroborated'' the Managers refer to the fact that the \n     Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) was extremely thorough in \n     questioning all of Ms. Lewinsky's friends and associates to \n     whom she described the intimate details of her contact with \n     the President. Legally, the fact that Ms. Lewinsky relayed \n     her recollection of the facts to various third parties does \n     not provide additional, independent evidence of the nature of \n     her contact with the President.\n     \\46\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 284 (Statement of \n     Thomas P. Sullivan, Former U.S. Attorney, Northern District \n     of Illinois); see also Id. at 325, 332, 333 (testimony of \n     Ronald K. Noble and William F. Weld).\n     \\47\\ During her Senate deposition, Manager Bryant asked Ms. \n     Lewinsky if, contrary to his defense, the President's contact \n     with her fit into that described in the Jones deposition. In \n     response Ms. Lewinsky said, ``I'm not trying to be difficult, \n     but there is a portion of . . . [the] definition [used in the \n     Jones deposition] that says, you know, with intent, and I \n     don't feel comfortable characterizing what someone else's \n     intent was. I can tell you that I--my memory of this \n     relationship and what I remember happened fell within that \n     definition . . . but I'm just not comfortable commenting on \n     someone else's intent or state of mind or what they \n     thought.'' 145 Cong. Rec. S1221 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1999) \n     (Senate deposition of Ms. Lewinsky).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In further support of the perjury allegation regarding the \n     ``nature and details'' of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, \n     the Managers also alleged that the President's Grand Jury \n     testimony concerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was \n     perjurious because (1) his recollection of when the \n     approximately two-year affair began differs from Ms. \n     Lewinsky's by a few months; (2) he admitted to occasionally \n     having inappropriate banter on the phone with Ms. Lewinsky \n     when\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\n     it occurred as many as seventeen times; and (3) he described \n     his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky as beginning as a \n     ``friendship.'' \\48\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\48\\ See HMTB, supra note 38, at 57; see also Clinton Report, \n     supra note 40 at 34.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Disregarding the futility of attempting to judge the \n     veracity of these statements, they appear to be totally \n     immaterial to the Grand Jury given that the President \n     admitted an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, the triviality \n     of these charges are indicative of the inability of the House \n     Managers to utilize any sense of proportionality in \n     adjudicating the unacceptable behavior of the President. This \n     weakness is magnified by the fact that the House Managers \n     have asserted that conviction on any one of their allegations \n     of perjury warrant conviction.\\49\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\49\\ H. Res. 611.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It is difficult to believe that anyone would charge an \n     individual with perjury, never mind advocate the removal of a \n     popularly-elected President, based upon an interpretation of \n     the words ``occasionally'' or ``friendship.'' It is \n     staggering that the Managers, after forcing Ms. Lewinsky to \n     testify under oath during this trial, would press her on the \n     details and timing of her first intimate contacts with the \n     President in order to ``prove'' the relationship did not \n     begin as a ``friendship.'' \\50\\ As demonstrated by the \n     frustration of the American people with this line of inquiry, \n     the resources, both human and financial, expended by the \n     Managers were not warranted by the substance of the charge.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\50\\ 145 Cong.

Feb. 4, 1999) \n     (Transcript of Lewinsky Deposition in which Mr. Manager \n     Bryant is questioning Ms. Lewinsky about the timing and \n     intimate details of her relationship).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     2. Perjury Concerning the President's Deposition Testimony in \n         Jones\n       The Managers' second charge of perjury is that before the \n     Grand Jury the President repeated false testimony he gave in \n     the Jones deposition. This argument appears an attempt to \n     convict the President for lies he told in his Jones \n     deposition, an Article which the full House of \n     Representatives rejected. Ultimately, this subsection of \n     Article I collapses on itself.\n       In their Trial Brief the Managers also assert that the \n     President reaffirmed or adopted his entire deposition \n     testimony before the Grand Jury. This is simply not true. To \n     make this assertion the Managers use the President's Grand \n     Jury testimony that ``I was determined to walk through the \n     mine field of this deposition without violating the law, and \n     I believe I did.'' \\51\\ Before the Grand Jury the President \n     refuted his deposition testimony that he was never alone with \n     Ms. Lewinsky.\\52\\ In addition to being inaccurate, these \n     charges were rejected by the full House. Not even Independent \n     Prosecutor Starr alleged that the President committed perjury \n     concerning this issue.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\51\\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 60.\n     \\52\\ In his opening statement before the Grand Jury the \n     President began, ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky. . . \n     .'' The Independent Counsel followed-up and asked if he was \n     alone with Ms. Lewinsky. The President answered, ``yes.'' The \n     Record, supra note 43 at 460-62, 481.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     3. Perjury With Respect to Mr. Bennett's Offer of the \n         Lewinsky Affidavit\n       The third charge asserted by the Managers to substantiate \n     Article I is that the President lied before the Grand Jury \n     when he testified that ``I'm not even sure I paid attention \n     to what he [Mr. Bennett] was saying.'' \\53\\ The President \n     made this statement to the Grand Jury after being asked about \n     Mr. Bennett's representation to the Jones court that Ms. \n     Lewinsky's deposition verified that there was ``no sex of any \n     kind in any manner'' between her and the President.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\53\\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 62.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On page 62 of their Trial Brief the Managers assert that \n     this testimony is perjurious because ``it defied common \n     sense'' and the fact that the video of the deposition ``shows \n     the President looking directly at Mr. Bennett.'' This \n     evidence fails to provide any insight on the President's \n     state of mind and thus cannot meet the standard of proof that \n     the President knowingly made a false statement.\n     4. Perjury in Denying the Obstruction of Justice Charges\n       Finally, in subpart four of Article I, the Managers allege \n     that the President lied when he denied both tampering with \n     witnesses and impeding discovery in the Jones case. This \n     allegation bootstraps every allegation made in Article II \n     into an additional charge of perjury.\n       First, the Managers charge that the President lied when he \n     told the Grand Jury that he instructed Ms. Lewinsky that if \n     gifts were subpoenaed they would have to be turned over. I \n     will address Article II's charge of obstruction later. With \n     regard to the charge that he committed perjury, Ms. Lewinsky \n     provided testimony in her Senate deposition which requires \n     rejection of the allegation. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that \n     when she asked the President if she should give the \n     subpoenaed gifts to someone, ``maybe Betty,'' the President \n     either failed to reply or said ``I don't know,'' or ``let me \n     think about that.'' \\54\\ However, after the President's Grand \n     Jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was pressed on the issue. When a \n     FBI agent asked if she recalled the President telling her \n     that she must turn over gifts in her possession should they \n     be subpoenaed by the Jones attorneys, Ms. Lewinsky said, \n     ``You know, that sounds a little bit familiar to me.'' \\55\\ \n     On its face, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony would seem to make it \n     more likely than not that the President told her to turn over \n     whatever gifts she had.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\54\\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 64 (quoting Grand Jury testimony \n     of Ms. Lewinsky).\n     \\55\\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1228 (daily ed. February 6, 1999)(Senate \n     Deposition Testimony of Ms. Lewinsky).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       There are two remaining allegations in the final subpart of \n     Article I. First, it is alleged that the President committed \n     perjury when he told the Grand Jury that on January 18, 1998, \n     he made statements to Ms. Currie to ``refresh his memory.'' \n     Second, the Managers allege that he lied when he testified to \n     the Grand Jury that facts he relayed to his aides in denying \n     an affair were ``true'' but ``misleading.''\n       I am troubled by the inability of the President to be \n     completely forthright concerning both his relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky and subsequent attempts to conceal this affair \n     from his family, friends, staff, constituents, and Ms. Jones. \n     In no way do I condone this behavior. However, seasoned \n     federal prosecutors have made it known that the statements of \n     this type, made by the President or an average citizen, would \n     not, indeed should not, be prosecuted as perjury. The power \n     and prestige of the federal government should not be brought \n     to bear on a citizen regarding testimony in a civil case \n     pertaining to an improper sexual affair. The Impeachment \n     Trial has borne this out. Discrepancies in testimony between \n     two individuals, and only those two, seldom satisfy the \n     standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (or by \n     preponderance of the evidence, for that matter.) Moreover, \n     citizens are uncomfortable with such a role for government.\n       The Managers have alleged that a failure to convict the \n     President on perjury grounds will destroy civil rights \n     jurisprudence and allow any future President to lie with \n     impunity. Both the Managers and our government weathered \n     untruths during both the Iran-Contra investigation and the \n     ethics investigation of former Speaker Gingrich. Citizens may \n     well lack confidence in the ability of President Clinton to \n     be honest about his personal life, this is not, however, a \n     threat to our government. The President, as a citizen, \n     remains subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. The \n     Managers have failed to meet the burden of proof they set \n     regarding the perjury charges brought against President \n     William Jefferson Clinton.\n\n\n               VII. OBSTRUCTION ALLEGATIONS OF ARTICLE II\n\n       Article II alleges that the President obstructed justice by \n     engaging ``personally, and through his subordinates and \n     agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, \n     impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony related to a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.'' \\56\\ \n     The focal point of these allegations is the Jones litigation. \n     Article II outlines seven specific ``acts'' that the \n     President used to implement this ``course of conduct or \n     scheme.'' These ``acts'' will be analyzed to determine if \n     they established a foundation for a finding of ``high Crimes \n     and Misdemeanors.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\56\\ H. Res. 611.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As an initial point, it is necessary to set out the \n     elements of the crime of obstruction of justice, as set forth \n     at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503. The components of the offense \n     include: (1) there existed a pending judicial proceeding; (2) \n     the accused knew of the proceeding; and (3) the defendant \n     acted ``corruptly'' with the specific intent to obstruct and \n     interfere with the proceeding or due administration of \n     justice.\\57\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\57\\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503. The House Managers periodically \n     urge that the President is guilty of witness tampering. The \n     crime of witness tampering is set forth at 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1512. This statute requires proof that a defendant \n     knowingly engaged in intimidation, physical force, threats, \n     misleading conduct, or corrupt persuasion with the specific \n     intent to influence, delay, or prevent testimony or cause any \n     person to withhold objects or documents from an official \n     proceeding. Like the obstruction of justice charge, witness \n     tampering requires proof of a specific intent to interfere \n     with a witness.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The critical question in regard to the allegations is \n     whether the President acted with the specific intent to \n     interfere with the administration of justice. Absent a \n     demonstrable ``act'' coupled with a demonstrable ``specific \n     intent,'' no crime occurs. The House Managers point to the \n     seven following acts as the basis of their claim.\n     1. The Lewinsky Affidavit\n       The Article alleges that ``[o]n or about December 17, 1997, \n     William Jefferson Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a \n     Federal civil rights action brought against him to execute a \n     sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be \n     perjurious, false and misleading.'' \\58\\ The allegations go \n     to the Affidavit prepared by Monica Lewinsky in conjunction \n     with the Jones litigation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\58\\ H. Res. 611.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The best evidence of the President's involvement in this \n     affidavit is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky \n     has repeatedly and consistently stated that no one asked her \n     or instructed her to lie.\n       ``[N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a \n     job for my silence.'' \\59\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\59\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 1161 \n     (Lewinsky Grand Jury testimony 8/20/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on \n     their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to lie.'' \n     \\60\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\60\\ Id. at 718 (handwritten proffer of Lewinsky, given to \n     OIC 2/1/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``Neither the President or JORDAN ever told LEWINSKY that \n     she had to lie.'' \\61\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\61\\ Id. at 1398 (FBI Interview with Lewinsky 7/27/98).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n       ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed LEWINSKY \n     to say anything or to lie . . .'' \\62\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\62\\ Id. at 1400.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Despite these repeated denials, the House Managers persist \n     in arguing that the President influenced Ms. Lewinsky to file \n     a false affidavit in a early morning phone call on December \n     17, 1997. They hang their case on a portion of the \n     conversation that involved a discussion of the filing of an \n     affidavit in response to a subpoena from the Jones lawyers \n     and another portion of the conversation that dealt with the \n     ``cover story'' that both the President and Ms. Lewinsky had \n     been using to disguise their affair. Ms. Lewinsky has \n     testified that, in a call on December 17, 1997, the President \n     said ``Well, maybe you can sign an affidavit.'' \\63\\ The \n     House Managers argue that this statement alone must convict \n     because both the President and Ms. Lewinsky knew that a \n     truthful affidavit could never be filed given the clandestine \n     nature of their relationship.\\64\\ This theory disregards the \n     testimony of both the President and Ms. Lewinsky.\\65\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\63\\ Id. (Grand Jury Testimony of Ms. Lewinsky on 8/6/98) \n     (quoted in HMTB, supra note 38, at 22.)\n     \\64\\ ``Both parties knew that the Affidavit would need to be \n     false and misleading to accomplish the desired result.'' \n     HMTB, supra note 38, at 22.\n     \\65\\ The President testified that ``I've already told you \n     that I felt strongly that she could issue, that she could \n     execute an affidavit that would be factually truthful, that \n     might get her out of having to testify. . . . And did I hope \n     she'd be able to get out of testifying on an affidavit? \n     Absolutely. Did I want her to execute a false affidavit? No, \n     I did not.'' The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 571.\n     Ms. Lewinsky testified to the Grand Jury on 8/6/98, that ``I \n     thought that signing an affidavit could range from anywhere--\n     the point of it would be to deter or to prevent me from being \n     deposed and so that that could range from anywhere between \n     maybe just somehow mentioning, you know, innocuous things or \n     going as far as maybe having to deny any kind of \n     relationship.'' Id. at 844. In her Senate Deposition Mr. \n     Manager Bryant asked Ms. Lewinsky, ``The night of the phone \n     call, he's [the President is] suggesting you could file an \n     affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of filing a \n     false affidavit with the court?'' Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``I \n     don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would have \n     to be false, so, no, probably not.'' 145 Cong. Rec. at S1218 \n     (daily ed. February 4, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Any lingering doubt about the nature of the telephone \n     conversation on December 17, 1997, was erased by the \n     videotaped testimony of Ms. Lewinsky before the Senate. The \n     House Managers repeatedly argued that the President not only \n     influenced the content of her affidavit, but that the \n     President was knowledgeable of those contents. In a response \n     to Mr. Manager Bryant's question, however, Ms. Lewinsky \n     unequivocally stated that ``[h]e didn't discuss the content \n     of my affidavit with me at all, ever.'' \\66\\ The House \n     Mangers argued that the telephone call on December 17, 1997, \n     was a deliberate attempt by the President to compel Ms. \n     Lewinsky to submit an affidavit that would explicitly \n     encompass their pre-existing cover story. Again, in response \n     to Mr. Manager Bryant's questions, Ms. Lewinsky stated:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\66\\ 145 Cong. Rec. at S1307 (daily ed. February 6, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``Q: Now, you have testified in the Grand Jury. I think \n     your closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie, \n     but yet in that very conversation of December 17th, 1997, \n     when the President told you that you were on the witness \n     list, he also suggested that you could sign an affidavit and \n     use misleading cover stories. Isn't that correct?\n       ``A: Uh--well, I--I guess in my mind, I separated \n     necessarily signing affidavit and using misleading cover \n     stories. So, does----\n       ``Q: Well, those two----\n       ``A: Those three events occurred, but they don't--they \n     weren't linked for me.'' \\67\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\67\\ Id. at. S1306.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Managers argued that Ms. Lewinsky could have only \n     filed the affidavit as a result of pressure from the \n     President. They reasoned that only the President could \n     benefit from Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit. Ms. Lewinsky totally \n     refuted their view. Again, in another exchange with Mr. \n     Manager Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky stated:\n       ``Q: But you didn't file the affidavit for your best \n     interest, did you?\n       ``A: Uh, actually, I did.\n       ``Q: To avoid testifying.\n       ``A: Yes.\n       ``Q: Why--why didn't you want to testify? Why would not \n     you--why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?\n       ``A: First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. \n     Second of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with \n     Paula Jones or her case. And--I guess those two reasons.'' \n     \\68\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\68\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       After Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony, it is clear that \n     she filed the affidavit of her own volition to satisfy her \n     own needs. The President did not influence the content of the \n     affidavit. His remark in the December 17, 1997, conversation \n     was, at the most, a terse response to her request rather than \n     a elaborate directive to Ms. Lewinsky. There is no credible \n     evidence that the President orchestrated an attempt to file a \n     false affidavit.\n     2. The Lewinsky Testimony\n       The House Managers assert that during that same early \n     morning telephone conversation on December 17, 1997, the \n     President ``corruptly'' encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to give \n     ``perjurious, false and misleading testimony if and when \n     called to testify personally in that proceeding.'' \\69\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\69\\ H. Res. 611.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Once again, this allegation completely fails to consider \n     the sworn testimony of Ms. Lewinsky that ``no one ever asked \n     me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' \n     \\70\\ Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony before the \n     Senate provides even more detail to her previous statements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\70\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 1161 (quoting Ms. \n     Lewinky's Grand  Jury  testimony  on 8/20/98). See also PCTB, \n     supra note 42, at 56-57.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Managers suggest that the ``cover story'' \n     developed by Ms. Lewinsky and the President to disguise their \n     relationship was explicitly urged upon Ms. Lewinsky by the \n     President in response to the subpoena. There is little \n     evidence to support this view. Indeed, the available evidence \n     undermines the position of the House Managers. The following \n     Grand Jury testimony of Ms. Lewinsky indicates that there was \n     no explicit linkage between their ongoing denials of \n     a relationship and the Jones litigation.\n       ``Q [JUROR]: It is possible that you also had these \n     discussions [about denying the relationship] after you \n     learned that you were a witness in the Paula Jones case?\n       ``A: I don't believe so. No.\n       ``Q: Can you exclude that possibility?\n       ``A: I pretty much can. I really don't remember it. I mean, \n     it would be very surprising for me to be confronted with \n     something that would show me different but I--it was 2:30 in \n     the--I mean, the conversation I'm thinking of mainly would \n     have been December 17th, which was----\n       ``Q: The telephone call.\n       ``A: Right. And it was--you know, 2:00, 2:30 in the \n     morning. I remember the gist of it and I--I really don't \n     think so.\n       ``Q: Thank you.'' \\71\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\71\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume X at 1119-90 (quoting \n     Ms. Lewinsky's Grand Jury testimony on 8/20/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Managers have presented no credible evidence to \n     overcome the sworn testimony of the parties.\n     3. Concealment of Gifts\n       The Articles alleges that ``[o]n or about December 28, \n     1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly engaged in, \n     encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that \n     had been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him.'' The allegation refers to the transfer of gifts \n     from Ms. Lewinsky to Betty Currie on December 28, 1997.\n       The House Managers argue that the President directed Ms. \n     Currie to contact Ms. Lewinsky and arrange for the collection \n     of personal gifts that he gave Ms. Lewinsky and for their \n     subsequent concealment in Ms. Currie's home. There is \n     conflicting evidence whether Ms. Currie or Ms. Lewinsky \n     arranged for the pick-up of gifts. Regardless of who \n     initiated the gift transfer, however, there is insufficient \n     evidence that the President was involved in the transfer.\n       The chain of events leading to the transfer of gifts began \n     with a meeting between the President and Ms. Lewinsky on \n     December 28, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky indicated in one of her Grand \n     Jury appearances that in the course of the meeting she raised \n     the topic of the numerous personal gifts that the President \n     had given her in light of the Jones subpoena. According to \n     her Grand Jury testimony, Ms. Lewinsky recalled: ``[A]t some \n     point I said to him, `Well, you know, should I--maybe I \n     should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give \n     them to someone, maybe Betty.' And he sort of said--I think \n     he responded, `I don't know' or `Let me think about that.' \n     And left that topic.'' \\72\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\72\\ Id. Volume III, Part 1 at 872 (Lewinsky Grand Jury \n     testimony 8/6/98). Ms. Lewinsky discussed this exchange with \n     the President at least ten different times during her \n     multiple interviews and appearances as a witness. In a \n     subsequent appearance before the Grand Jury on August 20, \n     1998, she again recalled this discussion and stated ``And \n     he--I don't remember his response. I think it was something \n     like, ``I don't know, or `Hmm,' or--there really was no \n     response.'' Id. at 1122 (emphasis added). It is clear from \n     her testimony that there was no discussion of the concealment \n     of gifts with the President.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The next link in the chain is the most confusing. There is \n     no question that Betty Currie picked up a box of gifts from \n     Monica Lewinsky on the afternoon of December 28, 1997. \n     However, there is still an unresolved dispute concerning who \n     initiated this activity. Both Ms. Currie and the President \n     denied ever having any conversation in which the President \n     instructed Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts from Ms. \n     Lewinsky. Ms. Currie has repeatedly testified that it was Ms. \n     Lewinsky who contacted her about the gifts. On the other \n     hand, Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie called her to \n     initiate the transfer.\n       The Managers and the Committee Report cited the following \n     passage from Ms. Lewinsky's Grand Jury testimony.\n       ``Q: What did [Betty Currie] say?\n       ``A: She said, ``I understand you have something to give \n     me.'' Or, ``The President said you have something to give \n     me.'' Along those lines. . . .\n       ``Q: When she said something along the lines of ``I \n     understand you have something to give me,'' or, ``The \n     President says you have something for me,'' what did you \n     understand her to mean?\n       ``A: The gifts.\\73\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\73\\ Clinton Report, supra note 40 at 67-68 (quoting The \n     Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 874-75 (Lewinsky Grand \n     Jury testimony 8/6/98); see also HMTB, supra note 38, at 32-\n     33. However, Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of references to the \n     President in this conversation were later cast in doubt by \n     her subsequent testimony. In her Grand Jury testimony, Ms. \n     Lewinsky was quoted as:\n     Q: [Juror]: Do you remember Betty Currie saying that the \n     President had told her to call?\n     A: Right now, I don't. I don't remember. . . .\n     The Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 1141 (Lewinsky Grand \n     Jury testimony 8/20/98).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\n       The uncontradicted evidence is that the President and Ms. \n     Currie did not discuss the gifts. The uncontradicted evidence \n     is that the President did not initiate the discussion of \n     gifts with Ms. Lewinsky and made no substantive response to \n     her discussion of the gifts. The unresolved issue is whether \n     Ms. Lewinsky or Ms. Currie initiated the transfer of gifts. \n     Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony before the Senate does \n     not resolve the issue of who initiated the gift transfer. it \n     does, however, add critical details that suggest that Ms. \n     Lewinsky, of her own volition, decided to surrender certain \n     ``innocuous'' items to the Jones lawyers, while concealing \n     other gifts. First, Ms. Lewinsky had already decided before \n     the meeting with the President, on December 28, 1997, to \n     conceal items from the Jones layers. As she told House \n     Manager Bryant in Senate deposition testimony: on December \n     22, 1997, six days before her meeting with the President, she \n     bought the gifts that she was willing to surrender to a \n     meeting with Vernon Jordan.\n       ``Q: Did, uh, you bring with you to the meeting with Mr. \n     Jordan, and for the purpose of carrying it, I guess, to Mr. \n     Carter, items in response to this request for production?\n       ``A: Yes.\n       ``Q: Did you discuss these items with Mr. Jordan?\n       ``A: I think I showed them to him. . . .\n       ``Q: Okay. How did you select those items?\n       ``A: Uh, actually, kind of in an obnoxious way, I guess . . \n     . they were innocuous. . . .\n       ``Q: In other words, it wouldn't give away any kind of \n     special relationship?\n       ``A: Exactly.\n       ``Q: And was that your intent?\n       ``A: Yes.\n       ``Q: Did you discuss how you selected those items with \n     anybody?\n       ``A: No.\\74\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\74\\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1222 (daily ed. February 4, 1999) \n     (deposition of Ms. Lewinsky).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Not only did Ms. Lewinsky decide unilaterally to withhold \n     certain gifts, she also decided unilaterally to conceal these \n     gifts, not at the behest of the President, but out of her own \n     concern for privacy. In response to a question posed by Mr. \n     Manager Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky stated, ``I was worried someone \n     might break into my house or concerned that they actually \n     existed, but I wasn't concerned about turning them over \n     because I knew I wasn't going to, for the reason you \n     stated.'' \\75\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\75\\ 145 Cong. Rec. S1309 (daily ed. February 6, 1999) \n     (deposition of Ms. Lewinsky as replayed during the trial). \n     Manager Bryant's question is compound and slightly confusing, \n     Ms. Lewinsky's response, combined with her testimony that she \n     avoided testifying for reasons in her own best interest, \n     makes clear that she had come to an independent conclusion \n     not to provide gifts to the Jones attorneys.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The final detail added by Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped \n     testimony may be the most significant. The President \n     testified to the Grand Jury that Ms. Lewinsky raised the \n     issue of gifts he responded: ``You have to give them whatever \n     you have.'' \\76\\ When questioned by an FBI agent after the \n     President's testimony, Ms. Lewinsky said that the words in \n     the President's testimony, ``sounds [sic[ a little bit \n     familiar to me.'' \\77\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\76\\ This statement has been dismissed by the House Managers \n     as self-serving at best. However, Ms. Lewinsky's Senate \n     Deposition testimony lends significant collaboration to the \n     President's claim. See supra, note 55, p. 23.\n     \\77\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     4. The Lewinsky Job Search\n       The Article alleges that ``[b]eginning on or about December \n     7, 1997, and continuing through and including January 14, \n     1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified and succeeded in \n     an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a Federal \n     civil rights action against him in order to corruptly prevent \n     the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at \n     a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have \n     been harmful to him.'' \\78\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\78\\ H. Res. 611.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This allegation focuses on the efforts to find employment \n     for Ms. Lewinsky. Of critical importance is the undisputed \n     fact that these efforts began long before Ms. Lewinsky was \n     identified as a potential witness in the Jones case. Ms. \n     Lewinsky herself initiated the search for employment based on \n     her dissatisfaction with her job at the Pentagon and her \n     perception that she would not be able to return to work in \n     the White House. Ms. Lewinsky suggested that Vernon Jordan be \n     enlisted to aid her, and his involvement was obtained at Ms. \n     Lewinsky's request by Mr. Jordan's long-time friend Betty \n     Currie.\\79\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\79\\ In one of the more unusual aspects of this case, it \n     appears that the idea to enlist Mr. Jordan's assistance came \n     from Linda Tripp's ``advice'' to Ms. Lewinsky. See PCTB, \n     supra note 42, note 103, at 78.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The allegation of the House Managers crashes on the same \n     unshakable and uncontradicted statement that has bedeviled \n     them from the start. Monica Lewinsky's unchallenged statement \n     is that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.'' \\80\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\80\\ Supra, note 70 at 29.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Unable to refute her statement, the House Managers \n     attempted to weave a pattern of circumstantial evidence. Each \n     attempt of the House Managers rapidly unraveled.\n       Mr. Manager Hutchinson argued with great force and skill in \n     his opening presentation that December 11, 1997, was the \n     critical date in the case against the President. It was on \n     that date that Judge Wright ordered the President to answer \n     certain questions about ``other women.'' As Mr. Manager \n     Hutchinson argued on the Floor: ``And so, what triggered--\n     let's look at the chain of events. The judge--the witness \n     list came in, the judge's order came in, that triggered the \n     President into action and the President triggered Vernon \n     Jordan into action. That chain reaction here is what moved \n     the job search along . . . . Remember what else happened on \n     the day [December 11] again. That was the same day that Judge \n     Wright ruled that the questions about other relationships \n     could be asked by the Jones attorneys.\\81\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\81\\ 145 Cong. Rec. S234 (daily ed Jan. 14, 1999) \n     (presentation of Manager Hutchinson).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The thrust of the House Managers' argument is that the \n     President learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list \n     on December 6, 1997. He met with Mr. Jordan on December 7, \n     1997, to enlist Mr. Jordan in the Lewinsky job search, and, \n     with the Judge's order on December 11, 1997, making Ms. \n     Lewinsky's testimony more likely, Mr. Jordan ``intensified'' \n     what had been a dormant record of assistance. This scenario \n     is demonstrably false.\n       The House Judiciary Committee Report acknowledges that the \n     meeting between the President and Mr. Jordan on December 7, \n     1997, had nothing to do with Ms. Lewinsky.\\82\\ Because of \n     this lack of interest by the President and Mr. Jordan in Ms. \n     Lewinsky's job search, the House Managers had to seize an \n     event that could plausibly trigger the ``intensification'' of \n     the job search which allegedly occurred on December 11, 1997.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\82\\ Clinton Report, supra note 40, at 11. This fact alone \n     casts serious doubt on the theory of the House Managers. If \n     Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the witness list was disturbing \n     to the President, and he was participating in the job search \n     to silence Ms. Lewinsky, why would he avoid discussing this \n     matter with Mr. Jordan?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Although December 11, 1997, was the date of a meeting \n     between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky, the record shows that \n     this meeting was arranged prior to that date without the \n     participation of the President. As early Thanksgiving, Mr. \n     Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky had a conversation in which Mr. \n     Jordan told her that ``he was working on her job search'' and \n     asked her to contact him again'' around the first week of \n     December.'' \\83\\ In response to a request from Ms. Lewinsky, \n     Betty Currie called Vernon Jordan on December 5, 1997, to \n     request a meeting. (This was one day before the President \n     became aware of the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the \n     witness list.) Mr. Jordan told Ms. Currie to have Ms. \n     Lewinsky call him to arrange a meeting. Ms. Lewinsky did so \n     on December 8, 1997, confirming a meeting with Mr. Jordan on \n     December 11, 1997.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\83\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III at 1465 (Lewinsky \n     OIC interview 7/31/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Since the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky on the witness list \n     did not prompt any accelerated action on the job search and \n     since the meeting of Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan was \n     contemplated and initiated before the release of the witness \n     list, the House Managers were forced to grasp for some other \n     triggering event. Unwisely, as clearly stated in Mr. Manager \n     Hutchinson's remarks, they chose the issuance of Judge \n     Wright's order.\n       Judge Wright initiated a conference call with lawyers in \n     the Jones case at 6:33 pm (EST) on December 11, 1997. At 7:50 \n     pm (EST), she concluded the conference by informing the \n     parties that she would issue an ``order to compel'' testimony \n     about ``other women.'' At that moment, Vernon Jordan was \n     somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean on United flight 946 \n     bound for Amsterdam. His meeting with Ms. Lewinsky had \n     concluded hours before. Obviously, the meeting with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, the calls on her behalf, the ``intensification'' \n     of the job search, had nothing to do with Judge Wright's \n     order.\n       Nothing so illustrates the fragility of the House Managers' \n     case as this dubious and discredited attempt to characterize \n     Judge Wright's order as a catalyst for an illegal job search. \n     Forced to beat a hasty retreat by the revelation of this \n     attempted legal slight of hand, the House Managers reversed \n     course and argued, unconvincingly, that they always saw the \n     triggering event as the release of the witness list on \n     December 5, 1997, or the President's receipt of the list on \n     December 6, 1997.\\84\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\84\\ It is interesting to note that the Article alleges that \n     the incriminating events began on December 7, 1997, and \n     continued thereafter until January 14, 1998. Once again, \n     these constantly shifting dates illustrate the ad hoc nature \n     of this argument.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This assertion, however, contradicts the evidence that \n     there was no discussion about Ms. Lewinsky during the meeting \n     between the President and Mr. Jordan on December 7, 1997, and \n     the evidence that the December 11, 1997, meeting was arranged \n     by Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan without knowledge of the \n     witness list or Judge Wright's order and without the \n     assistance of the President.\n       Ms. Lewinsky received the active assistance of Mr. Jordan \n     to obtain interviews and favorable recommendations with three \n     prominent New York firms. She succeeded in obtaining a job at \n     one of these firms, Revlon. According to representatives of \n     these firms, they felt no pressure to hire Ms. Lewinsky.\\85\\\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\n     (Behavior that undercuts the suggestions of the House \n     Managers that Mr. Jordan was engaged in a high stakes effort \n     to find Ms. Lewinsky a job at all costs.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\85\\ The FBI investigators working for Mr. Starr recorded the \n     following testimony of representatives of Revlon, American \n     Express and Young and Rubicam: ``On December 11, 1997, \n     HALPERIN received a telephone call from VERNON JORDAN [who \n     recommended Ms. Lewinsky]. . . .

Allowing False Statements by his Attorneys\n       The Article alleges that the President ``corruptly allowed \n     his attorney to make false and misleading statements to a \n     Federal judge characterizing an affidavit . . .'' \\89\\ This \n     allegation rests on the President's silence during the Jones \n     deposition while his attorney, Mr. Robert Bennett, cited the \n     Lewinsky affidavit to Judge Wright as a representation that \n     ``there is no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form.'' \n     \\90\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\89\\ H.

There is, \n     however, doubt about the President's state of mind; whether \n     he was aware of the interchange between his counsel and Judge \n     Wright; and whether he formed the specific intent to use his \n     silence to allow a falsehood to be advanced.\n       The President consistently denied his awareness of this \n     exchange and testified that he was concentrating on his \n     testimony:\n       ``I'm not even sure I paid much attention to what he was \n     saying. I was thinking, I was ready to get on with my \n     testimony here and they were having these constant \n     discussions all through the deposition. . . .''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``I was not paying a great deal of attention to this \n     exchange.

The \n     only evidence introduced by the House Managers to refute the \n     President's assertions is an invitation to the Senate to look \n     at the videotape of the President's deposition in the Jones \n     case and ``read his mind,'' and an affidavit from Barry W. \n     Ward, Judge Wright's clerk. Mr. Ward confirms what may be \n     inferred from the tape. ``From my position at the conference \n     table, I observed President Clinton looking directly at Mr. \n     Bennett while this statement was being made.'' \\92\\ But, Mr. \n     Ward's ``mind reading'' abilities are probably on a par with \n     the Senate's. As he indicated in an article in the Legal \n     Times after the date of his Affidavit, Mr. Ward concluded, \n     ``I have no idea if he was paying attention. He could have \n     been thinking about policy initiatives, for all I know.'' \n     \\93\\ The House Managers have not presented sufficient \n     evidence to sustain the burden of proof with respect to this \n     allegation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\92\\ Ward Affidavit.\n     \\93\\ Legal Times, February 1, 1999.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     6. The Conversations with Betty Currie\n       The Article alleges that ``[o]n or about January 18 and \n     January 20-21, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton related a \n     false and misleading account of events relevant to a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him to a potential \n     witness in that proceeding. . . .'' \\94\\ This allegation \n     embraces two conversations between the President and Betty \n     Currie, his executive secretary. On January 18, 1998, the day \n     after his deposition in the Jones case, the President met \n     with Ms. Currie and asked her a series of leading questions \n     that he promptly answered himself by declaring ``Right?'' \n     \\95\\ He had a similar conversation on January 20, 1998.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\94\\ H. Res. 611.\n     \\95\\ HMTB, supra note 38, at 65.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Managers argue that the President knew that these \n     rhetorical questions were false and the only purpose for \n     raising these questions was to influence the testimony of Ms. \n     Currie.\\96\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\96\\ Ms. Currie was not a witness in the Jones proceeding at \n     the time of these conversations. House Managers argue that \n     the President knew she would be called as a witness because \n     of his constant references to Ms. Currie in his Jones \n     deposition. Moreover, Ms. Currie became a witness on January \n     23, 1998, when the Jones lawyers added her to their witness \n     list. White House counsels argue that Ms. Currie's addition \n     to the witness list was not prompted by the President's \n     testimony, but by information secretly provided to the Jones \n     lawyers by Linda Tripp. They further add that it cannot be \n     reasonably assumed that the President was aware that Ms. \n     Currie was likely to be called as a witness. Obstruction and \n     witness tampering statutes require knowledge that the \n     individual is or will be a witness. This argument remains \n     unresolved, but a lack of resolution injects further \n     uncertainty as to the allegations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       What is clear from the evidence is the fact that Ms. Currie \n     was not influenced by the President' statements. Ms. Currie \n     testified to that effect to the Grand Jury on July 22, 1998.\n       ``Q: Now, back again to the four statements that you \n     testified the President made to you that were presented as \n     statements, did you feel pressured when he told you those \n     statements?\n       ``A: None whatsoever.\n       ``Q: What did you think, or what was going through your \n     mind about what he was doing?\n       ``A: At the time I felt that he was--I want to use the word \n     shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just \n     talking.'' \\97\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\97\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 668 \n     (Currie Grand Jury testimony on 7/22/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Ms. Currie added in her testimony:\n       ``Q: That was your impression, that he wanted you to say--\n     because he would end each of the statements with ``Right?'', \n     with a question.\n       ``A: I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.'' \n     He would say, ``Right?'' and I could have said, ``Wrong.''\n       ``Q: But he would end each of those questions with a \n     ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or \n     not true.\n       ``A: Correct.\n       ``Q: Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?\n       ``A: None.''\\98\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\98\\ Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       What is unclear from the evidence is the President's intent \n     in making these statements. The President has testified: ``I \n     do not remember how many times I talked to Betty Currie or \n     when. I don't. I can't possibly remember that. I do remember, \n     when I first heard about this story breaking, trying to \n     ascertain what the facts were, trying to ascertain what \n     Betty's perception was. I remember that I was highly \n     agitated, understandably, I think.\\99\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\99\\ The Record, supra note 27, Volume III, Part 1 at 593 \n     (Clinton Grand Jury testimony on 8/17/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The President's assertion is not without plausibility. He \n     initiated the conversation after the Jones deposition where \n     he learned that all of the details of his relationship with \n     Monica Lewinsky were known by the Jones lawyers and shortly \n     would be public knowledge. He faced an immediate public and \n     political disaster. Although he knew what went on, he had to \n     know what Betty Currie knew, not to influence her testimony \n     but to determine the potential gaps in this story. Ms. Currie \n     was the key ``go-between'' with Ms. Lewinsky and her \n     recollection had to be confirmed. More precisely, the \n     President had to know if his story would be contradicted by \n     Ms. Currie.\n       Given the facts, the President's explanation is as \n     plausible as that advanced by the House Managers. They have \n     not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \n     had the specific intent to transform these events into the \n     crimes of obstruction of justice or witness tampering.\n     7. The Corruption of Potential Grand Jury Witnesses\n       The final subpart of the second Article of Impeachment \n     states that ``[o]n or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, \n     William Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading \n     statements to potential witnesses in a Federal Grand Jury \n     proceeding in order to corruptly influence the testimony of \n     those witness.'' The Managers have alleged that this caused \n     the Grand Jury to receive ``false and misleading \n     information.''\n       In his Referral, Independent Counsel Starr outlines denials \n     about an affair with Ms. Lewinsky that the President made to \n     members of his senior staff: John Podesta, Erskine Bowles, \n     Sidney Blumenthal, and Harold Ickes.\\100\\ The lies that the \n     President told ranged from immaterial \\101\\ to \n     despicable.\\102\\ These lies call into question the \n     President's character and judgment regarding this personal \n     affair, but they most certainly do not rise to the level of \n     criminal behavior.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\100\\ Referral from Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr to \n     the House of Representatives, House Doc. 105-310, at 198-203 \n     (September 11, 1998).\n     \\101\\ Mr. Podesta testified that the President told him that \n     after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House (to work at the \n     Department of Defense), she returned to visit Ms. Currie and \n     that Ms. Currie was with them at all times. Id. at 88 \n     (quoting Podesta Grand Jury Testimony of 6/16/98).\n     \\102\\ In his Senate Deposition Testimony Mr. Blumenthal \n     testified that he related to the Grand Jury that on 1/21/98 \n     the President told him that Ms. Lewinsky had ``come on to'' \n     him, he [the President] had ``rebuffed'' her, and that Ms. \n     Lewinsky then ``threatened'' him with telling people that the \n     two had an affair. See 145 Cong. Rec. S1248 (daily ed. \n     February 4, 1999).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In order to constitute obstruction of justice, the \n     President would have had to specifically intended these \n     individuals to go before the Grand Jury and lie. It is just \n     as plausible, if not more plausible, that the President was \n     simply trying to conceal and deny the affair from the public \n     at large. The\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\n     President spoke to his staff because of the appearance of \n     press articles; their conversations had nothing whatsoever to \n     do with the Grand Jury. As the Democratic Minority of the \n     House Judiciary Committee pointed out: ``does anyone really \n     think the President would have admitted to this relationship \n     . . .  if no Grand Jury had been sitting?'' \\103\\ Independent \n     Counsel Starr called senior aides to the President before the \n     Grand Jury because his prosecutors knew that the President, \n     in furtherance of the public denials he was making, would \n     have lied to his aides. Under the OIC and House Manager's \n     theory, by publically denying the affair, the President \n     tampered with all the grand jurors, who must have known of \n     his denials. This simply cannot be the case. The President is \n     dishonorable for lying to his aides and putting them in legal \n     jeopardy in this way, but he is not a criminal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\103\\ Clinton Report, supra note 40, at 385 (Minority Views).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1916-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 92.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to \nthe personal representative of the estate of Fred Steffens of Big Horn \nCounty, Wyoming, certain land comprising the Steffens family property; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n      legislation to transfer property in big horn county, wyoming\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich was passed by the Senate during the 105th Congress and \nunfortunately was not passed by the House of Representatives. This \nmeasure, which would return a family farm in Big Horn County, WY, to \nits rightful owners, has also gained the Administration's full support.\n  The family of Fred Steffens lost ownership of the property where they \nlived and prospered for almost 70 years, as a result of a \nmisrepresentation by the original property owners. Mr. Steffens' \nrelatives have explored every avenue to regain the title to their \nproperty, and are left with no other option than to seek congressional \nassistance. I stand before you today, on behalf of my constituents, to \nrequest help in providing a timely solution to this problem. It is my \nhope that in doing so, this wrong can be righted.\n  Upon the death of Fred Steffens on January 20, 1995, his sister Marie \nWambeke was appointed personal representative of the 80-acre Steffens \nEstate. In February 1996, Ms. Wambeke learned from the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) that she did not have a clear title to her brother's \nproperty, and she submitted a Color-of-Title application. Shortly \nthereafter, Ms. Wambeke was informed that her brother's property was \nnever patented, so her application was rejected.\n  The injustice of this situation is that when Mr. Steffens purchased \nthis property in 1928, he did receive a Warranty Deed with Release of \nHomestead from the former owners. Unfortunately, these individuals did \nnot have a reclamation entry to assign to Mr. Steffens. In fact, 2 \nyears before selling the property, the original owners had been \ninformed that the land they occupied was withdrawn by the Bureau of \nReclamation for the Shoshone Reclamation Project. At the same time, \nthey were notified that they had never truly owned the property.\n  Unethically, this did not stop them from selling the land to Mr. \nSteffens in 1928. In good faith Mr. Steffens purchased the property, \npaid taxes on the property from the time of purchase, and is on record \nat the Big Horn County Assessor's office as owner of this property. Due \nto the dishonesty of others, his family now faces the sobering reality \nof losing this land unless a title transfer can be effected \nlegislatively.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would transfer \nthe land from Fred Steffens' Estate to his sister Marie. This property \nhas been in their family since 1928. Through no fault of their own, \nthese folks are being forced to relinquish rights not only to their \nland, but to a part of their heritage and a legacy to their future \ngenerations. I hope we can expedite this matter by turning this land \nover the Marie Wambeke's ownership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFER OF STEFFENS FAMILY PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--Subject to subsection (b) and valid \n     existing rights, the Secretary of the Interior shall issue, \n     without consideration, a quitclaim deed to Marie Wambeke of \n     Big Horn County, Wyoming, the personal representative of the \n     estate of Fred Steffens, to the land described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) Reservation of Minerals.--All minerals underlying the \n     land described in subsection (c) are reserved to the United \n     States.\n       (c) Land Description.--The land described in this \n     subsection is the parcel comprising approximately 80 acres \n     and known as ``Farm Unit C'' in the E\\1/2\\NW\\1/4\\ of Section \n     27 in Township 57 North, Range 97 West, 6th Principal \n     Meridian, Wyoming.\n       (d) Revocation of Withdrawal.--The withdrawal for the \n     Shoshone Reclamation Project made by the Bureau of \n     Reclamation under Secretarial Order dated October 21, 1913, \n     is revoked with respect to the land described in subsection \n     (c).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 451. A bill for the relief of Saeed Rezai; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce private relief \nlegislation on behalf of my constituents, Mr. Saeed Rezai, and his \nwife, Mrs. Julie Rezai.\n  As my colleagues are aware, those immigration cases that warrant \nprivate legislation are extremely rare, but are warranted in some \ncases. I am introducing a bill for the relief of Saeed Rezai. I had \nhoped that this case would not require congressional intervention. \nUnfortunately, it is clear that private legislation is the only means \nremaining to ensure that the equities of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's case are \nheard and that a number of unresolved questions are answered without \nimposing a terrible hardship on Mr. and Mrs. Rezai and on their \nmarriage.\n  I wish to take a moment, Mr. President, to provide something by way \nof background to this somewhat complicated case and to explain the \nurgency of this legislation. Mr. Rezai first came to the United States \nin 1986. On June 15, 1991, he married his current wife, Julie, who is a \nU.S. citizen. Shortly thereafter, she filed an immigrant visa petition \non his behalf. Approval of this petition has been blocked, however, by \nthe application of 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nSection 204(c) precludes the approval of a visa petition for anyone who \nentered, or conspired to enter, into a fraudulent marriage. The \nImmigration and Nationalization Service [INS] applied this provision in \nMr. Rezai's case because his previous marriage ended in divorce before \nhis 2-year period of conditional residence had expired. In immigration \nproceedings following the divorce, the judge heard testimony from \nwitness on behalf of Mr. Rezai and his former wife. After considering \nthat testimony, he found there was insufficient evidence to warrant \nlifting the conditions on Mr. Rezai's permanent residency and, in the \nabsence of a qualifying marriage, granted Mr. Rezai voluntary departure \nfrom the United States. The judge was very careful to mention, however, \nthat there was no proof of false testimony by Mr. Rezai, and he granted \nvoluntary departure rather than ordering deportation because, in his \nwords, Mr. Rezai `may be eligible for a visa in the future.'\n  Despite these comments by the immigration judge, who clearly did not \nanticipate the future application of the 204(c) exclusion to Mr. \nRezai's case, the INS has refused to approve Mrs. Rezai's petition for \npermanent residence on behalf of her husband based on that very \nexclusion. In the meantime, Mr. Rezai appealed the initial termination \nof his lawful permanent resident status in 1990. In August 1995, the \n10th Circuit Court of Appeals denied this appeal and reinstated the \nvoluntary departure order. Under current law, there is no provision to \nstay Mr. Rezai's deportation pending the BIA's consideration of Mrs. \nRezai's current immigrant visa petition.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that Mr. Rezai deportation will \ncreate extraordinary hardship for both Mr. and Mrs. Rezai. Throughout \nall the proceedings of the past 6 years, not a single person that I \nknow of--including the INS--has questioned the validity of Mr. and Mrs. \nRezai's marriage. In fact, many that I have heard from have \nemphatically told me that Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's marriage is as strong as \nany they have seen. Given the prevailing political and cultural climate \nin Iran, I would not expect that Mrs. Rezia will choose to make her \nhome there. Thus, Mrs. Rezai's deportation will result in either the \nbreakup of a legitimate family or the forced removal of a U.S. citizen \nand her husband to a third country foreign to both of them.\n  It should also be noted that Mr. Rezai has been present in the United \nStates for more than a decade. During this time he has assimilated to \nAmerica culture and has become a contributing member of his community. \nHe has been placed in a responsible position of employment as the \nsecurity field supervisor at Westiminster College where he has gained \nthe respect and admiration of both his peers and his supervisors. In \nfact, I received a letter from the interim president of Westminister \nCollege, signed by close to 150 of Mr. Rezai's associates, attesting to \nhis many contributions to the college and the community. This is just \none of the many, many letters and phone calls I have received from \nmembers of our community. Mr. Rezai's forced departure in light of \nthese considerations would both unduly limit his own opportunities and \ndeprive the community of his continued contributions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 452. A bill for the relief of Belinda McGregor; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of Belinda McGregor, the beloved sister of one of my \nconstituents, Rosalinda Burton.\n  Mistakes are made every day, Mr. President, and when innocent people \nsuffer severe consequences as a result of these mistakes, something \nought to be done to remedy the situation.\n  In the particular case of Ms. Belinda McGregor, the federal \nbureaucracy made a mistake--a mistake which cost Ms. McGregor dearly \nand it is now time to correct this mistake. Unfortunately, the only way \nto provide relief is through Congressional action.\n  Belinda McGregor, a citizen of the United Kingdom, filed an \napplication for the 1995 Diversity Visa program. Her husband, a citizen \nof Ireland, filed a separate application at the same time. Ms. \nMcGregor's application was among those selected to receive a diversity \nvisa. When the handling clerk at the National Visa Center received the \napplication, however, the clerk erroneously replaced Ms. McGregor's \nname in the computer with that of her husband.\n  As a result, Ms. McGregor was never informed that she had been \nselected and never provided the requisite information. The mistake with \nrespect to Ms. McGregor's husband was caught, but not in time for Ms. \nMcGregor to meet the September, 1995 deadline. Her visa number was \ngiven to another applicant.\n  In short, Ms. McGregor was unfairly denied the 1995 diversity visa \nthat was rightfully hers due to a series of errors by the National Visa \nCenter. As far as I know, these facts are not disputed.\n  Unfortunately, the Center does not have the legal authority to \nrectify its own mistake by simply granting Ms. McGregor a visa out of a \nsubsequent year's allotment. Thus, a private relief bill is needed in \norder to see that Ms. McGregor gets the visa to which she was clearly \nentitled to in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I have received a very compelling letter from \nRosalinda Burton of Cedar Hills, UT which I am placing in the Record. \nMs. Burton is Ms. McGregor's sister and she described to me the strong \nrelationship that she and her sister have and the care that her sister \nprovided when Ms. Burton was seriously injured in a 1993 car accident.\n  I hope that the Senate can move forward on this bill expeditiously. \nMs. McGregor was the victim of a simple and admitted bureaucratic \nsnafu. The Senate ought to move swiftly to correct this injustice.\n  Mr. President, I am also including in the Record additional relevant \ncorrespondence which documents the background of this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Cedar Hills, UT,\n\n                                               September 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This is one of the many endless \n     attempts to seek fairness and justification regarding a very \n     unique and still unresolved case pertaining to the future of \n     my beloved sister, Belinda McGregor.\n       This is a plea on my part for you to please allow me the \n     opportunity to humbly express in this letter, my deepest \n     concern which is also personally shared by Senator Edward \n     Kennedy.\n       It would be a challenge to explain what once started as \n     ``the dream come true'' for my sister, Belinda, on to paper, \n     but I hope you will grant me a moment of your time to read \n     this attempt to seek your help, as my Senator.\n       Towards the end of 1993 I was the victim of a very serious \n     car accident and I could not have coped without the support \n     of my church and the tremendous help of my beloved sister, \n     Belinda, after which she expressed a strong desire to come \n     and live in Utah, to be close to me, her only sister. In \n     1994, therefore, a dream came true when, after applying for \n     the DVI Program, which is held yearly, my sister's husband \n     David, was informed by the National Visa Center, that he was \n     selected in the 1995 Diversity Visa Lottery\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n     Program. Finally, my sister had a chance to live near her \n     family and friends, Belinda, who is Austrian/British, then \n     working for the ``United Nations Drug Control Programme'' \n     (UNDCP) at the UN Headquarters in Vienna, Austria, was so \n     thrilled to be informed of the good news. Therefore, all the \n     necessary documents were provided to the National Visa Center \n     in New Hampshire.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 454. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to authorize \nthe appointment of additional bankruptcy judges for the judicial \ndistrict of Maryland, to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself \nand my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, to introduce \nlegislation that is absolutely critical to the administration of \njustice and the economy in our State of Maryland. This legislation \nprovides for four additional bankruptcy judges for the federal judicial \nDistrict of Maryland.\n  This bill represents only the most recent of our efforts to \nstrengthen Maryland's federal bankruptcy court. Early in the 105th \nCongress, we introduced legislation adding two additional bankruptcy \njudges for the District of Maryland, in line with the then-pending \nrequest of the Judicial Conference. The House of Representatives \nfollowed suit in summer 1997, passing legislation that authorized these \ntwo judges, in addition to other new bankruptcy judgeships throughout \nthe country. Last year, the Senate overwhelmingly passed bankruptcy \nreform legislation that, among other things, authorized these two \njudgeships, though under the Senate bill the judges were of temporary, \nrather than permanent, status. This legislation ultimately was not \nenacted into law, however, and with such inaction the problem facing \nMaryland's sitting bankruptcy judges has only grown. Maryland remains \nwithout the additional judgeships it so desperately needs to make our \nbankruptcy system work.\n  Our State's need for additional bankruptcy judges has long since \npassed the critical stage. Since November 1993, when Maryland last \nreceived an additional bankruptcy judge, the number of bankruptcy \nfilings in the State has more than doubled. While the entire nation has \nwitnessed a surge in bankruptcy filings over the past several years, \nthe increase in Maryland has dwarfed the national average increase. \nBankruptcy filings in Maryland in the second quarter of 1998 grew at \neight times the national rate of increase for that period; for the 12-\nmonth period ending June 30, 1998, the rate of increase in Maryland was \nthe tenth greatest of the 90 federal judicial districts in the Nation. \nThe District of Maryland ranks first among federal judicial districts \nin filings per judge. As noted earlier, each House of Congress \nauthorized two additional bankruptcy judges for Maryland during the \n105th Congress. Simply put, however, the problem has outpaced this \nsolution.\n  The need for the four additional judgeships sought in this \nlegislation becomes even more evident when one considers it in the \ncontext of the case-weighting system adopted by the Judicial Conference \nin 1991 to assess requests for additional bankruptcy judges. Under this \nsystem, different types of bankruptcy cases are assigned different \ndegrees of difficulty and overall weighted case-hour goals are \nestablished for the judges.\n  The Judicial Conference begins to consider requests for additional \njudges when a district's per-judge weighted caseload reaches 1500 \nhours. The average United States Bankruptcy Judge had a weighted case-\nhour load of 1429 hours per year for the 12-month period ending June \n30, 1998. For that same period, Maryland's bankruptcy judges averaged a \nweighted case-hour load of 3020 hours--an astounding 211 percent of the \nnational average. Not only do the Maryland figures dwarf the national \naverage; they also dwarf the prior Maryland figures which led to \nlegislation passed by each Houses of Congress authorizing additional \njudgeships. Indeed, Maryland's overall weighted case load for the 12-\nmonth period ending June 30, 1998, represented a 25% increase over its \nload for the prior 12-month period alone.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider these telling statistics:\n  If Maryland were to receive two additional judgeships tomorrow, its \nper-judge weighted caseload would still be 2013 hours--41 percent \ngreater than the national average last year, and 34 percent greater \nthan the 1500-hour benchmark used by the Judicial Conference to \nevaluate requests for additional judgeships.\n  If Maryland were to receive three additional judgeships tomorrow, its \nper-judge weighted caseload would still be 1725 hours--21 percent more \nthan the national average, and 15 percent greater than the Judicial \nConference benchmark.\n  Only if Maryland were to receive four additional judgeships, as \nrequested in this bill, would the per-judge caseload in Maryland \napproximate the national average. And even then each Maryland judge \nwould have a caseload of 1510 case-weighted hours--still above the \n1429-hour national average, and still above the 1500-hour Judicial \nConference benchmark.\n  The additional judgeships sought in this bill are essential not only \nfor effective judicial administration, but also for Maryland's economy. \nBankruptcy laws foster orderly, constructive relationships between \ndebtors and creditors during times of economic difficulty. Their \neffective and expeditious implementation results in businesses being \nreorganized, jobs (provided by creditors and debtors) preserved, and \ndebts managed fairly. Overworked bankruptcy courts have a destabilizing \neffect on this system, and the inevitable delays occasioned by the lack \nof judges harm creditors and debtors, imperiling Maryland's businesses \nand the people they employ.\n  It is expected that bankruptcy reform legislation will be one of the \nfirst items on the Senate's agenda now that it has resumed legislative \nbusiness. Adding judgeships in Maryland's and other bankruptcy courts \nin need of relief is an essential component of any such reform, given \nthat the legislation we are contemplating will not only not ease the \nburdens on these courts, but in fact will increase these burdens by \nimposing new responsibilities on our nation's bankruptcy judges. And \neven if comprehensive bankruptcy reform fails or is delayed, the \ncurrent state of affairs facing Maryland's bankruptcy court requires \nimmediate action in the form of adding judges to that court.\n  In closing let me once again commend the efforts of Maryland's four \nsitting bankruptcy judges--Chief Judge Paul Mannes and Judges Duncan \nKeir, James Schneider, and Steve Derby. Their dedication to the \nadministration of justice is especially impressive given the \nextraordinary burdens placed on them--burdens which the Senate ought to \nease at the earliest possible instance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 455. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nRespect to the requirements for the admission of nonimmigrant nurses \nwho will practice in health professional shortage areas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           nursing relief for disadvantaged areas act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with by colleague, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison to introduce the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged \nAreas Act of 1999. Today, some of our nation's poorest rural and inner-\ncity communities face a crisis--they may soon have inadequate or no \nhospital healthcare because nurses are unwilling to work in these \nneighborhoods. The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 \nwill ensure that hospitals located in these desperately underserved \nareas can continue to provide adequate healthcare to our most needy \ncommunities.\n  Hospitals located in underprivileged areas often experience severe \ndifficulty in attracting nurses. These hospitals operate in the middle \nof some of the harshest poverty and crime in our country. The employees \nof these hospitals often treat the worst and most troubling cases.\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\n  The condition of the surrounding area imperils the ability of these \nhospitals to recruit and maintain an adequate nursing staff. These \ncircumstances have pushed some hospitals into a financial crisis, \nthreatening the quality of healthcare to those most in need.\n  For the past eight years, this problem has been addressed by the \nH(1)(a) visa program which has allowed these hospitals to hire \nnonimmigrant nurses. Unfortunately, the H(1)(a) visa program sunset in \n1997, and so once again such hospitals are in crisis. By replacing the \nH(1)(a) visa, the Nursing Relief Act will alleviate this crisis.\n  The true beneficiary of this program will not be the hospitals, but \nthe underprivileged communities which rely on the hospitals' services. \nLet me tell you a story about the role that this program can play in \nthe health of a community. The story is about the St. Bernard Hospital \non the South Side of Chicago.\n  St. Bernard Hospital is the only remaining hospital in the Englewood \ncommunity, which serves over 100,000 people. It is located in one of \nthe poorest and most crime ridden neighborhoods in the country. Over \nthe years, St. Bernard has become indispensable to its community. Even \nthough it has not been designated as a trauma center, St. Bernard \nreceives the second highest number of ambulance runs from the Chicago \nFire Department. St. Bernard also provides free vision exams and free \nscreening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and sickle cell \nanemia. In addition, schoolchildren receive free physicals and \ninoculations.\n  St. Bernard Hospital also offers a great number of outreach and \ncommunity services. A food pantry is stocked, and clothes are made \navailable for patients in need. St. Bernard is sponsoring a project for \naffordable housing in the community. The hospital has opened four \nfamily clinics in Englewood to provide safe and easy access to \nhealthcare for community residents. Physicians from St. Bernard visit \nsenior housing facilities on a regular basis, and the hospital has been \nrecognized by Catholic Charities for its work with senior housing and \nhealthcare.\n  In addition, St. Bernard is by far the largest employer in the \nEnglewood area. When the hospital faces a crisis, many jobs in the \ncommunity are placed at risk.\n  Even though the health of Englewood relies on this hospital, St. \nBernard almost had to close its doors in 1992. After aggressive \nrecruitment efforts, the hospital was unable to attract enough \nhealthcare professionals to maintain its services. The hospital was \nespecially in need of registered nurses.\n  The problem had been solved in part by hiring foreign nurses through \nthe H(1)(a) visa program. The hospital had gone through great lengths \nto hire domestic nurses, and was using the H(1)(a) program only as a \nlast alternative to closing its doors.\n  In the first half of 1997, for example, the hospital placed want ads \nin the Chicago Tribune and received approximately 200 responses. \nHowever, almost 75 percent of the responses declined to interview when \nthey learned where the hospital was located. St. Bernard has also tried \nto hire nurses through nurse registries. However, the rates of the \nregistries would cost the hospital more than $2 million a year, an \nunsustainable expense for an already financially burdened hospital.\n  Clearly, the H(1)(a) visa program had been offering St. Bernard a way \nto maintain its service to the community when no other option was \navailable. In 1997, even that option was eliminated.\n  The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act will ensure that \nhospitals like St. Bernard can keep their doors open to the public and \ncontinue to support their community. In addition, however, the bill has \nbeen designed to protect the jobs of domestic nurses and to ensure that \nhospitals use the visa program faithfully and only as a last resort \nsolution.\n  This bill is more narrowly targeted than the old H(1)(a) visa \nprogram. The measure ensures that nurses can only be brought into the \nUnited States by hospitals that have no alternative. In short, we have \nmade every effort to ensure that no American nurse will lose his or her \njob as a result of this bill. While we want to assure that these \nhospitals have an adequate nursing staff, we must also guarantee that \nforeign nurses are not taking away jobs from domestic nurses.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does:\n  It establishes a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health \nprofessional shortage areas. The program provides non-immigrant visas \nfor 500 nurses each year to work in hospitals where there are severe \nnursing shortages.\n  The Nursing Relief Act protects the jobs of domestic nurses in three \nseparate ways:\n  First, the measure requires that a hospital must certify that it has \ngone through great lengths to hire and retain domestic nurses before it \ncan use this visa program to hire nonimmigrant nurses.\n  Second, the measure requires that nonimmigrant nurses must be paid \nthe same wages and work under the same conditions as domestic nurses. \nIn addition, nonimmigrant nurses cannot be hired in order to disrupt \nthe activities of labor unions. These provisions ensure that hospitals \ncannot undercut the working conditions of domestic nurses.\n  And third, the measure limits the number of nonimmigrant nurses who \nmay enter the United States in any given year. The Act provides spaces \nfor only 500 nonimmigrants each year, and it caps the number of nurses \nwho may enter each state.\n  In addition, the Nursing Relief Act provides for serious penalties \nfor abuse, thus ensuring that hospitals will not misuse this new visa \ncategory. Moreover, the bill guarantees that hospitals use this program \nfaithfully by narrowly defining the hospitals which are eligible. In \norder to hire nonimmigrant nurses through this visa program, hospitals \nmust fulfill four strict requirements.\n  First, the hospital must be located in an area which has been defined \nby the Department of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of \nhealth care professionals.\n  Second, the hospital must have at least 190 acute care beds.\n  Third, the hospital must have at least 35 percent of its in-patient \ndays reimbursed by Medicare.\n  Fourth, the hospital must have at least 28 percent of its in-patient \ndays reimbursed by Medicaid.\n  All of these measures ensure that the Nursing Relief Act will serve \nas a relief to our communities rather than a loophole in the \nimmigration laws.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this \nimportant and very timely initiative. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me and support the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of \n1999 so that every hospital can maintain an adequate nursing staff \nregardless of its location.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers a credit against income tax for information technology \ntraining expenses paid or incurred by the employer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  information technology training act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, throughout the 105th Congress, the \nAdministration and the Congress focused considerable attention on \ninformation technology (IT) issues, particularly the difficulties that \nmany American companies are experiencing in recruiting skilled workers \nto fill key positions in information technology.\n  The Department of Commerce, early in the 105th Congress, released a \nstudy, ``America's New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology \nWorkers,'' alerting us to the severe shortage of information technology \nworkers. This report was supported by a study from the Information \nTechnology Association of America, ``Help Wanted 1998: A Call for \nCollaborative Action For the New Millennium,'' which estimated that \nthere are more than 340,000 highly skilled positions in information \ntechnology that are not filled. Moreover, the Department of Labor \nprojected that our economy will require more than 130,000 information \ntechnology jobs in three fields--systems analysts, computer scientists \nand engineers, and computer programmers--every year for the next 10 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the shortage of skilled high-tech workers is not \nunique to any one region of the country--Silicon Valley, Dallas, \nAtlanta, or Northern Virginia. It is a matter of urgent concern across \nthe country. The shortage affects every State, every sector of the \neconomy, and its impact was documented during a conference of more than \n350 educators, State officials, and business community leaders that I \nhosted last fall in Bismarck, North Dakota. The conference was \nscheduled to examine the challenges and opportunities of information \ntechnology in the 21st century.\n  Without question, the shortage of skilled IT workers is a major \nconcern for State officials and the North Dakota business community. \nDuring the conference, many North Dakota business leaders from firms, \nincluding Great Plains Software, Gateway, U.S. West, and North Central \nData Co-op, confirmed the difficulties they are having in recruiting \nemployees with qualified information technology skills. The business \ncommunity and educators, representing all levels of education, \nemphasized the importance of expanding opportunities in information \ntechnology training and education.\n  Last year, during the closing days of the 105th Congress, we took the \nfirst step to respond to the concern over the shortage of skilled high-\ntech workers by increasing the annual cap on H1-B visas for foreign \nworkers recruited to work in U.S. high-tech industries. As important as \nthis first step is, the increase in H1-B visas by itself will not \nadequately respond to the shortage of\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nskilled workers in the U.S. Nor is it acceptable to authorize an \nincrease in the number of foreign workers coming to the U.S. to fill IT \nvacancies without taking steps to ensure that American workers and \nstudents have opportunities to train and qualify for these excellent \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, that is why, during consideration of the American \nCompetitiveness Act last year, I introduced legislation, S. 2089, to \nallow employers an income tax credit for information technology \ntraining expenses paid on behalf of employees or other individuals who \nare entering information technology careers. I believe it is essential \nthat we provide every opportunity to American workers and individuals \nto become aware of opportunities in information technology, and to \nensure that training and education is available at all levels. I regret \nthat we did not adopt this important initiative during the 105th \nCongress.\n  Today, I am introducing this legislation to provide employers a tax \ncredit for information technology training. I am very pleased that \nSenators Feinstein, Johnson, Daschle, Sarbanes, Boxer, Snowe, Murray, \nReid, and Robb are cosponsoring this important initiative. This \nlegislation is also endorsed by the Information Technology Association \nof America, the Software and Information Industry Association, the \nComputing Technology Industry Association, the Information Technology \nTraining Association, and the American Society For Training and \nDevelopment.\n  Under this legislation, the tax credit would be an amount equal to 20 \npercent of information technology training program expenses, not to \nexceed $6,000 in a taxable year. The value of the credit would increase \nby 5 percent if the IT training program is operated in an Empowerment \nZone, Enterprise Community, Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) \nzone, in a school district in which at least 50 percent of the students \nin the school district participate in the school lunch program, in an \narea designated as a disaster zone by the President or Secretary of \nAgriculture, or associated with a small business with no more than 200 \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, last year we responded to the IT worker shortage by \nincreasing the opportunities for skilled high-tech workers from other \ncountries to come to the U.S. to work in the information technology \nfield. Now we have an obligation to make certain that the same exciting \nopportunities in information technology are available to American \nworkers and other individuals interested in information technology \ncareers. I welcome additional cosponsors of this legislation, and I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to incorporate this important bill in the \ntax legislation that we are expected to consider in the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 456\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

With \n     over 346,000 IT jobs currently vacant in the United States, \n     American industry faces a severe shortage of trained IT \n     professionals. Filling these positions is imperative to the \n     growth of our national economy and securing our place as a \n     leader in the global marketplace.\n       In order to grow the nation's IT workforce, we must provide \n     educational opportunities for all Americans that will allow \n     them to\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\n     enter to this high-growth, high-wage industry Training is \n     readily available at both public institutions of higher \n     education and private training facilities, but many cannot \n     afford to take advantage of them.\n       ITAA and our members urge you to cosponsor Senator Conrad's \n     proposed legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 allowing employers a credit against income tax \n     for IT training expenses paid or incurred. It is critical \n     that we do everything we can to provide affordable access to \n     IT training for all Americans.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC 20510.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: Recognizing that increasing the supply \n     of highly qualified information sector workers is an \n     essential cornerstone for sustaining U.S. economic \n     prosperity, the Software & Information Industry Association \n     (SIIA) is pleased to endorse your legislative proposal to \n     encourage greater business investment in workforce skills \n     training.\n       SIIA is the principal trade association of the software and \n     information industry, representing 1,400 leading high-tech \n     companies that develop and market software and electronic \n     content for business, education, entertainment and the \n     Internet. SIIA was formed Jan. 1, 1999, as a result of a \n     merger between the Software Publishers Association and \n     Information Industry Association.\n       To meet the demands of the Information Age, virtually every \n     business in every economic sector is undergoing a \n     transformation that requires its workers to use modern \n     workplace technologies to achieve higher levels of \n     productivity. Unfortunately, not enough of these ``high-\n     performance'' workers exist to meet increasing demand. As the \n     Department of Commerce has estimated, hundreds of thousands \n     of positions will continue to go unfilled in the next decade \n     unless we improve our ability to build and sustain a modern, \n     high-tech workforce.\n       Your proposal offers an important opportunity to focus \n     national attention on this problem. It would amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a credit against \n     income tax for information technology training expenses paid \n     or incurred by the employer. The credit would be an amount \n     equal to 20 percent of training program expenses up to $6,000 \n     a year. The credit would increase by five percent for \n     expenses paid or incurred in programs operated in specific \n     underserved locations.\n       The proposal complements bills enacted in 1998 that seek to \n     improve the technical skills of high school students and \n     adult learners, provide better training opportunities for \n     incumbent and dislocated workers and ease immediate high-tech \n     worker shortages by increasing the number of foreign workers \n     allowed in the U.S. on a temporary basis. We strongly believe \n     that passage of this legislation will signal a continued \n     national commitment to creating new opportunities for \n     American workers while addressing the urgent need to \n     alleviate the undersupply of technology-proficient workers.\n       We look forward to working with you and your Senate \n     colleagues to gain swift passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth A.

ASTD works with the federal government as well \n     as the business, labor and education communities to support \n     public policies and programs that encourage continuous \n     learning opportunities for all segments of the working \n     population.\n       ASTD is a supporter of efforts to address the high-tech job \n     shortage. This legislation will serve as a significant \n     incentive for employer investment in continuing education \n     while providing employees with an opportunity to maintain and \n     improve skills in this rapidly advancing industry.\n       ASTD appreciates your support for this important tax \n     credit. We look forward to working with you to move a bill \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Laura Liswood,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Information Technology Training\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Austin, TX, February 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jim Moran,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad and Representative Moran: The \n     Information Technology Training Association (ITTA) \n     congratulates and thanks both of you for introducing \n     information technology training tax credit legislation in the \n     U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. In 1999 alone, our \n     380 member companies will train over 5,000,000 U.S. workers \n     on various IT topics. While most of our members are \n     responsible for providing the actual training to \n     corporations, we also represent various Fortune 1000 \n     companies that conduct their own internal IT Training. More \n     than ever, we know that the value of trained and skilled IT \n     workers is crucial to the continued growth of the United \n     States in their high-tech arena. Many of our members cite \n     this as the number one problem facing their businesses today.\n       Our nation's most important asset is our people. It is \n     important for the nation's economy to invest in the future of \n     its citizens and businesses. The most productive and cost \n     effective way to achieve that objective is to concentrate the \n     federal investment in incentives that most effectively help \n     citizens enter existing high-paying jobs. For that reason \n     directing this incentive to areas where jobs already exist is \n     a prudent decision. Industry studies have revealed that at \n     lest 340,000 high paying jobs are currently available. Since \n     those receiving training will find jobs waiting for them when \n     they finish their training, the country will immediately \n     begin recouping its investment in the form of additional \n     personal and corporate income taxes that would otherwise not \n     be generated.\n       Tax credits are an efficient way to deliver incentives to \n     small and medium-sized businesses, which typically are unable \n     to afford the costs of IT training and lack the resources to \n     keep up with paperwork required for other support programs. \n     There is also a shortage of industry workers with technical/\n     vocational IT skills. Many economically disadvantaged \n     students and displaced workers enter the industry after \n     completing single courses or series of technical courses in \n     order to acquire the skills needed to become certified.\n       We also want to acknowledge our support for your decision \n     to include the private-sector IT Training providers in this \n     legislation. Due to the rapidly changing nature of \n     technology, the private sector has led the way in developing \n     successful training programs on the latest and most current \n     technologies. Many of these companies have also partnered \n     with software and hardware vendors to ensure that the \n     training on their products is accurate and of a high quality. \n     We believe that the only way to have an impact on the IT \n     worker shortage is to include all providers of training: \n     private and public.\n       Your legislation is a prudent, cost-effective, and user-\n     friendly tool that will simultaneously help economically \n     disadvantaged students and displaced workers, the companies \n     in our industry, U.S. competitiveness, and our trade balance. \n     We thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Peter Squier,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              CompTIA Public Policy Committee,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, February 22, 1999.\n     Hon.

A bill to be introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad \n     would help high-tech startups train and retain highly-skilled \n     information technology (IT) workers.\n       In North Dakota, the farm crisis is driving many young \n     people out of the state, and economic conditions make it more \n     difficult for companies to compete for top talent.\n       One company that has seen firsthand how difficult it can be \n     to find and keep skilled IT workers is Fargo-based new media \n     and software developer Sundog Interactive. As a high-tech \n     startup in the heart of America's breadbasket, Sundog is \n     forced to compete with much larger firms on a national level, \n     not only for clients but also for talent.\n       ``From the outside, Fargo might not seem like an ideal \n     location to start a high-tech company,'' explains Brent \n     Teiken, Sundog Interactive's cofounder and president. ``But \n     our community has three major colleges and universities and a \n     large technical college, so we produce a high level of \n     educated, skilled and motivated young people. Unfortunately, \n     many of these bright minds leave the area after graduation \n     because employers in larger metropolitan areas can offer \n     higher salaries and better benefits. The tax credit \n     legislation Senator Conrad is proposing should help level the \n     playing field.''\n       Sen. Conrad's bill would allow high-tech companies like \n     Sundog Interactive to earn tax credits on the information \n     technology training they provide employees.\n       ``In the long run, everybody would win,'' Teiken says. ``We \n     already rely on our area universities for qualified interns. \n     This legislation would provide an incentive to keep doing \n     that--and the working capital to grow our company and offer \n     more competitive salaries as a result. Students would gain \n     real-world knowledge and experience they could take with them \n     wherever they go. And more students would consider remaining \n     in the state after graduation, since employers here would be \n     able to afford better wages.''\n       Teiken is scheduled to appear with Sen. Conrad at his press \n     conference on Wednesday, February 24, 1999, in Washington, \n     D.C., in support of the senator's proposed legislation. \n     Teiken is also a member of the North Dakota Information \n     Technology Council, a group Sen. Conrad helped organize to \n     address IT concerns in the state.\n       To learn more about Sundog Interactive, visit the company's \n     Web site at http://www.sundoginteractive.com. The News \n     section of the site includes a feature story which provides \n     Teiken's perspective on the future of information technology \n     in the state.\n                                  ____\n\n\nCisco Systems CEO Chambers: High-Tech Training Key to Prosperity in the \n                            Internet Economy\n\n\n          bi-partisan senate bill demonstrates u.s. leadership\n\n       Washington, DC.--February 24, 1999--Cisco Systems CEO and \n     President John Chambers today hailed a bi-partisan effort in \n     the Senate to focus on high-tech job-training and education \n     programs.\n       ``As the Internet Economy takes shape, there is a critical \n     need to prepare our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. There \n     is already a shortage of skilled high-tech workers and more \n     than 1.8 million new jobs will be created as the Internet \n     Economy transforms our economy,'' said Chambers.\n       With these challenges ahead, Chambers praised lawmakers for \n     ensuring that policymakers will address the pressing need for \n     training and education.\n       ``I salute Sen. Kent Conrad--along with Sen. Olympia Snowe, \n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer and others--for \n     highlighting the need for the government and the private \n     sector to partner to train workers for the Internet \n     Economy,'' he added.\n       Cisco Systems, the worldwide leader in networking for the \n     Internet, has already worked with Sen. Conrad on a number of \n     high-tech initiatives, including the establishment of a Cisco \n     Networking Academy in the State of North Dakota. The Cisco \n     Networking Academy program, currently in 1,200 high schools \n     across the country, teaches high-tech skills to students.\n       About 17,000 students are currently in the Networking \n     Academy program and Cisco expects more than 2,000 students to \n     graduate in 1999.\n       ``The kind of training Sen. Conrad and his colleagues are \n     encouraging through this legislation will allow students to \n     learn skills needed for jobs in high-technology companies and \n     help current employees to be retrained to meet the needs of \n     21st Century jobs,'' said Chambers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Great Plains Software,\n\n                                     Fargo, ND, February 23, 1999.\n     Re tax credit for information technology training expenses.\n\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: We have reviewed the legislation \n     drafted and sponsored by yourself, along with Senators \n     Feinstein, Boxer, Johnson, Daschle and Sarbanes which would \n     provide tax credits to businesses that train workers in \n     information technology skills. As the largest technology-\n     based employer in North Dakota, we support this legislation. \n     While benefit to our Company may be modest, smaller, start-up \n     technology companies, especially those in rural areas of our \n     state, should see substantial benefits.\n       As you know, American industry faces a severe shortage of \n     information training (IT) professionals. Any legislation \n     which addresses this issue is welcome.\n       Please feel free to note our Company's support of your \n     legislation publicly.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Douglas R. Herman,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today alongside my colleague \nfrom North Dakota in support of S. 456, the Information Technology Tax \nCredit bill, which provides employers with a tax credit for information \ntechnology training for their employees.\n  The purpose of this legislation is quite simple: To assist American \ncompanies which are having difficulty in recruiting skilled workers to \nfill positions in the information technology field.\n  Information technology--including computer programmers, systems \nanalysts, computer scientists and engineers--is a critical ingredient \nin the growth of the U.S. economy as well as the economy of California. \nA field that barely existed a few decades ago, information technologies \nare now among the most important emerging technologies in the world.\n  Information technology now accounts for more than $500 billion a year \nto U.S. economy, and one-third of all new jobs created since 1992 are \nin computers, semiconductors, software, and communications equipment.\n  According to recent studies, ``e-commerce'' is projected to grow from \n$2.6 billion in 1996 to over $220 billion in 2001--explosive growth \nthat will generate countless additional jobs.\n  And, just as important, many information technology jobs tend to be \nhigh value added, high-wage.\n  Last year California alone was responsible for sales of approximately \n$125 billion in high-tech production--almost than double 1992's $64 \nbillion in sales.\n  Computer services--just one sector of the IT economy--have created \n100,000 jobs in California in the past five years. There are now over \n400,000 people in California employed directly in high-tech \nmanufacturing jobs. When information technology business service jobs \nare added into the mix, there are currently over 700,000 information \ntechnology jobs in California, according to the Center for the \nContinuing Study of the California Economy.\n  And yet, despite this explosive growth--or perhaps because of it--\nAmerica is simply not producing enough skilled and able workers to meet \nthe needs of the information technology field.\n  Last year the Information Technology Association of America releases \na study which estimated that there are more than 340,000 high skilled \npositions in the information technology field that are not filled.\n  And the Department of Labor has projected that our economy will \nrequire more than 130,000 information technology jobs in just three \nfields--computer scientists and engineers, systems analysts, and \ncomputer programmers--every year for the next decade.\n  One of the most sobering experiences of my Senate career occurred \nlast year when I was told point blank by the CEO's of several large \nCalifornia high-tech companies that the United States is simply not \nproducing a sufficient number of skilled and educated workers to fill \nthe information technology positions that their companies need to fill \nif they were to be able to continue\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nto grow and successfully compete in the international economy.\n  To meet the needs of these companies, last year Congress had to \nrevise the cap on H1B visas to allow foreign professional and skilled \nworkers who had the education and skills to fill these information \ntechnology positions to come to the United States.\n  While raising the H1B visa cap may meet the short term needs of these \ncompanies and of the economy, it is not a long-term solution to this \nproblem.\n  To avoid the danger of a ``hollowing out'' the U.S. workforce we must \ninvest more in the education and training of American workers so that \nthey have the education and skills needed for the information \ntechnology jobs which make up the backgone of the new high-tech \neconomy.\n  We must make sure that new workers entering the workforce have the \nskills they need to match with the jobs they want to be able to get. We \nmust focus on retraining unemployed, older, and displaced workers, and \nencourage new partnerships between the IT industry and educational \ninstitutions. And we must reach out to those who have been left out to \nmake sure that they have the training they need to join in our current \neconomic prosperity.\n  To meet these needs, this legislation provides a tax credit for \nemployers who offer information technology training for individuals, \nequal to 20 percent of the information technology training program \nexpense, capped to $6,000 in a calender year.\n  And, to help those who may have been excluded from the economy of \ntoday take their place in the economy of tomorrow, it provides a 5 \npercent increase in the value of the credit as an additional incentive \nfor training in empowerment zones or enterprise communities.\n  The current strength of U.S. information technology industry comes, \nin large part, from a long and successful partnership between \ngovernment, educational institutions, and industry.\n  This legislation builds on that partnership to both meet our current \nneeds and to train the next generation of information technology \nworkers, and to maintain the U.S. economy's strength and leadership in \nthe twenty-first century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 457. A bill to amend section 922(t) of title 18, United States \nCode, to require the reporting of information to the chief law \nenforcement officer of the buyer's residence and to require a minimum \n72-hour waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the permanent brady waiting period act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nChafee, Schumer, Lautenberg, Torricelli, Reed, Boxer and Dodd to \nintroduce the ``Permanent Brady Waiting Period Act of 1999.'' It is \nvital that we enact this measure if we are to ensure Americans that the \npopular Brady Bill will continue to be one hundred percent effective.\n  Five years ago, Congress passed the Brady Bill. That law contained a \nprovision that required a 5-day waiting period before a person can buy \na gun. Unfortunately last November, the waiting period was eliminated \nwhen we begin using the national instant check system for gun \npurchasers.\n  I fully support the use of an instant check system to determine if a \nputative firearm purchaser is legally barred from owning a gun because \nof a criminal record. But I believe that it must be coupled with a \ncooling off period.\n  Let me briefly explain what this legislation would do. It would \nrequire that anyone who wishes a buy a handgun must wait three days. \nThere are two exceptions to this requirement. First, if a prospective \npurchaser presents a written statement from his of her local chief law \nenforcement officer stating that the handgun is needed immediately \nbecause of a threat to that person's life or that of his family, then \nthe cooling off period will not apply. Second, if a prospective \npurchaser lives in a state that has a licensing requirement--and there \nare 27 such states--then the federal cooling off period will not apply.\n  I think both of these are common sense exceptions. Obviously people \nwho have a legitimate and immediate need of a handgun for self-defense \nshould be able to buy one. And in the states that have licensing or \npermit systems, the process of getting a permit acts as a state cooling \noff period.\n  This measure also requires that when a person applies to buy a gun \nthat the gun shop owner send a copy of the application to the local \nchief law enforcement officer. In addition, it alters the amount of \ntime that the state or federal government has to investigate a \npotential purchaser who has an arrest record. Under the law that will \ngo into effect on the first of December this year, if a person with an \narrest record applies for a gun, law enforcement will have three days \nto determine if that arrest resulted in a conviction. The measure we \nintroduce today would give law enforcement five days.\n  Mr. President, let me walk you through the process of buying a gun if \nthis law were in place.\n  If you are in a state that does not have a permit system in place, \nthen you go into a store and fill out a purchase form. A copy of that \nform will be sent to the Insta-Check point of contact for your state \nand a copy will also be sent to the chief law enforcement officer for \nwhere you live. You will then need to wait three days whereupon, \nassuming that you do not have a criminal record or any of the other \ndisqualifying characteristics, you will be able to pick up your gun.\n\n  If on the other hand, when the Insta-Check is run, the FBI learns \nthat you were arrested, then you will have to wait at least 5 days. \nThat five days will be used to determine if the arrest resulted in a \nconviction. If it did not, then after 5 days you can get your gun. If \nyou were arrested and convicted then you cannot get your gun and may be \nprosecuted.\n  Enacting this law is only sensible. A cooling off period may be the \nonly barrier between a woman and her abusive husband whose local \nrestraining order doesn't show up on a computer check or the only \nobstacle in the way of a troubled person planning to commit suicide and \ntake others with them. A cooling off period will prevent crimes of \npassion and spontaneous suicides. The list of people who have bought \nguns and used them within a few hours or a day to kill themselves or \nothers is far too long.\n  A recent study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrates \na disturbing trend that reinforces the need for a cooling off period. \nNormally, 4 to 5 percent of all crime guns traced by the police were \nused in murders. But the study found that 20 percent of all guns traced \nwithin 7 days of purchase were used in murders. That is a startlingly \nhigh incidence of guns being bought and used very soon thereafter to \ncommit a murder.\n  But this measure has a second, equally important justification.\n  That the Insta-Check system is in very good shape, but it will never \nbe perfect. For example, it will not have a lot of mental health \nrecords. And it is unlikely to have information like restraining orders \nentered in domestic violence cases. Letting local law enforcement know \nabout a potential gun purchase is a good idea--the local sheriff may \nknow that a person trying to buy a gun has a restraining order while \nthe FBI's Insta-check computer might not. In short, then, this bill \nwill help serve as a fail safe mechanism for the Insta-Check system. I \nfor one do not want to learn a year from now that someone got a gun and \nused it to harm someone else when a simple check of local records in \naddition to the Insta-Check would have revealed that the purchaser had \na history of mental instability.\n  Making the Brady waiting period permanent is not about more \ngovernment. It's about fewer gun crime victims. I hope that we can all \nagree on this goal.

Mr. President, today, Senator Durbin and I are \nintroducing ``Permanent Brady,'' which would establish a mandatory 3 \nday cooling off period before the purchase of a handgun.\n  I am under no illusion that Permanent Brady will cure the problem of \nhandgun violence. But I do believe a waiting period helps. Prior to \nenactment of the Brady law, in some States, an individual could walk \ninto a gun store and walk out with a handgun a few minutes later. Sure, \nthe individual had to fill out a form certifying that he or she had not \nbeen convicted of a felony and is not mentally incompetent. But that \nform was meaningless until the police had a chance to check to see if \nthe information provided was accurate. Now, the FBI has instituted an \ninsta-check system, which is working well. But a permanent three-day \nwaiting period gives local police the chance to conduct a check that \ncould turn up information not known to the FBI. For example, local \npolice could be aware of a restraining order against an individual for \ndomestic violence, or could be aware of a potential gun purchaser's \nmental instability.\n  A waiting period also can help prevent people temporarily under the \ninfluence of powerful emotions, drugs, or alcohol from obtaining a \nhandgun on impulse, thereby giving them a time to ``cool off'' and \nreconsider before they do something rash.\n  Last November the five-day waiting period established by the Brady \nLaw was phased out and replaced with the NICS--National Instant Check \nSystem. Establishment of a nationwide instant background check is a \ngood step, but I do not believe that an instant check renders a waiting \nperiod unnecessary. The bill we are introducing today would restore the \nwaiting period.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lott, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Grams, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Johnson, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Roberts, \n        and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 458. A bill to modernize and improve the Federal Home Loan Bank \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Home \nLoan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999. I am joined in this effort \nby my distinguished colleagues Senators Bayh, Lott, Bennett, Grams, \nKerrey, Johnson, DeWine, Conrad, Inhofe, Murkowski, Brownback, Bryan, \nRoberts, and Burns. While we've made a few improvements, this is \nessentially the same legislation I introduced during the 105th \nCongress.\n  The bill has the formal support of the American Bankers Association, \nthe Independent Bankers Association of America, America's Community \nBankers, the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, and the National \nAssociation of Home Builders. Equally important, we have the support of \nthe regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Board.\n  The bill's main objective is to strengthen local community banks that \nare vital to the economic growth and viability of our communities. The \nFederal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 would ensure \nthat, in an era of banking megamergers, smaller banks are able to \ncompete effectively and continue to serve their customers' lending \nneeds.\n  Community banks are finding that, for a variety of reasons, their \nfunding sources are shrinking. This makes it more difficult to fund the \nloan demands in their communities. During the 1980s in my state of \nNebraska--as in much of America--many community banks and thrifts \nclosed. As local credit dried up, local economies stagnated. Small \nbusinesses, our greatest engines for job growth, were the first to feel \nthe crunch.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 \nstrengthens community banks in order to avoid a repeat of the 1980s. By \nensuring the viability of the community bank and thrift, our bill will \nkeep credit flowing to small businesses, farmers, and potential \nhomeowners--and help our local communities to thrive as we enter the \n21st Century.\n  There is plenty of evidence that small banks are facing growing \ndeposit pressures. This problem has two causes: First, banks and \nthrifts are competing for deposits with brokerage firms and mutual \nfunds--and local institutions are losing. That means that deposits that \nused to go to local institutions and were used for local lending are \nnow going to major financial institutions outside the community.\n  Second, we have an aging population in many rural communities. When a \nfarmer dies, his inheritance goes to his children--who often have left \nthe community. That means money flows out of the community--out of \nlocal financial institutions--and is no longer available for local \neconomic development.\n  These two factors mean less deposits in local banks. That means less \nlocal capital available for local loans. Less economic development. \nLess opportunity. And this problem won't fix itself--most of these \nlocal institutions are too small to go to the capital markets on their \nown.\n  This is where the Federal Home Loan Banks can make a real difference. \nThe Home Loan Banks can be a critical source of liquidity for community \nbanks and thrifts. I tend to focus on rural America because that is \nwhere I come from--but liquidity problems can be equally serious in \nurban areas. The Federal Home Loan Banks are an important tool for \nproviding credit to consumers no matter where they live.\n  A related problem our bill addresses is government subsidized \ncompetition with the private sector. Commercial banks compete with \ncredit unions that pay no taxes and, therefore, have a lower cost of \nfunding. The same can be said of the Farm Credit System. Its connection \nto the federal government gives it a funding advantage over commercial \nbanks. The purpose of this legislation is not to drive the Farm Credit \nBanks or credit unions out of business--they play a vital role in our \ncountry. The purpose is to allow the\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nFederal Home Loan Banks to help level the playing field for commercial \nbanks and thrifts that must compete with these entities.\n  I want to provide you with a real world example: the case of \nCommercial State Bank in Wausa, Nebraska. Commercial has served \nnortheast Nebraska as an agricultural and business lender for more than \n70 years.\n  Now, with a growing economy in the region, the bank is growing as \nwell. In the small community of 600 people, deposits can't keep pace \nwith the growing demand for loans--and that means the bank's liquidity \nis declining. With less liquidity, there just isn't as much money \navailable for lending as the community demands.\n  This bill would help banks like Commercial and communities like \nWausa. As Doug Johnson, president of Commercial State Bank, wrote to me \nabout this legislation:\n\n       If banks like Commercial State Bank were able to access the \n     Federal Home Loan Bank, our customers would be better able to \n     be serviced with a consistent and competitive source of \n     funding. Denying credit to qualified borrowers is not \n     productive for Nebraska or the Midwest. Unfortunately, those \n     borrowers may miss the opportunities available to them at \n     this time to improve their economic prosperity.\n\n  Mr. President, that's what this bill is all about--helping \ncommunities to better secure their economic futures.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank system was established in 1932, primarily \nto provide a source of credit to savings and loan institutions for home \nlending. Now, a majority of the members in the FHLB system are \ncommercial banks. We should update this system to recognize this change \nin its membership.\n  Not since 1989 has significant Federal Home Loan Bank legislation \nbecome law. The system is working well, but I believe Congress can make \nit better. It's time for Congress to act.\n  This legislation has five main components:\n  First, our legislation would ease membership requirements for smaller \ncommunity banks and thrifts that are vital sources of credit in their \nlocal communities. It would allow the FHLB System to be more easily \naccessed as an important source of liquidity for community lenders. \nThese institutions would be permitted to post different types of \ncollateral for various kinds of lending. This critical change will \nfacilitate more small business, rural development, agricultural, and \nlow-income community development lending in rural and urban \ncommunities.\n  The second main component of this bill is an issue of basic fairness. \nFederally chartered savings associations, or thrifts as they are called \ntoday, are required to be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. \nCommercial banks, on the other hand, are voluntary members. This \ndisparity is unfair.\n  Our legislation allows federally chartered thrifts to become \nvoluntary members. This is important to these institutions, which are \nlarge stockholders in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It is critical \nthat all member financial institutions have the ability to choose \nwhether Federal Home Loan Bank membership is appropriate or not. As a \nresult of this action, we also equalize stock purchase requirements for \nall member institutions. We do this in a way that maintains and \nenhances the safety and soundness of the FHLB system.\n  The third component of this legislation fixes an imbalance in the \nsystem's annual REFCORP obligation. Currently, the 12 FHLBanks must \ncollectively pay a fixed $300 million obligation to service the REFCORP \nbonds that were issued to help pay for the S bailout. This fixed \nobligation has driven the banks to increase their levels of non-\nmission-related investments.\n  Under our legislation each FHLBank would be required to pay 20.75 \npercent of its earnings to service the REFCORP debt. Freeing the \nFHLBanks of the obligation to generate a specific dollar figure would \nallow them to concentrate on their primary mission of housing finance \nand community lending. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated \nthis change could bring in an additional $795 million over ten years to \nthe U.S. Treasury. In other words, we have protected the taxpayer from \npicking up any additional cost of the S bailout.\n  Fourth, the legislation addresses the issue of devolution of \nmanagement functions from the Finance Board to the FHLBanks. On issues \nof day-to-day management, the FHLBanks should be able to govern \nthemselves independently of their regulator. The function of the \nFinance Board should be mission regulation and safety-and-soundness \nregulation. The provisions of the legislation that accomplish this goal \nare non-controversial and enjoy broad support. In fact, they follow the \nrecommendations of a recent General Accounting Office study.\n  Finally, this legislation reforms the capital structure of the \nFederal Home Loan Bank system. Current law (established in 1932) \ndictates that the level of FHLBank capital is determined by the size \nand mix of a FHLBank's member assets, not by any rational capital \nstandards. The result is the FHLBanks' capital levels don't reflect the \nrisk profile of their lending activities. Furthermore, the FHLBanks' \ncapital lacks permanence because it is withdrawable by members upon \ntermination of their membership.\n  Our bill changes the existing capital rules to include a risk-based \ncapital requirement and a permanent capital requirement which ensures \nthe FHLBanks maintain capital levels appropriate to the risk of their \nbusiness activities. The new plan also encourages the FHLBanks to build \nup their retained earnings which act as an additional buffer and \nprotection to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, it's time to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank \nSystem. The landscape of the financial services industry is rapidly \nevolving. The Federal Home Loan Banks should be allowed to modernize to \nkeep pace with these changes. I am grateful to Senator Bayh, the \nprincipal cosponsor of the legislation, for his help in this endeavor. \nI am also grateful to the other cosponsors who have lent their names to \nthis effort. Today, Congressmen Baker and Kanjorski are introducing the \ncompanion bill in the House of Representatives. Both are tireless \nproponents for Federal Home Loan Bank modernization and their help in \nthe formulation of this legislation was critical.\n  I sincerely hope the Senate Banking Committee and the full Senate \nwill have the chance to consider this important legislation, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join with my \ncolleague Senator Hagel to introduce the Federal Home Loan Bank System \nModernization Act of 1999. We are joined in this endeavor by Senators \nLott, Kerrey, Bennett, Bryan, Johnson, Grams, Conrad, Burns, Brownback, \nDeWine, Murkowski, Roberts, and Inhofe.\n  Let me begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to Senator \nHagel for spearheading this reform effort over the past two years. The \nHome Loan Bank System is not something that is on the lips of every \nSenator or every constituent and I commend him for mastering this \ndifficult subject and for devising some changes that will allow this \nsomewhat-obscure system to have a tangible positive impact upon the \nlives of people who might not even be aware that the system exists.\n  Mr. President, the core element of our legislative proposal today \nwould be to allow community banks--defined as those institutions with \nassets of less than $500 million--to access the low cost capital of the \nHome Loan Bank System in order to make loans to small businesses, \nfarmers and other types of loans that benefit their community.\n  These small banks generally serve rural communities and small cities. \nThe plain fact is that while, overall, the national economy is robust, \nthere is still demand for credit and capital in rural communities that \ncannot be met by the existing financial structure. These communities, \nunfortunately, do not always attract the attention of the large banks \nand securities firms that have come to dominate the financial \nlandscape. And since the community banks that serve these communities \nare constrained in the amount of lending they can do by the amount of \ndeposits that they can raise from a limited geographic area, fueling \neconomic growth requires us to develop additional sources of private \nsector funding.\n  By opening up the Home Loan Bank System to these small, community \nbanks, this legislation will, hopefully, not only allow the banks to \nmeet the\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nloan demand of their town or small city, but will also have the added \neffect of keeping interest rates down--or even lowering those rates--\nfor these kind of loans.\n  Let me also emphasize, Mr. President, that these benefits will accrue \nto these communities without a single dime of taxpayer money. Making \nthese changes to the Home Loan Bank System frees up access to capital \nusing existing private sector mechanisms.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly outline why it is necessary for \nCongress to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and why \nopening up the system to these small banks is consistent with the \nmission that Congress endowed the system with in 1932.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank System was created in 1932 to serve as a \npublic/private mechanism that would both regulate the thrift (S) \nindustry and would help the industry obtain low-cost capital for the \npurpose of making home mortgages (at the time, the primary mission of \nSavings & Loans). Borrowing by the individual home loan banks is backed \nby the full faith and credit of the US Government, thus allowing them \nto borrow at the lowest possible rates. In turn, the bank makes that \nmoney available to its members in the form of ``advances.''\n  In 1989, as part of the clean-up of the S crisis, the Home Loan \nBank System was dramatically changed. It was stripped of its regulatory \nauthority (which was transferred to the newly created Office of Thrift \nSupervision) and of its authority to administer the deposit insurance \nfund (called FSLIC at the time and which was transferred to the FDIC \nwhich now administers the SAIF). The banks retained authority to \nprovide low-cost capital to the thrift industry, though membership was \nalso opened up to commercial banks. A Federal Housing Finance Board was \ncreated specifically to make sure that the activities of the 12 banks--\nwhich were still controlled by their members--conformed to safety and \nsoundness regulations.\n  The Banks were also required to buy REFCORP bonds. As a result, the \nbanks must pay a total of $300 million each year out of their earnings. \nThe banks must also pay $100 million each year as part of the \nAffordable Housing Program. The REFCORP formula required a payment of a \ncertain percentage of each banks annual earnings; if that failed to \nmeet the annual $300 million payment, a further allocation system went \ninto place with the heaviest burden placed on those banks with the \ngreatest number of S failures.\n  This legislation keeps in place all of the safety and soundness \nregulations put into place by FIRREA and FDICIA. But it would reform \nsome of the basic management of the individual banks so that basic \nadministrative decisions are placed in the hands of the men and women \nrunning the bank, rather than emanating from the Finance Board here in \nWashington. The bill also seeks to rationalize the capital structure of \nthe individual banks so that the need to engage in non-advance \ninvestments is reduced and so that banks' capital reserves are secured \nby permanent--rather than tradeable--stock.\n  With the rise of the secondary mortgage market--primarily driven by \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac--and the entry of other entities like \nmortgage brokers into the mortgage market, many people have been \nlooking for ways to allow the banks to play a more relevant role in \ntoday's society. Expanding the Home Loan Banks ability to provide low-\ncost capital to the smallest banks in principally rural areas is both a \nbenefit to the banks and to communities that are still experiencing a \ncredit crunch.\n  In 1932, Congress correctly surmised that creating funding for \nhousing was the cornerstone of rebuilding towns, villages and cities \ngripped in the vise of the Great Depression. Today, with the housing \nmarket flush with capital, it is appropriate for Congress to use this \nlongstanding tool of community development--the Federal Home Loan Bank \nSystem--to address the pressing and serious capital needs of rural \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Hagel and myself to work \ntowards enactment of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 459. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe State ceiling on private activity bonds; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n         THE STATE AND LOCAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nwith my colleague, Senator Hatch, an important bill that will assist \nstates and localities in working with private industry to foster \neconomic development and provide home ownership opportunities to low-\nincome Americans. Specifically, our bill will increase the private \nactivity tax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or $250 million, if \ngreater, and index the cap to inflation.\n  Congress created the private activity tax-exempt bond decades ago to \napply to mortgage revenue bonds and other bonds for multifamily \nhousing, redevelopment of blighted areas, student loans, manufacturing, \nand hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, Congress \nunintentionally restricted the growth of this program by imposing a cap \non the bond volume of $50 per capita or $150 million that was not \nindexed to inflation. The resulting erosion in purchasing power has \ncrippled the ability of states to meet the growing demand for these \nbonds.\n  Congress took an important step to correct this problem in the Fiscal \nYear 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill by approving a partial, phased-in \nincrease in each state's bond cap. The bond cap will be increased by $5 \nper capita beginning in 2003. The volume limit will reach $70 per \ncapita, or $210 million if greater, in 2006. Unfortunately, inflation \nwill have reduced the purchasing power of these bonds by nearly thirty-\nthree percent by the time the volume cap increase is fully phased in.\n  Tax-exempt bonds are issued by state and local governments to provide \nbelow market interest rates to fund authorized programs and projects. \nRevenue bond investors accept lower interest from these bonds because \nthe interest income is tax-exempt. For example, mortgage revenue bonds \nare issued to help lower income working families buy their first homes. \nThese low interest loans significantly lower the cost of owning a home.\n  In my own state, the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency has issued over \n$1.1 billion in mortgage revenue bonds for almost 16,000 affordable \nhome mortgages since the program began. In 1996 alone, the agency \nissued over $112 million in mortgage revenue bonds for nearly 1,200 \nhome loans. That's 1,200 Louisiana families who now know the pride of \nowning their own home--Louisiana families that earned, on average, less \nthan $28,000 last year. The Louisiana Housing Finance Agency estimates \nthat it could have put another $50 million in bond authority to good \nuse. Nationwide, states could have used an additional $7 billion in \nbond cap for mortgage revenue bonds, student loan bonds, industrial \nrevenue bonds, pollution control bonds and other worthy investments.\n  Student loan bonds are also issued to raise a pool of money at tax-\nexempt interest rates resulting in lower interest rate college loans. \nIn my state, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority has issued $745 \nmillion in student loan bonds since 1984. These bonds have funded over \n80,000 college loans for deserving Louisiana students--students who \notherwise might not have been able to afford to attend college.\n  In Louisiana, the roughly $40 million of remaining 1997 volume cap \nwill not come close to fulfilling the $330 million of demand for these \nbonds. The total 1997 volume cap for Louisiana was $217,500,000. After \nfunding minimal housing and student loan needs, little volume cap \nremains available for industrial development bonds for manufacturing \npurposes. Many of the industrial and manufacturing facilities create \nsubstantial employment opportunities. Unfortunately, a deficiency in \nvolume cap limits these opportunities.\n  Our bill will correct this woeful situation and improve the ability \nof states and localities to provide home ownership opportunities to \nlow-income families throughout the United States, to help fund student \nloans for college students and to help finance industrial and \nmanufacturing facilities. These facilities will, in turn, increase \nemployment and the tax base of local governments. I urge my colleagues \nto join me and Senator Hatch in this effort.\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my good \nfriend Senator Breaux the ``State and Local Investment Opportunity Act \nof 1999.'' This legislation would first, raise the annual limit on \nStates' authority to issue their own tax-exempt ``Private Activity'' \nBonds to the greater of $75 times population or $225 million and, \nsecond, index the limit to inflation.\n  Tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds finance much needed municipal \nservices, student loans, affordable housing, and economic development.\n  In my home State, the Utah Housing Finance Agency has financed first-\ntime homes for nearly 41,000 working families with Mortgage Revenue \nBonds. In addition, multifamily housing bonds have financed almost \n3,300 affordable apartments. Both of these bonds are subject to the \ncap.\n  However, many more Utah families still need the housing help that \nthese bonds provide. According to the National Council of State Housing \nAgencies, demand in Utah for these bonds and other Private Activity \nBonds more than doubled supply. Nationwide, demand for bond authority \nexceeded supply by almost 50 percent in 1997.\n  The current bond limit is the greater of $50 times population or $150 \nmillion. Cap growth is restricted by State population growth, which has \nbeen less than 5 percent nationwide over the past decade. During the \nsame period, inflation has sliced bond purchasing power nearly in half, \nas measured by the Consumer Price Index.\n  Last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act included a partial, phased-in \nbond restoration among its limited tax provisions. However, the \nincrease will not become effective until 2007. By then, nearly one-\nthird of the purchasing power of Private Activity Bonds will have been \nlost even with the phase-in.\n  Bond restoration has strong bipartisan support. A majority of the \nSenate, and nearly three quarters of the House, cosponsored full \nrestoration and indexation in the 105th Congress. Furthermore, three-\nquarters of the House, including nearly three-quarters of the Ways and \nMeans Committee, cosponsored identical House legislation.\n  The Nation's governors and mayors, along with other State and local \ngroups, and the public finance community strongly support full bond cap \nrestoration.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the ``State and Local \nInvestment Opportunity Act of 1999,'' so that their States can continue \nto make vital investments in their citizens and communities.\n\n                                 S. 460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Year 2000 \nFairness and Responsibility Act.'' This bill addresses what is \npopularly known as the ``Y2K Problem'' or the ``Millennium Bug.'' It is \nsupported by over 85 industry organizations and is important to the \nstate of Utah, our nation's fastest growing high-tech state.\n  Due to a simple decision years ago to save space on computer punch \ncards, many computers and electronic devices around the world still \nexpress years in only two digits. As a result, these computers will be \nincapable of making a smooth transition to the next millennium. \nTechnicians and economists have predicted that this problem, if not \ncorrected in time, could result in either a recession or at least \nserious economic dislocation.\n  Over the last several years, the U.S. government and the private \nsector have made great strides in aggressively targeting the technology \nside of the Y2K problem. Although there remains much to do, many \ncritical areas have already been addressed.\n  Last year, a unanimous Congress passed a bipartisan Senate Judiciary \nCommittee-reported bill that unleashed the genius of the American \nprivate sector by fostering the sharing of remedial information on the \nY2K problem. Prior to the bill's passage, various businesses were \nfearful of being sued if they shared corrective and other information \nconcerning the Y2K problem. In essence, the bill insulates statements \nabout Y2K information and solutions from being used as admissions in a \ncourt of law. This legislation has spurred solutions to the Y2K problem \nby increasing the amount of information available to address the Y2K \nchallenge.\n  But while this first step was important, additional reforms are \nneeded to aid innocent users and manufacturers and to nurture an \nenvironment where solutions to the Y2K problem will be forged. Last \nyear's advances are threatened by frivolous Y2K lawsuits--which will \ndisrupt and perhaps even cripple our courts, our high-tech industry, \nand thousands of businesses, large and small, around our nation. \nIndeed, one respected analyst recently estimated that the world-wide \ncost of Y2K-related litigation would be a staggering one trillion \ndollars.\n  The anticipated flood of lawsuits from those affected by the Y2K \ncrisis may very well impede the progress we have been making in solving \nthe problem. Companies of every variety will be forced to devote \nprecious resources to litigation rather than to repairing and \npreventing computer problems, and many of these companies may even go \nbankrupt as a result. Our courts could very well be deluged with \nlawsuits, clogging the arteries of justice. These consequences must be \naddressed.\n  The legislation introduced today will ameliorate the Y2K dilemma in a \nfair and reasonable manner. One of the main features of this new Y2K \nbill is that it provides for a problem-solving, cooling off period \nbefore Y2K-related litigation may commence. The problem-solving period \nis designed to allow prospective plaintiffs an opportunity to describe \nthe nature of the problem of which they seek legal remedy and give the \nprospective defendants an opportunity to respond and, if necessary, \ncorrect any material Y2K defect.\n  The parties may be able to resolve their disputes during the \nmediation period, thus forestalling the need for costly and time-\nconsuming litigation. Correspondingly, the bill establishes an \nalternative dispute resolution mechanism to resolve private disputes \nand avoid litigation.\n  Of particular significance is the bill's limitations on damages. The \nbill limits punitive damages in Y2K-related suits to three times \neconomic damages or $250,000, whichever is greater, or, if a small \nbusiness is a defendant, whichever is lesser. This and other provisions \nwill prevent frivolous lawsuits while preserving the ability of the \ntruly injured to recover damages and to deter future abuses.\n  The bill also remediates potential problems arising out of Y2K-\nrelated class suits. Class action cases are currently a source of \nabuse, and this bill seeks to limit such abuses by allowing class \nactions to proceed only if a majority of class members' claims involve \nmaterial defects relating to Y2K problems. Thus, as a practical matter, \nspecious class action suits are barred.\n  The purpose of our bill is clear--to promote and increase the chances \nthat innocent users and businesses gain access to solutions to the Y2K \nproblem. And while the purpose is clear, we recognize that the solution \nis not simple, We have worked to produce a fair, reasoned bill that \npreserves the rights of all parties to settle disputes, but will help \navert the potential disasters awaiting us if we choose not to act.\n  This bill reflects the high levels of cooperation and broad consensus \nthat large manufactures, small businesses, the telecommunications \nindustry, the information technology industry, electric utilities, and \nprofessional associations have been able to achieve. They\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nare all to be commended for their efforts in supporting this vitally \nimportant legislation.\n  Let me explain the bill in more detail.\n\n\n                         I. purpose of the bill\n\n  The bill's main purpose is to promote Y2K readiness and problem-\nsolving by discouraging a wasteful diversion of resources that would \notherwise support readiness and problem-solving toward Y2K-related \nlitigation. Such a costly diversion of resources could exacerbate the \nrisk of nationwide economic dislocation that the Y2K problem poses. \nAccordingly, the bill aims to prohibit Y2K-related litigation but to \nimpose a slight delay in its commencement so as to promote resolution \nof Y2K problems and disputes without resort to litigation. I believe \nthis will benefit plaintiffs, defendants, consumers, businesses, and \ninnocent users. We want to create an environment when people think, \n``Let's try to solve it'' before they say, ``Let's sue them.''\n\n\n                  ii. summary of the bill's provisions\n\n  Pre-litigation Remediation Period (Sec. 101):\n  If a person aggrieved by a year-2000-related (Y2K-related) problem \nwants to file a lawsuit based on that problem, he must first provide \nthe prospective defendant, at least 90 days before filing suit, with \nnotice regarding how the Y2K defect manifests itself, what injury he \nsuffered or risk he bore as a result, and what relief he seeks. The \nonly exception to this mandatory 90-day remediation period is if the \nprospective plaintiff is party to a contract that provides for a period \nof delay before suit for breach of contract may commence. In that case, \nthe contract's waiting period prevails over the bill's.\n  If the prospective plaintiff fails to give notice to the prospective \ndefendant, as outlined above, and sues anyway, the defendant can treat \nthe plaintiff's lawsuit itself as a substitute notice, thus triggering \nthe 90-day remediation period. If the 90-day remediation period is \ntriggered by an actual lawsuit (instead of the notice) all discovery \nwill be stayed and pleading deadlines will be tolled for the duration \nof the period.\n  The bill imposes responsibilities on prospective defendants as well \nas plaintiffs. If a defendant has been given notice, as outlined above, \nhe must respond to this notice within 30 days of receiving it. In this \nresponse, the prospective defendant must state in writing his \nacknowledgement of receipt of the notice and what actions he will take \nor has taken to address the Y2K problem identified in the plaintiff's \nnotice. Even if the plaintiff has not given notice and the defendant \ntreats his actual lawsuit as substitute notice, the defendant must \nstill respond to that notice within 30 days with all required \nparticulars.\n  If the defendant fails to respond to the plaintiff's notice, then the \nremediation period terminates at the expiration of the defendant's 30-\nday response deadline; the lawsuit can then proceed.\n  Also of particular significance, the 90-day remediation period may be \nextended as part of mutual agreement of the parties to engage in \nalternative dispute resolution. See Sec. 102(a).\n  Pleading Requirements (Sec. 103):\n  The bill requires all Y2K plaintiffs seeking money damages to make a \ndetailed statement in their lawsuits of the nature and amount of the \ndamages they seek to recover, specific facts that form the basis for \ncalculating those damages, and how material Y2K defects manifest \nthemselves. In addition, if the claim being pursued requires proof that \nthe defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the plaintiff must \n``state in detail the facts giving rise to a strong inference that the \ndefendant acted with the required state of mind.''\n\n  The bill allows the court to dismiss a Y2K lawsuit that fails to meet \nthe above pleading requirements. However, the plaintiff can re-file his \nlawsuit with the required detailed statements and still get a chance to \npursue his claim.\n  Duty to Mitigate (Sec. 104):\n  This provision codifies the common-law rule that bars recovery of \ndamages for injuries that the plaintiff could reasonably have been \navoided.\n  Evidence of Reasonable Efforts and Contract Defenses (Sec. 202(a)):\n  This provision allows a defendant, ``for the purpose of limiting or \neliminating the defendant's liability,'' for breach of contract to \noffer evidence that his performance was ``reasonable in light of the \ncircumstances.'' This would overcome any objection, based on Federal or \nState rules of evidence, that evidence of such reasonable-efforts \nperformance is irrelevant to the issue of breach. Also, this provision \nexpressly preserves the common-law and Uniform Commercial Code defenses \nof impossibility and impracticability.\n  Contract Damages Limit (Sec. 203):\n  Contract damages are limited either to those provided for in a \nliquidated damages clause or by operation of law that governed the \ncontract's interpretation at the time of contract formation. This does \nnot alter present-day contract law. Rather, it is designed to preempt \nany State's attempt to change its contract law relating to Y2K problems \nafter the contract that is the subject of the lawsuit was entered into.\n  Proportionate Liability in Tort Cases (Sec. 301(b)):\n  This provision essentially codifies the tort doctrine of pure \ncomparative negligence in that it requires the court to assign a \npercent share of liability to each person determined to have caused or \ncontributed to the plaintiff's loss in proportion to the relative fault \nof each. Personal injury cases are exempt from this provision.\n  State of Mind and Foreseeability Requirements in Tort Cases \n(Sec. 302):\n  This provision establishes a heightened state-of-mind element for \nthree types of lawsuits: For fraud and negligent misrepresentation \ncases, the plaintiff must, in addition to proving all other elements of \nthe claim, prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant \n``actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial \nrisk, that [a Y2K] failure would occur.'' For cases that require proof \nof gross negligence or recklessness, the plaintiff must, in addition to \nproving all other elements of the claim, prove by clear and convincing \nevidence that the defendant ``actually knew, or recklessly disregarded \na known and substantial risk, that plaintiff would suffer [actual or \npotential] harm. For ordinary negligence cases, the plaintiff must, in \naddition to proving all other elements of the claim, prove by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the defendant ``knew or reasonably should have \nknown that its actions would cause harm to the plaintiff.''\n\n  Reasonable Efforts Defense in Tort Cases (Sec. 303):\n  Under this provision, a plaintiff may not recover simply by showing \nthat a Y2K failure occurred in something that was under the control of \nthe defendant. This is intended to avoid a defendant being held \nstrictly liable for harm caused by a Y2K failure. Also, the bill \nprovides the defendant with a complete defense to liability if he can \nshow that he took reasonable efforts under the circumstances to prevent \nthe Y2K failure or its attendant damages. Breach of contract cases are \nexempt from this provision.\n  Tort Punitive Damages Limit (Sec. 304):\n  This provision limits punitive damages to either: (1) lesser of three \ntimes actual damages or $250,000 for individuals whose net worth is \n$500,000 or less and for small businesses; or (2) the greater of three \ntimes actual damages or $250,000 for all other defendants.\n  Limit on Economic Loss Recovery in Tort Cases (Sec. 305):\n  This provision essentially codifies the common-law economic loss \ndoctrine found in section 766C of the Restatement of Torts. \nAccordingly, the provision allows recovery of economic losses only when \npermitted by statute or judicial decision and (1) where permitted under \na contract to which the plaintiff is a party; (2) where permitted under \napplicable law that governed interpretation of the contract at the time \nof contract formation; (3) when they are incidental to a Y2K-related \npersonal injury claim; or (4) when they are incidental to a Y2K-related \nproperty damage claim.\n  Liability of Officers and Directors (Sec. 306):\n  This provision limits the personal liability of corporate officers \nand directors to the greater of $100,000 or the amount of cash \ncompensation such officer or director received in the year preceding \nthe act or omission for which he was found liable. This limitation on \npersonal liability does not apply where it is proven by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the officer or director specifically intended \nto harm the plaintiff by (1) intentionally making materially misleading \nstatements on\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nwhich the plaintiff relied or (2) intentionally withholding material \ninformation regarding a Y2K failure that he had a duty to disclose. \nThis provision expressly does not pre-empt State law on liability of \nofficers and directors.\n  Class Action Requirements:\n  Regarding Y2K-related class suits, the bill allows these actions to \nproceed only if a majority of class members' claims involve material \nY2K defects. Also, only those individuals who have actual notice, as \ncertified by the court, of the suit are entitled to join the class, \nunless they inform the court in writing prior to commencement of trial \nor entry of judgment of their desire to join the class.\n  Finally, the bill changes the requirements of Federal jurisdiction \nfor Y2K-related actions in three respects: (1) there is no amount in \ncontroversy requirement for Federal diversity jurisdiction; (2) \ndiversity of citizenship can be established as to any member of the \nclass, not just the named members; and (3) plaintiffs as well as \ndefendants can remove Y2K-related actions from state court to Federal \ncourt.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the Y2K \nproblem is not a partisan issue. This is a bipartisan, fair bill. We \nmust all work together--now--to ensure that a rush to the courts does \nnot cripple the ability of American businesses to solve the Y2K problem \nswiftly, efficiently and without unnecessary distractions. The real \nbeneficiaries of this bill will be individual consumers and businesses, \nthe engine of the American economy. I ask my colleagues to support this \nworthwhile legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill in its entirety be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Effective date.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and \n     programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 \n     and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year \n     2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 \n     or thereafter or will fail to process those dates.\n       (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph \n     (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that \n     are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, \n     consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and \n     defense systems, in the United States and throughout the \n     world.\n       (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users \n     of technology products concentrate their attention and \n     resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on \n     assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans \n     to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-\n     change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions \n     associated with computer failures.\n       (3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may \n     affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology \n     products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood \n     that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a \n     significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.\n       (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have \n     a range of undesirable effects including the following:\n       (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial \n     resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 \n     computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems \n     remain or become operational.\n       (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted \n     business and customer relationships that are important to the \n     effective functioning of the national economy.\n       (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing \n     particular problems for the small businesses and individuals \n     who already find that system inaccessible because of its \n     complexity and expense.\n       (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, \n     adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany \n     litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the \n     difficulties associated with the date change and work against \n     the successful resolution of those difficulties.\n       (v) Concern about the potential for liability--in \n     particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense \n     associated with defending against even the most insubstantial \n     lawsuits--is prompting many persons and businesses with \n     technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year \n     2000 computer date-change problems.\n       (b) Purposes.--Based upon the power contained in article I, \n     section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, \n     the purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all \n     businesses and users of technology products reasonable \n     incentives to solve year 2000 computer date-change problems \n     before they develop;\n       (2) to encourage the resolution of year 2000 computer date-\n     change disputes involving economic damages without recourse \n     to unnecessary, time consuming, and wasteful litigation; and\n       (3) to lessen burdens on interstate commerce by \n     discouraging insubstantial lawsuits, while also preserving \n     the ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered \n     real injury to obtain complete relief.\n       (c) Scope.--Nothing in this Act affects claims for personal \n     injury.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on January 1, 1999.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Year 2000 Fairness and \nResponsibility Act. This bill, supported by more than 80 industry \norganizations, is especially important to California, where over 20 \npercent of the nation's high-tech jobs are located.\n  The genesis of the bill was a request by several industry groups--\nincluding the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers (NAM), the Chamber of Commerce and the \nInformation Technology Association of America--to develop legislation \nto prevent frivolous and baseless lawsuits that could jeopardize \ncompanies actually solving Y2K problems.\n  In concert with Senator Hatch and industry groups, a bill has been \ndrafted that is narrow in focus and moderate in application. In \ndeveloping this legislation, we have sought to solve an important \nproblem and feel we have worked to develop a fair bill. We remain \nwilling to address concerns with this legislation. It is a starting \npoint, not a final piece of legislation.\n  This bill is a bill that will prevent frivolous and baseless \nlitigation, but will not restrict an individual's right to sue to \nmitigate real damages.\n  Let me outline a few key provisions of the legislation.\n  First, this bill provides a 90-day ``cooling off period,'' during \nwhich no Y2K lawsuit may be filed and a three-step process must be \nfollowed:\n  A. Anyone alleging harm due to a Y2K failure must first provide \nwritten notice to the potential defendant of the problem.\n  B. The defendant then has 3 days to respond in writing.\n  C. The defendant also has 60 additional days to fix the problem.\n  This cooling off period is important because it allows companies to \nconcentrate on solving the problem before suits are filed and \nhopefully, it will eliminate the rush to litigation that many \nanticipate.\n  Obviously, the hope is that if a company is given an opportunity to \nsolve a Y2K problem, that company will proceed to do so with dispatch. \nTherefore, there will be fewer injured parties, ergo, fewer will need \nto file suit.\n  Second, the bill limits punitive damages to $250,000 or three times \neconomic loss, whichever is greater. However, for individuals whose net \nworth does not exceed $500,000 or for small businesses, of fewer that \n25 full-time employees, punitive damages would be limited to the lesser \nof $250,000 or three times economic damages.\n  Third, this bill provides for proportionate liability, so that a \ndefendant would be limited to the percentage proportion of that \ndefendant's fault in causing the alleged harm. In other words, ``no \ndeep pockets.''\n\n  Fourth, the bill establishes requirements that the plaintiffs must \nallege specific harm and damages when filing suit, including the \nfactual basis for the calculation of damages.\n  The bill also provides either party the opportunity to request \nAlternative Dispute Resolution at any time during the 90-day cooling \noff period provided for in this bill. If the parties agree to use \nAlternative Dispute Resolution and the dispute is settled, the \ndefendant must pay the settlement in 30 days unless other arrangements \nare agreed to.\n  Sixth, the bill provides that if a contract specifically limits \nliability for actions that would include a Y2K action, no recovery is \navailable beyond the contract terms. Recovery, however, is available if \nthe contract does not mention liability limitations. Recovery is also \navailable for any contract entered into without a true ``meeting of the \nminds.'' This would include contracts, for instance, between large \ncompanies and ordinary consumers. Even if the terms of use within a \nproduct box state a limit on liability, courts can award Y2K damages.\n  The bill also sets minimum injury requirements for class action \nlawsuits to prevent attorneys from gathering large numbers of \nplaintiffs that have not really even been harmed by a given Y2K defect.\n  Additionally, the bill requires that all potential class members be \nnotified of a Y2K class action by U.S. mail, return receipt requested. \nThat notice must include information about the nature of the action, \nthe jurisdiction, claims that are not being pursued, and the \narrangement for attorneys fees.\n  Ninth, the bill provides federal courts with jurisdiction over Y2K \nlawsuits so long as any member of the class is a citizen of a State \ndifferent from the defendant (or is a citizen of a foreign country). \nCurrent law states that if any class representative of the class action \nis a citizen of the State in which the business is located, the federal \ncourts have no diversity jurisdiction. This makes it easy for the \nattorneys filing a class action to have it heard in state court.\n  However, the bill does allow a federal court to abstain from exerting \njurisdiction in cases where most class members are in the same State as \nthe defendant and the case will be governed primarily by that State's \nlaw, or if the class is small or the amount in controversy is less than \n$1 million.\n  In summary, it is clear that there are consumers and businesses that \nhave been and will be harmed by Y2K defects. For these companies and \nindividuals impacted by Y2K problems, the Hatch-Feinstein bill \npreserves the right to sue and to recover damages, and actually \nincreases their chances of finding a quick solution to their problems.\n  But the bill also prevents the kind of litigation nightmares that \nwould distract from Y2K solutions and drain resources from already \nburdened companies throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, we believe that this bill represents a fair and \nreasoned approach to what is surely a real problem. But as I have said, \nthis bill also represents a starting point, not an ending point. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ncontinue developing a fair bill that can pass in the near future. We \nmust give businesses the reasonable protections they require to solve \nY2K problems efficiently, quickly and without unnecessary distractions. \nI thank Senator Hatch for working with me on this issue, I urge my \ncolleagues to contact us and to work towards a bipartisan, reasonable \nsolution to this problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 462. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Social \nSecurity Act, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the Federal-State Extended \nUnemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to improve the method by which \nFederal unemployment taxes are collected and to improve the method by \nwhich funds are provided from Federal unemployment tax revenue for \nemployment security administration, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE EMPLOYMENT SECURITY FINANCING ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenators Cochran and Voinovich, to introduce the ``Employment Security \nFinancing Act of 1999.''\n  As you may know, our nation's employment security system was \nestablished as a federal-state partnership more than 60 years ago. This \nsystem has not undergone major restructuring since its inception; \nhowever, a ``temporary'' .2% surtax was enacted in the 1970's. Today, \nthis system overtaxes and overburdens employers, shortchanges states, \nand, most importantly, underserves those who need it most--the \ninvoluntarily unemployed.\n  Two separate payroll taxes fund the employment security system. The \nmost onerous and inefficient of these is the FUTA (Federal Unemployment \nTax Act) tax. FUTA is a payroll tax collected by the IRS, dedicated to \nprovide administrative funding for states through allocation from the \nDepartment of Labor (DOL). Unfortunately, FUTA taxes sent to Washington \nrarely find their way back to the states. In Fiscal Year 1997, DOL \nestimated that states sent more than $6 billion in FUTA taxes to \nWashington, but received only $3.1 billion in return.\n  Mr. President, reform of the unemployment insurance program is \nessential to a state like Ohio, which receives less than 39 cents of \neach employer FUTA dollar. This shortfall in funding has led to the \nclosing of 22 local employment service offices during the last four \nyears. In order to make up for\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nthe shortfall of FUTA dollars, the Ohio legislature has appropriated \nmore than $50 million during the last four years to pay for the \nadministration of employment services, something that should be funded \nby FUTA taxes. This appropriation of state tax dollars forces Ohio \ntaxpayers to pay twice to fund these services.\n  Ohio is not alone. Since 1990, less than 59 cents of every FUTA \ndollar has been sent back to the states. In fact, in 1997, states \nreceived a paltry 52% return on their FUTA tax dollars. As a result, \nmany states are being forced to make up the shortfall from their own \ngeneral funds, and cut back on other services provided to the \nunemployed.\n  For businesses, the system's consequences are equally severe. \nEmployers are forced to pay two separate taxes. The current FUTA net \ntax rate is .8%, or a maximum of $56 per employee. In addition, \nemployers must pay a similar state payroll tax to finance unemployment \nbenefits. It is estimated that the nation's 6 million FUTA-paying \nemployers spend a total of $1 billion annually simply complying with \nFUTA reporting requirments.\n  Mr. President, the Employment Security Financing Act is designed to \naddress the problems the current system has imposed on the states and \nFUTA taxpayers. Specifically, it would: reduce the tax burden by \nrepealing the ``temporary'' .2% FUTA surtax; streamline filings by \ntransferring responsibility for collection of the FUTA tax from the IRS \nto the states; improve administration by ensuring that states get a \ngreater return on their employers' FUTA tax dollars; improve services \nwith an emphasis on reemployment; and combat fraud and abuse.\n  This is an important issue that Congress needs to consider. I look \nforward to working with others on legislation that can meet the budget \nrules, yet still achieve necessary reform of the unemployment insurance \nprogram.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the National \nFederation of Independent Business, and Strategic Services on \nUnemployment & Workers' Compensation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         Strategic Services on Unemployment & Workers' \n           Compensation,\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the business community, \n     UWC enthusiastically endorses your proposal, the Employment \n     Security Financing Reform Act, which will save employers $4 \n     billion in unemployment tax and claim costs each year and \n     provide a permanent fix for the chronic under-funding of \n     state unemployment insurance (UI) and employment service \n     agencies. UWC is the only national association specializing \n     exclusively in unemployment and workers' compensation issues \n     on behalf of business. Our members include large and small \n     employers and national and state business organizations \n     around the country. Enactment of your proposal is a top \n     priority for UWC.\n       Only 50 cents out of each dollar now collected from \n     employers under the Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) is used \n     as intended for administering the state UI program. The \n     balance of FUTA revenue is effectively diverted to other \n     programs, disguising the true deficit in federal general \n     revenues and accumulating IOU's in a sham Unemployment \n     ``Trust Fund'' whose apparent buildup will later be used to \n     justify higher unemployment benefits--all at employer \n     expense. This charade would end under your proposal, which is \n     a win/win/win for workers, business, and government. It will \n     save money for employers and make government more efficient \n     and responsive to local needs and conditions. The proposal \n     achieves these results by reducing the FUTA rate and allowing \n     states to fund their agencies at a level closer to the amount \n     actually needed to administer unemployment benefits and help \n     match jobless workers with employers eager to fill widespread \n     job vacancies. It cuts paperwork for employers by eliminating \n     the separate FUTA tax forms; gives each state rather than \n     Washington responsibility to determine how much it needs to \n     administer its unemployment and employment services agencies; \n     and puts 100% of FUTA funds to work reducing state \n     unemployment taxes on business.\n       As a business organization, UWC supports adequate but not \n     excessive FUTA taxes. It is inexcusable that the federal \n     government collects more under FUTA than is needed for sound \n     UI administration and yet under-finances the agencies which \n     are responsible for efforts to move UI claimants off the \n     unemployment rolls and match workers with jobs. This under-\n     funding directly inflates the cost of state unemployment \n     benefits, which are financed through business payroll taxes \n     at the state level. It has also caused the states to impose \n     $200 million in additional state taxes to make up for the \n     shortfall in FUTA funds doled out by the federal government. \n     It's long past time to fix this problem, and we heartily \n     applaud your leadership in seeking permanent FUTA reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Eric J. Oxfeld,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n                                      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the 600,000 small \n     business owners of the National Federation of Independent \n     Business (NFIB), I want to commend you for introducing ``The \n     Employment Security Financing Act of 1999.'' One of our top \n     legislative priorities this year is to encourage Congress to \n     cut payroll taxes and return the unemployment system to the \n     states. Your legislation will ease the burden of unemployment \n     taxes on small business and overhaul an inefficient and \n     duplicative system.\n       Small businesses tend to be labor intensive, so they are \n     disproportionately affected by taxes on labor. And unlike \n     income taxes, payroll taxes must be paid whether a business \n     makes a profit or loss. Most of our members survive on a thin \n     margin of positive cash flow. Payroll taxes make that margin \n     even thinner.\n       Importantly, your legislation takes steps to begin reducing \n     the burden of one payroll tax--the Federal Unemployment Tax \n     Act (FUTA). Specifically, it repeals the ``temporary'' FUTA \n     surtax put in place in 1976 in order to repay loans from the \n     federal unemployment trust fund. Even though this money was \n     fully repaid in 1987, Congress has extended this temporary \n     tax four times, imposing an annual $1.4 billion tax burden on \n     America's employers and employees. Repeal of the surtax is \n     long overdue.\n       As this legislation progresses through Congress, we hope \n     that you will look for opportunities to further reduce FUTA \n     taxes. Even with the elimination of the surtax, FUTA taxes \n     collect far more than is needed for the program. In FY 1997, \n     the Department of Labor estimates that states received only \n     $3.1 billion of the $6 billion in FUTA taxes sent to \n     Washington. Permanent FUTA taxes should be cut to reflect the \n     lower costs of the program.\n       Finally, we support language in your legislation that \n     transfers responsibility for collecting the FUTA tax from the \n     IRS to the states. This will provide a much needed paperwork \n     reduction boost for small business owners who currently have \n     to fill our separate state and federal unemployment tax \n     forms.\n       We thank you for introducing this important legislation and \n     look forward to working with you in the coming months to \n     enact it into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n                            Vice President, Federal Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 465. A bill to meet the mental health substance abuse treatment \nneeds of incarcerated children and youth; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the mental health juvenile justice act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nthat outlines a comprehensive strategy for providing federal assistance \nto states and localities, to better serve children in need of mental \nhealth services who come in contact with our nation's juvenile justice \nsystem. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy and Landrieu in \nthis effort. The bill has received the strong support of over forty \norganizations including the American Bar Association, the American \nPsychiatric Association, the Children's Defense Fund, the United Church \nof Christ, and form states judges, probation and police officers.\n  Elie Wiesel once said: ``More than anything--more than hatred and \ntorture--more than pain--do I fear indifference.'' We must be vigilant \nnot to allow ourselves and our country to be indifferent to children's \nmisery, particularly those children who may be sick, difficult, and \ntest our patience, understanding, and compassion.\n  Yet, today, throughout America, I fear that we have become deeply \nindifferent to how we treat juveniles in the justice system who live in \nthe shadow of mental illness.\n  Each year, more than one million youth come in contact with the \njuvenile justice system, and more than 100,000 of these youth are \ndetained in some type of jail or prison. These children are \noverwhelmingly poor and a disproportionate number of children of color.\n  By the time many of these children are arrested and incarcerated, \nthey have a long history of problems in their short lives. As many as \ntwo-thirds suffer from a mental or emotional disturbance. One in have \nhas a\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nserious disorder. Many have substance abuse problems and learning \ndisabilities. Most come from troubled homes.\n  The `crimes' of these children vary. While some have committed \nviolent crimes, some have committed petty theft or skipped school. \nStill others have simply run away from home to escape physical or \nsexual abuse from parents or other adults.\n  Despite popular opinion, most of the children who are locked up are \nnot violent. Justice Department studies show that only one in twenty \nyouth in the juvenile system have committed violent offenses.\n  Jails and juvenile detention centers often find themselves unprepared \nto deal with the mentally ill. For instance, medication may not be \ngiven or properly monitored. Or, guards may not know, for example, how \nto respond to disturbed youth who simply is not capable of standing in \nan orderly line for meals. A common result is that these kids are \ndisciplined and put in solitary confinement.\n  What is happening to these troubled children is national tragedy. \nAcross the country, we are dumping emotionally disturbed kids into \njuvenile prisons.\n  Why do so many youth with mental illness end up in the justice \nsystem? Children with mental disorders often behave in ways that bring \nthem into conflict with family members, authority figures, and peers. \nOver the last ten years, the public attitude toward juvenile crime has \ngrown toughter. Consequently, the juvenile justice system is casting a \nwilder net. A growing fear and intolerance of children who misbehave or \ncommit nonviolent offenses have pushed children into the juvenile \nsystem who would not have ended up there in earlier times.\n  At the same time, our country has failed to invest adequately in \nservices and programs that could reduce the need for incarceration. \nThese include mental health services. The warning signs for delinquency \nare well known--school failure, drug and alcohol abuse, family violence \nand abuse, and poverty. Yet, we have failed to put in place community \nprevention, screening, and early intervention services for those \nchildren most at risk. Proper mental health treatment can prevent or \nreduce offending. But many communities don't have adequate treatment \nservices for children and their families.\n  For example, a recent report by Louisiana state officials \nacknowledged that secure facilities held many children who had been \n``discarded'' from the educational, child welfare and other systems of \ncare. I have heard that social workers in a number of states have been \neven instructed desperate parents to have their children arrested in \norder to get services because community health services are so scarce.\n  Last July, I went with the National Mental Health Association to the \nTallulah Correctional Center for Youth, a privately-owned correctional \nfacility for over 600 youth in northeast Louisiana, to see firsthand \nthe shocking civil rights violations cited by the U.S. Department of \nJustice. I left with vivid and disturbing images of how we are dealing \nwith youth with mental and emotional problems in this country.\n\n  While in Tallulah, I saw one hallucinating and suicidal child in \nisolation for observation, yet his transfer to an appropriate mental \nhealth facility was uncertain. Another child I met was taking three \ndifferent types of powerful psychiatric medications, but had only seen \na psychiatrist twice in the last eight months. The Justice Department \nreports chronicled instances where boys were being repeatedly sexually \nand physically abused, and children with mental illnesses were being \nhoused with youths who have committed violent crimes. Mentally ill \nchildren received no therapy, and when they were having symptoms, they \nwere isolated or punished for their illness.\n  Tallulah is not the only offending facility, however. The Justice \nDepartment has exposed gross abuses in Georgia, Kentucky, and other \njuvenile facilities in Louisiana. Other states are also experiencing \nsimilar problems. Investigators found extreme cases of physical abuse \nand neglect of mental health needs, including unwarranted and prolonged \nisolation of suicidal children, hog-tie and chemical restraints used on \nyouth with serious emotional disturbances, forced medication and even \ndenial of medication. Children with extensive psychiatric histories who \nare prone to self-mutilation (e.g., cutting themselves with glass) \nnever even saw a psychiatrist.\n  In some cases, abusive treatment of these children results directly \nfrom their being emotionally disturbed. Staff in juvenile facilities \nfail to recognize, and in fact punish them for, the symptom of their \ndisorders. Children have been punished for requesting treatment or put \nin isolation when they refused to accept treatment. One child in a boot \ncamp was punished for making involuntary noises that were symptoms of \nhis Tourette's syndrome. Mental disorders are being handled almost \nsolely through discipline, isolation, and restraints according to \ninvestigations by the US Justice Department and human rights groups.\n  A recent survey by the California Youth Authority found that 35 \npercent of boys in its custody and 73 percent of girls need treatment. \nOne reason for the higher percentage of young people with mental \nillness in jail, specialists say, is that many states have cut budgets \nfor adolescent psychiatric care, even more than those for adults.\n\n  If a child had a broken leg, would any institution leave that leg \nunattended? Why then, in America, are we dumping children with mental \nhealth problems in institutions without treatment, and under conditions \nwhich can only worsen their illnesses?\n  Our current system fails mentally ill children. How? The screening \nand treatment of mental and emotional disorders are inadequate or \nnonexistent at correctional facilities. Mental illness is often \naddressed solely through discipline, isolation, and restraint. At \nTallulah, children told us that they were beaten and were put in \nisolation for long periods, even months--echoing in painful detail what \nhad been revealed in the Justice Department reports.\n  The tragedy of this situation is that we know what works--treatment--\nbut our current system for children with mental illness favors \npunishment over treatment. For children, we know that family-focused, \nindividualized treatment delivered in the child's community can improve \nchildren's mental health and prevent them from offending in the first \nplace. It is proven that integrating these mental health and substance \nabuse services with schools and child welfare agencies produces even \ngreater success. In fact, linked community services have been shown to \nreduce contact with the juvenile justice system by 46 percent.\n  My legislation would help states provide critical assistance to these \nchildren who suffer from mental disorders. It focuses on providing \nappropriate services that can both prevent them from committing \ndelinquent offenses and from reoffending, and it is structured so that \nservices are planned and integrated at the local level.\n  First, it provides funds to train juvenile justice personnel on the \nidentification and appropriate treatment of mental illness in kids, and \non the use of community-based alternatives to incarceration. Currently, \njuvenile justice system personnel lack routine training to deal with \nmentally ill youth, many of whose low risk factors make them good \ncandidates for alternative treatment programs in the community.\n  Second, it authorizes a new treatment and diversion block grant \nprogram to state and localities. Despite studies showing large numbers \nof incarcerated children having psychiatric disorders, we know that \nscreening, assessment and treatment for children's mental disorders is \ngrossly inadequate. Further, many of these kids have multiple problems \nbefore they are locked-up, and are involved with several different \nchild agencies and systems. Typically, these agencies shift the care \nand costs for serving a child back and forth. The result is that the \nchild and the family never receive the services they need. States will \nbe able to access the new block grant funds to develop and implement \nintegrated treatment and diversion programs for juveniles who come up \nagainst the police and the courts.\n\n  Third, it will establish training and technical assistance centers. \nNow, States do not have the information and technical assistance they \nneed to provide appropriate services for youth with mental health \ndisorders. Further,\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nit will establish a federal council which will report to Congress on \nrecommendations to improve the treatment of mentally ill children who \ncome into contact with the justice system.\n  Next, it will give States the choice whether to use their federal \nprison construction funds for treatment of incarcerated mentally ill \nand children.\n  Finally, if will amend the Prison Litigation Reform Act, by restoring \nto federal courts the authority to remedy abuse conditions in juvenile \njustice facilities. Congress passed the act in 1996 largely to reduce \nfrivolous pro se lawsuits by prisoners, and nothing in my bill would \naffect those provisions of the PLRA. Yet, the PLRA has had a \ndevastating effect on the conditions in which juvenile offenders and \nmentally ill prisoners are held. My provision would not repeal the PLRA \nor adversely effect the crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. Instead, it \nwould carve out a narrow exception to the PLRA restrictions in limited \ncircumstances, involving children and the mentally ill, for it has been \nshown again and again that they are particularly vulnerable to abuse \nand neglect in state institutions.\n  We can no longer be indifferent to this national tragedy. What I saw \nin Tallulah, and what is happening in countless facilities across this \ncountry, is a disgrace. The wholesale neglect of juveniles with mental \nillness in our prisons must end. We as a society have the moral \nobligation to see they get the help they need. Treating young people \nwith mental disorders in dehumanizing ways is not the answer to \nquestions of crime prevention and public safety. And it's not the way \nto make children productive, law abiding, and caring citizens. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EDGAR NOLLNER\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMr. Edgar Nollner Sr., a distinguished Alaskan and notable American \nhero who passed away recently at his home in Galena, Alaska at the age \nof 94.\n  While Edgar Nollner is not a household name, many Americans may \nrecall his heroic story of courage, teamwork and selflessness.\n  In the winter of 1925, the Gold Rush town of Nome, Alaska was in the \nmidst of a deadly diphtheria epidemic. Several cases of the contagious, \nbacterial disease had struck the small predominately Native population, \nsome 1,400 of the towns residents.\n  On January 21, an emergency Morse code message was transmitted from \nNome pleading for a supply of diphtheria antitoxin serum. Twenty pounds \nof serum was found at an Anchorage hospital, but territorial governor \nScot Bone would not risk flying the precious viles of serum from \nAnchorage to Fairbanks due to hazardous weather conditions. In fact, it \nis noted that the governor said he was willing to let the pilots risk \ntheir lives, but he would not risk the serum. Officials then determined \nthat the serum would be shipped to Nenana via railroad; the serum \narrived in the interior Alaska town six days after the initial plea was \nsent. It was from Nenana that the infamous 674 mile Serum Run Relay \nbegan, a race not for glory or riches, but a race to save the residents \nof Nome.\n  Nome typically received most of its winter supplies by dog sled with \ndeliveries taking a single musher 15 to 20 days to make a trip. Instead \nof a solo run, 20 dog-sled mushers, including Edgar Nollner, prepared \nto tackle the 70 degree below zero temperatures, frozen tundra and \ngale-force winds blowing up to 75 miles and hour. The mushers and dog \nteams were thus divided into shorter sprint segments to quicken the \ntrip.\n  Edgar Nollner was scheduled to run the 10th leg of the relay, 42 \nmiles, but his younger brother, George, begged him to let him drive the \nlast 18 miles of his leg. Edgar ran at night, covering the 24 miles \nfrom Whiskey Point to Galena in 3 hours. He reported that winds were so \nfierce, causing so much blowing snow, that he could not see his dogs\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nor anything around him. His lead sled dog and trusted friend, Dixie, \nknew the trail and never faltered.\n  The frozen serum arrived safely in Nome on February 2, 1925, in a \nmere 5 days and 7 hours; the epidemic was soon over. The brave men and \nscores of dogs were all hailed heroes. But for all the acclaim it \nreceived, the serum run marked the end of an era. With the increase of \nbetter airplanes, better schedules, and the insurgence of snow \nmachines, the need for dog sleds was no longer essential. If the fear \nof diphtheria now seems antiquated, it is only because the Serum Run \nbrought an end to the disease as a serious health threat in the United \nStates.\n  Edgar Nollner was just 20 years old when he left his trapper and \nfisherman lifestyle to selflessly join the others on the Serun Run. He \nwas the son of a Missouri man who came to Alaska for the 1890's Gold \nRush, and an Athabaskan mother, who made their home along the Yukon \nRiver in Galena. As the last surviving member of the serum-run relay \nmushers who risked their lives so that others may live, Edgar Nollner \nwas truly a twentieth century hero.\n  The townspeople in Galena are mourning Edgar's passing but his legacy \nremains. Records show that Mr. Nollner married twice, fathered 24 \nchildren and has more than 200 grandchildren and great grandchildren. \nMr. President, I believe there can be no greater gift.\n  To honor these brave men, the famous Serum Run Relay was reenacted in \n1973, in an event know known as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The \nmodern-day Iditarod covers more than 1,000 miles of frozen tundra from \nAnchorage to Nome and is now run annually in March.\n  Edgar Nollner was both a hero and legend. I salute this rugged \nAlaskan who risked his life so that others could live--he epitomizes \nthe true spirit of all Alaskans. His spirit, along with the 19 other \nbrave Serum Run mushers will continue to run strong in every Iditarod. \nThe final chapter of this dramatic saga is closed, but not \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1960-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROHIBITION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ``KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER'' \n                              REGULATIONS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks in \nsupport of Senator Allard's bill that would prohibit the implementation \nof the ``Know Your Customer'' (KYC) regulations by the four federal \nbanking agencies (Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Office of \nThrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation). As a cosponsor of this legislation, I am \nconcerned that this proposal would bring a regulatory imbalance to \nbanks and their competitors, increase regulatory burdens on the banking \nindustry and potentially violate the privacy of consumers. Once again \nthe federal government has prescribed regulations that are costly to \nbusinesses and intrusive to citizens.\n  These regulations would put the banking industry at a disadvantage \nwith their nonbank financial service competitors because many of them \nare not required to develop and maintain ``Know Your Customer'' \nprograms under the proposal. Many bank customers would correctly view \nthis as an intrusion of their privacy and might elect to conduct their \nbanking business at other financial institutions.\n  Current criminal reporting requirements already mandate that \nfinancial institutions report violations of federal law to the Treasury \nDepartment after uncovering potential money laundering, insider abuse, \nor any violation of federal law. Ironically, under the proposed \nregulations by the federal banking agencies, a financial institution \nwould not be required to report a violation after it has occurred. The \nproposed regulations create more burdensome and invasive regulations by \nrequiring banks to investigate all customers activity to see if any \nviolation of federal law has taken place, not just those suspected of \ncriminal activity. This could be time consuming and extremely costly \nfor banks.\n  The proposed regulations have generated many concerns from both \nconsumers and the banking industry. A proposal that requires bankers to \nanalyze all customer transactions would violate the public's trust and \nconfidence in the banking industry. The financial service sector has \nbeen very effective in reporting possible violations of the law, while \nat the same time protecting customer information. The proposed \nregulations do little to increase the ability to curtail illegal \nactivity and would severely harm America's financial institutions and \nthe customers they serve. I encourage the four federal banking agencies \nto reconsider their proposed regulations and withdraw them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1961-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ELECTRIC UTILITY RESTRUCTURING\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, last year, Senator Gorton and I \nintroduced a bill that addressed a growing problem faced by local \ngovernments in the new era of state electric utility restructuring. \nThat bill had the bipartisan co-sponsorship of almost a dozen Senators.\n  On February 6, we reintroduced this legislation as the Bond Fairness \nand Protection Act. This bill will ensure Nebraskans continue to \nbenefit from the publicly-owned power they currently receive. Nebraska \nhas 154 not-for-profit community-based public power systems. It is the \nonly state which relies entirely on public power for electricity. This \nsystem has served my state well as Nebraskans enjoy some of the lowest \nrates in the nation.\n  Approximately 18 states have already moved toward permitting new \ncompetition in the electric industry. However, the federal tax rules \ngoverning municipal bond financing did not anticipate the new era of \nelectric utility restructuring when they were crafted more than a \ndecade ago. If Congress does not act, public power systems that open \ntheir transmission lines to privately owned utilities can jeopardize \nthe status of their outstanding tax-exempt bonds. The legislation my \ncolleagues and I introduced is an equitable solution to the problem.\n  Under this legislation, local governments determine how their future \nmunicipal power debt will be treated. According to the US Department of \nEnergy, my own state had over $2.2 billion in outstanding municipal \npower bond debt in 1996. Our bill protects local governments that \nissued public power bond debt in the past, yet gives them the \nflexibility to issue new, but fully taxable debt if they choose to \nbuild any new power generation facilities in the future.\n  Specifically, our legislation provides them with an option: they may \neither choose to operate under current, so called ``private use'' rules \nin our tax code. Or if they prefer, they can choose to make a one-time \nirrevocable election that will allow them to build new power generation \nfacilities if they want, but only using fully taxable bonds instead of \ntax-exempt financing.\n  It is important we recognize and respect local governments may face \nunique situations in public power financing issues as the electricity \nmarket changes, and we give them reasonable and fair choices.\n  Congress may or may not choose to move forward this year on the \nlarger and more complex issues involved in restructuring the \nelectricity marketplace. But I feel we must act to solve this special \nproblem this year. Our local governments should not face unfair \nretroactive bond taxation triggered by old federal tax rules in \nconflict with the new state-mandated laws or regulations.\n  This legislation weighs the interests of local governments, \nbondholders, consumers, and public and private utilities. It will \nenable Nebraska public power systems to make decisions in the best \ninterests of their consumers and protect the reliable, affordable \nelectric service that Nebraska currently enjoys.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1961-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1961-S1962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE'S CHAMIQUE HOLDSCLAW\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \nrecognize an outstanding University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers \nbasketball player, senior Chamique Holdsclaw.\n  Last week, Chamique Holdsclaw was recognized as the outstanding \namateur athlete in the nation when she was awarded the 1998 James E. \nSullivan Memorial Award. Chamique is the first female basketball \nplayer--and only the\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nthird basketball player, male or female--to win the award in its 69-\nyear history.\n  It comes as no surprise to those of us from Tennessee that Chamique, \nthe second University of Tennessee athlete in two years to take the \nhonor, follows former Volunteer quarterback Peyton Manning. Other \nwinners of this prestigious award include Bill Walton, Bill Bradley, \nBonnie Blair, Florence Griffith-Joyner and Bruce Jenner.\n  Mr. President, Chamique Holdsclaw is one of the finest college \nbasketball players in America, who time after time has displayed grace \nunder pressure, sinking last-minute, game-winning shots. She has led \nboth her high school and college teams to national basketball \nchampionships. And of course we all remember last year when she led the \nLady Volunteers to a 39-0 record and a third straight national title. \nChamique has Tennessee on track for a fourth straight title this \nseason.\n  To measure the impact this Tennessee senior has had on women's sports \nover the past four years, you did not have to look any farther than \nacross from the Lady Vols bench last week, where former Sullivan winner \nJackie Joyner-Kersee sat. After meeting Chamique at an awards ceremony \ntwo weeks ago, Joyner-Kersee was so impressed that she flew in from St. \nLouis for Chamique's final regular-season home game, in which she \nscored 25 points and pulled down 11 rebounds.\n  Regardless of what greatness Chamique Holdsclaw achieves in her pro \ncareer, her time at Tennessee has clearly changed the game. Though \nplenty of women's college basketball legends came before her, Chamique \nbecame her sport's first national superstar. She took hold of that \nspotlight, thrived under the pressure it brought with it, and made \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, the Sullivan Award recognizes athletes who have \nexcelled in competition while exhibiting leadership, character and \nsportsmanship. Chamique Holdsclaw embodies each of these qualities and \nis the kind of person we should encourage all our young people to \nemulate. Her determination and dedication to excellence remind us that \nwe each have the power to make a positive difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1961-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO JOUSHUA HEWITT AND DANA WALSH\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity today to recognize two young students from my state who \nhave achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in \ntheir communities. Joushua Hewitt of Perry, NY, and Dana Walsh of \nOceanside, NY, have been named State Honorees in the 1999 Prudential \nSpirit of Community Awards program. Each year this program honors \nstudents who have demonstrated outstanding community service.\n  These two fine students have given back to their communities in many \nways. Mr. Hewitt is being recognized for his efforts in staging a \nsimulated traffic accident to graphically demonstrate the horrors of \ndrunk driving to his classmates. Ms. Walsh is being recognized for \ncoordinating a fund-raising drive at her school, which raised $3,000 \nfor the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. These two students are excellent \nexamples of young adults who are working hard to make their communities \nbetter and they deserve to be honored.\n  Mr. Hewitt and Ms. Walsh should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from a group of dedicated volunteers from across the \ncountry. As part of their recognition, they will come here to the \nCapitol in May for several days of special events, including a \nCongressional breakfast reception. While in Washington, 10 of the 1999 \nSpirit of Community honorees will be selected as America's top youth \nvolunteers. I commend all of those who have been nominated.\n  It is my honor to congratulate these young people who have \ndemonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly \nextraordinary in today's world. They deserve our sincere admiration and \nrespect. Their actions show that young Americans can--and do--play \nimportant roles in their communities, and that America's community \nspirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1962-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask that a statement I submitted to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on the \ncommittee's markup of S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act \nof 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, improving our nation's schools is clearly a \n     crucial task and one deserving of the committee's time and \n     attention. However, I regret that the committee has chosen to \n     proceed with the consideration of Senator Frist's Ed Flex \n     bill today, just a scant hour after two of this century's \n     most important Senate votes.\n       The Senate is currently engaged in the conduct of our most \n     serious constitutional duty--the impeachment trial of the \n     President. Rightfully, this undertaking has engaged all of \n     our time and energy. Beyond our required attendance on the \n     Senate floor, we have also each been engaged in party \n     conferences, smaller group discussions with our colleagues \n     and other meetings crucial to the Senate's consideration. \n     Today, in particular, was a crucial moment in this \n     proceeding, with two historic votes on continuing the trial. \n     These votes necessitated further discussions and meetings in \n     search of a consensus on how to proceed.\n       And yet, in the midst of this turmoil, the committee chose \n     to go forward with this mark up. I believe this step was both \n     inappropriate and unwise. Education and the other issues \n     before our committee are too important to move forward \n     without our full attention and involvement. We need the \n     opportunity to thoughtfully examine Ed Flex and other \n     proposals, consider changes and discuss these issues with \n     each other and our staffs. Without this level of involvement, \n     the chances for moving strong, bipartisan legislation with \n     any hope of passage diminish significantly.\n       I recognize that putting these matters aside until the \n     impeachment trial is a settled matter is particularly \n     difficult when discussing education. We all care a great deal \n     about education and improving our schools. And we all know, \n     contrary to what we have all been doing since we got here in \n     January, education is the work we were sent here to do by our \n     constituents.\n       In addition, the measure before the committee today, the \n     Education Flexibility Partnership bill, is one that we all \n     spent a great deal of time on last year. I personally offered \n     three amendments and worked cooperatively and extensively \n     with Senator Frist to improve the underlying language of the \n     bill throughout the committee's consideration. Ultimately, I \n     voted for the bill, but had significant reservations, which I \n     expressed in my additional views to the committee report.\n       Unfortunately, nothing in these intervening months has \n     happened to allay my concerns. We have had no hearing on this \n     demonstration program or this bill. There continues to be \n     basically no data on gains in student achievement--the \n     central goal of the Ed Flex program. We continue to consider \n     this legislation outside of the context of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act, where it rightly belongs. We have \n     had two GAO reports raising fundamental issues about the Ed \n     Flex program. We have yet to consider other significant \n     proposals for reform in our schools. And, yet, in moving \n     forward today, the committee is clearly intent on proceeding \n     without addressing or considering these concerns.\n       Mr. Chairman. I remain convinced that you and Senator Frist \n     are committed to working in a bipartisan fashion on this bill \n     and in developing strong education policy generally. It is \n     clear this is only path by which we can get things done. But \n     bipartisanship is hard work that demands substantive \n     engagement by members. In my view, there was clearly not the \n     time or opportunity to do so, today, with the Senate so \n     rightfully occupied with impeachment.\n       I look forward to the days, hopefully in the near future, \n     where we can turn our full attention to this bill and our \n     committee's full agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1962-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1962-S1966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n Mr. HELMS.

A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the Chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the Committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            rule 8--reports\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the Chief Clerk of the \n     Committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the \n     same day that the Committee has ordered a measure or \n     matter reported. Such views shall then be included in the \n     Committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part \n     thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover \n     of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the \n     Committee report may be filed and printed immediately \n     without such laws.\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the Committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the Committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the Committee.\n\n\n                            RULE 9--TREATIES\n\n       (a) The Committee is the only Committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent. \n     Because the House of Representatives has no role in the \n     approval of treaties, the Committee is therefore the only \n     congressional committee with responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the Committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the Committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the Committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the Committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except as extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          RULE 10--NOMINATIONS\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 6 \n     calendar days after it has been formally submitted to the \n     Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the Committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the Committee decrees \n     otherwise.\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) in appropriate cases, the \n     nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a \n     confidential statement with the Committee; (3) the Committee \n     has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests \n     which could conflict with the interests of the government in \n     the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) \n     for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-\n     large, or minister, the Committee has received a complete \n     list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of \n     his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during \n     the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding \n     years; and (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, \n     a report on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            RULE 11--TRAVEL\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on Committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the Chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the Ranking Minority \n     Member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state \n     the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and \n     financial report shall be filed with the Committee within 30 \n     days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the \n     Committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without the \n     express authorization of the Committee. Except in \n     extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be \n     approved unless the reporting requirements have been \n     fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is \n     strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government \n     sources is subject to the same approval and substantive \n     reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In \n     addition, members and staff are reminded of Senate Rule \n     XXXV.4 requiring a determination by the Senate Ethics \n     Committee in the case of foreign-sponsored travel. Any \n     proposed travel by Committee staff for a subcommittee purpose \n     must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking \n     minority member prior to submission of the request to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full Committee. \n     When the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member approve the \n     foreign travel of a member of the staff of the committee not \n     accompanying a member of the Committee, all members of the \n     Committee shall be advised, prior to the commencement of such \n     travel of its extent, nature, and purpose.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the Committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the Staff Director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\n     of a member of the Committee may travel with that member with \n     the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member \n     of the Committee. During such travel, the personal staff \n     member shall be considered to be an employee of the \n     Committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of Rule 11 as regards staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of \n     this section, each Member of the Committee may designate \n     one personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative \n     of the Member.''\n\n\n                          RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all Committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the Committee, unless a majority of the Committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the Committee \n     shall be published unless the Chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the Ranking Minority Member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The Chief Clerk of the Committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (3) Classified or restricted transcripts shall be kept in \n     locked combination safes in the Committee offices except when \n     in active use by authorized persons for a period not to \n     exceed 2 weeks. Extensions of this period may be granted as \n     necessary by the Chief Clerk. They must never be left \n     unattended and shall be returned to the Chief Clerk promptly \n     when no longer needed.\n       (4) Except as provided in paragraph 7 below, transcripts \n     classified secret or higher may not leave the Committee \n     offices except for the purpose of declassification.\n       (5) Classified transcripts other than those classified \n     secret or higher may leave the Committee offices in the \n     possession of authorized persons with the approval of the \n     Chairman. Delivery and return shall be made only by \n     authorized persons. Such transcripts may not leave \n     Washington, DC, unless adequate assurances for their security \n     are made to the Chairman.\n       (6) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (7) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     Chairman with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, \n     only the following persons are authorized to have access to \n     classified or restricted transcripts.\n       (i) Members and staff of the Committee in the Committee \n     rooms;\n       (ii) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     Committee, and of the Majority and Minority Leaders, with \n     appropriate security clerances, in the Committee's Capitol \n     office;\n       (iii) Senators not members of the Committee, by permission \n     of the Chairman in the Committee rooms; and\n       (iv) Members of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the Committee's Capitol office, or, with the \n     permission of the Chairman, in the offices of the officials \n     who took part in the meeting, but in either case, only for a \n     specified and limited period of time, and only after reliable \n     assurances against further reproduction or dissemination have \n     been given.\n       (8) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the Committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the Chairman and \n     notice to the other members of the Committee. Each transcript \n     of a closed session of the Committee shall include on its \n     cover a description of the restrictions imposed upon access, \n     as well as any applicable restrictions upon photocopying, \n     note-taking or other dissemination.\n       (9) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a Committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the Committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, or \n     in the case of staff, by the Staff Director or Minority Staff \n     Director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All restricted transcripts and classified Committee \n     reports shall be declassified on a date twelve years after \n     their origination unless the Committee by majority vote \n     decides against such declassification, and provided that the \n     executive departments involved and all former Committee \n     members who participated directly in the sessions or reports \n     concerned have been consulted in advance and given a \n     reasonable opportunity to raise objections to such \n     declassification.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified Committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified fewer than twelve years \n     after their origination if:\n       (i) the Chairman originates such action or receives a \n     written request for such action, and notifies the other \n     members of the Committee;\n       (ii) the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and each member \n     of former member who participated directly in such meeting or \n     report give their approval, except that the Committee by \n     majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to \n     early declassification; and\n       (iii) the executive departments and all former Committee \n     members are consulted in advance and have a reasonable \n     opportunity to object to early declassification.\n\n\n                      RULE 13--CLASSIFIED MATERIAL\n\n       (a) All classified material received or originated by the \n     Committee shall be logged in at the Committee's offices in \n     the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and except for material \n     classified as ``Top Secret'' shall be filed in the Dirksen \n     Senate Building offices for Committee use and safekeeping.\n       (b) Each such piece of classified material received or \n     originated shall be card indexed and serially numbered, and \n     where requiring onward distribution shall be distributed by \n     means of an attached indexed form approved by the Chairman. \n     If such material is to be distributed outside the Committee \n     offices, it shall, in addition to the attached form, be \n     accompanied also by an approved signature sheet to show \n     onward receipt.\n       (c) Distribution of classified material among offices shall \n     be by Committee members or authorized staff only. All \n     classified material sent to members' offices, and that \n     distributed within the working offices of the Committee, \n     shall be returned to the offices designated by the Chief \n     Clerk. No classified material is to be removed from the \n     offices of the members or of the Committee without permission \n     of the Chairman. Such classified material will be afforded \n     safe handling and safe storage at all times.\n       (d) Material classified ``Top Secret,'' after being indexed \n     and numbered shall be sent to the Committee's Capitol office \n     for use by the members and authorized staff in that office \n     only or in such other secure Committee offices as may be \n     authorized by the Chairman or Staff Director.\n       (e) In general, members and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their Committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (f) The Staff Director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of these regulations.\n\n\n                             Rule 14--Staff\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the Committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the Chairman of the Committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the Staff Director; provided, however, \n     that such part of the staff as is designated Minority Staff, \n     shall be under the general supervision of the Ranking \n     Minority Member and under the immediate direction of the \n     Minority Staff Director.\n       (2) Any member of the Committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     Committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     Committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the Committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations.\n       In addition to carrying out assignments from the Committee \n     and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for Committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and in regard to the administration of \n     foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or \n     developments which might otherwise escape notice should be \n     called to the attention of the Committee, or of individual \n     Senators with particular interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     Committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when Committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the Committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected Members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     Committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the Committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (i) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\n       (ii) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the Staff \n     Director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     Minority Staff Director. In the case of the Staff Director \n     and the Minority Staff Director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the Chairman or the Ranking Minority \n     Member, as appropriate. In any event, such public statements \n     should avoid the expression of personal views and should not \n     contain predictions of future, or interpretations of past, \n     Committee action; and\n       (iii) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the Committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the Committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     Staff Director or Minority Staff Director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 Rule 15--Status and Amendment of Rules\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the Committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in Committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These Rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the Committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, Rules of the \n     Committee which are based upon Senate Rules may not be \n     superseded by Committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/24/senate-section/article/S1962-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since 1989 the Rules Committee has \nreported out biennial funding authorizations for committees of the \nSenate for the two funding periods beginning on March 1. This policy \nhas been strongly supported by the Senate's committee chairmen and \nranking members. Before the Senate today is a resolution which \nauthorizes committee expenditures for the remaining seven months of \nFiscal Year 1999 at the 1998 salary baseline plus the January 1999 cost \nof living adjustment (COLA) of 3.1%, as authorized by the President pro \ntempore. Committees had been previously authorized from October 1st \nthrough February 28th by S. Res. 54, in the 105th Congress.\n  This resolution follows on the heels of one that Senator Dodd, \nRanking Member of the Rules Committee, and I submitted and which was \npassed on February 12, 1999, which suspended the requirements of \nparagraph 9 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and \nauthorized a seven-year continuing resolution such as is before the \nSenate at this time.\n  As we informed committees in a joint letter on January 22, Y2K \nconcerns had prompted the Senate's recent adoption of the new Financial \nManagement Information System (FMIS). This new financial management \nsystem, which is designed to conform to the Federal Government's fiscal \nyear that runs from October 1, to September 30, requires that we \nconsider adjustments in the committee funding system. To allow all due \ndeliberation, we determined that the wisest course was to\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nauthorize the committees through the balance of this fiscal year and \nuse that time to carefully design a committee funding procedure in \nlight of the new FMIS. To that end, the Rules Committee will be \nconducting hearings and seeking the input of the various Senate \ncommittees on these questions. And, of course, we invite the committees \nto make recommendations on baseline funding, full-time employee levels \nand other concerns related to authorizing the balance of the biennium.\n  The interim funding resolution also authorizes the use of unexpended \ncommittee funds, as has been done in some form since 1989. Section 20 \nof this resolution authorizes the use of Special Reserves on a \ncommittee-by-committee basis. It also provides a mechanism to make \nunexpended funds as of the close of business on February 28, 1999, \navailable to cover non-recurring needs for committees through September \n30.\n  It should be noted that all of the unexpended funds represent \npreviously authorized funds which have not been spent. They are not new \nauthorized funds. This policy has successfully served as an incentive \nto reduce spending. Without it, the policy would effectively be to \nspend it or lose it with a predictable outcome that more money would be \nspent.\n  Mr. President, let me also add that this interim resolution does not \nincrease FTE positions and reiterate that it provides for special \nreserves funding as needed. Further, this resolution keeps the total \nauthorized amount within the appropriations previously authorized in \nthe Fiscal Year 1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill for \n``Inquiries and Investigations.''\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague, the Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, \nSenator McConnell, in introducing this resolution to provide for \nfunding for the standing committees of the Senate. This resolution \nauthorizes committee expenditures for the remaining seven months of \nFiscal Year 1999. This resolution is being enacted pursuant to S. Res. \n38, adopted on February 12, 1999.\n  Since 1989, the Committee has provided funding for the committees on \na biennial basis. This has proved to be an effective management tool \nfor assuring continuity of funding throughout a Congress. The Committee \ndoes not intend that this short-term funding resolution signal a \ndeparture from that tradition. Instead, this seven-month continuing \nresolution will allow the Rules Committee to consider the impact of \nchanges in the Senate's financial management and accounting systems, \nwhich have been necessitated by Year 2000 (Y2K) concerns, on the \ncommittee funding cycle.\n  Under normal procedures, each committee would have reported its \nbiennial funding resolution to the Senate by January 31, and the Rules \nCommittee would have then acted to report an omnibus committee biennial \nfunding resolution providing funding for the period March 1, 1999 \nthrough February 28, 2001. The Rules Committee will initiate that \nprocess in late spring, so that each committee will have the \nopportunity to present its budget to the Rules Committee for action \nprior to enactment of a funding resolution for the remainder of the \nbiennial period. During this period, the Committee will also seek input \nfrom the chairmen and ranking members of the standing committees with \nregard to changes in committee funding which may be required to conform \nto the Senate's new Y2K compliant financial system.\n  This resolution funds committees at the current baseline level, \nincreased by a 3.1% salary cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This \nresolution also authorizes the use of Special Reserves, which are the \nreprogrammed funds remaining in the appropriations account at the end \nof the committee funding cycle on February 28. These funds are made \navailable to committees to meet unforeseen, non-recurring expenses. \nThese funds are accessed by the joint request of the chairman and \nranking member of the committee, and the joint approval of the chairman \nand ranking member of the Rules Committee.\n  I commend my colleague, the Chairman, for his efforts to bring this \nresolution to the Senate floor today. By adopting this resolution, we \nare ensuring continued funding for committees while at the same time \nallowing the Rules Committee to fully review the impact on committees \nof changes in the Senate financial management and accounting system.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 49 be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
