Mr. President, I may use part of my leader time if my \ncomments go over the 5 minutes. I ask that that be recognized should it \nbe required.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that \nis critical not only for an important region of our country, the upper \nMidwest, but really the whole country. How we decide the process by \nwhich we make critical decisions about the ecological and environmental \nbalance that must be taken into account as we consider all of the \nchallenges we face with regard to proper management is really what is \nat stake here.\n  The Missouri River is one of the most important rivers of the \ncountry, but this could apply to the Mississippi River and to any one \nof a number of rivers throughout the country. Ultimately, it will be \napplied. You could say this is a very important precedent. A process \nhas been created, enacted by this Congress, that allows very careful \nconsideration of all the different factors that must be applied as we \nmake\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\ndecisions with regard to management of a river, of wetlands, of \nanything else.\n  Basically what this amendment does is simply say, let that process go \nforward, without making any conclusion about what ultimately that \nprocess will lead to. If we ultimately decide that whatever process \nproduced is wrong, we, as a Congress, have the opportunity to stop it. \nWhy would we stop it midway? Why would we say today that we don't want \nthat process to continue; we don't want it to reach its inevitable end \nwith a product that we could look at for comment? That is the first \npoint: a process is in place. The legislation currently within the \nenergy and water bill stops that in its tracks.\n\n  I don't have it in front of me, but the report language makes it very \nclear. Senator Bond and others may argue that, no, this process can \ncontinue, but the effect of this amendment stops it in its tracks. We \nwill not have an opportunity to carefully consider all of the \nrecommendations given the language that is currently incorporated in \nthe bill. We must not stop a process that allows us a result upon which \nwe will then pass judgment.\n  The Missouri River is a very critical river. It is a multifaceted \nriver that requires balance. The current management plan was written \nwhen the Presiding Officer and I, Senator Bond, and others were, at \nbest, in our teens, if not in our early years of life. It was written \nin the 1950s and adopted in about 1960. It has been the plan for 40 \nyears.\n  What the Corps of Engineers is now saying, what Fish and Wildlife is \nnow saying is that after 40 years, prior to the time the dams were \nconstructed, it is time to renew that manual; let's find another; let's \ntake another look at it to determine whether or not what worked in the \n1950s and 1960s is something that will work today. Their feeling is \nthat it will not, that we need to upgrade it; we need to refresh it; we \nneed to renew it.\n  Back when that manual was written, the anticipated amount of barge \ntraffic was about 12 million tons. We never reached 12 million tons. We \nare down to about 1.5 million tons of barge traffic, totaling about $7 \nmillion.\n  We are spending $8 million in barge subsidies to support a $7 million \nindustry. At the same time, we have an $85 million recreation industry. \nWe have an incredible $667 billion hydropower industry. We have \nindustries that are held captive, in large measure, because of a manual \nwritten in 1960 that anticipated barge traffic that never developed.\n  It is time to get real. It is time to allow the process to go \nforward. It is time to allow those agencies of the Federal Government, \nwhose responsibility it is to manage this river, to do it without \nintervention. There will be plenty of time for us to take issue, to \ndiffer, to ultimately come to some other conclusion if that happens. \nBut that is not now, especially given the recognition that the manual \nis out of date. The manual didn't produce the kind of result over four \ndecades that was anticipated. Now it is time to change. That is all we \nare asking.\n  Let the process go forward. The President has said that unless this \nchange is made, this bill will be vetoed. We are nearing the end of the \nsession. If we want to guarantee that this is going to be wrapped up in \nan omnibus bill with absolutely no real opportunity for the Senate to \nhave its voice heard, then the time to change it, so it can be signed, \nis now--not 4 weeks from now. I am very hopeful my colleagues will \nunderstand the importance of this question, the importance of this \namendment. I am hopeful that, on a bipartisan basis, we can say let us \nallow the Corps, Fish and Wildlife, and the biological experts to do \ntheir work. Then let us look at that work and make our evaluation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes and ask that I be \nadvised when that is up so I may yield to my colleagues.\n  We have had a lot of argument about whether we ought to stop the \nprocess. That is not what is at issue. What is at issue is stopping \nflooding in downstream States, such as Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, \nNebraska, and States down the Mississippi, and the implementation of a \nrisky scheme. Section 103--and I am happy to show it to my colleagues--\nsays none of the funds made available may be used to revise the manual \nto provide for an increase in the springtime water release during \nspring heavy rainfall and snowmelt in States that have rivers draining \ninto the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.\n  This same provision has been included in four previous energy and \nwater bills in the last 5 years. It has been passed by this Congress \nand signed by the President. It clearly permits a review of \nalternatives to change river management. It only prevents one, single, \nspecific harmful alternative of a controlled flood, which was proposed \nfirst in 1993, subjected to public review and comment by this Congress, \nand rejected by the administration when it was considered in 1994. The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture opposed it. The U.S. Department of \nTransportation opposed it. There was unanimous opinion on people who \nlived in and worked along the river. The officials there oppose this \nrisky scheme. Now, 5 years later, the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote a \nletter on July 12 demanding that, as an interim step, a spring pulse \ncome down the Missouri River starting in 2001.\n  This is supposed to help the habitat of the pallid sturgeon. But what \nit does is increase the spring rise, and the Missouri and Mississippi \nalready have a spring rise. We get floods and we have damage that hurts \nland and facilities and kills people.\n  The people of Los Alamos know what happens when the Federal \nGovernment gave them a controlled burn. They are still wiping soot out \nof their hair. This is a proposal to give a controlled flood to areas \nwhere there is great risk. That is why the Democratic Governor of \nMissouri, the mayor of Kansas City, both Democrats, both oppose the \nmotion to strike. They support section 103. We know it would curtail \ntransportation, the most efficient and effective and environmentally \nfriendly form of transportation of agricultural goods, and that is \nbarge traffic. It would end barge traffic on the Missouri River, which \nI think may be the objective. Barge traffic not only gets product down \nthe river to the world markets, but it keeps the cost of shipping under \ncontrol by competition. It would harm transportation on the Mississippi \nRiver. That is why the Southern Governors' Association and waterways \ngroups have come out in strong support of section 103.\n  Our State Department and Natural Resources Conservation Department \noppose this risky scheme. They are dedicated to the recovery of the \nspecies. They have other alternatives that need to be and can be \nstudied. The U.S. Geological Survey Environmental Research Center is \nlooking at what we can do to increase the number of pallid sturgeon, \nand the likely objectives they have do not involve increasing floods in \nthe spring.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in rejecting this \nmotion to strike because it puts lives at risk; it ends transportation \nfor farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield that time to my colleague, the junior Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Missouri \nfor taking point on this very important measure that will protect a \nlivelihood and a set of very essential opportunities that exist in \ndownstream States. To send a surge of water downstream in the spring, \nwhen we are already at risk of flooding, could hurt the capacity of our \nfarmers to produce. And then to compound the injury and add the insult \nof making the shipping of what they produce difficult, or impossible, \nor not competitive, would be very damaging.\n  Over half of the people in my State of Missouri drink water from the \nMissouri River. We have come to rely on it as a resource. This doesn't \ndetract from the overall ability to measure and evaluate what happens \non the river. It simply says that prior to the plan we are not going to \nauthorize a spring surge which would add flooding and jeopardize the \nlivelihood of many individuals in Missouri and other States that border \nthe Missouri River.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some leader time. I understand \nI have 8 minutes remaining. My colleagues can vote any way they wish, \nbased upon the facts as presented. Let nobody be misled. This has \nnothing to do with flooding--nothing. This doesn't apply when there is \nflooding or when there are droughts. That is written right into the \nlanguage of this new master manual proposal. It has nothing to do with \nflooding. This has to do with barge traffic. That is what this is \nabout. It is about barge traffic.\n  Now, the Senator from Missouri talks about the importance of \ncompetition. How much competition is there when you have three-tenths \nof 1 percent of all agricultural transportation related to barge \ntraffic and 99 percent is rail and highway? Is that competition? My \ncolleagues are appropriately trying to defend a dying industry in \nMissouri, and they are using flood concerns to protect them. This is \nnot about floods. This is about protecting three-tenths of 1 percent of \nall transportation for agriculture in the entire region. That is what \nthis is about. Nothing more and nothing less.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reemphasize the first point made by my \nfriend from South Dakota. He is entirely accurate. We hear about the \nspecter of floods. If you look at the facts, this amendment has nothing \nto do with floods. Why do I say that? It is because of the Army Corps \nof Engineers' own analysis. Looking at the alternatives, the current \nmaster manual, compared with the spring rise/split season, there is no \nstatistical, no difference--it is 1 percent--in the flood control \nbenefits between the two alternatives. None. One percent is \nstatistically insignificant.\n  So you hear on the floor those protecting a dying industry using \nanother scare tactic, and that is floods. That is totally inaccurate. \nIn addition, the proposal of the spring rise/split season will be used \nin only 1 out of every 3 years. And the proposal also provides that if \nit looks as if there might be a wet year, or more precipitation in the \nyear a spring rise might otherwise occur, there would be no spring \nrise. Why? Because the primary goal of the Corps of Engineers is flood \nprotection. Let's take that off the table; take flooding and the wall \nof water down the river off the table.\n  In the 1993 and 1997 flood years, if this proposal had been in \neffect, there would be no spring rise and no split season. It would not \nexacerbate the 1993 and 1997 floods.\n  In addition, if this amendment to strike 103 is not adopted, we will \nhave a big lawsuit on our hands. Why? Because the environmentalists \nwill file a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers because of not \nprotecting the Endangered Species Act. We would have a whole set of \nproblems on our hands. Let's not have a lawsuit. Let's not have scare \ntactics for the sake of trying to protect a dying industry that need \nnot be subsidized as it is now.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nmy colleague from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The Bond provision of the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill would prohibit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nfrom implementing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to increase \nspring time releases of water from Missouri River dams to simulate the \nnatural ``rise'' and ``fall'' in the Missouri River. This could be \npotentially devastating to Nebraska's farmers and ranchers and those \nwhose livelihood depends on the Missouri River because the ``rise'' \nincreases flood risk, and the ``fall'' interferes with barge traffic.\n  This ``spring rise'' that increases flood risks down the Missouri and \nthe Mississippi is particularly irresponsible when you take into \naccount that over the last two years, FEMA has spent $32.6 million in \nflood disaster for the Missouri River.\n  During the flood of 1993, the largest in recorded history, flood \ncosts ranged between $12 and $16 billion. More importantly, main stem \nMissouri River Dams--the very ones Fish and Wildlife want to change--\nprevented $4 billion in damages.\n  If the amendment to strike the Bond provision from the Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill is successful, and this ``fall'' occurs, then \nthere is a real potential that water levels are reduced to a point \nwhere barge traffic can't get through. Barge traffic is necessary to \nthe farmer. It brings fertilizer up in the spring and brings the \nharvest to market in the fall. Senator Bond's amendment will ensure \nthat water levels are kept at a navigable level.\n  This provision is not new to the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill. It has been included in four previous appropriations measures \nthat were signed into law by President Clinton. Now, President Clinton \nis threatening to veto this bill if it contains the Bond provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep the Bond provision in this \nappropriations bill and keep the Missouri River at a reasonable and \nsteady level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes to respond to comments made by the distinguished minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the leader.\n  I just have to say when the point was made that this is not about \nflooding, that is what has people in Missouri scared to death. Floods \ndon't happen every year. But when the floods happen, they are \ndevastating.\n  That is why I want to read from a letter by the Democratic Governor, \nMel Carnahan, of Missouri. In an August 17 letter he wrote to the White \nHouse trying to stop it, he said that absent change in the service as \nplanned, it is likely efforts to restore endangered species along the \nriver will be damaged and an increase in the risk of flooding river \ncommunities and agricultural land will occur; and, States along the \nriver will suffer serious economic damage to their river-based \ntransportation and agricultural industries.\n  When the Southern Governors Association wrote to the minority and \nmajority leaders, Mike Huckabee, Governor of Arkansas, speaking for the \nsouthern Governors, said that if the current plan is implemented and \nthese States incur significantly heavy rains during the rise, there is \na real risk that farms and communities along the lower Missouri River \nwill suffer serious flooding.\n  Frankly, nobody can tell when the heavy rains are coming. I have \nwatched the National Weather Service. They do not know. They cannot \npredict the heavy rains and floods that have devastated our lands and \nkilled people in recent years. They have come without warning. It takes \n11 days for water to get from Gavins Point to St. Louis. They are not \ngood enough. None of us is good enough to know when those heavy rains \nwill occur.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know I have a couple of minutes \nremaining in leader time. Let me respond. I understand it is 5 minutes. \nI will not use all of it because I know we are about ready to go to a \nvote.\n  Let me just say that the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri \nknows what I know and what everyone should know prior to the time they \nare called upon to vote.\n  First of all, it is not a plan until it is adopted as a plan. But the \nBond language would stop the plan from even going forward before we \nhave had a chance to analyze what effect it would have on floods. But \nthe proposal, which is all it is at this point, says we will exempt \nthose years when there is a prospect for flooding. We will exempt the \nmaster manual from being utilized and implemented if a flood is \nimminent. We lop off the flooded years and the drought years. This plan \nis to be used only in those times when there is normal rain flow. That \nis really what we are talking about here.\n  But I go back to the point: Why stop this process from going forward \nbefore we know all the facts? Why stick our head in the sand before we \nreally have the biological, ecological, and all of the managerial \ndetails?\n  That is what the language does. That isn't the way we ought to \nproceed. There will be time for us to oppose, if that may be the case. \nBut not now, not halfway through the process. Let's allow this process \nto continue.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I certainly will agree to time limits on each of \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. REID.

That is correct. It is not on paper yet, but I think \nthat is what we will agree to.\n  Mr. REID. Can we agree to it right now?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. There are a few things to be worked out first.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4114\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Helms, proposes an amendment numbered 4114.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the President to certify to Congress that the \n People's Republic of China has taken certain actions with respect to \n    ensuring religious freedom, as recommended by the United States \n             Commission on International Religious Freedom)\n\n       On page 4, line 22, beginning with ``Prior'', strike all \n     through page 5, line 6, and insert the following:\n     Prior to making the determination provided for in subsection \n     (a)(1), the President shall transmit a report to Congress \n     certifying that--\n       (1) pursuant to the provisions of section 122 of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3532), the terms and \n     conditions for the accession of the People's Republic of \n     China to the World Trade Organization are at least equivalent \n     to those agreed between the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China on November 15, 1999; and\n       (2) following the recommendations of the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom, the People's \n     Republic of China has made substantial improvements in \n     respect for religious freedom, as measured by the fact that--\n       (A) the People's Republic of China has agreed to open a \n     high-level and continuing dialogue with the United States on \n     religious-freedom issues;\n       (B) the People's Republic of China has ratified the \n     International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which \n     it has signed;\n       (C) the People's Republic of China has agreed to permit the \n     United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \n     and international human rights organizations unhindered \n     access to religious leaders, including those imprisoned, \n     detained, or under house arrest;\n       (D) the People's Republic of China has responded to \n     inquiries regarding persons who are imprisoned, detained, or \n     under house arrest for reasons of religion or belief, or \n     whose whereabouts are not known, although they were last seen \n     in the custody of Chinese authorities; and\n       (E) the People's Republic of China has released from prison \n     all persons incarcerated because of their religion or \n     beliefs.\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\n       On page 5, line 10, strike ``section 101(a)'' and insert \n     ``section 101''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first, I say to colleagues that if I \nwas not on the floor right now, I would be in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Senator Brownback is conducting some hearings that deal with \nreligious freedom in China. This amendment also deals with the same \nquestion.\n  I rise today, Democrats and Republicans, to offer an amendment. I \noffer this amendment with Senator Helms of North Carolina. I believe \nlater on Senator Feingold is going to want to be added as a cosponsor.\n  This amendment will prove that our country cares deeply about \nreligious freedom and our country is not indifferent to the suffering \nof millions of Chinese who face religious persecution. Respect for \nreligious liberty goes to the heart of American values. We cannot say \nthat we are deeply committed to human rights and that we are deeply \ncommitted to religious freedom and then remain silent as we witness \nChina's abuse of both of these rights.\n  Two years ago, in a 98-0 vote, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act, which created the Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom. Congress instructed that the \nCommission make recommendations to us when it comes to how, through our \nforeign policy, we could promote international religious freedoms. It \ntook this mandate seriously. After a year-long investigation, the \nCommission--and this is the report of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, which was issued May 1, 2000--found \nthat ``The government of China and the Communist Party of China \ndiscriminates, harasses, incarcerates, and tortures people on the basis \nof their religion and beliefs.''\n  My amendment follows verbatim the Commission's recommendation. It was \nthe recommendation of this Commission, which we established by a 98-0 \nvote, to delay PNTR until China made ``substantial'' improvements in \nallowing its people the freedom to worship as measured by several \nconcrete benchmarks.\n  People who believe in religious freedom have long understood a basic \ntruth--that America, our country, can never be indifferent to religious \npersecution. When others are hounded or persecuted for their religious \nbeliefs, we are diminished by our own failure to act or speak out. But \nwhen we embrace the cause of religious freedom, we reaffirm one of the \ngreat values of American democracy.\n  This legislation and this administration is focused on trade, which \nit is now promoting as a human rights policy. But trade alone will \nnever guarantee change. This report, which I am going to read in a \nmoment, on religious persecution in China issued just this year is \nbrutal. The State Department issued its report on international \nreligious freedom.\n  Senators cannot turn their gaze away from this unpleasant truth. They \ntalk about a tremendous amount of persecution in China.\n  We have now had two reports by the State Department on human rights \nwhich have not reported great improvement. This past year, the State \nDepartment report on human rights abuses talked about a brutal climate \nin China. We cannot reward China with PNTR while it continues to harass \nand jail people because of their religious beliefs.\n  Just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that China has indicted \n85 members of a Christian sect in a followup to the recent retention of \n130 of its members and the expulsion of 3 American missionaries.\n\n  With passage of PNTR, the United States of America gives up our \nannual right of review of China's most favored nation trade privileges \nas well as our bilateral trade remedy. We have not used this leverage \nas effectively as we should. But do we want to give up all of this \nleverage? Do we want to say we do not take into account this religious \npersecution in China and we will no longer annually review trade \nrelations to maintain some leverage and some voice in support of the \nright of people in China to practice their religious beliefs?\n  During the debate on the International Religious Freedom Act, many of \nmy colleagues made impassioned speeches that U.S. foreign policy should \nnever ignore the importance of this fundamental right of people to be \nable to practice their religion and not be persecuted in our dealings \nwith other countries. In fact, Congress instructed the Commission to \nmake recommendations to ensure that American foreign policy promotes \ninternational religious freedom.\n  That is what this amendment is about.\n  The Commission's members--because I am going in a moment to mirror \ntheir recommendations, which is what this amendment basically \nreflects--are drawn from both parties and represent extremely diverse \npoints of view, including, by the way, the members of this Commission \nas strong proponents of free trade. Its members include Elliot Abrams, \nformer assistant to President Ronald Reagan; John Bolton of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute; Rev. Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop \nof Newark; Nina Shea of Freedom House; and Rabbi David Sapperstein, \ndirector of the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism.\n  Despite the Commission's extraordinary diversity, its members \nunanimously agreed on no PNTR for China. We voted 98-0 for this \nlegislation. We established this Commission. We asked this Commission \nto present to us recommendations about how we could promote religious \nfreedom. The Commission took this mandate seriously. I want to just \nquote from this Commission's report. Its members unanimously agreed \nthat we should vote no on PNTR for China.\n\n       Given the sharp deterioration in freedom of religion in \n     China during the last year, the Commission believes an \n     unconditional grant of PNTR at this moment may be taken as a \n     signal of American indifference to religious freedom.\n\n  We are just asking in our amendment that Democrats and Republicans go \non record as not being indifferent when it comes to the question of \nreligious freedom.\n  I will explain my amendment in a moment. I see my colleague, Senator \nHelms, on the floor. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina and ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks from my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, around this place we customarily say in a case such as \nthis that we are ``pleased'' to support an amendment. I am honored to \nsupport this amendment, and I am honored to cosponsor it with my friend \nfrom Minnesota. In this case, we both have the same conviction about \nwhat our Government and our country ought to do before granting \npermanent normal trade relations to China.\n  I am sure Senator Wellstone has made it clear, but for the purpose of \nemphasis, this amendment directs the President, if China has indeed met \na series of religious freedom conditions, to certify such before \ngranting permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  This amendment really tells China--and, just as importantly, the rest \nof the world--that we in America still stand for something, something \nother than profits, something other than whatever benefit may be \nimagined by the steps the President is trying to take with China.\n  In this case, we are saying we don't believe China should be welcomed \ninto international organizations such as the WTO while China continues \nto repress, to jail, to murder, and to torture their own citizens \nsimply because those citizens have dared to exercise their faith.\n  Let me quote a passage from the Clinton State Department's own report \non religious freedom that was delivered to the Congress of the United \nStates just this past week. This is the State Department:\n\n       In 1999, the Chinese government's respect for religious \n     freedom deteriorated markedly.\n  The question is, Are we going to stand here today and ignore this, \nknowing that China abuses, mistreats, and murders its own people? Are \nwe going to ignore the crackdown on\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nChristians that began just last week, during which three Americans--\nAmericans, let me emphasize--were arrested by the Communist Chinese?\n  Other crimes against religious believers in China abound. In the past \ncouple of years, China has intensified its so-called patriotic \nreeducation campaign aimed at destroying Tibetan culture and religion. \nSimilar horror stories are taking place in the Muslim northwest where \nthe Chinese Government is smashing, destroying, and stomping anybody \nwho attempts to display any kind of ethnic or true religious identity.\n  It is naive to believe these abuses will be dealt with by the \nCommission set up by this legislation. I hope I live long enough to see \nit happen. I will surpass, I believe, I fear, Senator Thurmond in age \nbefore that happens or, more precisely, until hell freezes over because \nit is not going to happen, not in the lifetime of anybody in this \nChamber.\n  The example of the recently created Commission on Religious Freedom \nis very instructive. After dramatically cataloging the barbaric \ncrackdown on religious freedom in China, the Commission recommended--\nhow do you like them apples?--that permanent normal trade relations not \nbe granted to China at this time. But nobody pays any attention, \nsimilar to a train passing in the night.\n  Here we are today, ready to toss all of those findings, all of the \nthings we know are going on, and say we ought to do it. Not with my \nvote, Mr. President; not with my vote. That is why we must insist that \nprogress on religious freedom precede China's entry into the WTO. That \nis precisely what this amendment does. I urge its adoption. I commend \nthe Senator from Minnesota for sponsoring it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from North Carolina. Mr. \nPresident, so that all Senators will know what this amendment does, let \nme be very precise about it. I look forward to hearing a response from \nmy colleague from Nebraska.\n  It tracks the recommendations of the Commission on Religious Freedom \nprecisely, that the U.S. Congress should grant PNTR, the Commission \nsaid, only after China makes substantial improvements with respect to \nfreedom of religion as measured by the following standards, which I \nthink are not unreasonable:\n  (A) China agrees to establish a high level and ongoing dialog with \nthe U.S. Government on religious freedom issues; (B) China agrees to \nratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which \nit signed in 1998; (C) China agrees to permit unhindered access to \nreligious leaders, including those imprisoned, detained, or under house \narrest by the U.S. commission on international freedom and other human \nrights organizations; (D) China provides a detailed response to \ninquiries regarding a number of persons who were imprisoned, detained, \nor under house arrest for reasons of religion or belief, or whose \nwhereabouts are not known but who were last seen in the custody of \nChinese authorities. And, finally, China has made substantial progress \nin releasing from prison all persons incarcerated for religious \nreasons.\n  This amendment is basically the recommendations of the report on the \nU.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The Commission \nsettled on these reasonable conditions after an intensive investigation \nwhere they met with Government officials, bishops, monks, and members \nof house churches in China. Its report extensively documents abuses \nagainst Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others in China.\n  Let me give my colleagues a few examples. I start with Christians. \nThe Commission found that the Chinese Government has engaged in \ncrackdowns on the Protestant house church movement and Catholics loyal \nto the Vatican. Last week, Chinese authorities arrested over 130 \nEvangelical Christians, including 3 Americans, for holding a revival \nmeeting. Further, Chinese authorities detained scores of Protestant \nworshipers and detained, beat, and fined unknown underground Catholics \nin Hebei Province last year. In recent months, many Catholic clergy \nloyal to the Vatican have also been detained. One young bishop was \ndetained while performing an unauthorized mass. He was found dead on \nthe street in Beijing shortly after being released from detention. The \nVatican reports that five churches built without the Chinese \nGovernment's authorization were torn down, and another 15 were \ndestroyed in Fujian Province.\n  While harsh prison sentences and violence against religious activists \ncontinue, state control, increasingly, takes the form of the \nregistration process. This is the way the Government monitors \nmembership in religious organizations, locations of meetings, selection \nof clergy, and content of publications. If religious members do not \nregister, they can be fined, their property seized, and sometimes they \nare detained. Again, I am just summarizing the reports that are before \nthe Senate.\n  Muslims: The Government has also carried out a major purge of local \nofficials in heavily populated Muslim areas and targeted \n``underground'' Muslim religious activities. The Government has banned \nthe construction or renovation of 133 mosques, and arrested scores of \nMuslim religious dissidents.\n  In Xinjiang, Muslims holding positions in the Government who continue \nto practice Islam have lost their jobs. Local newspapers report that \nauthorities were moving village by village, hamlet by hamlet, to clean \nup illegal religious activity. Religious teachers and students at \nunregistered schools have been detained, and they have been sent to \nreeducation through labor camps. Conditions in Xinjiang labor camps are \nsaid to be the most horrific in China. Brutality and hunger are common, \nsome inmates simply disappear. As in other areas in China, officials \nhave launched an indepth ``atheist education'' campaign. As in Tibet, \naccess to information is severely restricted.\n  These are the reports before the Senate. And we are going to say that \nwe will not speak out, and we are not going to at least ask China to \ncomply with minimum standards of decency when it comes to ending this \nreligious persecution before we automatically renew trade relations?\n  Now to Tibetans. Prior to the Chinese invasion in 1950, Tibet was a \ncountry steeped in religion. Religious practice was central to the \nidentity and the lives of Tibetan people. Recognizing the power of \nreligion in Tibetan life, the Chinese have attempted to destroy this \ncultural base, to quell dissent with authoritarian rule. Over 6,000 \nmonasteries and sacred places have been destroyed by the Chinese over \nthe last 40 years. Today in Tibet, human rights conditions remain grim. \nTibetan religious activists face ``disappearance'' or incommunicado \ndetention, long prison sentences, and brutal treatment in custody. We \nare going to be silent about this?\n  In addition, a Government-orchestrated campaign against the Dalai \nLama continues. The campaign includes a reeducation program for monks \nand nuns which the government has spread widely. In one county, for \nexample, monks were locked in their rooms for over 3 weeks for their \nrefusal to denounce the Dalai Lama. In another region, over 120 \nresident nuns were expelled from their monasteries.\n\n  In an action denounced by the Dalai Lama, the Beijing government \npicked a boy as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. This is the \nlatest campaign by the Chinese government to control the future of \ntheir religion. In 1995, the Dalai Lama identified another Tibetan boy \nas the reincarnate Panchen Lama. The Chinese government immediately \ndenounced the Dalai Lama's choice, arrested the boy and his family, and \npushed their choice. Chinese authorities continue to hold the Panchen \nLama--the world's youngest political prisoner--at a secret location and \nhave refused all requests to visit him by official and unofficial \nforeign delegations.\n  As the Commission declared:\n\n       The Chinese government has no more authority under Tibetan \n     Buddhism to select reincarnated lamas than they do to select \n     bishops under Roman Catholicism.\n\n  The Karmapa Lama, a young Tibetan man, who was groomed by the Chinese \nfor their own political purposes recently fled his monastery and his \nChinese guards for life in exile in India. He had been used cynically \nby the Chinese as a symbol of religious freedom, yet\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nwas unable to receive instruction by religious tutors as required by \nTibetan tradition. Earlier this year, the young leader said:\n\n       Tibet has suffered great losses. Tibetan religion and \n     culture have reached the point of complete destruction.\n\n  And we do not take that into account with this legislation? We do not \neven want to go on record supporting religious freedom?\n  China's excesses can be felt even closer to home as witnessed this \npast week in New York. On August 28th, more than 1,000 religious \nleaders from around the world attended the Millennium Peace Summit, a \nconference organized under the authority of the United Nations. Because \nof pressure from the Chinese government, the Dalai Lama, spiritual \nleader of Tibetan Buddhists and winner of the Nobel Peace Price, was \nconspicuously not invited. U.N. officials and China's own diplomats \ntold conference organizers that China would oppose any appearance in \nthe U.N. General Assembly chamber by the leader of Tibet's 15 million \nBuddhists.\n  By the way, I note that Ms. Jiang, from the Qi Gong movement, and Mr. \nHarry Wu--and I will have an amendment on prison labor--I think is \nsomewhere here in the gallery during this debate.\n  Perhaps the most egregious example of the PRC government's contempt \nfor the rights of its own citizens has been the unrelenting campaign of \nrepression against practitioners and defenders of Falun Gong, a popular \npractice of meditation and exercises.\n  According to international news media reports, at least 50,000 Falun \nGong practitioners have been arrested and detained, more than 5,000 \nhave been sentenced to labor camps without trial, 400 have been \nincarcerated in psychiatric facilities, and over 500 have received \nprison sentences in cursory show trials. Detainees are often tortured \nand at least 33 practitioners have died in government custody. Every \nday there is a report in the New York Times about these abuses in \nChina. Are we just going to ignore all of this?\n  Consider, for instance, the death of Chen Zixiu, a 58-year-old \nretired autoworker, who was killed by torture at the hands of Beijing \nofficers when she was unable to pay the fire for her jail time. As \ndescribed in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The day before Chen died, her captors again demanded that \n     she renounce her faith in Falun Gong. Barely conscious after \n     repeated jolts from a cattle prod, the 58-year-old stubbornly \n     shook her head. Enraged, the local officials ordered Ms. Chen \n     to run barefoot in the snow. Two days of torture had left her \n     legs bruised and her short black hair matted with pus and \n     blood, said cellmates and other prisoners who witnessed the \n     incident. She crawled outside, vomited, and collapsed. She \n     never regained consciousness.\n\n  Furthermore, over 600 Falun Gong practitioners have reportedly been \ncommitted to mental hospitals, where they have been mistreated with \ninjections, sedatives, anti-psychotics, as well as electric shocks. \nState doctors are misusing the practice of psychiatry against political \ndissidents, as in the practice of ``Soviet psychiatry.'' That was the \ncountry from which my father fled persecutions. The Washington Post \nrecently reported on a computer engineer and a Falun Gong practitioner \nwho died after spending a week in a mental hospital where doctors \ninjected him, twice daily, with an unknown substance that made him lose \nmobility and finally led to heart failure.\n  This man suffered extreme mistreatment simply for peacefully \nexercising their beliefs, a right recognized by the United Nations \nDeclaration of Human Rights and guaranteed by China's own Constitution. \nIt is particularly disturbing that Chinese officials have publicly \ndefended these atrocities on the spurious ground that Falun Gong is \nallegedly destabilizing the country. Beijing has made similar \nstatements about Christian ``house churches'' that refuse to submit to \ngovernment oversight and direction.\n  As Rabbi David Sapperstein, the former Chairman of the United States \nCommission on International Religious Freedom, he said:\n\n       Falun Gong has almost become the symbol for the struggle \n     for religious freedom. And when thousands and thousands of \n     people have been arrested, imprisoned, tortured, when people \n     have died in prison, it is impossible for countries to say \n     they are deeply committed to human rights and remain silent. \n     And that is why we have urged the United States government to \n     speak out.\n\n  Please let me repeat that:\n\n       And when thousands and thousands of people, Rabbi David \n     Sapperstein goes on to say ``have been arrested, imprisoned, \n     tortured, when people have died in prison, it is impossible \n     for countries to say that they are deeply committed to human \n     rights and remain silent. And that is why we have urged the \n     U.S. government to speak out.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It \nwill show that the U.S. Senate does not just pay lip service to the \nimportance of religious freedom, and that it supports the right of \nmillions of Chinese to practice their faiths in peace and without \npersecution. My amendment is the least we can do. China should not be \nawarded PNTR now while it continues to arrest Christians, torture \nMuslims, and hound Tibetans--all because they refuse to renounce their \nbeliefs.\n  This is a vote on religious freedom. This is a vote about our \ncommitment to it. I do feel strongly about this, given my own \nbackground and what my family went through in another country, Russia. \nBut I also want to say to colleagues that it is, in my view, not \nacceptable to vote ``no''; to vote against this amendment or to table \nthis amendment with the argument being: But if we pass an amendment we \nwould have to go to conference committee. Try telling that to people \nback home.\n  To me this is the ultimate insider's argument: We cannot support an \namendment that supports religious freedom because then the bill we \npassed would be in a different form than the House bill, and it would \nhave to go to conference committee.\n  People are not going to be persuaded by that argument. People want us \nto vote for what we think is right, and that is what we should do. I \nsay to Senators, I personally believe it is a bogus argument. Every \nSenator in this Chamber knows that if we are serious about passing \nlegislation--I have not been involved in a strategy of delay. I know we \nare going to have the debate, and I know the legislation is going to \npass. But if we want to pass the legislation, there are all sorts of \nprecedents.\n  We will get it to conference committee, and we will get it right out \nof conference committee and pass it. We can put it into an omnibus \nAppropriations Committee report. There are many ways this legislation \ncan be passed, and I do not believe Senators should be able to say: No, \nwe are not going to vote for this amendment that deals with religious \npersecution because we do not want this legislation to go to conference \ncommittee.\n  This legislation can go to conference committee, come out of \nconference committee, and it can pass. I hope my colleagues will vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I know we are not under a UC \nagreement, but I will take a few more minutes to respond later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, if the other side is prepared to enter into \ntime agreements, this side is as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers the following \namendments, they be considered under the following debate times prior \nto votes in relation to these amendments:\n  Wellstone, international religious freedom;\n  Wellstone, human rights conditions;\n  Wellstone, prison labor;\n  Wellstone, right to organize;\n  Wellstone, persecution of union organizers.\n  Further, with respect to each amendment, there be 45 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Wellstone and 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Roth, or his designee. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that no \namendments be in order to the amendments prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. That is more than \na reasonable way to proceed. I say to my colleague from Nebraska before \nhe responds, so we can move forward in an expeditious way, I will be \nprepared when I get the floor to lay my amendments out and then lay \nthem aside so other Senators can offer amendments.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, in response to my friend and colleague, the\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nSenator from Minnesota, on his first amendment regarding religious \npersecution, my opposition to his amendment is not because I believe \nthere is religious freedom in China. Clearly, there is not. I believe \nevery one of the Members of this body understands that as well. It is \nmy opinion that if we adopt this amendment, it will have the opposite \neffect desired by its sponsors.\n  The issue is: How do we best influence the behavior of China on human \nrights? I believe if we kill permanent normal trade relations with \nChina, it will not be in the best interest of human rights in China.\n  I share my colleague's concern, as do each of our colleagues in this \nbody, about the repression of citizens' rights in China. Again, the \nquestion is, How do we best influence that behavior? How do we best \ndeal with it?\n  I believe, as well intentioned as this amendment is, that it is \nmisguided and that it will kill, if adopted, this bill. If this \namendment is adopted, effectively it will kill permanent normal trade \nrelations this year and have an influence, I suspect, on this bill into \nnext year.\n  As my colleague has pointed out, if any amendment is attached to \npermanent normal trade relations, then it will go back to the House for \nanother vote, we will have a conference. Then I believe because of \ntime, if for no other reason, we will have no permanent normal trade \nrelations with China.\n  One of the most dynamic challenges of our time is America's \nrelationship with China. This challenge represents opportunity and \nuncertainty for both nations. How the U.S.-China relationship unfolds \nwill have immense consequences for the world and human rights. It is my \nopinion that it is in the best interests of America, China, and the \nworld that America engage this relationship in every way on every \nfield.\n  Trade surely is a common denominator for the future of the world. We \nmust encourage China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and \nwe should grant China PNTR. We must do this certainly, obviously, with \na very clear eye to the understanding of the limitations, the \nchallenges, and the realities of this relationship with China. We have \nan opportunity to move this relationship along a track with positive \ngrowth, potential possibilities, and for a future that is far brighter \nthan the future that now exists in China. History will judge us harshly \nif we squander this opportunity.\n  China is currently positioned to be admitted to the WTO, the 135-\nmember international organization that works to break down trade \nbarriers and foster free and fair trade among member countries. Once it \nbecomes a member of the WTO, China must implement far-reaching domestic \neconomic reforms, eliminate trade barriers, and strengthen its laws \ngoverning domestic business practices, environmental practices, and, \nyes, human rights is part of that. Human rights is part of that \ndynamic.\n  These changes will set China on the road toward becoming a \nresponsible member of the international community. This is clearly in \nour national interest, it is clearly in the interest of the world, and \nit is clearly in the interest of human rights in China.\n  This debate is not only about trade. Far from it. It is much more \nthan trade. For China's future, it must implement the reforms that WTO \nmembership requires, yes, if its economy is to continue to grow and \nhundreds of millions of Chinese are to be lifted out of abject poverty \nand hunger.\n  As nations prosper, the world becomes more peaceful and free. When \nthere is freedom, peace, and prosperity, there is less conflict, less \npoverty, less hunger, and, yes, less war. That is in the interest of \nall peoples.\n  I believe China's membership in the WTO will have a positive \ninfluence on human rights in China. Like people everywhere, the Chinese \npeople want more control over their personal lives, more freedom, more \nrights. They want more control over their own destinies. People who are \npoor have little power.\n  Membership in the WTO will, in the long run, increase the prosperity \nof the Chinese people. The reforms required by WTO membership will \nstrengthen China's economy which will create jobs and boost standards \nof living, as it does elsewhere in the world, and bring more personal \nfreedom. This is critical if the Chinese people are to lift themselves \nout of poverty and begin to gain more control over their own destinies.\n  That is a major reason why Taiwan supports China's accession to the \nWTO. Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's democratic party and outspoken \ncritic of China's Government, also supports China's membership in the \nWTO, as does, in fact, the Dalai Lama, as do many of China's most \nprominent human rights activists.\n  On May 23 of this year, the House of Representatives voted to grant \nChina PNTR status. The Senate should do the same. If Congress grants \nChina PNTR, American businesses and agricultural producers will be able \nto compete in every segment of the Chinese market.\n  If Congress fails to pass the Chinese PNTR legislation, we will lock \nourselves out of the world's largest and fastest growing market, while \nour European and Japanese competitors rush in to fill the vacuum. That \nmakes no sense. What sense does that make? How are we influencing the \nbehavior of the Chinese Government? How are we improving human \nrelations and religious freedoms in China when we walk away from China?\n  One of the main benefits of China's membership in the WTO will be the \nmandatory reduction of its tariffs on agricultural products, as well as \nall goods and services. These changes, combined with PNTR for China, \nwill enable America's agricultural producers to tap further and deeper \ninto this huge potential market. Agricultural producers, manufacturers, \nand service providers will be free to select partners, marketers, \nbuyers, and distributors in China, instead of being forced to go \nthrough state-owned trading companies or middlemen.\n  The Chinese will also have to eliminate export subsidies for their \nagricultural and other products as well as import barriers such as \nquarantine and sanitary standards that are not based on sound science. \nAnd if the Chinese do not comply with their commitments under the \nagreement, the United States can petition the WTO to force them to do \nso. There will be strong economic and political incentives in place to \nencourage Chinese compliance.\n  Our markets have long been open to China. Now it is their turn to \nopen their markets to us. We have signed a bilateral trade agreement \nwith China that effectively levels the playing field for the first time \never. But if we do not grant PNTR to China, then all the hard-won \nconcessions in our trade agreement will not apply to the United States; \nhowever, they will apply to all other WTO members who do grant PNTR to \nChina. That would represent a tremendous loss and mindless disservice \nto American businesses, farmers, and workers. And, yes, I say again, \nwhat effect would this have on improving rights and improving the \nChinese behavior toward those rights and toward their own people?\n  It is important to the world and to the Chinese people that China \nbecome integrated in the global trading system. China's economy will \nopen more quickly to foreign exports and investments, increasing the \ninteraction of the people of China with the rest of the world and \nincreasing their standard of living and potential for more freedom.\n  These developments will have a positive effect on all human rights in \nChina, provide growth opportunities to American businesses and farmers \nand workers, and help stabilize a very important region of the world.\n  This issue has serious geopolitical and, surely, national security \ninterests attached to it for both America and the world, as well as \ntrade and economic interests. They are all interconnected. We must be \nwise enough to understand this interwoven dynamic and act on it. When \nnations are trading with each other, they are rarely sending their \narmies against each other. These are common denominator self-interests \nfor all nations, for all peoples.\n  China's membership in the WTO and Congress' granting of PNTR are \nclearly in the best interests of, yes, America, and I believe in the \nbest interests of China, the people of China, and the world. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this bill and oppose all amendments \nto it.\n  I add one last point. It is not a matter, I say to the good Senator \nfrom Minnesota, of this body or of this Nation or of our people looking \nthe other way when it comes to human rights violations in China. We are \nnot looking the other way. We are finding a course\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\nthat some of us believe is the correct course to influence the behavior \nof China. It is for that reason that I shall support this bill and \noppose all amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nvote on the Wellstone amendment that is now pending Senator Byrd be \nallowed to offer the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to the \nSenator from Nebraska and to other Senators, that I appreciate what he \nsaid, although I think some of my colleagues' remarks were more general \nremarks about the overall trade agreement. I will try to respond to a \nlittle bit of that. But I don't want Senators to get away from what \nthis amendment is about and this vote.\n  By a 98-0 vote, we supported the International Religious Freedom Act. \nWe said that we were concerned about promoting religious freedom \nthroughout the world. This legislation called for a commission to be \nset up, called the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, \nto make recommendations to us about how we could promote religious \nfreedom throughout the world.\n  This Commission has come up with a recommendation about China. What \nthis Commission has said--a Commission with extraordinary diversity; \nsome of its members for PNTR, other members against it; some of its \nmembers Republican, some of its members Democrat; some of its members \nChristian, Jewish, you name it--and I quote:\n\n       Given the sharp deterioration in freedom of religion in \n     China during the last year, the Commission believes an \n     unconditional grant of PNTR at this moment may be taken as a \n     signal of American indifference to religious freedom.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about. That is what this vote is \nabout. This amendment mirrors the recommendations of this Commission.\n  This amendment does not say that we should not trade with China. This \namendment does not say that we should isolate China. This amendment \ndoes not say that we should not continue to have economic relations \nwith China. This amendment does not say we should boycott China. This \namendment is not a China-bashing amendment. This amendment goes to the \nvery heart of what we say we are about as a country and what we are \nabout as a Senate.\n\n  All this amendment says is that before we finally sign off on PNTR, \nbefore we automatically renew normal trade relations--or what we used \nto call most favored nation status--with China, let's at least call \nupon China to live up to the following standards: China will agree to \nestablish a high-level and ongoing dialog with the U.S. Government on \nreligious freedom issues; China will agree to ratify the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it signed in 1998; China \nwill agree on unhindered access to religious leaders, including those \nwho have been imprisoned; China will give us a detailed response to \ninquiries about a number of people who have been in prison or detained \nor whose whereabouts are not known; and China will show they have made \nsubstantial progress in releasing from prison all persons incarcerated \nfor religious reasons.\n  This amendment does not say we do not trade with China. This \namendment does not say we do not have economic relations with China. \nThis amendment just says that we ought to, in this trade agreement, not \njust focus on the ``almighty'' dollar. By the way, we will have this \ndebate tomorrow.\n  I said yesterday--and I know other Senators will say it--my colleague \nfrom Nebraska talks about all these exports. I want to tell you, we are \ngoing to see a lot more investment, not necessarily more exports. When \nI hear my colleague from Nebraska describe what is freedom in China, \nand what is going to go on, I can't figure out exactly what he is \ntrying to get at. We have these two reports on the brutal treatment of \npeople.\n  I just spent 30 or 40 minutes giving examples of the persecution in \nChina. We have the State Department report on human rights abuses. We \nhave all the human rights organizations reports. We just want to say \nno, that doesn't matter? We don't want to take this into account at \nall? We don't want to at least pass an amendment that says yes to \nnormal trade relations, but, China, you must at least live up to these \nelementary conditions, this sort of basic definition of decency? We \ndon't wanted to go on record supporting that?\n  We have U.S. companies going to China right now, and they are paying \n3 cents an hour. We have people working from 8 in the morning until 10 \nat night, with maybe a half an hour off from work, under deplorable, \nhorrible working conditions. If they should dare to try to organize a \nunion, they wind up in prison serving 3- to 8-year sentences. I hear \nfrom my colleagues we are all concerned about freedom. The evidence \njust does not support that.\n  Let me be clear by way of summary: This amendment I have introduced--\ncosponsored by Senator Helms and, I believe, Senator Feingold--says we \nare going to take seriously the International Freedom Act that we \npassed, we are going to take seriously the recommendations of this \nreport, we are going to say there will be normal trade relations, but \nthe Chinese Government does have to live up to these standards; we are \nnot going to be indifferent to the religious persecution that is taking \nplace in this country.\n  If this report had not come out by the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, if the State Department had not come \nout with a report saying it is brutal what is happening to people--\nChristians, Muslims, Catholics, you name it--then I wouldn't have this \namendment. But this is the evidence that is staring us in the face.\n  The amendment I have introduced calls upon the Senate not to be \nsilent on this question. I know all about some of the companies that \nhave all of their ideas about investment. I know the ways in which they \nare going to make China an export platform, where they can pay people \nmiserably low wages and then send products back to our country. They \nare doing that right now. I understand all of the economic power behind \nthis. But I ask my colleagues, are there not other values that matter \nto us? How about religious freedom?\n  Again, I say to my colleague from Nebraska, this isn't about whether \nor not this bill will pass. That is not a legitimate excuse to vote \nagainst this amendment. If you feel strongly about religious \npersecution and you do not want to be indifferent, then you should \nsupport this amendment. If we pass this amendment and this bill goes to \nconference committee, then it will be rereported out of conference \ncommittee. And if there is the will to pass this and there is \noverwhelming support for establishing normal trade relations with China \nwithout annual review, it will pass. Everyone knows that. Don't use \nthat as an excuse. Just vote for what you think is right.\n  Don't go home to the coffee shops in your State and say: Well, yes, I \nthink these reports about persecution of people were terrible. I \ncertainly didn't want the Senate to be indifferent, and I didn't want \nto communicate a message to the Chinese Government that all we care \nabout is the economics, we don't care about these issues. The thing of \nit is, I couldn't vote for this amendment because if I voted for this \namendment, then the bill wouldn't have been passed in the same form in \nthe House and the Senate. And then it would have had to go to \nconference committee, and that would have meant there would be some \ndelay. I didn't want there to be any delay.\n  People's eyes will glaze over. They will look at you, and they will \nsay: Why don't you just vote for what you think is right or wrong. \nDon't give us this insider talk which, by the way, is not so \npersuasive.\n  We could pass this bill in any number of different ways with this \namendment. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 4118 Through 4121, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know Senator Byrd has some \namendments. What I will do is send up my\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\nother amendments and ask for their consideration. Then I will lay them \naside so other colleagues may introduce their amendments. I send my \nother four amendments to the desk en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all these amendments will have debate \nand time agreements, and we will move along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nregarding the pending Wellstone amendment occur at 12:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield up to 3 minutes to my colleague from Montana to speak on the \npending Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all my colleagues support the intent of \nthe Wellstone amendment. Of course, we want to protect religious \nfreedom all over the world. It is in our American Constitution. It is \nin our Bill of Rights. It is enshrined in the first amendment to the \nConstitution. It has helped make America the great country it is. There \nis no doubt about it.\n  But that is not what we are voting on. In effect, what we are voting \non is whether our American farmers, ranchers, workers, manufacturers, \nor service providers will be able to take advantage of very significant \nliberalization and market openings that will occur in China once it \njoins the World Trade Organization. In effect, that is what we are \nvoting on.\n  We are also voting on whether, if we deny Americans the opportunity \nto trade on a more liberalized basis with China, we are going to \ntherefore allow our Japanese and European competitors to trade with \nChina on much more favorable terms than we Americans would.\n  A vote for the Wellstone amendment means Americans will be closed out \nof the Chinese market of trade on favorable terms. It also means in \neffect that other countries--I mentioned before Japan and the European \nUnion--will be able to trade on more favorable terms because they will \nhave already ratified their PNTR with China. It is very clear at this \nstage of the congressional session, the Presidential election year, any \namendment to H.R. 4444 will kill the bill. That is clear. I assure my \ncolleagues that there will be no conference on this bill if there are \nany amendments at this stage in the congressional session.\n  I think it is also illustrative to point out what some very prominent \nreligious leaders have said about the WTO and China. The Dalai Lama has \nsaid:\n\n       Joining the WTO, I think, is one way [for China] to change \n     in the right direction. China must be brought into the \n     mainstream of the world community. Forces of democracy in \n     China get more encouragement through that way.\n\n  The Reverend Billy Graham said:\n\n       I believe it is far better for us to thoughtfully \n     strengthen positive aspects of our relationship with China \n     than to threaten it as an adversary. It is my experience \n     nations can respond with friendship just as much as people \n     do.\n\n  Many religious leaders think we should grant PNTR to China. I believe \nthat. It is crystal clear what the other body will do if any amendments \nare passed here. If those amendments are passed, we will not have a \nbill. We will not have PNTR. Therefore, I will vote against the \nWellstone amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Wellstone \namendment, even though I believe almost all of us agree with its \nunderlying intent. It is just not appropriate at this time on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Montana for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, I join in saying that we all share the concern of \nSenator Wellstone regarding China's repression of its citizens' \nreligious freedoms. I am sure every other Member of the Senate does as \nwell. But if passed, make no mistake about it, this amendment, as with \nany amendment that would be offered to this bill, will effectively kill \npermanent normalized trade relations with China, since a House-Senate \nconference and a second vote on PNTR would then be required.\n  So this amendment, or any amendment, for any reason, basically is a \nkiller amendment to this bill. That is why I am going to oppose all \namendments to PNTR and ask my colleagues to join me in adopting this \napproach.\n  As I've said before, I believe H.R. 4444 is certainly among the most \nimportant legislation we will consider this year and likely the most \nconsequential of the past decade. That's because passage of PNTR will \ncreate vast new opportunities for our workers, farmers and businesses \nand also vast new opportunities for the people of China.\n  It's also because PNTR serves America's broader national interest in \nmeeting what is likely to be our single greatest foreign policy \nchallenge in the coming years--managing our relations with China.\n  And as those with the greatest experience working in faith-based \norganizations actually based in China will tell you, engaging the \nChinese through PNTR and other avenues offers us the best chance to \nadvance religious freedom--not hinder it, or stop it, but to advance \nreligious freedom in China. The best thing they say we can do is help \npass PNTR.\n  Here is what Billy Graham, one of whose organizations has been \nworking in China for 10 years providing Bibles, literature and \nleadership training, has to say:\n\n       I believe it is far better for us to thoughtfully \n     strengthen positive aspects of our relationship with China \n     than treat it as an adversary. In my experience, nations can \n     respond to friendship just as much as people do.\n\n  And here is what Reverend Pat Robertson says:\n\n       I do not minimize the human rights abuses which take place \n     in [China], but I must say on first-hand observation that \n     significant progress in regard to religious freedom and other \n     civil freedoms has been made over the past twenty-one years. \n     If the U.S. refuses to grant normal trading relations with \n     [China] we will damage ourselves and set back the cause of \n     those in China who are struggling toward increased freedom \n     for their fellow citizens.\n\n  Randy Tate, former Executive Director of Christian Coalition, said \nthe following last year:\n\n       Our case for greater trade . . . is less about money and \n     more about morality. It is about ensuring that one-fifth of \n     the world's population is not shut off from businesses \n     spreading the message of freedom and ministries spreading the \n     love of God. . .\n\n  According to a letter from 21 U.S. religious leaders,\n\n       Despite continued, documented acts of government \n     oppression, people in China nonetheless can worship, \n     participate in communities of faith, and move about the \n     country more freely today than was even imaginable twenty \n     years ago. . . . These positive developments have come about \n     gradually in large part as a result of economic reforms by \n     the Chinese government and the accompanying normalization of \n     trade, investment and exchange with the outside world.\n\n  Finally, let's listen to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama: ``Joining the \nWorld Trade Organization . . .'' he said, ``is one way (for China) to \nchange in the right direction. I think it is a positive development. In \nthe long run, certainly [the trade agreement] will be positive for \nTibet. Forces of democracy in China get more encouragement through that \nway.''\n  Mr. President, let us also remember that H.R. 4444 contains a \nprovision to establish a Congressional-Executive Commission on the \nPeople's Republic of China modelled after the Commission on Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, which played such an important role in \npromoting human rights in the former Soviet Union.\n  This new Commission's purpose is to monitor human rights conditions \nin China, including the right to worship free of involvement of and \ninterference by the government.\n  Each year, the Commission will issue a report to the President and \nthe Congress setting forth the findings of the Commission as well as \nrecommendations for legislative or executive actions to push China to \nimprove its record on religious freedom and in other areas of human \nrights.\n  Let us also remember that the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for \nInternational\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\nReligious Freedom visited China in 1999 to emphasize to Chinese \nauthorities the priority the United States places on religious freedom.\n  In addition, the United States has designated China as a ``country of \nparticular concern'' for violations of religious freedom under the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act.\n  Mr. President, every one of us in this body is concerned about \nreligious freedom. Yet as so many religious leaders with long-term \nexperience working in China contend, the best way to advance religious \nfreedom is to further our engagement with China economically and \notherwise. PNTR is central to such engagement, particularly as H.R. \n4444 specifically addresses the issue of religious freedom.\n  Finally, I must emphasize again that a vote in favor of the amendment \noffered by my friend from Minnesota--or for any amendment for that \nmatter--effectively is a vote to kill PNTR. There is simply too little \ntime left in this Congress to conference PNTR and conduct a second \nround of votes.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in tabling this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement dealing with \nthe Department of State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                Statement by Richard Boucher, Spokesman\n\n\n   response to commission on international religious freedom's first \n                             annual report\n\n       The following statement was issued by Harold Hongju Koh, \n     Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, \n     and Robert Seiple, Ambassador-at-Large for International \n     Religious Freedom.\n       ``The Commission on International Religious Freedom, an \n     independent advisory body created in 1998 to report on and \n     make recommendation to the President, Secretary of State, and \n     the Congress on the state of religious freedom around the \n     world, has released its first annual report. We have only \n     just received the final copy of the report, and will study it \n     carefully. This year's report focuses on three countries in \n     particular--China, Russia and Sudan. In its descriptions of \n     violations of religious freedom, the report appears to \n     parallel closely the evaluations of the State Department's \n     annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, released in \n     February of this year, and the International Religious \n     Freedom Report, released in September 1999 (both available at \n     www.state.gov).\n       ``As required by law, the report also makes recommendations \n     for U.S. policy options. We welcome many of the proposals, \n     including the report's call for increased focus on the \n     Sudanese government's abuses of human and religious rights, \n     and its recommendation for increased monitoring of religious \n     liberty at the local level in Russia. The Administration has \n     already enhanced our efforts on each of these issues, and we \n     will look for opportunities to do even more in the future.\n       ``At the same time, the report contains a number of \n     recommendations with which we disagree, especially the \n     recommendation that the Congress impose human rights \n     conditionality on permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) \n     with China. We profoundly believe that conditionality will \n     not advance the cause of religious freedom in China, and will \n     not improve the circumstances of any of the religious \n     adherents about whom we are all deeply concerned. This is \n     because conditionality as proposed by the Commission--and \n     even a vote to reject PNTR--provides little more than the \n     appearance of U.S. leverage against the Chinese government. \n     It would not prevent Chinese entry in to the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO); nor would it deprive China of the \n     economic benefits of WTO membership. What it would do is \n     deprive the U.S. of the full economic benefits of China's \n     market-opening commitments, and severely restrict our ability \n     to positively influence the course of events in China--\n     including our ability to promote religious freedom. It would \n     reduce the role of American companies in bringing higher \n     labor standards to China and in forcing local companies to \n     compete in improving the lives of their workers.\n       ``However, with unconditional Congressional approval of \n     PNTR, China will enter the WTO bound by the full range of \n     economic commitments contained in the U.S.-China bilateral \n     trade agreement. These commitments will move China in the \n     direction of openness, accountability, reform, and rule of \n     law, all of which will improve the conditions for religious \n     freedom in China. Failure to approve PNTR would deprive the \n     U.S. of the ability to hold China to all of these \n     commitments. Given China's likely entry into the WTO, it \n     would also put us in conflict with WTO rules, which require \n     immediate and unconditional provision of PNTR for all WTO \n     members.\n       ``Despite our fundamental disagreement with the Commission \n     on the issue of conditionality, we share the Commission's \n     deep concern about abuse of religious freedom in China, and \n     we remain committed to sustained U.S. Government efforts to \n     promote religious freedom. President Clinton has made \n     promotion of religious freedom abroad a priority of his \n     presidency and an integral part of our foreign policy. The \n     President created the first-ever Advisory Committee on \n     Religious Freedom Abroad, directed that we expand coverage of \n     religious freedom in the State Department's annual human \n     rights report, and supported and signed the legislation that \n     brought into being the International Religious Freedom \n     Commission.\n       ``As demonstrated by our sponsorship of a recent resolution \n     on China at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, we will \n     continue to keep faith with those in China who face \n     persecution due to their religious practices. We also look \n     forward to continued dialogue with the commission on how best \n     to promote our common goal of improving the observance of \n     religious freedom in China and around the world.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have already made my arguments. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Feingold be added as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again, on this one procedural point, \nmaybe there is something I don't understand about the Senate, but I \nhave been here 10 years. We do have conference reports and conference \ncommittees. This is the most amazing argument. All of a sudden, people \nare coming to the floor and saying we can't vote for any amendment \nbecause there will be no conference committee, or there might be one, \nbut then the bill will be dead. What? We have conference committees all \nthe time.\n  If Senators want to pass this, and if this amendment or other \namendments pass and this bill is in a different form, it will be a \nbetter bill than we have. Believe me, it will go to conference. And \ngiven this steamroller on behalf of this legislation, with so many \npeople wanting it to pass with such powerful interests in the country \nfor it, believe me, it will go to conference committee and the \nconference committee will report right back to us, and it will pass if \nwe want it to pass. You can't make the argument that a vote for the \namendment kills the bill. Vote for the amendment on its merits up or \ndown but don't make that argument because it is simply not accurate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time prior to \na vote relative to the Byrd amendment, re: coal, be limited to 3 hours \nto be equally divided in the usual form, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. The vote has been set for 12:15, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask that the vote occur now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I object now in order to give people time \nto finish some of the business they have before they come to the floor. \nWe have the vote set right now for 12:15, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I object to the request to move the vote up earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I ask that my amendment No. 4115 at the desk \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4115.\n\n   (Purpose: To require the United States to support the transfer of \n United States clean energy technology as part of assistance programs \n     with respect to China's energy sector, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 69, after line 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 702. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSFER OF CLEAN \n                   ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS WITH RESPECT TO CHINA'S ENERGY SECTOR.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the People's Republic of China faces significant \n     environmental and energy infrastructure development \n     challenges in the coming century;\n       (2) economic growth and environmental protection should be \n     fostered simultaneously;\n       (3) China has been recently attempting to strengthen public \n     health standards, protect natural resources, improve water \n     and air quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions levels \n     while striving to expand its economy;\n       (4) the United States is a leader in a range of clean \n     energy technologies; and\n       (5) the environment and energy infrastructure development \n     are issues that are equally important to both nations, and \n     therefore, the United States should work with China to \n     encourage the use of American-made clean energy technologies.\n       (b) Support for Clean Energy Technology.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, each department, agency, or other \n     entity of the United States carrying out an assistance \n     program in support of the activities of United States persons \n     in the environment and energy sector of the People's Republic \n     of China shall support, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     the transfer of United States clean energy technology as part \n     of that program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the departments, agencies, and entities \n     of the United States described in subsection (b) such sums as \n     may be necessary to support the transfer of clean energy \n     technology, consistent with the subsidy codes of the World \n     Trade Organization, as part of assistance programs carried \n     out by those departments, agencies, and entities in support \n     of activities of United States persons in the energy sector \n     of the People's Republic of China.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do quorum calls come out of the 3 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If they are suggested during the 3 hours, they \ncount. If they are suggested at the end of the 3 hours, they do not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on the quorum \ncall which I am about to enter will not count against the 3 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there are exactly three Senators on the \nfloor, including the Senator presiding. Shouldn't we have better \nattendance than this on a matter so important as this legislation? I am \ngoing to suggest the absence of a quorum, and I will object to it being \ncalled off, so it will be a live quorum.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am going to break my own rule here and ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not want to be dilatory. That is not my \ndesire at all. I voted earlier today to proceed to the consideration of \nthis measure. But it seems to me to be a sad reflection on us all if we \nare going to have a far-reaching measure of this importance before the \nSenate here at 5 minutes until 1 p.m. and with only three Senators on \nthe floor.\n  Now, it is not so much that this happens to be my amendment, but this \ndoes happen to be an important measure, and this does happen to be an \nimportant amendment, in my judgment.\n  So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it not be charged against the 3 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, I would like to have a live quorum, so \nI will presently intend to object to the calling off of the quorum \nbecause I want Senators to give a little bit of attention to what is \ngoing on here.\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been informed that several Senators \nare not here, they having thought there would be at least an hour and a \nhalf to 3 hours before there would be a vote. I am not going to take \nadvantage of Senators in that way, and I, therefore, shall proceed.\n  But with now the time running, let me say, I think this is a travesty \nupon the legislative process. This is a far-reaching measure. There are \nimportant amendments that will be called up and voted down--summarily \nvoted down--by many Members; at least, many Members will summarily vote \nagainst any amendment. Some have already announced their intention to \nvote against any amendment.\n  So a rhetorical question, I think, would be in order. Why have any \ndebate? Why call up amendments? Why go through this charade? I have \ncalled up an amendment. We all know it is going to be rejected because \nsome Senators are going to vote against any amendments, no matter what \nthe amendment provides. They can be good amendments, they can be better \namendments, they can be the best amendments. They are all going to be \nrejected. What kind of legislative process is that?\n  I have been in this Congress 48 years. I have been in the Senate 42 \nyears. I have never seen anything like this. Members are very \nforthright in saying--they don't make any bones about it--that they \nhave agreed they will not support any amendment. Why? Because they say \nit would mean, if the amendment should carry, that the measure would \nhave to go to the House and then to a conference.\n  The House might accept the amendment. There might not have to be a \nconference. The House might accept the amendment. And if a conference \ndid ensue, again, so what? That is the way we have been doing things \nfor decades. The Senate votes. If there are amendments to the House \nbill, then there is a conference, unless the House accepts the \namendment itself. Here are some amendments that, if the House should \nhave an opportunity to vote on them, undoubtedly would receive good \nvotes in the House and perhaps, who knows, they might pass the House. \nBut this administration doesn't want any vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a question of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is the question: Does the chairman of the committee \nknow whether or not the administration is opposed to any amendments \nbeing added to this measure by the Senate?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague that it is my understanding the administration is opposed to \nany amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Can the distinguished chairman answer as to why the \nadministration is opposed to any amendment as far as he, the chairman, \nknows?\n  Mr. ROTH. I don't know that I can answer for the White House why they \nare opposed. I think, if I might make a short comment, a number of us \non both sides of the political aisle, as well as both branches of \nGovernment, the executive and the Congress, believe this is an \nextraordinarily important matter, that it involves our country's \neconomic future as well as security, and that it is important we \nproceed as expeditiously as possible. I suspect, but I cannot say, \nthere are those who are fearful that we are in the campaign season and, \nif it goes back to the House, that many will be unable to vote their \nwill for fear they might antagonize some of their important supporters.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that is a forthright answer. It is quite \nenlightening. I certainly thank the distinguished chairman.\n  I seem to recall that there have been many important measures over \nthe years that have been debated. Many have been enacted; some have \nbeen rejected. The Versailles Treaty was rejected.\n  What I am saying is, this is not the only important measure. I grant \nthat it is very important. The chairman says it is such an important \nmeasure, the administration does not want it amended. At least that is \nhis recollection of what the administration's position is. But there \nhave been many important measures. I won't go through them now, but I \ncan think of a good many that have come up here since I have been a \nMember of the Senate.\n  I was here when the 1964 Civil Rights Act was enacted. I believe it \nwas before the Senate 116 days, including the 2 weeks that were used in \ncalling up that measure. But we had amendments. There had to be cloture \nfiled on it in order to get a final vote. There was the natural gas \nbill of 1978. One could go on and name equally important measures that \nwere far-reaching measures, but never was there the blood oath that was \ntaken by Senators that they would stand to the man or to the woman \nagainst any amendment: Regardless of its merit, it shall not pass. And \nsince when has the Senate bowed the neck to any administration and \nagreed, either publicly or in private or with a wink and a nod, that we \nwill stand with you, Mr. Administration; we will be with you; we will \nstand against any amendment. It does not make any difference how it \nmight affect my constituents. It does not make any difference how it \nmight affect my sons, my daughters, my grandchildren. It does not make \nany difference, Mr. Administration, or Mr. President; we will stand \nwith you; we will be against this amendment.\n\n  What is the Senate coming to when the Senate engages in that kind of \ncharade? I say Senators ought to bow their heads in shame. What is \nhappening to the Senate when that kind of situation obtains? That is \nwhat we have come to here, where we follow, like sheep, the \nadministration over a cliff.\n  I dare say there will be some Senators who have taken that blood \noath--I will refer to it as a blood oath; it is probably as good as a \nblood oath because apparently that is the way it is going to work--who \nwill have agreed to pursue that kind of course in spite of the rules, \nthe history, the traditions of the Senate, in spite of the oath of \noffice they took.\n  Each of us takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States. Here is the Constitution of the United States. I \nhold it in my hand. Are we supporting the Constitution of the United \nStates which says that the Congress shall have power to regulate \ninterstate and foreign commerce? Not exactly in those words, but it is \nin section 8 of article I of this Constitution: Congress shall have \npower to regulate commerce. That is what this bill is about, commerce. \nYet we are not going to let Congress regulate it. We are not going to \nlet the Congress of the United States uphold and utilize its power \nunder the Constitution of the United States in this regard.\n  This same Constitution says, with regard to amendments, that all \nrevenue-raising measures will originate in the other body. But the \nSenate may amend, ``as on other bills,'' it says. So that would include \nthe measure that is before the Senate. So we are giving the back of our \nhand to the Constitution of the United States. We are not exercising \nour responsibilities--not just our rights, but we are not exercising \nour responsibilities to the people, to the Constitution, to this \ncountry, to our children, to our grandchildren, and to ourselves. We \nare not standing by our duty and our responsibility if we enter into \nsuch an agreement as that among us.\n  I daresay some of the Senators who have fallen into that pothole will \ncome to rue the day. I will have more to say about this in that regard \nbefore we have the final vote. Today, I cast my 15,801st vote in this \nSenate; 15,801 votes. No Senator in the history of the Republic can \nmatch it. I have never entered into such an agreement. When I was in \nthe leadership, when I was a leader, when I was a whip, when I was \nsecretary of the Democratic conference, whether in the majority or \nminority, I never asked my friends in the Senate to stand to the man.\n  I am not saying that the majority leader or minority leader have \nasked Senators to do that. But there is some kind of a virus that has \ncome along here and seized on the Chamber and, all of a sudden, there \nare several Senators\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\nwho are going to vote against any amendment. Think about that. I would \nnot want my constituents to think I would do that. I might want to \nlisten to a Senator. He might be a Republican. I might want to listen \nto that Republican explain his amendment, and I might want to vote for \nit, and I might vote for it. I might vote for it even if my fellow \nDemocrats were against it.\n  This Senator is not going to be bound by any ``blood oath.'' I \nobjected to that when I was a member of the house of delegates 54 years \nago. I stood up in a caucus and said, ``I'm not going to be bound by \nthis caucus.'' It was a Democratic caucus. ``I am not going to walk \naround here with shackles and chains on my wrists and legs and, more \nimportantly, on my conscience.''\n  I think a Senator is entitled to be heard on his amendment and \nentitled to have the frank opinions of other Senators. He is entitled \nto have his colleagues' opinions, short of any shackles and chains that \nare binding them, as it were, to vote against any amendment.\n  So I am utterly wasting my time. I am just wasting my time. I am \nsorry to say I am impinging on the time of the Presiding Officer. We \nhave the manager of the bill here and I am wasting his time. Why go \nthrough all of this when Senators have stood upon this floor and said--\nI have heard them--that they will vote against any amendment to this \nbill. Why? Because if the amendment were to be adopted, it would mean \nthat the bill would then have to go back to the House and go to \nconference. Well, so what. That is the way we do things. That is the \nprocess, and it has been the process for decades. That will continue to \nbe the process. We go to conference or the House accepts the bill. In \nany event, both Houses have to act together in unison and have to agree \nupon any measure before it can be sent to the President, providing it \nis a bill or joint resolution.\n  So there you are. That is the reason. I will tell you why. They are \nafraid; the administration is afraid. Senators are afraid--those who \nhave taken this position--of being against any amendment. They are \nafraid that the Senate, in the free exercise of its wisdom and its \njudgment, might accept and adopt some of these amendments. When they go \nback to the House in that case, then the House, in its wisdom, might \naccept the amendments. And so this measure would not be passed as a \nclean measure.\n\n  What are we coming to here? I can't remember that ever happening in \nmy time in the Senate. It is an unwritten agreement, but it is an \nagreement, apparently. Shame, shame on us; shame on the Senate; shame \non the administration, if that is the policy they are pushing. Are we \nslaves to the administration? Are we slaves or are we men? Are we free \nmen and women? After all, when it is boiled down, in essence, Milton's \nParadise Lost is about freedom of the will. God gave man freedom of the \nwill. Now, why don't you Senators exercise that freedom of the will?\n  I understand that all who vote against amendments are not doing so \njust because they have entered into some kind of unwritten agreement \nthat they are going to be against all amendments. There are some \nSenators who will be against this amendment I am offering. They would \nvote against it, no matter what. So I certainly don't impugn the \ncharacter or honesty and integrity of Senators. I am sickened by this \nidea that we have to pass this as a clean bill and no matter what \namendment or whose amendment it is, or where it started, or what its \nimpact or merits, we are going to vote down all amendments. That \nsickens me. You may say, so what, he is sickened. Well, it is more than \n``so what.'' This is the United States Senate.\n  What a sad day when Senators look at a measure and say: We will not \nsupport any amendment. What a reflection upon man's freedom of the \nwill. In the body which is the premier upper House of the world, where \namendments are assured and where freedom of debate is assured, what a \nsad reflection upon our attitudes toward our responsibilities and our \nduties and toward our rights on behalf of our people. The people of \nWest Virginia want this amendment. The people of West Virginia support \nthe amendment. But they are going to be gagged. They can support it all \nthey want. It will not pass. It cannot pass. The same can be said for \nother amendments.\n  I have heard it said here, we are going to influence the Chinese to \nmove farther, to a more moderate society, farther in that direction; we \nhave to pass this, we will have more influence. The Chinese have been \naround for thousands of years, thousands of years. The Chinese were one \nof the earliest peoples to have a civilized society. And they are in no \nbig hurry. When they seek to achieve an objective, they can wait. They \nhave the patience of that great man of Ur, Job. They have the patience.\n  And they say we will influence them, we will influence them to become \nmore amenable to our views and the views of the democracy. We don't \neven have a democracy here. This is a republic. The very idea that we \nare going to influence them. We have been in business for 212 years \nhere; they have been in business for 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 years or \nlonger. They were around when the pyramids of Egypt were created by the \nancient Egyptians. So we are going to influence them? Well, let's see \nwho is influenced in the long run.\n  The amendment I offer is a good amendment. If we can influence them \non this amendment, we will have achieved something.\n  I say to the former Senator from Wyoming, we don't call attention to \npeople in the galleries, but he has the right to the floor as a former \nSenator. I say to my friend from Wyoming, who is a man of utterly good \nsense, good judgment, that if he were a Member of this body, he would \nlaugh at this charade, he would laugh at this charade, were it not so \nserious. I am glad he is back on the floor today. At least there is a \nlittle wisdom in the Chamber at this moment.\n  Mr. President, as many Senators know, I have been working for many \nyears to provide funding for a range of clean energy technologies. \nThese technologies are essential to growing our economy while also \nensuring that environmental improvements, energy security, public \nhealth, and air and water quality are met. The U.S. will need a range \nof energy resources if our nation is ever going to achieve a \nsustainable economic future, and we must expand the range of newer \ntechnologies and practices to meet even more challenging problems in \nthe future. The very same argument can be made for China. It would be \nproductive for both nations if we could leverage our hard-won \ntechnological advances while helping China develop in a more \nenvironmentally and economically sound manner.\n  Let me say this over again: It would be productive for both nations--\nChina and the United States--if we could leverage our hard-won and \ncostly, paid for by the taxpayers of America, technological advances, \nwhile helping China develop in a more environmentally and economically \nsound manner.\n  By 2020, energy technology experts estimate that global clean energy \ntechnology markets are expected to double, and these markets in \ndeveloping countries alone could require a multi-trillion dollar \ninvestment as infrastructure is built and replaced. Clean energy \ntechnologies and other such beneficial mitigation actions such as \ncarbon sequestration are essential responses if any nation, in this \nrapidly growing economy, ever hopes to adequately address burgeoning \nenvironment and energy concerns such as energy security, resource \ndiversity, land use changes, air and water quality, and ultimately, \nglobal climate change. If one realizes that two-thirds of the global \nenergy infrastructure has yet to be built and much of the current \ninfrastructure will need to be upgraded or replaced, then every nation \nmust play a role and strategically plan for this anticipated \ndevelopment.\n  I note that in May 2000, the U.S. and China signed a cooperative \nagreement on environment and development. Recognizing that these two \nintertwining issues are some of the most critical challenges in the \ncoming century, our two nations have committed themselves to meeting \never-growing development needs in an economically and environmentally \nsound manner. As part of that agreement, the U.S. and China plan to \nexpand and accelerate the transfer of clean energy technologies in \norder to meet energy demands and environmental protection challenges. \nAmong a number of important features, this recent agreement\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nspecifically calls for the increased utilization of Clean Coal \nTechnologies. I believe that agreements like this are a gradual but \npositive step in bringing increased cooperation between our two \nnations, and I hope that future endeavors that build upon this \nfoundation are pursued.\n  In 1985, I worked to create the Department of Energy's Clean Coal \nTechnology program, a very successful research and development program. \nOriginally designed to address acid rain reduction, the Clean Coal \nTechnology program is now addressing a broader range of emission \nissues, including the reduction of greenhouse gases. It is well known \nthat, just as coal has fueled much of the American economy, it will \nplay a major role in China's development as well.\n  The U.S. and China, two of the largest energy producing nations in \nthe world, will only make substantial progress in reconciling the need \nfor economic growth and environmental protection through increased \ncooperation that includes the use of clean energy technologies such as \nrenewable, energy efficiency, nuclear, and fossil energy technologies \nincluding Clean Coal Technologies. In the end, it does not matter where \nclean energy technologies like American-made Clean Coal Technologies \nare demonstrated. More importantly, it matters that these technologies \nbe deployed in any region or nation that uses coal to meet rapidly \ngrowing energy demands. While the U.S. should be deploying these \ntechnologies domestically, the best energy technologies for coal-fired \ngeneration facilities must be installed so that their real world \nbenefits can be proven in China likewise. In a recent survey conducted \nby the Electric Power Research Institute, it is predicted that nations \nsuch as China, with large indigenous coal reserves, will use these \nplentiful resources for producing electricity to fuel their rapidly \ngrowing economy. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of \ncoal. The study estimates--now, get this, the two other Senators who \nare here today. I won't name them. I want my two other Senators, \nthough, to hear this. The study estimates that China could build as \nmany as 180 electric powerplants per year for the next 20 years with \nabout 75 percent of these powerplants utilizing coal.\n\n  Now, where are the environmentalists? I need their support on this \namendment.\n  Let me say that again. The study estimates that China could build as \nmany as 180 electric powerplants per year for the next 20 years, with \nabout 75 percent of these powerplants utilizing coal.\n  What is that going to do to the problem of global warming?\n  Because coal is the largest energy resource that China can produce in \ngreat quantities domestically, it will almost certainly be China's \ndominant fuel resource choice. As a first step, one of the cheapest and \neasiest pollution abatement measures that China could utilize would \ninclude coal washing. We have been through that. We know what coal \nwashing means. It would use coal washing to remove impurities from the \nore.\n  That distinguished Presiding Officer, who is from Illinois, knows \nwhat coal washing is. They produce coal up there in Illinois, and have \nbeen doing so for quite a long time.\n  Today, less than 20 percent of the coal burned in China is washed. In \nthe near term, China needs pollution abatement technologies like coal \nwashing and sulfur scrubbing, with an increasing demand for additional \nclean coal technologies as new facilities come online.\n  This evidence should serve as a wake-up call--China will use coal to \nfuel much of China's economic growth. Still, China's many other \ndomestic environmental challenges are formidable, resulting in serious \nhealth and potential economic devastation if they are not addressed. \nFor example, China, home to 5 of the 10 most polluted cities in the \nworld, must address the serious impacts on people's health from this \npoor air quality.\n  Today, few Chinese cities have adequate water treatment facilities. \nApproximately 40 percent of China's water in urban areas is \ncontaminated, and land use changes could make agricultural production \nand food security increasingly more precarious. Additionally, China now \nranks second in the world in energy consumption and greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Hear me now, environmentalists. You should position yourselves at the \ndoors of this Chamber. You should position yourselves at the elevators \nto the building and buttonhole these Senators when they come into this \nChamber and tell them: Vote for this amendment. This is an \nenvironmentalists' amendment.\n  The Energy Information Agency estimates that 84 percent of the \nprojected growth in carbon emissions between 1990 and 2010 will come \nfrom developing countries, and one of the largest sources will be \nChina.\n  While I know there is no one silver bullet to solve the totality of \nthese very complicated global environment and energy problems, if the \ninternational community is ever going to effectively combat issues of \nair and water pollution, land use changes, and global climate change, \nthen the United States and China must work together to increase the use \nof clean energy technology. That window is now open. To ignore the \nbenefits of clean coal technologies, knowing that coal will be a \nprimary fuel of choice, would be folly, utter folly. The U.S. has \ngrappled with many of these energy and environmental problems and is \nmaking slow but steady progress in addressing air, water, and land use \nproblems.\n\n  For example, the United States has done much to improve its own use \nof coal as a fuel for electric generation. While coal use has tripled \nsince 1970, the emissions have decreased substantially while also \nproviding the much needed electric generation necessary to light this \nChamber, for example; to light the White House; to fuel the needs of \nthe big cities on the Atlantic seaboard, the large industrial centers \nin the Midwest. I am talking about coal, C-O-A-L.\n  While coal use has tripled since 1970, the emissions have decreased \nsubstantially, while also providing the much needed electric generation \nnecessary for economic growth. We should, therefore, provide developing \nnations such as China with our expertise and experience--at their cost. \nThese are not for free. These are paid for by the American taxpayer. \nBut we should make them available, and our agencies operating in China \nshould help to open the doors, open the gates so these technologies \nthat have come at great expense to the American taxpayer can be \nutilized for great effect in China.\n  We should help China to resolve its environmental and developmental \ndilemmas by learning from our own past mistakes, in part through the \nutilization of the most advanced energy technologies and practices. My \namendment requires any U.S. Government agency that plays a role in \nenvironment and energy, and operates in China, to increase that \nagency's efforts to increase China's efforts to get clean energy \ntechnologies on the ground in China.\n  I recognize that at this time there are particular limitations on \nspecific agencies prohibiting them from working in China. These \nsanctions are another issue that Congress should address later. My \namendment is not intended to overturn those sanctions. Rather, the \nUnited States should be using the collective resources and expertise of \nsuch Government agencies as the Departments of Commerce, State, and \nEnergy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Export-Import Bank \nto provide greater technical assistance and other aid, to the maximum \nextent practicable, to assist in the promotion, the transfer, and the \ndeployment of more American-made clean energy technology. The U.S. \nGovernment needs to help U.S. companies increase their market share for \nenvironmental and clean energy technologies in China's rapidly growing \nmarket.\n  In June 1999, the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology released a report entitled ``The Federal Role in \nInternational Cooperation on Energy Innovation.'' The conclusions of \nthat study strongly suggested that more needed to be done to fill the \ngaps in the ``technology innovation pipeline.'' The recommendations \ninclude strengthening the Federal foundation for capacities in energy \ntechnology innovation, promoting a range of energy efficient and clean \nenergy technologies, and enhancing the interagency development of these \nideas\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\ninternationally. The scientific and technology experts outlining these \nrecommendations have made a number of observations in their report that \njustify the need for this very important amendment.\n  What are some of those observations?\n  1. Energy use will grow dramatically worldwide, particularly in \ndeveloping nations.\n  2. Technological innovation and the policies adopted to promote \nefficient and clean energy technologies will determine the quantity of \nenergy used in the future and the impact of that energy use.\n  3. A significant portion of the demand for new energy technologies \nwill be outside the United States under any future scenario.\n  4. Government has a critical and legitimate role to play.\n  5. Strengthening industrial and developing country cooperation on \nclean energy technologies is a promising approach to helping secure \ndeveloping country participation in any future international framework \nfor addressing global climate change.\n  6. A unified vision and coordinated management will enhance U.S. \ninternational cooperation efforts on energy.\n  In an effort to help implement many of these commonsense ideas, I \noffer my amendment today. If Senators believe that more needs to be \ndone to address global environment and energy issues --and I not only \nsay Senators, but I also include the White House. The Vice President \nhas been a leader in the effort to have countries clean up the \npollution. He has been a leader advocating measures to offset global \nwarming. This is his chance. This is the time. This is the opportunity.\n  If Senators believe that the United States has developed a package of \ncommercial-ready, cutting-edge, clean energy technologies, if we \nbelieve the recommendations outlined in this report and believe that \nthey make sense, if we believe the United States should be doing more \nto develop clean energy technology markets internationally, then I have \nthe way to do it. I have the amendment. This amendment is a logical \noutcome.\n  Clean coal technologies are just one of many examples of clean energy \ntechnologies that have been enhanced through U.S. investment in \nresearch, development, and demonstration. But many of these newer, \ncleaner technologies must eventually be deployed in the market so that \ntheir worthiness can be proved. It is imperative that we fill that gap. \nThe United States should be doing even more to work with China to get \nclean energy technologies in place.\n  If there is something real to this thing called global warming--and I \nbelieve there is. I believe there is something to global warming. This \nis the way to ameliorate it.\n  China would benefit by utilizing cleaner technologies; growing its \neconomy, and improving its citizens' lives. At the same time, U.S. \ncompanies would benefit by creating an even broader market opportunity \nfor American-made technologies.\n  Some people may believe that the United States should not be helping \nChina make clean energy technology investments until China has formally \ncommitted itself to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as \noutlined in Senate Resolution 98. I am a believer in Senate Resolution \n98. As a lead sponsor of that resolution, let me be clear, we should be \nencouraging more action, not less action. The amendment that I offer \ntoday is not tied to S. Res. 98 or any climate change treaty.\n  I recognize the underlying science of climate change and believe that \nevery nation including China, must do its part to tackle this \ninternational problem. If the international community is ever going to \ntackle a truly global issue like climate change, then all nations must \nwork to find equitable, cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. While clean energy technologies may help reduce greenhouse \ngases, they also address a wide range of equally important environment \nand energy concerns. Therefore, the United States should be taking \nfurther steps on many fronts, including encouraging China to use more \nAmerican-made clean energy technologies. This is a win-win-win-win \nopportunity for both our countries and may eventually provide for \nfuture scenarios by which developing nations consider climate change \ncommitments.\n  While there are many issues that our two large, very powerful \ncountries do not agree on, energy and environment challenges constitute \ncommon issues of concern in which we can work more closely. Chinese \nofficials at the highest levels have acknowledged that increasing steps \nmust be taken to fight pollution and ecological deterioration. China's \ndomestic efforts must increase given the serious nature of their \nenvironmental problems. They have serious environmental problems, and \nthey know it. It is clearly recognized that there are sound policy \noptions and a range of commercial-ready technologies that can help \nChina make substantial improvements in its energy sector but all \nparties must be ready to meet these challenges. International \ncooperation remains critically important, especially for introducing \nmore clean energy technologies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. \nThis can be done if the United States and China work more closely to \nenhance clean energy technology transfer for the benefit of both our \nnations.\n\n  As the panel of scientific and technology experts from this \nassessment on clean energy technology innovation has concluded:\n\n       The needs and opportunities for enhanced international \n     cooperation on energy-technology innovation supportive of \n     U.S. interests and values are thus both large and urgent. . . \n     . Now is the time for the United States to take the sensible \n     and affordable steps . . . to address the international \n     dimensions of the energy challenges to U.S. interests and \n     values that the 21st century will present.\n\n  Therefore, I urge Senators to put aside the blood oath and support \nthis amendment as it will help strengthen the American values, \nAmerican-made technologies, and the PNTR bill that we are considering \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 56 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's \namendment regarding clean energy. I have to confess to my good friend \nand colleague that I do so reluctantly because I know of no one who is \nmore experienced in the procedures of this august body or who is better \nequipped to lead an argument in which he believes so strongly.\n  I have to say that much of what he wants to accomplish I not only \nsympathize with but think it is critically important that we address \nthose problems at some future time.\n  First, let me repeat what I stated at the beginning of the week. Any \namendments that are added to this legislation would indeed force us \ninto conference on this bill. We are in agreement on that. But given \nthe limits of time, it would be uncertain whether we would have the \ntime to take up and adopt a conference report.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle--my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Moynihan, as well as myself--strongly believe that this \nlegislation on PNTR is the most important piece of legislation we will \nconsider this year, if not this decade.\n  I know the ordinary process is to have conferences and go back and \nforth, but it seems to me one of the remarkable aspects of this \nCongress, and the Senate in particular, is the flexibility in the means \nof which we can progress on a legislative endeavor.\n  Those of us who believe it is of utmost importance that we open \nChina's doors to American exports and products believe strongly that \nthe best way to accomplish it, under current circumstances, is to try \nto keep a clean bill.\n  Let me point out for the public at large, particularly in the \nSenate--perhaps less so in the House--there are many opportunities to \nraise this type of question. We have a rule of nongermaneness. To me, \nalways one of the great advantages, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, of being a Senator, even a freshman Senator, is you \ncan raise significant legislation and have the opportunity to debate it \non the floor, which is not always true of the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\n  But the point I am trying to make is that those of us who support \nthis legislation--I would include the administration--there is a broad \nconsensus among many of us that it is critically important that we move \nahead with permanent normal trade relations, and that if we begin down \nthe road of amendments, it could very likely prevent effective action \nbeing taken on this piece of legislation.\n  I point out that if we fail to act this year, China will still become \na member of the WTO. We are disadvantaging our people, our companies, \nour workers, our farmers by not providing them the advantage of the \nsignificant concessions that Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated with her \nChinese counterparts.\n  I would say, those who oppose the bill, of course, are more likely to \nbe willing to take these risks than those of us who believe it is of \nsuch critical importance to our country.\n  So given the limits of time, it seems to me it would be uncertain \nwhether we would have the time to take up and adopt a conference \nreport. As such, it seems to me, a vote in favor of an amendment on \nthis bill is a vote to kill it. It is really that simple. That is why I \nmust oppose it.\n  It is ironic that by threatening passage of PNTR, this legislation \ncould have the opposite effect to what was intended. After all, PNTR is \nessential to giving our companies, our farmers, and our service \nproviders meaningful access to the Chinese market. This, obviously, \nincludes the companies and service providers that are more than ready \nto sell China environmentally sound products and services, including \nthose that my colleague seeks to promote through this amendment.\n  I strongly agree on the seriousness of the environmental problems in \nChina. I think the distinguished Senator from West Virginia mentioned \nthere are certain cities that, if you have ever visited, really \nillustrate the magnitude of the problem and understand the importance \nof improvement being made environmentally.\n  But whether or not we will be in a position to supply our technology, \nto provide our equipment and services, will depend on how effective we \nwill be on moving ahead with granting PNTR in response to the upcoming \naccession of China to WTO.\n  Once China becomes a member of the WTO, we will be in a far superior \nposition to provide the kind of assistance that will protect our \ninterests, but that will happen only if we pass this legislation. \nPassage of PNTR will improve our ability to encourage China to begin to \ntake the measures that are essential if we are going to address the \nproblems of global warming and all the other serious environmental \nproblems.\n  Indeed, I have to emphasize that, in my judgment, nothing will \npromote exports of these types of goods and services more than PNTR. \nThis is not just because of the market access commitments the Chinese \nhave made. WTO accession will also bring China under the disciplines of \nthe TRIPS agreement, which is the WTO agreement on intellectual \nproperty rights. As my distinguished colleague knows, nothing is more \ncritically important, and protected with greater care, than know-how, \ntechnology. The United States is a leader, the world leader in \ndeveloping the most progressive technology, whether it is environmental \ntechnology or technology in other areas. And by passing PNTR, we help \nprotect our technology. We gain a system by which we can enforce our \nrights; through a dispute settlement process that is part of the WTO. \nAs a matter of fact, the Chinese have even agreed to some stricter \nprovisions in protecting our intellectual property rights, which is \nimportant, I know, to both of us.\n  We should also not lose sight of the fact that the countries with the \nbest environmental practices are those with the greatest level of \neconomic development. China's WTO accession is the key element for \nensuring economic growth in China and bringing them along the path of \neconomic development. It is only with that economic development that we \nwill be able to see long-term and sustainable progress towards \nenvironmental protection.\n  Frankly, this is as true in China as it is in any other developing \ncountry. It simply is a fact that poor countries cannot afford the \ntypes of environmental protections that the wealthier countries enjoy. \nAs much as we may wish this were not the case, it is a fact we cannot \nignore. That is why we should not do anything that would threaten \nPNTR's passage.\n  There are, in my judgment, many important reasons for supporting \nPNTR, but one of them is that it, together with WTO accession, will be \nessential an element of creating the conditions in China for improved \nenvironmental protection.\n  Again, I am very sympathetic to the objectives and goals of the Byrd \namendment, but I also feel compelled to make it clear to all my \ncolleagues that a vote in favor of this amendment is a vote to kill \nPNTR. For that reason, I must oppose this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Let me reiterate that China will become a member of the WTO \nregardless of the decision of Congress on PNTR. The legislation before \nus is not about that. What is at issue is whether we want to say yes to \nChina's offer to open its door to our goods.\n  Let me also add that I was very much interested in hearing the \ncomments of Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, discussing on this floor his \nexperience in a visit with the Chinese leadership. In that discussion, \nhe pointed out that not only was the President very open about his \nsupport for the concessions that had been made in the negotiations with \nthe United States, but he was looking forward to even greater opening \nof the Chinese market.\n  Again, I think it is important for everyone to understand that China \nhas access to the American market. This legislation in no way affects \nthat. What is important, this legislation opens up China's market to \nthe United States of goods, products, technology. For that reason, it \nis critically important that we proceed and act affirmatively on giving \npermanent normal trade relations.\n  Once we do that, we are taking a giant step forward in permitting the \nkind of exchanges of environmental technology, of science, of \nequipment, of supplies that will help China address its serious \nenvironmental problem. I appreciate the concern of Senator Byrd about \nthis environmental issue, but the best way, in my judgment, to begin \nsolving and addressing that problem is by making sure China has \npermanent normal trade relations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday in remarks \nfollowing an extensive comment by our sometime President pro tempore, \nour revered Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Delaware and I \nwould have to oppose all amendments. Whatever their good intentions or \nsound assertions, they would simply have the effect of costing us this \nepic and fundamentally important measure.\n  I will just say one thing about clean coal. It is remarkable how much \nprogress has been made in our time. I can recall, as a graduate student \nafter returning from the Navy, I received a Fulbright fellowship to the \nLondon School of Economics. The clean air technology was so bad in \nBritain that there would be days, theoretically full daylight, in which \nthe buses would be preceded by busmen carrying electric lights to show \nthem their way through the streets of London. It was darkness at noon \nin the most extraordinary way.\n  I visited what was then Peking, in our usage, in 1975. The air was \nnot breathable.\n  At that time, or just previously, the Mao government put out large \nmatters about biological warfare by the United States which required \nthe citizens to wear white masks during the day. Certainly it wasn't \nbiological warfare; it was the air quality. It is not what it should be \ntoday. It is vastly better than what it was, and it will be vastly \nbetter yet as economic development proceeds.\n  So with a measure of regret and great respect, I have to urge our \nMembers to vote against this otherwise admirable amendment. On another \nvehicle, at another time, yes, but not this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, 20 minutes on the Byrd amendment, from our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from Iowa for \nyielding. While my time will be charged against the majority time on \nthe Byrd amendment, I want to talk about the bill itself.\n  Mr. President, you run for a high office such as the Senate because \nyou want to have an opportunity to have an effect on people's lives. \nYou hope that effect you have is going to be a positive one. What we \nhave political parties and debate for is to determine which policies \nare positive and which are negative in terms of their impact on people. \nI would have to say I have seldom had an opportunity to speak on an \nissue or to vote on legislation that I think is more important for the \nfuture of every American and more important for all the people who live \non this planet than the issue of establishing normal trade relations \nwith China.\n  I would like to try to look at this in more of a historic context, to \ntry to define why I think this is such a big deal and why this is so \nimportant to every person living on the planet. In 1948, from the \nrubble of World War II, a group of 23 nations got together to form an \norganization that became known as the GATT. What that organization was \ntrying to do was to learn from the experiences of the 20th century, to \nlearn from the experiences of the Great Depression where we turned a \nrecession into a depression with protectionism and protective tariffs, \nto learn from the terrible experiences of a world war.\n  Those nations had a vision, in 1948, to set up a world trading system \nso that people could produce goods and services and sell them all over \nthe world so that countries would not end up getting into wars over \nresources, because resources would be freely traded. And since people \nliving anywhere could specialize doing the things they did best, those \nnations believed the welfare of each individual citizen and all \ncitizens combined would be enhanced.\n  Remarkably, those 23 nations that set up what we know today as the \nworld's trading system included China. In 1948, 52 years ago, China \njoined the United States, Great Britain, and other countries with a \ndream of promoting world trade. But then, in 1949, just 1 year later, \nsomething happened. What happened was China took the wrong turn. China \nturned to the dark side. China listened to politicians who said they \nwere for the people and not for the privileged. China thought they \ncould create wealth by tearing down wealth. China thought you could \nbuild up somebody by tearing down somebody else. So they set about \ncreating what Chairman Mao called a ``ladder to paradise.'' The net \nresult was the destruction of capital, the destruction of private \nproperty, the destruction of any kind of modern system for economic \ndevelopment--and untold suffering and poverty for the Chinese people. \nRemarkably, a country with among the most able people in the world \nfound itself among the poorest countries on the planet. China had \nachieved the Marxist dream of making people equal--but it was an \nequality in poverty and hopelessness. I should say that it was equality \nfor everybody except a small number of political leaders; they seem to \nnever be equal.\n  If anybody needs any numerical examples of what a difference economic \nfreedom makes, listen to these numbers. In 1949, mainland China and \nTaiwan had roughly equal per capita incomes. The mainland had all the \nnatural resources, and obviously they had the same kind of people. By \n1978, by promoting world trade, protecting private property, and \nincreasingly allowing people to make economic choices for themselves, \nthe per capita income of Taiwan had risen to $1,560 a year. In \ncontrast, per capita income on the mainland was a wretched $188 a year. \nToday, the per capita income of Taiwan is over $13,000 a year. And \nwhile China has started to turn from the dark side, while dramatic \nchanges are underway in China, per capita income there is currently \nonly $790 a year.\n  Why is this vote so important? The vote is so important because in \n1948 China was one of 23 nations that shared our dream of an open world \nwith relatively free trade. Then in 1949 they turned to the dark side, \nand the Chinese people paid a terrible price for that decision. Today, \n52 years after helping to found what now is the World Trade \nOrganization, China is back knocking on the door, in essence saying we \ndid the wrong thing by turning to the dark side 51 years ago, and now \nwe want to come back and join the rest of the world in the free \nexchange of goods and services.\n  This is an important occasion, it seems to me, because we have to \nanswer the question: Are we going to open the door or are we going to \nslam the door in their face?\n  We often get carried away around here in thinking that if people are \nnot perfect, they are not good enough. We have heard a lot of \ncriticisms about China on the floor of the Senate, and they are the \nsame criticisms heard around the country. Based on the facts I would \nsay the criticisms are absolutely correct.\n  The two arguments we have heard more than any other argument in this \ndebate are, No. 1, there is relatively little religious freedom in \nmodern China. Obviously, that is true. I remember when Senator McCain \nand I were in Beijing and we were visiting with the President of China. \nWe had raised the question about Tibet and about religious freedom. He \nsaid: We do not object to people practicing religion. It is \nproselytizing we object to.\n  I said: Mr. President, you don't know proselytizing. Wait until the \nBaptists and the Mormons get over here. You haven't seen proselytizing.\n  When people think they have found something in religion, they want to \nshare it. But in China they do not have a conception of what religious \nfreedom is. If we are going to trade only with countries that have \ngranted its people the full range of religious freedom, China today \nfails on that account. But that is not the right question. The right \nquestion is, Will there be more religious freedom in China tomorrow \nthan today if we reject this agreement, or will there be more religious \nfreedom if we accept it?\n  I tried during that meeting, and have on several subsequent occasions \nin meeting with Chinese leaders, to explain that freedom is like \npregnancy. You cannot have just a little of it. It takes on its own \nlife. When people have economic freedom, they want political freedom. \nWhen people have a right to own property and make decisions about their \nown future, they want the ability to make decisions about their own \nleaders. We have seen it in Taiwan. We have seen it in Korea. It is \nchanging the world, and it will change China.\n  For our colleagues who say they object to religious suppression in \nChina, so do I. I object to it, and that is one of the reasons I am for \nnormal trade relations with China. I believe that based on all of our \nhistoric experience, trade will change China. The ability of people to \ntrade and, in the process, to experience prosperity and have the \neconomic freedom that comes from the ability to buy American products, \nto know the joy of wearing cotton underwear made out of Texas and \nAmerican cotton, to get the ability to own stock in America, to get the \nability to own bank accounts denominated in U.S. dollars--all of that \nis provided in this agreement.\n  Once you have a bank account with U.S. dollars in it, you are \nfundamentally changed forever. You want your right to have your say, \nand you want the right not only to make decisions in your family, but \nyou want the right to ultimately affect decisions of your country, and \nyou want the right to worship God as you choose. When you have economic \nfreedom and the prosperity it brings, you ultimately have the power to \nget religious freedom.\n  Many of our colleagues say that the Chinese do not respect workers' \nrights, and they do not. If one was going to judge this agreement based \non how workers are treated, how do you expect a country to treat \nworkers when most people work for the government? How do you think this \ncountry would treat workers if we all worked for the government? \nWorkers end up being treated well because they have opportunities, \nbecause if they do not like how they are being treated on this job, \nthey can quit and go to work somewhere else.\n  We hear the AFL-CIO talk about workers' rights in China. If they \nreally\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\ncared about workers' rights in China, they would be for this agreement \nbecause what this agreement is going to mean is more trade, more \ncapital, more competition, more freedom, a larger number of employers \nin China and, therefore, the freedom that people will have to quit \nworking for the government and government-sponsored enterprises and \nwork in the private sector.\n  I am not here to argue today that we ought to agree to normal trade \nrelations with China because China treats its workers well. I am here \nto argue for normal trade relations with China because if we have \nnormal trade relations with China, workers will be treated better \nbecause they will have more opportunities, they will have more freedom.\n  There are some people who make the most fraudulent argument of all, \nand that is the argument that they oppose normal trade relations with \nChina because China does not protect its environment, or because China \nmakes decisions about its environment to which we object. If you really \ncare about the environment in China--and they are part of the \nenvironment of the planet on which we live--you should be for this \nagreement because what poor country protects its environment? What \ncountry with a per capita income of $790 a year has the luxury of being \nconcerned about its environment? I can answer that. None.\n  If you want the environment to be better protected in China, you want \nmore economic growth, more economic freedom, more prosperity so that \npeople have the luxury of being concerned about the environment.\n  I am not here today to say people who say there is no religious \nfreedom in China are wrong. I am not here today to say that the people \nwho say workers' rights are not respected in China are wrong. I am not \nhere to say people are wrong when they say that China does not protect \ntheir environment. They are right.\n  The question is not what is China like today; the question is what \nwill China be like tomorrow. The answer will be based on what we do in \nterms of either opening this door to let them into the world of trade, \nor slamming the door in their face.\n  There are other people who say if we let China in, ultimately that is \ngoing to mean that when we go to Wal-Mart, that shirts are going to be \ncheaper, that sweaters are going to be cheaper, that clothing is going \nto be cheaper, that implements are going to be cheaper, and that that \nis a bad thing because they could be made in America. I reject that. I \nthink it is a plus. I thank God every day that people can go to Wal-\nMart and buy clothing that is inexpensive. Few benefactors in the \nhistory of America or the world have done more than Wal-Mart to benefit \nordinary people. The Chinese can produce quality goods that the people \nof Texas want to buy. I believe in freedom, and part of freedom is the \nright to buy something if it is legally traded and if it benefits your \nfamily.\n  What do we get from these agreements? We have heard a lot of talk \nabout the fact that we get a 17-percent reduction in average tariffs on \nagriculture. I can assure you that is going to be good news for our \ncorn producers in Texas. It is going to be good news for our cotton \nproducers. We believe that as the Chinese get an opportunity to eat \nTexas beef, they are going to like it, and as their income grows, they \nare going to want a lot more of it.\n  We also believe that lowering industrial tariffs in China from an \naverage of 25 percent to an average of 9 percent is going to be a \ndramatic boom to U.S. manufacturing, especially the manufacturing of \nhigh-quality items in high-wage industries, such as our high-tech \nindustries. We believe we will benefit.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, I wish to touch on three other \nindustries that are also going to benefit. My colleagues know that we \nin America produce financial services better and more efficiently and \nmore abundantly than any other country in the world. Needless to say, \nthis is a high-wage industry. It is one in which we dominate the world, \nand we want to continue it. I will touch briefly on a couple of these \nindustries.\n  In the insurance market in China today, there is an ad hoc system \nwhere U.S. and foreign insurers get a license to operate based on \npolitical favor, on good fortune, or having been there first.\n  And as an insurer, you have very real limits on where you can sell \nyour products.\n  Under the November 15 agreement, China will grant licenses without \nquantitative limits or needs testing to qualified foreign insurers. \nAmerican insurance companies will be able to sell in China. And China's \ngeographic limits on where foreign insurers can sell insurance products \nwill be phased out over a 3-year period.\n  Don't you think it will be good for people in China to get an \nopportunity to own a piece of the ``rock''? It seems to me that if \nanything ties us together and promotes peace and trade, it is having \npeople in China be able to invest in American insurance companies, or \nbuy IRAs, or enter into 401(k) retirement programs where the money is \ninvested in the United States of America and around the world. Clearly \nwe all benefit from that.\n  Today, foreign banks in China can engage only in commercial banking \nif they are located in 20 specific cities. Foreign banks can only offer \nbanking products in foreign currency. That means that for most people \nin China, they do not have access to American banks. It's an extremely \nlimited ability to operate. Basically, what foreign banks have to do is \nto get Chinese partners, which means they basically must give part of \ntheir business away for the right to operate in China.\n  But under the November 15 agreement, all geographic restrictions on \nforeign banking in China will be lifted within 5 years. American banks \nwill be able to own 100 percent of their banking operations in China.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will grant the 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And within 5 years, American banks will be able to do \nbanking business in Chinese currency.\n  I cannot imagine how the world won't be better off when people \nworking in China can bank in American banks, and use American banking \nproducts. If that is not the essence of freedom, I don't know what is.\n  It's a similar story for our securities industry. Today, there are \nvery real limits on American securities firms' activities in China, and \non the ability of U.S. companies to invest and to have clear operating \nownership. Those restrictions will be significantly modified for the \nbenefit of our industry as well as the Chinese.\n  To sum up, with the implementation of the November 15 agreement and \nthe adoption of this PNTR legislation, the American financial sector as \nwell as our industry and agricultural sectors will have an \nextraordinary opportunity to compete in a growing market of 1.2 billion \nconsumers.\n  It is seldom in the Senate that you vote on something that represents \nhistory in the making. A lot of what we do here--and a lot of what \neverybody does in every job in the world--is a bunch of little things \nabout which they don't necessarily get excited. Today, we have an \nopportunity to work on something that is critically important, \nsomething that truly will dramatically improve the world in which we \nlive.\n  I am very strongly in favor of the pending PNTR legislation. I am \nopposed to amending this legislation. There are many good ideas for \namendments, but the bottom line is this is something that is important. \nThis is something that is historic. We need to get on with it, without \ntacking on amendments.\n  I thank our colleague very much for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, I understand the pending amendment is that of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. My remarks are not to that \namendment, or at least the first part of my remarks, but more general \nin nature on the entire debate in reference to PNTR.\n  I believe that the issue before us--whether or not to improve what is \ncalled the permanent normal trade relations with China--is the Senate's \nfirst critical--very critical--foreign policy test of the 21st century.\n  It seems to me that we are poised at a crossroads. Our future depends \non the right decision.\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for a very comprehensive \nreview of the issues that will affect our daily lives and pocketbooks, \nboth in China and the United States--more particularly the United \nStates. I associate myself with his remarks.\n  Do we approve PNTR and demonstrate to China, and just as importantly, \nif not more, to the world, that diplomacy through commerce is a formula \nfor stability and progress or do we vote PNTR down and miss the \nopportunity to become linked with one-fifth of the world's population?\n  I, for one, hope we summon the wisdom and the courage to remain \nengaged by appropriately approving the legislation that is before us \nwithout amendments. To do otherwise would be a very serious mistake.\n  I strongly support this legislation. However, some of my colleagues \nhave argued, and will continue to argue, that America should refuse to \ndo business with China. They cite the possibility of job loss, trade \ndeficits, international disputes, and human rights, not to mention \nnational security concerns, as reasons to isolate and to ostracize \nChina.\n  On the contrary, it seems to me that approving PNTR and validating \nthe trade agreement--which requires China to drastically reduce its \ntariffs, eliminate trade barriers, and remove restrictions on foreign \ninvestment and trading and distribution rights--will benefit American \nworkers and farmers and businesses.\n  These new market opportunities will support U.S. jobs and U.S. \neconomic expansion into the new century, not to mention assisting the \nChinese to become more familiar with and ascribe to the rule of law. \nThis issue cuts across all areas of America.\n  To illustrate the broad importance of China trade, let me use some \nexamples from my home State of Kansas. Boeing is the world's largest \naircraft exporter. It employs 18,000 people in Kansas, with a payroll \nof $1 billion, where 80 percent of that production--80 percent of that \n$1 billion that accrues to Kansas--is export related.\n  In 1994, Boeing exported 25 percent of all Kansas production to \nChina. In the future, China plans to buy large numbers of regional \naircraft which are made at the Boeing plant in Wichita. But if the \nSenate should fail to approve this bill--amendment free--Boeing will \nsuffer a huge competitive disadvantage in the huge Chinese market, and \nthese valuable contracts will go to a European competitor, not to \nmention the loss of jobs in Wichita.\n  Likewise, PNTR will have a similar impact on agriculture, an industry \nwhere one-third of all goods are bound for export markets.\n  In 1998, Kansas farms exported $58 million worth of goods to China. \nThis agreement increases the market access and grants distribution \nrights for corn, beans, wheat, beef, pork, and fertilizer--all of the \nagricultural products so vital to us in regards to our balance of \npayments as well.\n  China soon may be able to purchase the entire annual wheat crop of \nKansas. I certainly hope that would be the case, more especially with \nthe price today at the country elevator.\n  My good friend and Kansas native, Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman, estimates that passing PNTR will mean an additional $2 \nbillion per year in total U.S. farm exports to China in just several \nyears.\n  Engaging China will benefit our other Kansas businesses.\n  Let me go back and reflect a minute before I get into the other jobs \nthat are directly affected in other industries.\n  We had quite a discussion, it seems to me, before we broke for the \nAugust recess about the appropriations and the authorization for \nagriculture. I think it was reflective of the $5.5 billion in emergency \nlost income payments, $7.5 billion, as I recall, for the new crop \ninsurance reform, some emergency assistance because of hard-hit areas \nof the United States, where farmers and ranchers are going through a \ndifficult time.\n  People totaled up last year's expenditures and this year's \nexpenditures. The difference this time around is that we budgeted this \nmoney. It does not come out of emergency funds. There was a real \nconcern expressed by many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nand that side of the aisle about these expenditures, and saying: My \ngoodness, we are spending a record amount for agriculture.\n  I didn't hear too much debate in that arena as to the cause, as to \nwhy we are going through a world price decline, not only the United \nStates but farmers everywhere, all around the world. There have been 3 \nrecord years of crops worldwide, sanctions on 71 countries, not using \nall the export programs, the value of the dollar hindering our exports, \nthe Asian market in real decline, and the same thing for South America. \nThe list goes on and on. Not too much debate with regard to the cause, \nwhat is happening to worldwide agriculture prices, and why this outflow \nof expenditures, yes, to subsidize American agriculture at record \nlevels, and a lot of concern about, wait a minute, we are not going to \nhave one more nickel go to agriculture that is first not authorized and \nappropriated. I agree with that; I think that is the way it ought to \nbe.\n  We have done some very good things in this session in behalf of \nagriculture. My point is, if we do not pass this trade bill, if we do \nnot have an aggressive and consistent agricultural policy with regard \nto exports, we really should not be hearing too much criticism about \none nickel more going to agriculture--if we shut down these markets and \nsay we are not going to trade with one-fifth of the world's population. \nThat is one of the things we should consider as the law of unintended \neffects. If in fact this bill does not pass, it is going to cause a \ntrade disruption such that one could hardly imagine. We will be going \ninto the next century with our trade policy in real tatters.\n  Engaging China will benefit our other Kansas businesses--I am trying \nto point out the effect of this bill in a macro way in Kansas, micro in \nterms of the Nation--large and small businesses. Let's try Payless Shoe \nSource, Inc., 2,000 Kansas employees; Black & Veatch production is \nexport related, a major international engineering firm with offices in \nthe Kansas City area; a business called Superior Boiler Works of \nHutchinson, KS, which provides industrial boilers for building projects \nin China--you might not think Hutchinson, KS, is where we are providing \nmost of the boiler projects for that huge nation, but that is the \ncase--several ventures in China by Koch Industries of Wichita. Clearly, \nthe stakes are high, thousands of jobs. One out of four jobs in Kansas \ndepends on trade. I use the Kansas example only for illustration. All \n50 States will certainly benefit as well.\n  I don't think we need to be misled by charges that a vote against \nPNTR is a vote to protect American jobs. I just don't think that is \ncorrect. There are winners and losers in regard to all trade \nagreements. As a matter of fact, I think in some ways, when we talk \nabout this issue or any trade pact, they are sometimes oversold. They \nare not a panacea. There are winners and there are some losers. A trade \nagreement is nothing more than, nothing less than, a working agreement \nto try to settle the differences you are going to have with your \ntrading partners and competitors anyway. At least you have some \nstructure there and a rule of law where you can reach a logical \nconclusion and strike an agreement to have much better trade relations. \nI know they are overcriticized. If I say they are oversold, they \nprobably are. They are certainly overcriticized.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently pointed out:\n\n       It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has \n     impacted the level of total employment over the long run. \n     Indeed we are currently experiencing the widest trade deficit \n     in history with a level of unemployment close to record lows.\n\n  Trade-related jobs pay Americans 15 percent more than the average \nnational wage. Free trade with China will provide unrestricted access \nto a wider variety of goods and services at lower prices and better \nquality. The distinguished Senator from Texas certainly gave that \nexample in his remarks. In short, international trade raises real wages \nwith virtually no downside risk to job security.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and chairman of the \nArmed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, I have very serious \nconcerns about China emerging as a more significant military threat, \nespecially in the area of thermonuclear weapons and the proliferation \nof that\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nweaponry. I know it is a problem. It is a very serious problem. It is a \nnational security concern. However, it seems to me that is not a reason \nto erect a trade barrier, nor is it an excuse to add what I would \nconsider to be an amendment conceived with good intentions but a \ncounterproductive and redundant amendment.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Tennessee should be on the \nfloor shortly to offer an amendment or a freestanding bill, or whatever \nhe so chooses, to address the proliferation issue. I share his concern. \nI share his sense of frustration. Secretary Albright, Secretary of \nDefense Cohen, and a panel of experts went to China over the break and \ndid not achieve the progress we all wanted to see with regard to their \ntalks with the Chinese, more especially with the Chinese concern over \nnational missile defense. That is a real challenge. That is a problem. \nThat is a national security challenge. It seems to me we don't solve it \nby putting an amendment on a trade bill. Quite the opposite. Trade has \na stabilizing effect on international relations. The more the two \nnations trade and invest economically in each other, the less likely \nthey are to engage in military conflict.\n  If we don't trade, if we isolate China, it isn't a question of \nwhether or not they will join the WTO. We will turn a lot of the \ndecisionmaking over to the two military general authors who say by 2020 \nthey hope China will be a superpower equal to that of the United \nStates. I know that is where they want to go. If we are able to \nestablish a better trading relationship and engagement, all those \ndecisions will not then be turned over to the nationalists, the \nhardliners, and all of the military generals.\n  Since the Thompson amendment seems to enjoy more than nominal \nsupport--and why shouldn't it? The Senator has worked very hard on this \nparticular issue; he is modifying it almost each day to try get more \nsupport. I understand the concern and frustration on the part of many \nMembers who want to send a signal to the Chinese. At that point, it \nseems to me there is some growing support for the amendment. But I \nwould like to highlight the importance of passing H.R. 4444 without \namendments.\n  No matter how politically tempting or national security tempting a \nparticular amendment may be, a vote for an amendment serves ultimately \nas a vote against PNTR. We have other avenues by which we can safeguard \nour national security interests. They are well known to all Members of \nthe Senate. I will not go into that. To attach an amendment to this \nbill would be a grave mistake. I think Senators should consider that \naccordingly.\n  My former House colleagues have assured me they will not take another \nvote on PNTR. I know that assurance or that talk is not taken seriously \nby some in this body. I can't tell the Senate how serious it really is, \nbut it seems to me when they look me in the eye and say: Senator \nRoberts, if we do this, there will not be a vote in the House, then we \nwill have a trade disaster on our hands. That will be our \nresponsibility. In short, it is now or never for PNTR. And never is not \nan alternative.\n  In addition to the proliferation concerns, I also find China's record \non human rights and its religious oppression unacceptable. However, \nhistory proves the best manner to inspire change is through engagement \nand trade, not isolation, turning the decisionmaking, again, over to \nthose who are now in favor of the oppression. When Deng Xiaoping took \npower in 1978, 2 years after Mao's death, he opened China to trade and \nforeign investment.\n  And the change in the economy and the human condition in China was \ndramatic--outstandingly dramatic. China's gross domestic product grew \nat an average of 9.7 percent a year for almost two decades. That is an \nincredible growth. Its share of world GDP rose from 5 percent in 1978 \nto 11.8 percent by 1998, only 2 years ago. Its income per person rose \nsix times as fast as the world average when they opened it up to trade. \nSo you can see what kind of economic opportunity, what kind of economic \nwherewithal, and what kind of improvement there was in the daily lives \nand the pocketbooks of each Chinese individual. You can see what \nhappened.\n  More importantly, 20 percent of the population--200 million people--\nwere lifted above the subsistence line. The most dramatic increase in \nthe standard of living in the history of the world gave the Chinese \npeople the ability to purchase televisions, washing machines and, \nincreasingly, computers and mobile phones with Internet access, to \nbecome members of a modern global society, in terms of information and \ntransparency in regard to freedom and economic opportunity.\n  Above all, the economic changes are quickly and dramatically \nimproving personal freedom for the average Chinese citizen. Despite the \nCommunist Government, millions of Chinese now have access to foreign \nmagazines and newspapers, copiers, satellite TV dishes, and the \nInternet, where they can learn about capitalism, freedom, and \ndemocracy, and it is catching. Internet access, which American \ncompanies are quite willing to provide, will only accelerate this \nprocess.\n  Finally, it should be stressed that congressional approval of PNTR \nfor China is not a decision on whether China becomes a member of the \nWorld Trade Organization. That is not the case. That is not the issue. \nChina will become a member of that world trade group, hopefully, later \nthis year, regardless of our decision. It means we will be locked out \nof the trade benefits, the agreements that have been so long pursued. \nIt means the PNTR vote will determine how the United States deals with \nthis huge nation as it becomes a WTO member. That is exceedingly \nimportant.\n  Approval gives Americans entry to Chinese markets and provides an \navenue for influence. Disapproval ensures we are shut out while China \ndoes business with the rest of the world.\n  With that in mind, I strongly urge my Senate colleagues to lead \nAmerica down the engagement path toward prosperity and peace by \npromptly approving the PNTR legislation, amendment free.\n  I will repeat the one thing I underscored when I started my remarks. \nIt is basically a test to demonstrate to the rest of the world and to \nChina that diplomacy through commerce is a formula for stability. I \nbelieve that. That is what this vote is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas controls 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes at this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this 15 minutes will be on another \nsubject. I have sought recognition to introduce legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only has 8\\1/2\\ minutes to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will need 15 total.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 6\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nfor a total of 15 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are located in today's Record under \nMorning Business.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has offered \nan amendment which highlights that China has enormous reserves of coal \nwhich that country will in all likelihood rely on greatly to fuel power \nplants as its economy continues to expand and modernize.\n  I commend Senator Byrd for his effort to support the transfer of \nclean coal technologies to China as part of our foreign assistance \nprograms. The coal in the hills and mountains of China has high \nconcentrations of sulfur and mercury. The United States should \nencourage the use of technologies that will reduce emissions of harmful \nsubstances and improve generation efficiency.\n  While I support the amendment offered by Senator Byrd, I strongly \nencourage the Administration to also promote the use of renewable \nenergy technologies in China. Coal may be a plentiful resource in China \nbut that country should also utilize other energy technologies to \nprovide power for their growing economy such as wind, solar and \nbiomass. The United States and many European countries have developed \nlow cost power generation technologies in all of these areas of \nrenewable energy. Our foreign policy\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\nshould vigorously promote these technologies as well as clean coal \ntechnology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls the \nremaining time on the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 minutes and 9 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again, I ask the clerk to read my \namendment in the Record so it appears once again before the Senate \ntakes a vote.\n  That time will not be charged to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 69, after line 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 702. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR THE TRANSFER OF CLEAN \n                   ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS WITH RESPECT TO CHINA'S ENERGY SECTOR.\n\n       (a)(1) the People's Republic of China faces significant \n     environmental and energy infrastructure development \n     challenges in the coming century;\n       (2) economic growth and environmental protection should be \n     fostered simultaneously;\n       (3) China has been recently attempting to strengthen public \n     health standards, protect natural resources, improve water \n     and air quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions levels \n     while striving to expand its economy;\n       (4) the United States is a leader in a range of clean \n     energy technologies; and\n       (5) the environment and energy infrastructure development \n     are issues that are equally important to both nations, and \n     therefore, the United States should work with China to \n     encourage the use of American-made clean energy technologies.\n       (b) Support for Clean Energy Technology.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, each department, agency, or other \n     entity of the United States carrying out an assistance \n     program in support of the activities of United States persons \n     in the environment and energy sector of the People's Republic \n     of China shall support, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     the transfer of United States clean energy technology as part \n     of that program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the departments, agencies, and entities \n     of the United States described in subsection (b) such sums as \n     may be necessary to support the transfer of clean energy \n     technology, consistent with the subsidy codes of the World \n     Trade Organization, as part of assistance programs carried \n     out by those departments, agencies, and entities in support \n     of activities of United States persons in the energy sector \n     of the People's Republic of China.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the clerk.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this is a pro-business amendment. It is \na pro-environment amendment. It is a pro-labor amendment. It is a pro-\nAmerica amendment. It is a pro-commonsense amendment. The amendment \nhelps businesses to get clean energy technologies into the Chinese \nmarket. The amendment helps to clean the water and the air.\n  I have a book by the distinguished Vice President, Mr. Gore, entitled \n``Earth in the Balance.'' This is where we can start to clean up the \nEarth. This amendment helps to clean the water and the air. It helps to \nreduce global climate change, and helps America use our resources and \nwould help China to use its resources more efficiently.\n  Finally, this amendment promotes American-made clean energy \ntechnologies that help the U.S. economy. Who can be against that? I \nhaven't heard one word in these 3 hours, not one word, of criticism \nconcerning my amendment. Not one word by way of attacking my amendment \non its merits. As a matter of fact, not many Senators--two or three \nonly--have spoken a few short words in opposition to the amendment, but \ntheir arguments are not going to the merits of the amendment. As a \nmatter of fact, I believe the Senators who have spoken would probably \nsupport this amendment if it were on some other bill.\n  I have crafted this amendment so that every Senator's interests are \nrepresented. Here is one of the cleanest, purest amendments that has \never been read at the desk where the clerk sits. Nobody is opposed to \nanything that is in the amendment. There hasn't been a word, not a \nsingle word spoken against this amendment. So it is a win-win \nopportunity that we should take advantage of today.\n  The only problem is that Senators have blinders on. I can remember \nback in 1947 when the State of West Virginia had 97,600 farms, had \n97,000 horses, and 6,000 mules. When farmers use their horses, they put \nblinders on them. I am sure Senators understand what blinders are. They \nkeep the horses from seeing an automobile and shying away from it, \npossibly running away, wrecking the wagon or the buggy, and ending up \nkilling the passenger.\n  Senators who oppose this today say quite openly and frankly that they \noppose it because any amendment adopted to this bill might kill the \nbill. This is not a killer amendment. I know a killer amendment when I \nsee one. This is not a killer amendment. I have no interest in killing \nthis bill by this amendment or any other amendment. I will vote against \nthe bill. But I have not engaged in any dilatory tactics. I haven't \nengaged in any filibuster. I voted to take up the bill. I am not \ninterested in killing it through dilatory actions. I am interested in \nimproving it. This bill is going to pass the Senate. I read the \nhandwriting on the wall. Belshazzar is not the only person who can see \nhandwriting on the wall. I can read the handwriting on the wall. We \nhave absolutely no chance of killing the bill if that is what we want \nto do. I prefer to improve it. It could be improved to the point that I \nwould vote for it, but it will pass whether I vote for it or not.\n  This is no killer amendment. This amendment is a highly beneficial \namendment to our own country, to the working people, to the \nbusinesspeople of this country, to the environmentalists and to the \nenvironment, to industry, to the Chinese. I have gone over that already \nso I won't repeat it again. It is not a killer amendment. I plead with \nSenators to take off the blinders on this amendment. Take them off. \nTake off your blinders, Senators, and smudge that line that has been \ndrawn in the sand. Take a good look at this amendment. That is why I \nhave had it read again, just before voting on it. Take a good look at \nit. This amendment is no killer amendment. It is a sugar pill, candy-\ncoated peppermint pill. There is no hidden ingredient. There is no \narsenic here; no bitter aftertaste. It will not leave halitosis. It is \na sugar-coated amendment.\n\n  This amendment will help our trading relations with China because it \ncan help to assuage environmental concerns about China's coming rapid \ngrowth. It will help China. It will help the business community in our \nown country because it will encourage and enhance the marketability of \nclean energy technology in China. God knows they are going to need it. \nThey are going to need it. It will help those businesses employ more \npeople as they develop and sell these new energy technologies. \nEverybody benefits, everybody. And I believe the amendment would pass \nthe House, if the House were given an opportunity to vote on this \namendment.\n  But the Senators who oppose this amendment do not want that to \nhappen. They don't want the House to have an opportunity to debate this \namendment. They don't want the House to vote on this amendment. But it \nwould pass the House, probably with flying colors. It is an opportunity \nthat should not be missed just because some Members have taken what \nwould amount to a blood oath to oppose all amendments--oppose all \namendments.\n  It is a winning horse, a winning horse. You can't do better over at \nCharles Town at the races, I say to my friend from Delaware. You can't \nfind a better horse over at Charles Town, just 75 miles from here. Go \nover there and see the winning horses.\n  But this is a winning horse that I have brought in here today; a \nwinning horse. Look at its teeth, open its mouth--it is a winning \nhorse. It is just waiting, just waiting, waiting patiently, may I say \nto the Senator from Massachusetts before he egresses from the Chamber, \nthis is a horse that is just waiting to collect the prize. And all we \nhave to do is say, ``giddy-up, giddy-up.'' It is my amendment that I am \ntalking about--a winning horse.\n  Senators, let this pony run. Don't draw the line in the sand. Don't \nsay no. Don't close one's ears, like Odysseus was told by Circe to put \nwax in his ears so that he wouldn't hear the singing sirens. Take the \nwax out of your ears. Let this pony run. I plead with Members to take \noff the blindfolds and look at this amendment on its many, many merits.\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\n  This will not hurt, Senators. Put just one toe, the big toe or the \nlittle toe, over that line in the sand that you have drawn. There is an \noasis of benefits for everybody on the other side of the line. Take \nthis step, take this brave, single step and cross over into the \npromised land, freed from the shackles of the oath that binds you.\n  A poem comes to my mind, written by J.G. Holland.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Fifteen minutes, 20 seconds.\n  I can't find my poem--ah, my trusty aide has found it. I don't need \nit anyhow.\n\n     God, give us men. A time like this demands\n     Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\n     Men who can stand before a demagog\n     And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men sun-crowned, who live above the fog\n     In public duty and in private thinking;\n     For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,\n     Their large professions and their little deeds,\n     Mingle in selfish strife, lo. Freedom weeps,\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men.\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty,\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character; men of sterling worth.\n     Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the earth.\n     God, give us men.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time. I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote occur, up or down, on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank all Senators \nfor listening. And in particular I thank the distinguished manager of \nthe bill, a venerable Senator whom I greatly admire, and with whom I \noften talk. We engage each other in conversation about our little dogs. \nHe has a little dog. I have a little dog. It recalls to my attention an \nold song, an old fiddle song:\n\n       You better stop kicking my dog around.\n       Every time I come to town,\n       The boys start kicking my dog around.\n       Whether he's a poodle or whether he's a hound,\n       You better stop kicking my dog around.\n\n  That is the way the Senator from Delaware and I feel about it. I \ntreasure his friendship. He has been a fine manager on this bill. But \nhe is wrong in taking the position that he should vote against my \namendment.\n  I also thank my friend on this side of the aisle, Mr. Moynihan; as \nalways, a gentleman and scholar. I thank him for the way he has \nconducted himself on this amendment and on other bills.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call for \nthe quorum be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4115. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHollings be recognized to offer an amendment, that there be 1 hour \nequally divided in the usual form prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment, and that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to a \nvote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4122 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4122.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provision terminating the application of \n chapter 1 of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 and the effective date \nprovisions, but provide for accession of the People's Republic of China \n                    to the World Trade Organization)\n\n       On page 4, beginning with line 4, strike through line 18 on \n     page 5 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101. ACCESSION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO THE \n                   WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Pursuant to the provisions of section 122 of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3532), the President shall \n     transmit a report to Congress certifying that the terms and \n     conditions for the accession of the People's Republic of \n     China to the World Trade Organization are at least equivalent \n     to those agreed between the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China on November 15, 1999.\n       On page 5, line 19, strike ``SEC. 103.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     102.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am reading the words of art here. That \nis why I have drawn this particular amendment because I thought there \nmight be a question of germaneness. You cannot tell from reading \nwithout reference what exactly this amendment does. But in a line, it \ndoes away with the ``P'' of PNTR, the ``permanent'' normal trade \nrelations, so that we can annually, as we have in the past, fulfill the \nobligation referred to by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nwho knows better than any our Constitution, article I, section 8. I \nalmost have to demonstrate, like my forbearer, L. Mendel Rivers, the \ndistinguished Congressman from Charleston, SC, who used to head up\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\nArmed Services. He would bring up the Secretary of Defense. He would \nsay, Robert Strange McNamara, not the President, not the Supreme Court, \nbut the Congress shall raise and support armies.\n  Similarly, not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the \nCongress, under article I, section 8, shall regulate foreign commerce. \nNow word has it the ``Philistines'' got the fix on; we can't regulate \nanything. As the distinguished Senator pointed out in the previous \ndebate on the amendment, there is no debate. They fix the Finance \nCommittee, and once they--the leadership on both sides--get that, then \nthey see how many votes they need and they wait until now to give us a \nlittle time, when we are about to leave for the Presidential campaign \nin another 3 weeks. You would think we would have a chance to debate \nand exchange ideas about the significance of a $350 billion to $400 \nbillion trade deficit. But not at all. Nobody to listen or to exchange \nvows and no debate whatsoever. It is very unfortunate.\n  PNTR, to bring it right into focus--and the reason we submit this \nparticular amendment has nothing to do with opening up China. They say \nwith this agreement and with going into the World Trade Organization, \nwe are going to open up China. Not at all. We have had an agreement \nwith Japan, and Japan has been in the WTO for 5 years, and it has yet \nto open up the Japanese market.\n  PNTR has not a thing to do with jobs in America, either. My friend, \nthe director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tom Donahue, says \nPNTR will create 800,000 jobs. I can show you we will lose at least \n800,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. I will get that \nparticular study later.\n  When they had the House vote and a headline in the Wall Street \nJournal, there was a footrace for investment in China. But it's not \nthat we are going to start hiring more in America because we are going \nto have increased production and increased exports and increased jobs, \nnot at all.\n  So it is not about exports whatsoever. We have a $70 billion deficit \nin our balance of trade with China, and I will bet you that it \nincreases. Does anybody want to take on the bet? Name the amount, name \nthe odds; the bet is on.\n  This deficit is going to increase with or without this particular \namendment. And it has nothing to do with technology. We already have a \n$3.2 billion deficit in the balance of trade in high-tech with the \nPeople's Republic of China that will approximate $5 billion alone just \nthis year.\n  It has really nothing to do with the environment and labor. I \nsupported strongly the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. \nBut, mind you me, it took us 200 years and more to get around to the \nenvironment, to get around to a safe working place and everything else \nof that kind.\n  It has nothing to do with human rights. The first human right is to \nfeed 1.3 billion. The second human right is to house the 1.3 billion. \nThe third human right is to educate. And the fourth human right, of \ncourse, is one man/one vote. Many here in the Congress have been \ntouting one man/one vote. Without education, you have total chaos. As a \nresult, you are not going to have a PNTR agreement that will improve \nhuman rights. They have used traumatic control. We oppose that; we \ndon't like it. But run a country of 1.3 billion and let demonstrations \nget out of hand, and you have total chaos and no progress or \nimprovement.\n  So it is really not about undermining the Communist regime. I have \nheard that on the floor. On the contrary. The Communist regime is \nunanimously in favor of PNTR. They know what they are doing. We don't \nknow what we are doing. It is not about China obeying its agreements, \nit is about the United States enforcing ours.\n  I don't know where the fanciful thought has come from that somehow we \nhave to continue like this, after 50 years of almost losing our entire \nmanufacturing capacity, whereas Japan--a little country of 126 \nmillion--takes on 280 million Americans and almost outmanufactures and \noutproduces the United States of America. We are losing our economic \nstrength. We are losing our middle class that is the backbone of that \neconomic strength. ``The strength of a democracy is its middle class,'' \nsaid Aristotle. We put in yesterday a particular article from Fortune \nmagazine about the disparity between the rich and the poor and how the \nmiddle class is disappearing.\n\n  This has to do with the United States competing in international \ntrade, the global economy. That is why I put up this amendment, so that \nwe won't get it done in the year 2000. There is too great an interest \nin the Presidential campaign right now to really get anything \naccomplished on this important issue. Neither Presidential candidate \nhas really addressed the subject of our trade deficit. They just say it \nin a Pavlovian fashion: ``I am for free trade.'' Well, free trade is an \noxymoron. Trade is something for something. We know it is not free. \nOtherwise, of course, they hope to have trade without restrictions, \nwithout tariffs, without nontariff barriers, and those kinds of things.\n  As the father of our country said, the way to maintain the peace is \nto prepare for war. And the way to maintain free trade, rather than \npreparing for war, is to prepare for the trade war. It means in a sense \nto begin to compete, raise a barrier, and remove a barrier in China.\n  Jiang Zemin or Zhu Rongji should run for President. They know how to \nrun the trade policy. They use that rich market of 1.3 billion and say: \nYou can't come in here and sell that Boeing airplane, that 777, unless \nyou make half of it in downtown Shanghai. You can't come in here with \nthat automobile, that Buick, unless you put your research center here \nin Shanghai. They just told Qualcomm--although Trade Representative \nBarshefsky said we solved this problem--that there will be no more \ntechnology transfers. Hogwash. Tell them to call Qualcomm. They found \nout they couldn't sell there unless they shared the technology to the \nChinese.\n  So business is business; it is not the Boy Scouts and it doesn't \nadhere to the golden rule. Incidentally, it is not for profits in the \ninternational competition. The global competition is for market share \nand for jobs. We are losing out in every particular turn.\n  So since I am a little bit limited in time here this afternoon, I \nwant to correct the Record. I know the distinguished chairman of our \nFinance Committee will enjoy this, because I could quote myself.\n  We did this research 15 years ago. We were tired of hearing about \nSmoot-Hawley, and that the hobgoblins were coming. They really went \naround yelling ``peril,'' and the Chinese, how we discriminated against \nthem. Then the talk was that Smoot-Hawley would cause a world war; if \nyou do not vote for this we are going to have World War III. I never \nheard of such nonsense. It is time we jailed that buzzard, Smoot-\nHawley. Unfortunately, Ross Perot didn't understand Smoot-Hawley.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na part of the Congressional Record dated September 17, 1985, the text \nby the former distinguished Senator of Pennsylvania, John Heinz.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senator John Heinz, Submitted for the Congressional \n                       Record, September 17, 1985\n\n       Mr. Heinz. Mr. President, it gravely concerns me that every \n     time someone in the Administration or the Congress gives a \n     speech about a more aggressive trade policy or the need to \n     confront our trade partners with their subsidies, barriers to \n     imports and other unfair practices, others, in the Congress \n     immediately react with speeches on the return of the Smoot-\n     Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, and the dark days of blatant \n     protectionism and depression.\n       Take, for example, a statement by the Senator from Rhode \n     Island [Mr. Chafee] which appeared in the Record on June 17. \n     Senator Chafee first asserts that an overvalued dollar is \n     primarily responsible for the current trade deficits. Second, \n     he expresses his concern that Congress might enact \n     legislation, like Smoot-Hawley, in order to alleviate our \n     trade problems. Third, he adds that this would have a \n     devastating effect on the U.S. economy, because Smoot-Hawley \n     had a devastating effect on the economy in the 1930's. In \n     fact, Senator Chafee goes so far as to state that ``The \n     Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act * * *, without question, led to the \n     Great Depression.''\n       Mr. President, despite my admiration for the Senator from \n     Rhode Island, I find myself unable to agree with him on this \n     issue. First,\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\n     while Senator Chafee is correct in citing the excessive value \n     of the dollar as the main contributing factor to our trade \n     deficit, he fails to mention that underlying the dollar's \n     strength and high interest rates is an enormous budget \n     deficit. Nor does he mention the way market access barriers \n     affect U.S. exports abroad.\n       This question aside, it seems that for many of us that \n     Smoot-Hawley has become a code word for protectionism and, in \n     turn, a code word for the Depression. Yet when one recalls \n     that Smoot-Hawley was not enacted until more than 8 months \n     after the October 1929 economic collapse, it is hard to \n     conceive how it could have ``led to the Great Depression.'' \n     Indeed, for those of us who sometimes wonder about the \n     ability of Congress to make any changes in our economy, the \n     changes supposedly wrought by this single bill in 1930 appear \n     fantastic.\n       Historians and Economists, who usually view these things \n     objectively, realize that the truth is a good deal \n     complicated, that the causes of the depression were far \n     deeper, and that the link between high tariffs and economic \n     disaster is much more tenuous than the article Senator Chafee \n     placed in the record implies. A 1983 study by Donald Bedell \n     publicly explodes the myth of Smoot-Hawley through an \n     economic analysis of the actual tariff increases in the act \n     and their effects in the early years of the depression. The \n     study points out that the increases in question affected only \n     $231 million worth of products in the second half of 1930, \n     significantly less than 1 percent of world trade; that in \n     1930-32 duty-free imports into the United States fell at \n     almost the same percentage rate as dutiable imports; and that \n     a 13.5-percent drop in GNP in 1930 can hardly be blamed on a \n     single piece of legislation that was not even enacted until \n     midyear.\n       This, of course, is not to suggest that high tariffs are \n     good or that Smoot-Hawley was a wise piece of legislation. It \n     was not. It made a bad situation worse. But it was also \n     clearly not responsible for all the ills of the 1930's that \n     are habitually blamed on it by those who fancy themselves \n     defenders of freed trade. Mr. President, I have placed this \n     study in the record previously. Indeed, the Senator from \n     South Carolina (Mr. Hollings] cited it in his recent \n     appearance before the Finance Committee on Textile \n     Legislation. However, the continuing appearance of these \n     articles erroneously blaming Smoot-Hawley for everything bad \n     that has happened since 1930 dictates bringing it to \n     Senators' attention once again. Sort of a refresher course, \n     if you will. Hopefully, the study will help us to clean up \n     the rhetoric so often associated with Smoot-Hawley and \n     provide for a more sophisticated and accurate view of \n     economic history.\n       Mr. President, I ask that the study, by Don Bedell of \n     Bedell Associates, be printed in the Record.\n       The study follows:\n\n   Tariffs Miscast as Villain in Bearing Blame for Great Depression--\n                        Smoot/Hawley Exonerated\n\n                         (By Donald W. Bedell)\n\n\n             Smoot/Hawley, depression and world Revolution\n\n       It has recently become fashionable for media reporters, \n     editorial writers here and abroad, economists, members of \n     Congress, members of foreign governments, UN organizations \n     and a wide variety of scholars to express the conviction that \n     the United States, by the single act of causing the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 to become law (Public Law 361 of the 71st \n     Congress) plunged the world into an economic depression, may \n     well have prolonged it, led to Hitler and World War II.\n       Smoot/Hawley lifted import tariffs into the U.S. for a \n     cross section of products beginning mid-year 1930, or more \n     than 8 months following the 1929 financial collapse. Many \n     observers are tempted simply to repeat ``Free Trade'' \n     economic doctrine by claiming that this relatively \n     insignificant statute contained an inherent trigger mechanism \n     which upset a neatly functioning world trading system based \n     squarely on the theory of comparative economics, and which \n     propelled the world into a cataclysm of unmeasurable \n     proportions.\n       We believe that sound policy development in international \n     trade must be based solidly on facts as opposed to \n     suspicions, political or national bias, or ``off-the-cuff'' \n     impressions 50 to 60 years later of how certain events may \n     have occurred.\n       When pertinent economic, statistical and trade data are \n     carefully examined will they show, on the basis of \n     preponderance of fact, that passage of the act did in fact \n     trigger or prolong the great depression of the thirties, that \n     it had nothing to do with the great depression, or that it \n     represented a minor response of a desperate nation to a giant \n     world-wide economic collapse already underway?\n       It should be recalled that by the time Smoot/Hawley was \n     passed 6 months had elapsed of 1930 and 8 months had gone by \n     since the economic collapse in October, 1929. Manufacturing \n     plants were already absorbing losses, agriculture surpluses \n     began to accumulate, the spectre of homes being foreclosed \n     appeared, and unemployment showed ominous signs of a \n     precipitous rise.\n       The country was stunned, as was the rest of the world. All \n     nations sought very elusive solutions. Even by 1932, and the \n     Roosevelt election, improvisation and experiment described \n     government response and the technique of the New Deal, in the \n     words of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in a New York Times article \n     on April 10, 1983. President Roosevelt himself is quoted in \n     the article as saying in the 1932 campaign, ``it is common \n     sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it \n     frankly and try another. But above all, try something.''\n       The facts are that, rightly or wrongly, there were no major \n     Roosevelt administration initiatives regarding foreign trade \n     until well into his administration; thus clearly suggesting \n     that initiatives in that sector were not thought to be any \n     more important than the Hoover administration thought them. \n     However, when all the numbers are examined we believe neither \n     President Hoover nor President Roosevelt can be faulted for \n     placing international trade's role in world economy near the \n     end of a long list of sectors of the economy that had caused \n     chaos and suffering and therefore needed major corrective \n     legislation.\n       How important was international trade to the U.S.? How \n     important was U.S. trade to its partners in the twenties and \n     thirties?\n       In 1919, 66 percent of U.S. imports were duty free, or $2.9 \n     billion of a total of $4.3 billion. Exports amounted to $5.2 \n     billion in that year making a total trade number of $9.6 \n     billion or about 14 percent of the world's total.\n\n                  U.S. GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, 1929-33\n                      [Dollar amounts in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1929    1930    1931    1932    1933\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGNP............................   $103.4   $89.5   $76.3   $56.8   $55.4\nU.S. international trade.......     $9.6    $6.8    $4.5    $2.9    $3.2\nU.S. international trade             9.3     7.6     5.9     5.1  \\1\\ 5.\n percent of GNP................                                       6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Series U., Department of Commerce of the United States, Bureau of\n  Economic Analysis.\n\n       Using the numbers in that same chart I it can be seen that \n     U.S. Imports amounted to $4.3 billion or just slightly above \n     12 percent of total World Trade. When account is taken of the \n     fact that only 33 percent, or $1.5 billion, of U.S. Imports \n     was in the dutiable category, the entire impact of Smoot/\n     Hawley has to be focused on the $1.5 billion number which is \n     barely 1.5 percent of U.S. GNP and 4 percent of world \n     imports.\n       What was the impact/ in dollars dutiable imports fell by \n     $462 million, or from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, during \n     1930. It's difficult to determine how much of that small \n     number occurred in the second half of 1930 but the \n     probability is that it was less than 50 percent. In any case, \n     the total impact of Smoot/Hawley in 1930 was limited to a \n     ``Damage'' number of $231 million spread over several hundred \n     products and several hundred countries!\n       A further analysis of imports into the U.S. discloses that \n     all European Countries accounted for 30 percent or $1.3 \n     billion in 1929 divided as follows: U.K. at $330 million or \n     7\\1/2\\ percent, France at $171 million or 3.9 percent, \n     Germany at $255 million or 5.9 percent, and some 15 other \n     nations accounting for $578 million or 13.1 percent for an \n     average of 1 percent.\n       These numbers suggest that U.S. Imports were spread broadly \n     over a great array of products and countries, so that any \n     tariff action would by definition have only a quite modest \n     impact in any given year or could be projected to have any \n     important cumulative effect.\n       This same phenomenon is apparent for Asian countries which \n     accounted for 29 percent of U.S. Imports divided as follows: \n     China at 3.8 percent, Japan at $432 million and 9.8 percent, \n     and with some 20 other countries sharing in 15 percent or \n     less than 1 percent on average.\n       Australia's share was 1.3 percent and all African countries \n     sold 2.5 percent of U.S. Imports.\n       Western Hemisphere countries provided some 37 percent of \n     U.S. Imports with Canada at 11.4 percent, Cuba at 4.7 \n     percent, Mexico at 2.7 percent, Brazil at 4.7 percent and all \n     others accounting for 13.3 percent or about 1 percent each.\n       The conclusion appears inescapable on the basis of these \n     numbers; a potential adverse impact of $231 million spread \n     over the great array of imported products which were dutiable \n     in 1929 could not realistically have had any measurable \n     impact on America's trading partners.\n       Meanwhile, the Gross National Product (GNP) in the United \n     States had dropped an unprecedented 13.5 percent in 1930 \n     alone, from $103.4 billion in 1929 to $89 billion by the end \n     of 1930. It is unrealistic to expect that a shift in U.S. \n     International Imports of just 0.2 percent of U.S. GNP in 1930 \n     for example (231 million on $14.4 billion) could be viewed as \n     establishing a ``precedent'' for America's trading partners \n     to follow, or represented a ``model'' to follow.\n       Even more to the point an impact of just 0.2 percent could \n     not reasonably be expected to have any measurable effect on \n     the economic health of America's trading partners.\n       Note should be taken of the claim by those who repeat the \n     Smoot/Hawley ``villain'' theory that it set off a ``chain'' \n     reaction around the world. While there is some evidence that \n     certain of America's trading partners retaliated against the \n     U.S. there can be no reliance placed on the assertion that \n     those same trading partners retaliated against each other by \n     way of showing anger and frustration with the U.S. self-\n     interest alone would dictate otherwise, common sense would \n     intercede on the side of avoidance of ``shooting oneself in \n     the foot,'' and the facts disclose that World Trade declined \n     by 18 percent by the end of 1930 while U.S. Trade declined by \n     some 10 percent more or 28 percent. U.S. Foreign Trade \n     continued to decline by 10 percent\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n     more through 1931, or 53 percent versus 43 percent for World-\n     Wide Trade, but U.S. share of World Trade declined by only 18 \n     percent from 14 percent to 11.3 percent by the end of 1931.\n       Reference was made earlier to the duty free category of \n     U.S. Imports. What is especially significant about those \n     import numbers is the fact that they dropped in dollars by an \n     almost identical percentage as did dutiable goods through \n     1931 and beyond: Duty Free Imports declined by 29 percent in \n     1930 versus 27 percent for dutiable goods, and by the end of \n     1931 the numbers were 52 percent versus 51 percent \n     respectively.\n       The only rational explanation for this phenomenon is that \n     Americans were buying less and prices were falling. No basis \n     exists for any claim that Smoot/Hawley had a distinctively \n     devastating effect on imports beyond and separate from the \n     economic impact of the economic collapse in 1929.\n       Based on the numbers examined so far, Smoot/Hawley is \n     clearly a mis-cast villain. Further, the numbers suggest the \n     clear possibility that when compared to the enormity of the \n     developing international economic crisis Smoot/Hawley had \n     only a minimal impact and International Trade was a victim of \n     the great depression.\n       This possibility will become clear when the course of the \n     Gross National Product (GNP) during 1929-1933 is examined and \n     when price behavior world-wide is reviewed, and when \n     particular tariff schedules of manufacturers outline in the \n     Legislation are analyzed.\n       Before getting to that point another curious aspect of the \n     ``Villian'' theory is worthy of note. Without careful \n     recollection it is tempting to view a period of our history \n     some 50-60 years ago in terms of our present world. Such a \n     superficial view not only makes no contribution to \n     constructive policy-making. It overlooks several vital \n     considerations which characterized the twenties and thirties:\n       1. The internal trading system of the twenties bears no \n     relation to the interdependent world of the eighties \n     commercially, industrially and financially in size or \n     complexity.\n       2. No effective international organization existed, similar \n     to the general agreement for tariffs and trade (gatt) for \n     example for resolution of disputes. There were no trade \n     ``leaders'' among the world's nations in part because most \n     mercantile nations felt more comfortable without dispute \n     settlement bodies.\n       3. Except for a few critical products foreign trade was not \n     generally viewed in the ``economy-critical'' context as \n     currently in the U.S. as indicated earlier neither President \n     Hoover nor President Roosevelt viewed foreign trade as \n     crucial to the economy in general or recovery in particular.\n       4. U.S. Foreign Trade was relatively an amorphous \n     phenomenon quite unlike the highly structured system of the \n     eighties; characterized largely then by ``Caveat Emptor'' and \n     a broadly laissez-faire philosophy generally unacceptable \n     presently.\n       These characteristics, together with the fact that 66 \n     percent of U.S. Imports where duty free in 1929 and beyond, \n     placed overall international trade for Americans in the \n     twenties and thirties on a very low level of priority \n     especially against the backdrop of world-wide depression. \n     Americans in the twenties and thirties could no more \n     visualize the world of the Eighties than we in the eighties \n     can legitimately hold them responsible for failure by viewing \n     their world in other than the most pragmatic and realistic \n     way given those circumstances.\n       For those Americans then, and for us now, the numbers \n     remain the same. On the basis of sheer order of magnitude of \n     the numbers illustrated so far, the ``villian'' theory often \n     attributed to Smoot/Hawley is an incorrect reading of history \n     and a misunderstanding of the basic and incontrovertible law \n     of cause and effect.\n       It should also now be recalled that, despite heroic efforts \n     by U.S. policy-makers its GNP continued to slump year-by year \n     and reached a total of just $55.4 billion in 1933 for a total \n     decline from 1929 levels of 46 percent. The financial \n     collapse of October, 1929 had indeed left its mark.\n       By 1933 the 1929 collapse had prompted formation in the \n     U.S. of the reconstruction finance corporation, Federal Home \n     Loan Bank Board, brought in a democrat president with a \n     program to take control of banking, provide credit to \n     property owners and corporations in financial difficulties, \n     relief to farmers, regulation a stimulation of business, new \n     labor laws and social security legislation. Beard, Charles \n     and Mary, new Basic History of the United States).\n       So concerned were American citizens about domestic economic \n     affairs, including the Roosevelt Administration and the \n     Congress, that scant attention was paid to the solitary \n     figure of Secretary of State Cordell Hull. He, alone among \n     the Cabinet, was convinced that international trade had \n     material relevance to lifting the country back from \n     depression. His efforts to liberalize trade in general and to \n     find markets abroad for U.S. products in particular from \n     among representatives of economically stricken Europe, Asia \n     and Latin America were abruptly ended by the President and \n     the 1933 London Economic Conference collapsed without result.\n       The Secretary did manage to make modest contributions to \n     eventual trade recovery through the most favored nation (MFN) \n     concept. But it would be left for the United States at the \n     end of World War II to undertake an economic and political \n     role of leadership in the world; a role which in the twenties \n     and thirties Americans in and out of government felt no need \n     to assume, and did not assume. Evidence that conditions in \n     the trade world would have been better, or even different, \n     had the U.S. attempted some leadership role cannot \n     responsibly be assembled. Changing the course of past history \n     has always been less fruitful than applying perceptively \n     history's lessons.\n       The most frequently used numbers thrown out about Smoot-\n     Hawley's impact by those who believe in the ``villain'' \n     theory are those which clearly establish that U.S. dollar \n     decline in foreign trade plummeted by 66 percent by the end \n     of 1933 from 1929 levels, $9.6 billion to $3.2 billion \n     annually.\n       Much is made of the co-incidence that world-wide trade also \n     sank about 66 percent for the period.

Department of Commerce of the United States, League of Nations, and International Monetary Fund.\n\n       The inference is that since Smoot-Hawley was the first \n     ``protectionist'' legislation of the twenties, and the end of \n     1933 saw an equal drop in trade that Smoot-Hawley must have \n     caused it. Even the data already presented suggest the \n     relative irrelevance of the tariff-raising act on a strictly \n     trade numbers basis. When we examine the role of a world-wide \n     price decline in the trade figures for almost every product \n     made or commodity grown the ``villain'' Smoot-Hawley's impact \n     will not be measurable.\n       It may be relevant to note here that the world's trading \n     ``system'' paid as little attention to America's revival of \n     foreign trade beginning in 1934 as it did to American trade \n     policy in the early thirties. From 1934 through 1939 U.S. \n     foreign trade rose in dollars by 80 percent compared to \n     world-wide growth of 15 percent. Imports grew by 68 percent \n     and exports climbed by a stunning 93 percent. U.S. GNP by \n     1939 had developed to $91 billion, to within 88 percent of \n     its 1929 level.\n       Perhaps this suggests that America's trading partners were \n     more vulnerable to an economic collapse and thus much less \n     resilient than was the U.S. in any case the international \n     trade decline beginning as a result of the 1929 economic \n     collapse, and the subsequent return by the U.S. beginning in \n     1934 appear clearly to have been wholly unrelated to Smoot/\n     Hawley.\n       As we begin to analyze certain specific schedules appearing \n     in the Tariff Act of 1930 it should be noted that sharp \n     erosion of prices world-wide caused dollar volumes in trade \n     statistics to drop rather more than unit volume thus \n     emphasizing the decline value. In addition, it must be \n     remembered that as the great depression wore on, people \n     simply bought less of everything increasing further price \n     pressure downward. All this wholly apart from Smoot/Hawley.\n       When considering specific schedules, No. 5 which includes \n     sugar, molasses, and manufactures of maple sugar cane, \n     syrups, adonite, dulcite, galactose, inulin, lactose and \n     sugar candy. Between 1929 and 1933 import volume into the \n     U.S. declined by about 40% in dollars. In price on a world \n     basis producers suffered a stunning 60% drop. Volume of sugar \n     imports declined by only 42% into the U.S. in tons. All these \n     changes lend no credibility to the ``villain'' theory unless \n     one assumes, erroneously, that the world price of sugar was \n     so delicately balanced that a 28% drop in sugar imports by \n     tons into the U.S. in 1930 destroyed the price structure and \n     that the decline was caused by tariffs and not at least \n     shared by decreased purchases by consumers in the U.S. and \n     around the world.\n       Schedule 4 describes wood and manufactures of, timber hewn, \n     maple, brier root, cedar from Spain, wood veneer, hubs for \n     wheels, casks, boxes, reed and rattan, toothpicks, porch \n     furniture, blinds and clothespins among a great variety of \n     product categories. Dollar imports into the U.S. slipped by \n     52% from 1929 to 1933. By applying our own GNP as a \n     reasonable index of prices both at home and overseas, unit \n     volume decreased only 6% since GNP had dropped by 46% in \n     1933. The world-wide price decline did not help profitability \n     of wood product makers, but to tie that modest decline in \n     volume to a law affecting only 6\\1/2\\% of U.S. imports in \n     1929 puts great stress on credibility, in terms of harm done \n     to any one country or group of countries.\n       Schedule 9, cotton manufactures, a decline of 54% in \n     dollars is registered for the period, against a drop of 46% \n     in price as reflected in the GNP number. On the assumption \n     that U.S. GNP constituted a rough comparison to world prices, \n     and the fact that U.S. imports of these products was \n     infinitesimal. Smoot/Hawley was irrelevant. Further, the \n     price of raw cotton in the world plunged 50% from 1929 to \n     1933. U.S. growers had to suffer the consequences of that low \n     price but the price itself was set by world market prices, \n     and was totally unaffected by any tariff action by the U.S.\n       Schedule 12 deals with silk manufactures, a category which \n     decreased by some 60% in dollars. While the decrease amounted \n     to 14% more than the GNP drop, volume of product\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n     remained nearly the same during the period. Assigning \n     responsibility to Smoot/Hawley for this very large decrease \n     in price beginning in 1930 stretches credibility beyond the \n     breaking point.\n       Several additional examples of price behavior are relevant.\n       One is schedule 2 products which include brick and tile. \n     Another is schedule 3 iron and steel products. One \n     outstanding casualty of the financial collapse in October, \n     1929 was the gross private investment number. From $16.2 \n     billion annually in 1929 by 1933 it has fallen by 91% to just \n     $1.4 billion. No tariff policy, in all candor, could have so \n     devastated an industry as did the economic collapse of 1929. \n     For all intents and purposes construction came to a halt and \n     markets for glass, brick and steel products with it.\n       Another example of price degradation world-wide completely \n     unrelated to tariff policy is petroleum products. By 1933 \n     these products had decreased in world price by 82% but Smoot/\n     Hawley had no petroleum schedule. The world market place set \n     the price.\n       Another example of price erosion in world market is \n     contained in the history of exported cotton goods from the \n     United States. Between 1929 and 1933 the volume of exported \n     goods actually increased by 13.5% while the dollar value \n     dropped 48%. This result was wholly unrelated to the tariff \n     policy of any country.\n       While these examples do not include all schedules of Smoot/\n     Hawley they clearly suggest that overwhelming economic and \n     financial forces were at work affecting supply and demand and \n     hence on prices of all products and commodities and that \n     these forces simply obscured any measurable impact the tariff \n     act of 1930 might possibly have had under conditions of \n     several years earlier.\n       To assert otherwise puts on those proponents of the Smoot/\n     Hawley ``villain'' theory a formidable challenge to explain \n     the following questions:\n       1. What was the nature of the ``trigger'' mechanism in the \n     act that set off the alleged domino phenomenon in 1930 that \n     began or prolonged the Great Depression when implementation \n     of the act did not begin until mid-year?\n       2. In what ways was the size and nature of U.S. foreign \n     trade in 1929 so significant and critical to the world \n     economy's health that a less than 4% swing in U.S. imports \n     could be termed a crushing and devastating blow?\n       3. On the basis of what economic theory can the act be said \n     to have caused a GNP drop of an astounding drop of 13.5% in \n     1930 when the act was only passed in mid-1930? Did the entire \n     decline take place in the second half of 1930? Did world-wide \n     trade begin its decline of some $13 billion only in the \n     second half of 1930?\n       4. Does the fact that duty free imports into the U.S. \n     dropped in 1930 and 1931 and in 1932 at the same percentage \n     rate as dutiable imports support the view that Smoot/Hawley \n     was the cause of the decline in U.S. imports?\n       5. Is the fact that world-wide trade declined less rapidly \n     than did U.S. foreign trade prove the assertion that American \n     trading partners retaliated against each other as well as \n     against the U.S. because and subsequently held the U.S. \n     accountable for starting an international trade war?\n       6. Was the international trading system of the twenties so \n     delicately balanced that a single hastily drawn tariff \n     increase bill affecting just two hundred and thirty one \n     million dollars of dutiable products in the second half of \n     1930 began a chain reaction that scuttled the entire system? \n     Percentage-wise $231 million is but 0.65% of all of 1929 \n     world-wide trade and just half that of world-wide imports.\n       The preponderance of history and facts of economic life in \n     the international area make an affirmative response by the \n     ``Villian'' proponents an intolerable burden.\n       It must be said that the U.S. does offer a tempting target \n     for Americans who incessantly cry ``Mea Culpa'' over all the \n     world's problems, and for many among our trading partners to \n     explain their problems in terms of perceived American \n     inability to solve those problems.\n       In the world of the eighties U.S. has indeed very serious \n     and perhaps grave responsibility to assume leadership in \n     international trade and finance, and in politics as well.\n       On the record, the United States has met that challenge \n     beginning shortly after World War II.\n       The U.S. role in structuring the United Nations, the \n     general agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT), the \n     International Monetary Fund, the Bretton Woods and Dumbarton \n     Oaks conferences on monetary policy, the World Bank and \n     various regional development banks, for example, is a record \n     unparalleled in the history of mankind.\n       But in the twenties and thirties there was no acknowledged \n     leader in international affairs. On the contrary, evidence \n     abounds that most nations preferred the centuries-old \n     patterns of international trade which emphasized pure \n     competition free from interference by any effective \n     international supervisory body such as GATT.\n       Even in the eighties examples abound of trading nations \n     succumbing to nationalistic tendencies and ignoring signed \n     trade agreements. Yet the United States continues as the \n     bulwark in trade liberalization proposals within the GATT. It \n     does so not because it could not defend itself against any \n     kind of retaliation in a worst case scenario but because no \n     other nation is strong enough to support them successfully \n     without the United States.\n       The basic rules of GATT are primarily for all those \n     countries who can't protect themselves in the world of the \n     eighties and beyond without rule of conduct and discipline.\n       The attempt to assign responsibility to the U.S. in the \n     thirties for passing the Smoot/Hawley tariff act and thus set \n     off a chain reaction of international depression and war is, \n     on the basis of a preponderance of fact, a serious misreading \n     of history, a repeal of the basic concept of cause and effect \n     and a disregard for the principle of proportion of numbers.\n       It may constitute a fascinating theory for political \n     mischief-making but it is a cruel hoax on all those \n     responsible for developing new and imaginative measures \n     designed to liberalize international trade.\n       Such constructive development and growth is severely \n     impeded by perpetuating what is no more than a symbolic \n     economic myth.\n       Nothing is less worthwhile than attempting to re-write \n     history, not learning from it, nothing is more worthwhile \n     than making careful and perceptive and objective analysis in \n     the hope that it may lead to an improved and liberalized \n     international trading system.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

We even \ngot Sec. 13.301, regarding a lockbox. We already have written in law \nthat you are not to include Social Security in your budget. It is \nsupposed to be in a trust fund. It was signed into law on November 5, \n1990, by George Herbert Walker Bush. But they all say: Now I have a \nlockbox bill. They voted--98 Senators, Senator Heinz, and myself \nincluded, back at that particular time. But they don't obey it.\n  I think the most brilliant of Senators--I have been around 34 years--\nis our distinguished colleague, the ranking member, Patrick Moynihan of \nNew York. Sen. Moynihan wrote a very scholarly bill. I don't disparage \nat all. I lost a lot of valuables during a fire at my home. One was a \ncollection of his books, which has now been replaced. He is a brilliant \nauthor, a most interesting writer, and a tremendous authority. But on \nthis particular score, he is incorrect. The outcome of this vote won't \nthreaten any world war, or anything else like that.\n  It is very important to realize that the crash came in October 1929, \nand Smoot-Hawley did not occur until June of 1930--8 months after the \ncrash. And furthermore, back in 1929 and 1930, international trade to \nthe United States economy was only 1.5 percent of the GNP. So Smoot-\nHawley could not have caused the crash, which has been contended on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  And, No. 2, it had no far-reaching effects. In fact, it was hardly \nmentioned by either President Hoover, or then-candidate Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, or President Roosevelt after he took office because there \nwere other things to be disturbed about. The adverse effects of Smoot-\nHawley paled in comparison to the problems facing the United States at \nthat time.\n  I quote:\n\n       The conclusion appears inescapable on the basis of these \n     numbers; a potential adverse impact of $231 million spread \n     over the great array of imported products which were dutiable \n     in 1929 could not realistically have any measurable impact on \n     America's trading partners.\n\n  $231 million--here we are talking about a $350 billion to a $400 \nbillion deficit. This is the overall trade figure of $231 million.\n  I read further:\n\n       Meanwhile, the gross national product (GNP) in the United \n     States had dropped an unprecedented 13.5 percent in 1930 \n     alone, from $103.4 billion in 1929 to $89 billion by the end \n     of 1930. It is unrealistic to expect that a shift in U.S. \n     international imports of just 0.2 percent of U.S. GNP in 1930 \n     for example ($231 million on $14.4 billion) could be viewed \n     as establishing a ``precedent'' for America's trading \n     partners to follow, or represented a ``model'' to follow.\n       Even more to the point an impact of just 0.2 percent could \n     not reasonably be expected to have any measurable effect on \n     the economic health of America's trading partners.\n\n  I read and skip over because it is too long under the limited time to \nread the report in its entirety. But I quote this part.\n\n       1. The international trading system of the twenties bears \n     no relation to the interdependent world of the eighties \n     commercially, industrially and financially in size or \n     complexity.\n       2. No effective international organization existed, similar \n     to the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for \n     example for resolution of disputes. There were no trade \n     ``leaders'' among the world's nations in part because most \n     mercantile nations felt more comfortable without dispute \n     settlement bodies.\n       3. Except for a few critical products foreign trade was not \n     generally viewed in the ``economy-critical'' context as \n     currently in the\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n     U.S. as indicated earlier neither President Hoover nor \n     President Roosevelt viewed foreign trade as crucial to the \n     economy in general or recovery in particular.\n       4. U.S. foreign trade was relatively an amorphous \n     phenomenon quite unlike the highly structured system of the \n     eighties; characterized largely then by ``Caveat Emptor'' and \n     a broadly laissez-faire philosophy generally unacceptable \n     presently.\n\n  That brings it into sharp focus, because you have heard again and \nagain that Smoot-Hawley started a trade war, that collapsed economies \nbrought on the Depression and started World War II. They say if we \ndon't vote for PNTR, it will cause World War III. They are bringing out \nall of these bogeymen. There is no merit in this.\n  Again, the Constitution, article I, section 8, says the Congress \nshall regulate and control foreign trade.\n  We are listening to the White House and the fix that is on, and they \nsaid, permanently abandon, amend the Constitution if you please, \ndisregard this fundamental, and let us handle it because the White \nHouse father knows best. They bring out that white tent, and they all \nrun around. They are mostly your friends, Senator Roth. You know them \nwell. And they are for profits. They don't have a country.\n  Listen to what Boeing says: I am not an American corporation, I am an \ninternational company.\n  Listen to the chairman of the board of Caterpillar: I am an \ninternational corporation.\n  They are companies without any country. They could care less about \nyou, and I have to give every care. You and I are responsible for the \nregulation of foreign trade, and we ought not vote against it this \nafternoon by voting down this amendment on the premise of no \namendments, no amendments, no amendments. If we have amendments, the \nHouse would then have a chance to look at it and realize that permanent \ntrade relations with China abrogates the responsibility of Congress \nunder the Constitution.\n  Reading on, there are a couple more quotes in the limited time.\n  In the concluding comments by Senator Heinz at that time:\n\n       The attempt to assign responsibility to the U.S. in the \n     thirties for passing the Smoot/Hawley Tariff Act and thus set \n     off a chain reaction of international depression and war is, \n     on the basis of a preponderance of fact, a serious misreading \n     of history, a repeal of the basic concept of cause and effect \n     and a disregard for the principle of proportion of numbers.\n       It may constitute a fascinating theory for political \n     mischief-making but it is a cruel hoax on all of those \n     responsible for developing new and imaginative measures \n     designed to liberalize international trade.\n       Such constructive development and growth is severely \n     impeded by perpetuating what is no more than a symbolic \n     economic myth.\n       Nothing is less worthwhile than attempting to rewrite \n     history, not learning from it. Nothing is more worthwhile \n     than making careful and perceptive and objective analysis in \n     the hope it may lead to an improved and liberalized \n     international trading system.\n\n  Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said that 15 years ago, almost to \nthe day, September 1985. Those observations that our distinguished \ncolleague made are just as true today.\n  Under the Constitution there is a fundamental responsibility that \nCongress regulates foreign commerce, but the Finance Committee and the \nadministration with its fixed votes says: No, give it up. When I say \n``fixed votes,'' I wish I had the New York Times article. I wish I had \nthe Washington Post article. There were followup articles to the vote \non NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, and in \nthat, distinguished Chairman Roth, it was revealed that they gave our \nfriend, Jake Pickle, a cultural center, they gave another Congressman \ntwo C-17s, and another a round of golf in California with the \nPresident--just to get their vote. They went around to fix, nothing to \ndo with trade, and once the fix is on, you come out on the floor and \nsay: Vote if you please to abandon your constitutional responsibility.\n  My amendment says: No, let's have trade with China. That is obviously \ngoing to occur. We live in the real world. These embargoes don't work. \nForget about the embargoes. You cannot stop trade and grind the economy \nto a halt, the world economy to a halt, as they alleged Smoot-Hawley \ndid. It will never happen.\n  It is not about starting a trade war and having an embargo. It is \nabout enforcing our dumping laws--we could start by consolidating the \nenforcement efforts--and realizing that the industrial worker of the \nUnited States of America is the most competitive in the world. The \nthing that is not competing is the Congress of the United States.\n  We are about to vote. They say this amendment, too, will be voted \ndown. We are about to vote down our responsibility to one of the most \nimportant issues that possibly could confront us. Alan Greenspan says \nthe only bad effect on the economy is the $350 billion trade deficit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roth pertaining to the introduction of S. 3017 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Hollings \namendment, which takes the ``P'' out of PNTR; that is, as I understand \nthe amendment, it provides for an annual review of normal trade \nrelations status.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I oppose that amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do \nso, for a very simple reason. That is, if that amendment were agreed to \nand were to become part of the normal trading relations status with \nChina, we automatically as Americans would be shooting ourselves in the \nfoot, to say the least.\n  Why do I say that? As the world becomes more complicated, more \ncomplex, we hear about globalism, trade agreements, taxation or \nnontaxation of products over the Internet, and whatnot. Unfortunately, \nwe have to rise to a higher level of more sophistication and learning \nand know what is going on with these arrangements and agreements so \nthat we Americans are in a better economic condition.\n  It is difficult, but we have no choice with all the economic \npressures that are advancing our world so quickly. The provisions of \nthe World Trade Organization, I believe, very much help raise our \neconomic standards. They are not perfect, but perfection cannot be the \nenemy of the good. If there were no WTO, it would be an economic free-\nfor-all. Various countries would be doing their own deals at the \nexpense of others, and it would be chaos. It would be a mess. At least \nthe World Trade Organization is a vehicle, a forum, a mechanism, a way \nto get some civility, some process into trade matters and trade \ndisputes that occur in this world.\n  One of the basic principles of the World Trade Organization is \nnondiscrimination and unconditionality. It is written in article 1 of \nthe WTO. That means when a country grants trade concessions to another, \nit must do so unconditionally and on a nondiscriminatory basis so the \nsame benefits, same provisions apply to all countries in the world. \nOtherwise, it is obvious if one country had certain trade agreements \nwith one country and gave certain benefits to one and not another, \nthere would be chaos. Article 1 of the WTO articles provides for \nnondiscrimination and unconditionality with respect to trade agreements \nand membership in the WTO.\n  The amendment before us is discriminatory and it is conditional by \nnot making it permanent normal trade relations status but annual. That \nflatly violates article 1 of the WTO. As a consequence, if this \namendment is adopted, we Americans could be giving up all the market-\nopening benefits to which China has agreed. That is, China would have \nno obligation to grant America those concessions, and they are major, \nwhether it is auto tariffs or tariffs on other products. China is \ndramatically lowering tariffs.\n  China would also say: We Chinese agree to let you Americans set up \nyour own distribution systems; you do not have to deal through Chinese \ncompanies anymore. The list is mind-boggling. It is amazing how much \nChina has agreed to open up and to take American products that we have \nbeen trying to export to China that, frankly, have not been exported or \nsignificantly diverted because of current Chinese barriers.\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\n  My colleagues are going to hear the argument: This agreement is going \nto help Americans invest in China, and that takes away American jobs. \nCompanies in America and around the world are already investing in \nChina. It is happening today.\n  The agreement with China says: OK, there can be a lot less pressure \non companies to build factories in China and make it more easy for \nAmerican companies to ship products to China because China is \ndramatically reducing its barriers.\n  If this amendment is adopted, as I mentioned, China will be under no \nobligation to give us those breaks as we try to ship products to China. \nChina will have no obligation to lower trade barriers that China has \nnegotiated with the United States. However, China will be obligated to \ngive those benefits and breaks to our competitors--to Japan, to the \nEuropean Union--because they have entered WTO properly under the \nconditions of unconditionality and nondiscrimination. We have complied \nwith article 1.\n  We have heard a lot of facts and figures about a lot of different \nissues, but the heart of this amendment is to take away the permanent \nnature of normal trade relations with China that we will be granting, \nand that means it is conditional, it is discriminatory and flatly \nviolates article 1 of the WTO and, therefore, is a killer amendment, an \nanti-American amendment. It is anti-American because all other \ncountries get benefits, and it is a killer because it means we will not \nget the benefits of China opening up to American exports.\n  Let me cite one of America's foremost experts on the GATT and the \nWTO, Professor John Jackson, Georgetown University Law Center:\n\n       The United States must extend permanent, unconditional MFN \n     treatment to the PRC for the US to comply with US WTO \n     obligations, unless the US invokes the ``opt-out'' provisions \n     of the WTO.\n\n  Our own Congressional Research Service has concluded:\n\n       In order to make US law consistent with WTO obligations, \n     Congress would need to remove the PRC from the Title IV \n     regime (i.e., Jackson-Vanik) . . . The Title IV regime is \n     inconsistent with MFN obligations when applied to a WTO \n     member . . . because of the conditions that it attaches to \n     the grant of nondiscriminatory treatment to that country's \n     goods.\n\n  Let me respond to the criticism that we get nothing out of PNTR in \nterms of US trade benefits.\n  The fact is that granting China PNTR will bring a significant drop in \nChinese tariffs. That will reduce the pressure many companies feel to \ninvest in China in order to do business there. Our information \ntechnology products--computers, fiber optics, and telecommunications \nequipment--will see tariffs in China go to zero by 2004. Auto parts \ntariffs will average only ten percent by 2006.\n  When you add these significant tariff reductions to the new ability \nthat American firms will have to import directly into China, control \ntheir own distribution and service networks, and own advertising firms, \nexport of our goods and services will increase substantially.\n  Yes, American companies will continue to invest in China. But their \nability also to export will be enhanced significantly by PNTR. Failure \nto grant China PNTR will allow our Japanese and European competitors to \nexport more, but not our workers and our farmers.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to yield time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma or I will ask unanimous consent \nthat he be permitted such time as is necessary. He wanted to speak on \nthis. I did not realize that. I want to have a few minutes left.\n  I want to comment on the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nMontana. All these wonderful benefits--he has not read the GAO report. \nEverything is indeterminate. This is the most flexible agreement ever \nmade. We made one with Japan and we have not penetrated that market. We \nmade one with Korea and we have not penetrated that one, either.\n  All these benefits--I do not know if a $68 billion deficit is a \nbenefit. Heavens above, we have to stop this somehow. Paraphrasing \nAbraham Lincoln: We have to think anew, act anew, and work together, we \nmight get a plus balance of trade.\n  The distinguished Senator is saying if you vote for this amendment, \nyou are violating article 1 of the WTO. I say if you vote against it, \nyou are violating article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, \nabdicating our responsibility to regulate foreign commerce. We cannot \nmake an agreement with the WTO to disband and dispel that particular \nobligation and responsibility.\n  I do not understand that at all. That is a narrow analysis if I ever \nsaw one, that somehow the WTO is a wonderful thing. In fact, we are \ngetting all kinds of requests to get out of it on account of the \nforeign credit sales given American corporations in their exports \noverseas. I will get into that later on, perhaps next week.\n  We have received a number of those requests. We are losing, I say to \nthe distinguished Senator. The only reason for this amendment is to \nsay: Wait a minute, let's have trade with China; go ahead with the WTO. \nLet's just take the ``P'' out of PNTR. The Senator from Montana said on \nthe floor and Senator Moynihan said on the floor, irrespective of this \nbill, China will become a member of the WTO--and we are a member of the \nWTO, so why are they so worried about this amendment?\n  We are not violating anything by voting for this amendment, but my \ncolleagues will violate article I, section 8 of the Constitution and \nour responsibilities under the Constitution if they vote against it.\n  I have used the remaining time I had, I believe. I thank the \ndistinguished Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may utilize.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague from South Carolina, and I disagree with my colleague that \nsupporters of normalizing trade have no merit to their argument. The \neconomic benefits of China's accession are unassailable.\n  According to independent economic analysis, China's market access \ncommitments will mean an additional $13 billion in U.S. exports \nannually. Our current exports to China are $14 billion a year, which \nmeans the deal so ably negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky will \neffectively double annual U.S. exports to China.\n  Doubling our exports to China holds benefits for every sector of the \nU.S. economy from agriculture to manufacturing to services. It also \nprovides significant benefits for American workers.\n  The one step that we must take to ensure that American farmers, \nAmerican workers, and American businesses reap the benefits of an \nagreement that three Presidents took 13 years to squeeze out of the \nChinese. That step is to normalize our trade relations with China.\n  What that means in practical terms is an end to the unproductive \nannual review of China's trade status. That is what H.R. 4444 does--it \neliminates the annual review that has provided no leverage over Chinese \nbehavior.\n  My distinguished colleague's amendment would gut the House bill by \nonce again requiring this unproductive annual review of China's trade \nstatus. The amendment would deny the benefits of China's WTO accession \nto our farmers, to our workers, and to our businesses.\n  Why is that? It is because the annual vote on China's trade status \nwould violate our own obligations under the WTO, as was so effectively \npointed out by the Senator from Montana, and allow the Chinese to deny \nour exporters access to their markets. That access would go, instead, \nto our European, Japanese, and other competitors.\n  My colleague from South Carolina has said that the Japanese know how \nto run their trade policy. Let me say that if we deny the benefits of \nthis deal to our exporters, we will have given the Japanese a trade \npolicy gift that I am certain they would never have guessed we would \nhave been foolish enough to forego.\n  And, for what? How will denying our exports to China give us any \nleverage over Chinese behavior? Why would we suppose that cutting off \nour exports to China would do anything to influence\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nChina's policies, whether on Taiwan, on weapons proliferation, on human \nrights, or on labor rights?\n  No. What we get in return for foregoing the benefits of this deal is \nthe prospect of returning to the same unproductive annual debate we \nhold on China's trade status. It should be obvious to all, based on the \narguments we have heard today about Chinese behavior, that the annual \ndebate simply has not worked. It is time to take a different approach.\n  The bottom line is that we have precious little to lose in ending the \nannual renewal process and much, much to gain by enacting PNTR.\n  That is why I oppose the amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague and urge this body to oppose it as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose amendment No. 4122, which \ncalls for annual trade reviews with China, offered by the distinguished \njunior Senator from South Carolina on H.R. 4444, Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with China.\n  This amendment, if passed as part of the China PNTR bill, would be \ntantamount to unilaterally establishing special conditions on China's \nmembership in the WTO, a violation of World Trade Organization precepts \nthe United States, as a member, commits to follow.\n  In such a case, China would be legitimately entitled to deny American \nworkers, entrepreneurs, investors--in short, our Nation--the benefits \nof open access to China's markets and the privileges of important WTO-\nrelated agreements, such as the International Telecommunications \nAgreement, conferred by WTO membership.\n  I am also convinced that amendments at this stage create a procedural \nproblem that could derail passage of this extremely important bill. \nAdopting any amendments at this stage would require sending this bill \nto conference. It is clear to me that we do not have the time remaining \nin this Congress to resolve a bicameral conflict over this bill. I \nbelieve it is crucial that we let nothing interfere with what may be \nthe most important decision concerning China for years to come.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I think the Senator, the chairman of our committee, has \nspoken so well and effectively; the Senator from Montana equally so. I \nbelieve this debate has been thorough. We respect our friend from South \nCarolina. We know his views. We do not share them in this case.\n  So much is at issue. Let us go forward and vote and get on with this \nmatter.\n  Mr. ROTH. Is there any time remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 38 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield back the 38 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the time.\n  The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4122.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nand the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could speak briefly about the schedule, \nI have been talking with Senator Reid and Senator Daschle and the \nmanagers of this legislation. We are making progress on the amendments. \nWe have had a good debate throughout the week. We are going to keep \npushing ahead until we get through the amendments. I had committed not \nto file cloture before next Tuesday, but it would be my intention to \nfile cloture next Tuesday, if necessary, to get this legislation \ncompleted. I think everybody is working hard and doing a good job.\n  Tonight, at 6 o'clock we will go back to the energy and water \nappropriations bill. I know Senator Domenici and Senator Reid are \nprepared to work on that tonight. Our intent is to push ahead. \nHopefully, we will get Senators' amendments considered and disposed of \nquickly. The intent is to stay and get it done tonight. I believe \nSenator Domenici and Senator Reid have indicated that is what they \nintend to do and we will certainly support their efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the vote in relation to the \nHollings amendment, Senator Smith of New Hampshire be recognized to \noffer his amendment to H.R. 4444, and at 6 o'clock p.m. the amendment \nbe immediately laid aside and the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n4733, the energy and water appropriations bill under the previous \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a couple of unanimous consent \nrequests that I will offer at this time and hopefully it will not take \ntoo long to consider these and we can go ahead and stay on schedule.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no later than the close of business on \nTuesday, September 26, the majority leader be recognized to turn to \ncalendar 527, which is S. 2340, regarding the Amateur Sports Integrity \nAct, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, the \ncommittee amendments be immediately agreed to, and the majority leader \nthen be recognized to send a cloture motion to the desk to the bill.\n  Under rule XXII, the cloture vote would occur 1 hour after the Senate \nconvenes following the ascertainment of a quorum on Thursday, September \n28.\n  I also ask consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, if the cloture is \ninvoked, the bill be considered under the following agreement: That \nthere be 2 hours for debate on the bill to be equally divided in the \nusual form; that there be up to two relevant amendments in order for \nSenator Reid of Nevada and Senator Brownback of Kansas or their \ndesignees, that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; \nthat no motions to recommit or commit be in order.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the above-\nlisted amendments, and the use or yielding back of time, the bill be \nadvanced to\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nthird reading and passage occur, all without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, efforts to force this body \nto consider a questionable proposal, which is a ban on legal gambling \non college games, shows a fundamental misunderstanding, in this \nSenator's view.\n  At this stage, we have about 18 or 19 days left in this congressional \nsession. We have 11 appropriations bills that must pass the Senate. We \nhave all the fundamental conference reports that must be held. There is \na hue and cry about doing something about a real Patients' Bill of \nRights. There is a need to do something about minimum wage. We have all \nkinds of problems with education. As we speak, today, 3,000 children \ndropped out of high school in America, and we are not spending any time \non that. We need prescription drug coverage, Medicare. There are so \nmany fundamental issues that we need to work on and there is not a hue \nand cry out there that we need to take the next 19 days and spend 1 \nminute talking about banning something that is legal in America; that \nis, betting on college games.\n\n  Remember, if we were serious about doing something about betting on \ncollege games, we would go after the 98.5 percent of illegal betting \nthat goes on in college games. Only a percent and a half goes on in \ncollege games, and that is legal in the State of Nevada.\n  With just a few weeks to go in Congress, it is incredulous we would \nbe asked to waste time debating the merits of banning legalized \nwagering on college games.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, with great underscoring, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there was an objection heard.\n  I ask consent that the Senator from Kansas be recognized for 1 minute \nso he can respond on this issue, since it is an issue in which he has \nbeen very much involved.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I request to be included for an additional minute.\n  Mr. LOTT. I amend my request for that.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Reserving the right to object, the vote \nwent longer than anticipated. I was looking only for 5 or 10 minutes to \npresent my amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have the Senator locked in.\n  We will delay. Let me just ask unanimous consent, then, that we delay \ngoing on the energy and water bill for 10 minutes. It will be 10 after \n6. Is that the correct time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the majority leader's underlying request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does that mean we will be on the floor at----\n  Mr. LOTT. It will be 10 after 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the underlying unanimous \nconsent request? Without objection, the Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized for 1 minute, after which the Senator from Nevada will be \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I are bringing this \nbill forward. I think the majority leader has proposed 2 hours of \ndebate. I am willing to do that at any time, any place. We would do it \nnow here on the floor, but we can go to the middle of the night if \npeople would like to. This has cleared the Commerce Committee; 14-2 was \nthe vote when this cleared through.\n  There is a hue and cry across the country. Virtually every college in \nAmerica has asked for this legislation because they are having problems \non their college campuses dealing with betting on their athletes. This \nis affecting the moral values. It is giving a black eye to our college \ncampuses. There is one place in the country that this goes on legally. \nIt is in Nevada. It is a loophole that has been there, and it is time \nfor us to deal with it. We only need 2 hours to deal with it. I think \nwe can take care of this within the timeframe that is left. I applaud \nthe leader and hope we can get to this yet during this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this legislation would plunge the dagger \ninto the back of Nevada's principal industry and would accomplish no \nuseful purpose. Ninety-eight percent of the sports betting in America \nis conducted illegally outside of the State of Nevada. There is no \nlogical way in which you can conclude that by eliminating sports \nbetting that occurs in my own State, that is licensed, that is \nregulated--you have to be 21 years of age --you address a legitimate \nproblem, which is illegal gambling on college campuses.\n  It is misdirected, it is ill-conceived, and it would be the dream of \nevery illegal bookie in America if this legislation passes. I am \npleased to join with my colleague in objecting to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request.\n  First, let me say there has been a lot of discussion about the \nsupport and the need for a lockbox on Social Security and Medicare. I \ncertainly agree. We have tried to get that put in place in the Senate. \nWe have not been successful. So I am going to ask consent that we get \nan agreement to do that.\n  I remind my colleagues, it was passed in the House overwhelmingly, \n46-12, to do that with regard to Social Security and Medicare. We have \nattempted to do it. We tried to invoke cloture in June of 1999, which \nfailed basically along party lines. I think maybe there has been a lot \nof movement in this direction, so I think we ought to try to set this \nup before we go out.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be in order for the majority leader, after \nnotification of the minority leader, to turn to Calendar No. 152, H.R. \n1259, regarding the Social Security and Medicare lockbox, and following \nthe reporting of the bill by the clerk, all remaining amendments to the \nbill be germane to the subject contained in H.R. 1259.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me say for the \nrecord, the majority leader has, as he has indicated, offered the \nlockbox legislation on two separate occasions. I might remind my \ncolleagues that on both occasions he filed cloture immediately, denying \nthe minority any opportunity to offer amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent, and ask the majority leader's support, for \nan alternative approach which would be that we offer Medicare/Social \nSecurity lockbox amendments in addition to a prescription drug benefit \namendment to be offered in the context of this lockbox. I make that \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. But I hope the minority leader would consider working \ntogether to see if we could get a vote on the Social Security/Medicare \nlockbox itself. Perhaps he would like to have an alternative proposal \nin that area. I think we can work it out where there would be \nalternative proposals on Social Security/Medicare lockbox, if you have \na different idea about how to do it. I don't think we ought to get into \nother issues at this point.\n  Let's make it clear whether we want to have the Social Security/\nMedicare lockbox or not. I would be glad to talk with the Democratic \nleader about seeing if we can at least set it up. There will be other \nbills where I am sure the prescription drug matter is going to come up, \nis going to be debated, and it is going to be voted on.\n  There is a lot of talk out across the land about the lockbox and how \nthere is one or should be one. I think we ought to go ahead and \ncomplete that action, and I will work with the Senator on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the majority leader again to suggest, \nas I have on many occasions, that we can find a way, perhaps, to \naddress this issue. We certainly have a lot of ideas. I do not want to \npreclude ideas articulated and offered by my colleagues. I would be \nmore than happy to work\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nwith him. As he has indicated, there is a good deal of interest on \nSocial Security and Medicare lockboxes and perhaps we can find a \nprocedural way to address them even in the short time that remains in \nthis session.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the minority leader yield for a moment? I would like \nto say I am very interested in the lockbox. I am also interested in \nmaking sure there is something in the box before it is locked. We have \n$1.3 trillion in tax cut proposals around here for surpluses that don't \nyet exist. So when these are offered, I think some of us would like the \nopportunity to offer amendments. That is the point the Senator from \nSouth Dakota makes, and a very appropriate point.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. That is our \nconcern. If we are going to have a debate, we need to have a debate \nabout these issues that afford Senators the right to offer amendments. \nBut again, I reiterate my desire to discuss it with the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. Domenici addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I do have the floor, I yield to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friends on the other side of the \naisle, the Vice President, as your candidate, plans to spend $2.6 \ntrillion of this surplus on new programs. That is what we are worried \nabout. So we both have some worries about what is going to be left in \nthe lockbox--whether we are going to spend it on taxes or whether you \nare going to spend it on an infinite number of new programs. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the time that we have taken, I \nask unanimous consent the time before we go to energy and water be \nextended to 6:15 so Senator Smith can offer his amendments and lay them \naside as he had been promised he would be able to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the majority leader for his \nconsideration and also thank Senator Domenici as well. I do not want to \nhold the Senate up from moving to the appropriations bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4129\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4129.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask the amendment that I \nsent to the desk be divided into six categories in the manner in which \nI now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so divided.\n  The amendment, as divided, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require that the Congressional-Executive Commission \nmonitor the cooperation of the People's Republic of China with respect \nto POW/MIA issues, improvement in the areas of forced abortions, slave \n          labor, and organ harvesting, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 46, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n                               Division I\n\n     SEC. 302A.

These all \namend the section of the bill that creates a commission which is to \nmonitor and report on Chinese activities.\n  The six subjects I am urging we include are very reasonable. I am \namazed, really, they have not already been included in the commission's \nreporting responsibilities. Let me just list and give a brief line or \ntwo on each one.\n  The first division or item is monitoring and reporting on Chinese \ncooperation on POW and MIA issues. We all know that the Chinese \nGovernment possesses information about Americans who are missing from \nthe Korean war--and perhaps even the Vietnam war, but certainly the \nKorean war; maybe World War II--which could bring closure to literally \nthousands of families. Yet this Government, the Chinese Government, has \nrefused to provide us even basic information. In fact, it denies it \neven possesses this information when we know they do. So this amendment \nwould merely let the American people know in an objective manner on \nthis commission the extent to which the Chinese are not cooperating on \nthis humanitarian issue.\n  The second item is monitoring and reporting on commercial activities \nbetween the United States and the People's Liberation Army. Currently, \nthe Chinese People's Liberation Army directly or indirectly owns scores \nof businesses. They conduct commerce with U.S. companies. That includes \nthe sale of products to U.S. consumers. So this amendment would simply \nrequire the FBI to monitor and report to Congress on the activities of \nthe PLA's, the People's Liberation Army's, businesses here in the \nUnited States. Specifically, they would take data collected by the DIA, \nCIA, customs, and other agencies and report their findings to Congress \non the dollar amount of PLA revenues and where these revenues are being \ndirected within the Chinese military. This report will also monitor any \ntechnology transfers between PLA companies and U.S. companies, \nincluding an assessment of the impact upon the U.S. military, U.S. \ninterests, and our allies. That is all it does. I think it is a very \nreasonable amendment and should be approved by the Senate.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  The third item in the division is monitoring and reporting on \ndevelopment of Chinese space capabilities. We know the world has \nobserved our military space advantage and has taken steps to acquire \ntheir own military space systems to counter ours. In particular, we \nhave observed the Chinese are developing military space capabilities \nthat could threaten the United States and threaten our allies' \nmilitary, civilian, and commercial systems. Free and open trade, and \nthe reduced vigilance free trade fosters, will facilitate the \ndevelopment and proliferation of space technology needed to expand \nChinese space capabilities. This commission would monitor this activity \nand report on it so we would have good information as to exactly what \nwas going on in that regard.\n  The fourth item is monitoring and reporting on the cooperation on \nenvironmental protection. Our Nation has some of the strongest \nenvironmental laws in the world. Yet Chinese companies can operate with \nlower costs and compete with U.S. companies because they do not have to \ncomply with the same requirements that U.S. companies do.\n  If we are going to give permanent trade status to the country of \nChina, then why not make them play by the same rules U.S. companies do? \nIf you wonder why they can sell their clothes and other products over \nhere so cheaply, that is one of the reasons they compete with us and \ncan pay such low labor costs. They do not have to abide by the same \nregulations.\n  This amendment simply monitors the extent to which China is enforcing \ntheir own environmental regulations. We cannot dictate how they do \nthat--they are their own nation--but we can monitor it and we can let \nthe American people know that we are, by passing PNTR, saying we are \ngoing to ignore their environmental infractions and we are going to \nenforce ours. I think we ought to have that as part of this agreement.\n  The fifth division is monitoring and reporting on conditions relating \nto orphans and orphanages in China and the extent to which they are \nproviding access to U.S. and international adoption agencies. Every \nyear, untold numbers of Chinese baby boys and girls with special needs \nare left at state-run orphanages in horrible situations. Throughout the \nnineties, several human rights organizations revealed deplorable \nconditions and inhuman treatment. The death rates for these children \nare oftentimes astronomical. They are left to die of starvation. When \nwe give all this wonderful treatment to the country of China, I hope we \nthink about that and see if we have any concerns about these human \nrights violations.\n  My amendment would simply monitor and encourage China to determine \nthat the quality and care of its orphans is improving by providing \nspecific data on the survival rates of these children. Isn't that the \nleast we can do if we are going to trade with them and help them? Why \nnot help the children in China who are stuck in these orphanages.\n  Finally, No. 6, monitoring and reporting on organ harvesting and \ntransplanting in the People's Republic of China. One of the most \ndespicable, horrible acts of any nation in the world--and I cannot \nunderstand why we would look the other way and not even report and let \nthe American people and the world know what they are doing. This \namendment would task a commission with monitoring this barbaric and \ninhuman practice of literally taking organs involuntarily from executed \nprisoners. They are not prisoners executed and then having their organs \ntaken after execution, they are executed in order to get the organs, so \nwe understand what this is. We would require a report on the actions \ntaken by the PRC to end organ harvesting.\n\n  In conclusion, this is a good amendment. There are six divisions. \nThey are good divisions. I say to my colleagues who say we cannot amend \nthis because it is going to mess up the whole PNTR issue, this is not \nmessing up anything. This commission is going to monitor these six \nareas that are, for the most part, outrages really that the Chinese are \nallowed to get away with.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment at the appropriate time. I \nthank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8163-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8163-S8187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 6:15 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration \nof H.R. 4733, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4733) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are working on perhaps as many as 50 \nor 60 amendments trying to get them narrowed down to a very few \ncontentious issues. On behalf of Senator Reid, I think we can say we \nintend to finish tonight. We can try. I do not know how many votes we \nwill have. In the meantime, we are still busy putting some language \ntogether.\n  Senator Hutchison has asked that I yield 10 minutes to her. I will \nspeak for 1 minute of her time, and I think Senator Dodd is going to \nuse a couple minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes be set aside at this point \nfor Senator Hutchison to talk about a bill she is introducing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \nDomenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 3021 are located in \ntoday's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint \nResolutions.'')\n  Mr. Domenici addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I note the presence on the floor of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Might I make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  We now are on the energy and water appropriations bill; is that \ncorrect, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no time scheduled for its adoption or for \ntermination of debate on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no time agreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senators, I have talked with the majority \nleader, and I have talked to Senator Harkin. Even though there is a \nvery large number of amendments, we are trying to finish tonight. We \nhave arranged to get started with two amendments. We are going to \naccept one; and one is going to require a vote. Then, when we finish \ndebating those--we might have to put off the vote, I say to Senator \nDurbin, for a little while while we work out all these amendments. But \nwe will eventually, at some point, have a vote on Senator Durbin's \namendment before we finish this bill.\n  We are going to listen for 10, 15 minutes to Senator Harkin's \nconcerns about the NIF project at Lawrence Livermore. Senator Reid and \nI have agreed we will accept his amendment tonight and proceed after \nthat to debate Senator Durbin's amendment.\n  I say to Senator Durbin, a Senator who is opposed to his amendment \nwill arrive soon. I assume we will have a time agreement, if it is \nsatisfactory to Senator Bond.\n  Can we do that right now?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. I underline what the Senator from New Mexico has said. My \nfriend from Illinois has three amendments he has filed. It is my \nunderstanding that he is going to offer one of those; and if there \nwould be an up-or-down vote on that, he would withdraw two of the \namendments--and not only an up-or-down vote but no second-degree \namendments.\n  So the Senator from Illinois would agree--if I could have the \nattention of the Senator from New Mexico for just a minute. The Senator \nfrom Illinois would agree to 30 minutes equally divided, with a vote, \nwith no second-degree amendments. That is my understanding, that we \nwould have a vote on that at some time before final passage later \ntonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I wonder if he would agree to 20 \nminutes equally divided?\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be prepared to withdraw two of the three \namendments. I will be prepared to limit my debate to no more than 10 \nminutes on my side, if we can agree also that it be an up-or-down vote \non the amendment, as offered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will have an up-or-down vote. We checked that with \nthe opposition. It is not me agreeing. He wants to agree to that. So \nwhen he arrives, there will be 10 minutes on a side. I say to the \nSenator, you will agree to withdraw your other two amendments and \nproceed with the amendment with reference to the Missouri River that we \nhave seen?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we get an agreement with Senator Harkin?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator would let me have a minute?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Durbin--I just got word--I hear \nSenator Bond is en route and that he did not say that he would agree to \nno amendments. I think he will when he gets to the floor, but I just \nwant to make clear I probably overspoke. I thought he had said that.\n  Can we just wait for him to arrive?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend, we will revisit it when he is on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want on his amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I may have 15 minutes, that would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa has 15 minutes.\n  The clerk has yet to report the amendment. The amendment at the desk \nis not the same as the one filed. It will require unanimous consent to \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4101, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nI sent to the desk be substituted for the earlier amendment I had on \nfile.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4101, as modified.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit to $74,100,000 the total amount of funds that may be \n      expended for construction of the National Ignition Facility)\n\n       On page 90, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       Sec. 320. (a) Limitation on Total Cost of Construction of \n     National Ignition Facility.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the total amount that may be expended for \n     purposes of construction of the National Ignition Facility, \n     including conceptual and construction design associated with \n     the Facility, may not exceed $74,100,000.\n       (b) Independent Review of National Ignition Facility.--(1) \n     The Administrator of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration shall provide for an independent review of the \n     National Ignition Facility and the Inertial Confinement \n     Fusion Program. The review shall be conducted by the National \n     Academy of Sciences.\n       (2) The review under paragraph (1) shall address the \n     following:\n       (A) Whether or not the National Ignition Facility is \n     required in order to maintain the safety and reliability of \n     the current nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (B) Whether or not alternatives to the National Ignition \n     Facility could achieve the objective of maintaining the \n     safety and reliability of the current nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (C) Any current technical problems with the National \n     Ignition Facility, including the effects of such problems on \n     the cost, schedule, or likely success of the National \n     Ignition Facility project.\n       (D) The likely cost of the construction of the National \n     Ignition facility, including any conceptual and construction \n     design and manufacture associated with construction of the \n     Facility.\n       (E) The potential effects of cost overruns in the \n     construction of the National Ignition Facility on the \n     stockpile stewardship program.\n       (F) The cost and advisability of scaling back the number of \n     proposed beamlines at the National Ignition Facility.\n       (3) Not later than September 1, 2001, the Administrator \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the review conducted \n     under this subsection. The report shall include the results \n     of the review and such comments and recommendations regarding \n     the results of the review as the Administrator considers \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the so-\ncalled NIF. I will use that acronym.\n  The National Ignition Facility is a massive research facility being \nbuilt at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Labs in \nCalifornia. NIF supposedly--I use that word ``supposedly''--was a part \nof the Stockpile Stewardship Program which is supposed to maintain the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal without exploding any \nnuclear weapons.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, this is a deeply troubled \nprogram. The General Accounting Office recently issued a report that \ndetailed management turmoil, cost overruns, slipping schedules, and \nunsolved technical problems. I am deeply concerned that we will pour \nmore and more money into NIF, money that could be used for other \nscientific purposes. NIF appears to be mostly a jobs program for \nnuclear weapons scientists. That is the point.\n  Let me review the history of the cost projections for the National \nIgnition Facility. In 1990, a National Academy of Sciences panel \nestimated we could achieve ignition with a $400 million facility. They \ncalled it a reasonable cost. Then it went up to $677 million in 1993. \nThen it went up to $2.1 billion this past June for construction costs \nand another $1.1 billion for operation before it is completed. Then in \nAugust, the GAO found that the Department of Energy has still neglected \nto include the cost of targets and other parts of the program. They \nhave now suggested a total cost of close to $4 billion. It is going up \nall the time. We were up to $4 billion in August. Outside experts, \nadding in operation costs for another 25 years, the uncertainties \nbecause research and development are underway, estimate the life-cycle \ncosts are now somewhere upwards of about $10 billion and counting. This \nis not a reasonable cost; it is a massive public boondoggle.\n  I will say that at this point--and I will say it again and again \nuntil we finally resolve this issue of the National Ignition Facility--\nif you liked the Clinch River breeder reactor that we debated here \nalmost 20 years ago, that we poured billions of dollars into before we \nfinally got rid of it, if you liked the Clinch River breeder reactor, \nyou will love this program. If you liked the Superconducting Super \nCollider, you would like this program.\n  Under Clinch River, we spent $1.5 billion before we finally killed \nit. It was projected to cost $3.5 billion. We thought that was \noutlandish. On the Superconducting Super Collider, we spent $2.2 \nbillion. It was estimated to cost over $11 billion. We heard all the \narguments; I remember them well. I was involved in both debates on \nClinch River and on the Superconducting Super Collider: We have spent \nall that money; we are just going to let it go to waste.\n  We heard those arguments over and over again: Once we put that money \nin, we have to complete it.\n  I ask you, are we worse off as a country now because we did not build \nthe Clinch River breeder reactor; we came to our senses in time? Are we \nworse off as a country because we came to our senses in time and did \nnot complete the Superconducting Super Collider? Not at all. We are \nbetter off because we saved the money. Now we are down to the National \nIgnition Facility, another one of the big boondoggles of all time.\n  We have spent about $800 million, give or take a few. It is estimated \nto cost about $4 billion--slightly more than the Clinch River breeder \nreactor--and counting, as I said. Four billion is just one of the most \nrecent estimates. It is going to be more than that. Yet we are hearing: \nWell, we have spent the $800 million; we ought to keep spending the \nmoney.\n\n  As this National Ignition Facility continues, keep in mind the Clinch\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nRiver breeder reactor, keep in mind the Superconducting Super Collider. \nAsk yourselves if we didn't do the right thing by stopping those at the \ntime and saving our taxpayers money.\n  We have had a lot of problems with NIF. They have repeatedly tried to \nhide the true costs of the project. In fact, DOE and lab officials told \nGAO that they deliberately set an unrealistically low initial budget \nbecause they feared Congress would not fund a realistic one.\n  This is directly from the GAO report:\n\n       DOE and Laboratory officials associated with NIF told us \n     that they recognized it would cost more than planned, but \n     that they accepted this unrealistic budget in the belief that \n     Congress would not fund NIF at a higher cost. . . .\n\n  They lied to us. They simply lied to us. They admitted it to GAO. Now \nthey want more money. Is this what we reward? Is this the kind of good \nstewardship we reward?\n  We had an independent review last year that was supposed to come to \nCongress. The lab and DOE officials edited it before we got it. They \nhave hidden problems from DOE. When Secretary Richardson praised the \nproject out at Livermore last year, he proclaimed it on cost and on \nschedule. But the lab officials knew it was actually over budget and \nfar behind. They had known it for months. They simply just did not tell \nthe Secretary of Energy.\n  So what is this NIF? Why is it necessary? NIF is a stadium-sized \nbuilding in which they plan to place 192 lasers all pointed at one very \nsmall BB-sized, even smaller pellet. When all these lasers fire at one \ntime, it is going to create a lot of heat, a lot of pressure, \nhopefully, as they say, to create nuclear fusion. These weapons \nscientists hope they will achieve ignition; that is, to get more energy \nfrom the fusion than they put in with the lasers.\n  The stated purposes of NIF: One, to simulate conditions in exploding \nnuclear weapons; two, to maintain a pool of nuclear weapon scientists \nat Livermore; and three, to conduct basic research towards fusion \nenergy.\n  Let me take the last one first. In the House I was on the Science and \nTechnology Committee for 10 years. We had a lot of dealings with \nLawrence Livermore at that time on something called Shiva, a big laser \nproject. It cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. They were going to \nprove they could develop inertial confinement laser fusion energy. We \nspent a lot of money on it. It is now on the scrap heap someplace. We \nwasted a lot of money on that project, too.\n  Again, let me talk about the stockpile stewardship. It may be true \nthat NIF would provide useful data for simulating nuclear weapons \nexplosions. But we don't need that data to maintain the nuclear arsenal \nwe have today. For decades, we have assured the safety and reliability \nof our nuclear weapons with a careful engineering program.\n  First of all, all the weapons we have in our stockpile were tested in \nmore than 1,000 nuclear tests prior to the ban on nuclear explosions--\n1,000 of them. Secondly, in addition, every year, 11 weapons of each \ntype are removed from the stockpile, taken apart, disassembled, and the \ncomponents are carefully examined and tested for any signs of aging or \nother problems. All of the components can be tested, short of creating \nan actual nuclear explosion. If any problems are found, components can \nbe remanufactured to original specifications.\n  So far, the evidence indicates that the weapons are not noticeably \naging. These activities we have underway right now are low cost. Yet \nthey provide a secure and tested way of maintaining our present nuclear \nstockpile. We don't need a $4 billion facility at Lawrence Livermore to \ndo what we are doing right now. We can and will continue these \nsurveillance activities of our stockpile.\n  The kind of detailed information on nuclear explosions that NIF could \nprovide is needed only to modify weapons or design new ones. But we \ndon't need to design any new nuclear weapons. Indeed, the more changes \nwe make, the further we will move from the nuclear tests we have \nconducted and the less confident we can be that our nuclear weapons \nwill work as intended.\n  In short, we have conducted over 1,000 nuclear explosions and tests. \nWe have designed, redesigned, compacted, made smaller specifically \ndesigned nuclear weapons. We don't need the NIF for any more design, \nbut that is what they intend to do with it. That is why scientists of \nwidely divergent views on other issues agree we do not need NIF for \nstockpile stewardship.\n  Edward Teller, known as the father of the hydrogen bomb, when asked \nwhat role NIF would have in maintaining the nuclear stockpile, replied, \n``None whatsoever.''\n  Robert Puerifoy, former vice president of Sandia Lab, said, ``NIF is \nworthless . . . it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period.''\n  Seymour Sack, a former weapons scientist at Livermore, called NIF \n``worse than worthless'' for stockpile stewardship.\n  Again, the NIF facility also cannot be justified for basic science or \nfusion energy research. About 85 percent of the planned experiments are \nfor nuclear weapons physics. Most of the remainder are on nuclear \nweapons effects. So there is precious little left for any kind of basic \nor applied sciences.\n  What we are left with is a $4 billion full employment program for a \nfew nuclear weapons scientists. We can do better than that. We \ncertainly do need to maintain some nuclear weapons expertise as long as \nwe maintain nuclear weapons. As I have said, there is a better way and \na cheaper way than spending billions of dollars on construction \ncontracts. It makes absolutely no sense to spend these billions when we \nhave a well-settled, time-tested, proven way of making sure our nuclear \nstockpile is safe and is workable.\n  So not only is NIF not needed for this stockpile stewardship, but as \nthe cost of this facility continues to escalate, it is going to steal \nfunding from other stockpile stewardship activities. Just as we found \nthat the Superconducting Super Collider was going to steal from other \nbasic physics research, and as we found the Clinch River breeder \nreactor would take other needed energy programs, NIF is going to do the \nsame thing.\n\n  The administration has requested an additional $135 million for \nconstruction of NIF this year, and that is going to be taken from other \nstockpile stewardship activities, in addition to the $74 million that \nis in this bill. So if you think we are only spending $74 million on \nNIF, forget it. They have already requested to transfer another $135 \nmillion from other activities.\n  The administration has requested an even larger increase for fiscal \nyear 2002, $180 million, and hundreds of millions of dollars more in \nfuture years. Again, I submit that we will be starving basic science \nprograms and physics programs in order to get the money to build this \nproject at Lawrence Livermore.\n  Even Sandia Lab has publicly expressed concern. They said in a \nstatement earlier this year:\n\n       The apparent delay and significant increase in cost for the \n     NIF is sufficient that it will disrupt the investment needed \n     to be made at the other laboratories, and perhaps at the \n     production plants, by several years. This causes us to \n     question what is a reasonable additional investment in the \n     National Ignition Facility.\n\n  Lastly--and I will end on this note--even if it is built, the \nNational Ignition Facility may never achieve ignition. Even Lawrence \nLivermore's NIF project manager, Ed Moses, suggested, ``The goal of \nachieving ignition is a long shot.'' Physicist Leo Mascheroni is quoted \nin the August 18 issue of Science magazine as saying, ``From my point \nof view, the chance that this reaches ignition is zero. Not 1 percent. \nThose who say 5 percent are just being generous to be polite.'' Well, \nthere you have it.\n  If it does work, the NIF may itself be a nuclear proliferation \nthreat. The Lawrence Livermore Institutional Plan describes the main \npurpose of NIF:\n\n       To play an essential role in assessing physics regimes of \n     interest in nuclear weapons design and to provide nuclear \n     weapon-related physics data, particularly in the area of \n     secondary design.\n\n  So that is what it is for--designing new nuclear weapons. But we \ndon't need to. It is of dubious value in maintaining the stockpile when \nwe already have, as I said, a time-tested, proven way of doing so.\n  Well, Mr. President, the amendment I offered basically leaves the \n$74.1 million that is in the bill. But it only says that was all they \ncould use right now. My amendment says the administrators of the \nNational Nuclear Security\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nAdministration shall provide for an independent review of the NIF and \nthe Inertia Confinement Review Program. This review shall be conducted \nby the National Academy of Sciences.\n  I have asked that the review address the following: whether it is \nrequired in order to maintain the reliability and safety of the \nstockpile; whether or not the alternatives could achieve the same \nobjective; any current technical problems that we have; the likely cost \nof the construction; the potential effects of cost overruns; lastly, \nthe cost and availability of scaling back the number of proposed beam \nlines at the NIF.\n  Basically, what I am saying is let's put the money in that we have \nnow, but let's have the National Academy of Sciences do an independent \nstudy that would not be reviewed and edited by Lawrence Livermore, and \nthis report would be submitted by September of 2001. That is really \nwhat this amendment does. I am grateful to the manager and the chairman \nof the committee for accepting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from New Mexico speaks, I \nwant to tell my friend from Iowa how appreciative I am of him bringing \nthis to the floor. With his statement tonight, he has made it so the \nNational Ignition Facility will be given a much closer look. It needs \nto be looked at much more closely. I already have a statement in the \nRecord, and I don't need to repeat how I feel about this whole project. \nI want to acknowledge to my friend what a great service he has rendered \nto the country by his statement tonight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada that we \nreally started questioning this because of some of the information the \nSenator from Nevada was given by officials from the DOE in Lawrence \nLivermore. That raised a lot of questions about where we were headed.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona wants to use a \nfew minutes on this discussion. But before we do that, I wonder if I \ncan get a unanimous consent agreement that has been cleared by both \nsides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the Durbin amendment at \n8 p.m. and there be up to 20 minutes of debate to be equally divided \nprior to the vote and no second-degree amendments be in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  Second, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote on the Durbin \namendment Senator Harkin be recognized to offer his amendment--which he \nhas already offered--the National Ignition Facility amendment, that \ntime on the amendment be limited to 30 minutes for the full debate; \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order; that Senator Harkin has \nused his time, and we will not use 15 minutes on our side.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote relative to \nthe Durbin amendment the two managers be recognized to offer all the \ncleared amendments and amendments that we have to modify to get \ncleared;\n  And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \ndisposition of the Durbin amendment the bill be advanced to third \nreading, the Senate proceed to passage of H.R. 4733, following the \npassage of the bill the Senate insist on its amendments and request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate which would be the entire \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto make sure it is clear that the Senator from Illinois will have an \nup-or-down vote on his amendment and that there will be no motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. I think I said that. I am glad to have \nthe clarification.\n  Mr. REID. Also, even though this isn't part of the unanimous consent \nrequest, because we have so much, I wonder if we could have some \ngeneral idea about how long the Senator from Arizona wishes to speak.\n  Mr. KYL. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Could we make that part of the unanimous consent agreement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not hear what the Senator from New \nMexico said about my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We were offering this as if the Senator had not given \nit, and I was trying to say he already has. I thank the Senator for \nasking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Domenici yielding some \ntime to me.\n  I think, while we have accepted this amendment, it is important that \nthe Record be corrected because Senator Harkin said some things that I \nbelieve not to be correct.\n  I also think that we need to be careful about how we act around here.\n  The fact that some people made some estimates as to how much it was \ngoing to cost to construct the National Ignition Facility and in fact \nwere greatly underestimating the cost of the facility should not be a \nreason for us to suggest that this facility is unnecessary. They \nsuggest that it is a ``boondoggle,'' to use the word of the Senator \nfrom Iowa. They suggest that it is in the same category of some other \ndiscretionary projects which we end up not funding in Congress. In \nfact, the Senator from Iowa and others recognized its importance in \ntheir support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when they argued \nthat we didn't need testing any more because we were going to have this \nwonderful Stockpile Stewardship Program, a part of which is the \nignition facility, and, therefore, they were willing to rely upon the \nStockpile Stewardship Program and the National Ignition Facility in \nlieu of testing forevermore. We are going to give up testing \nforevermore, Senator Harkin and others who supported the test ban \ntreaty said.\n  Now they are saying: Well, actually we don't need the National \nIgnition Facility, in our opinion. We are willing to submit the \nquestion of whether it is needed to some extraneous body.\n  But I will tell you that I visited with the head of the Lawrence \nLivermore Lab yesterday, and I talked to any number of Department of \nDefense and Department of Energy officials, as well as lab people, and \nevery one of them will confirm that the National Ignition Facility is a \ncritical component of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Without it, \neventually the Stockpile Stewardship Program provides you nothing in \nterms of data. And, indeed, our National Laboratories would probably \nnot be able to certificate the stockpile of the United States, which, \nof course, would require advertising--something I know the Senator from \nIowa would not want.\n  The National Ignition Facility is a key component of the Stockpile \nStewardship Program because it will actually allow an event to occur \nthat simulates a nuclear explosion. Calculations can then occur based \nupon that event to either confirm or deny the theory that the \nscientists have developed that they plugged into the computers.\n  But there is a point at which you can run all the calculations you \nwant. Unless you have something to compare them to, some real event, \nthey are worthless or meaningless.\n  That is why the ignition facility is so important. Even though it is \na little miniature thing--it is not like a big nuclear explosion--it \ncan provide them with the data they need to then validate the theories \nof the Stockpile Stewardship Program which they have run on their \ncomputers.\n  The argument of the Senator from Iowa, it seems to me, is a little \nbit like this: He loans the family car out to his son for a date. He \nsays: Be careful, son. Be in by midnight. The son comes back at \nmidnight: Gee, dad. I am sorry, I wrecked the car. The dad says: It is \nsuch a horrible thing you did that we are not going to repair the car. \nYou are cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\n  It is true that the cost of this program has gone up. I believe it \nhas gone up because of mistakes that were made on the part of the \nlaboratory in deciding how much this was going to cost.\n  It is easy for us to stand up and criticize it and say you all made a \nmistake. That is easy to do. I will join my colleague in that \ncriticism. But what do you do about it? Do you decide you are not going \nto go ahead with the facility that all of the experts say is critical \nbecause it is going to cost more? That is true. But it is still \ncritical. You\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\ncan't just say because it is going to cost more than we thought that we \nare just going to give up on the whole project. At least you can't \nadvocate the Stockpile Stewardship Program, as I know my colleague from \nIowa is.\n  I want to make this point, even though this amendment is going to be \naccepted. I am hopeful and I presume that it will not be a part of the \nfinal legislation that goes to the President for his signature. It \nwould be wrong to cap the funding on this, and it would be wrong to \nassume that the National Ignition Facility is not a critical part of \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n  I want to be able to correct the record so we don't leave any \nmisimpression that somehow this is a discretionary program, that we may \nnot need it, and because it is going to cost somewhat more than we \nthought, therefore we should be willing to jettison it.\n  It is a critical component to ensure the viability, the reliability, \nand the safety of our nuclear stockpile. I assume every one of us in \nthis room is very firmly committed to the proposition that the nuclear \nstockpile of the United States must be safe and reliable, and if it \ntakes this National Ignition Facility to ensure that, then we ought to \nbe willing to support it even if it is going to cost a little bit more \nthan we originally anticipated.\n  I appreciate the strong work of the Senator from New Mexico on this, \nand his willingness to yield me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl. I believe that is \nthe end of the discussion, unless the Senator from Iowa wanted a couple \nof minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Another minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. I think \nwhat Senator Kyl has said indicates why we need a little bit more \nrobust debate on this issue than what we are having tonight. I know it \nis late. We are moving on. But I really think we need to have a pretty \ninvolved discussion and debate on this issue. Obviously, we have a \ndisagreement on this issue. Again, I agree with the Senator from \nArizona that we want our stockpiles to be safe and reliable. The \nquestion is, What is the best methodology to accomplish that at the \ncheapest cost to the taxpayers and that perhaps will not open the door \nto other problems down the road while we might agree upon the basis of \nhow we get there? That is why I think we really need a more robust \ndebate on this issue of the National Ignition Facility than what we \nhave had in the past.\n  Businesses disagree on this. Scientists disagree on it. Obviously, \npoliticians are disagreeing on it. That is why on this one, which is \ngoing to cost a lot of money, I hope that next year--we will not this \nyear, but I hope next year--we can keep this study. I hope we do have \nthe study, as the Senator from Arizona said, by some outside body. The \namendment calls for the National Academy of Sciences to do it. I can't \nthink of a more appropriate body to do an independent analysis of the \nstudy than the National Academy of Sciences, where they can call on a \nbroad variety of different disciplines to have input.\n  I hope we at least have that and come back next year. Let's have a \nmore robust and more involved debate on whether or not we really want \nto continue with the National Ignition Facility.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document \nentitled ``National Ignition Facility (NIF)--An Integral Part of the \nStockpile Stewardship Program'' be printed in the Record to make the \npoint that the Clinton administration and five laboratory directors \nbelieve this is a critical project and that at least $95 million is \nnecessary in fiscal year 2001 for the NIF projects.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  National Ignition Facility (NIF)--An Integral Part of the Stockpile \n                          Stewardship Program\n\n       The NNSA is currently in the process of developing its \n     long-term plan for the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). \n     This plan will address all elements needed to maintain the \n     safety, security, and reliability of the nation's nuclear \n     weapons stockpile now and into the future, including science, \n     infrastructure, and people.\n       NIF supports the SSP, and is a vital element of the SSP in \n     three important ways: (1) the experimental study of issues of \n     aging or refurbishment; (2) weapons science and code \n     development; and (3) attracting and training the exceptional \n     scientific and technical talent required to sustain the SSP \n     over the long term. NIF is an integral part of the SSP \n     providing unique experimental capabilities that complement \n     other SSP facilities including hydrotests, pulsed power, and \n     advanced radiography. NIF addresses aspects of the relevant \n     science of materials that cannot be reached in other \n     facilities.\n       We concur that the NIF offers a unique, critical capability \n     within a ``balanced'' SSP. As with other elements of the SSP, \n     its long-term role must be integrated within the overall \n     requirements of the Program. Options should not be foreclosed \n     or limited but should be maintained to allow for its further \n     development. At this critical juncture, we agree that in \n     order to maintain the NIF within a balanced program an \n     additional $95 million is necessary in FY 2001 for the NIF \n     Project.\n     Madelyn R. Creedon, NNSA.\n     C. Bruce Tarter, LLNL.\n     John C. Browne, LANL.\n     C. Paul Robinson, SNL.\n     Date: September 6, 2000.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Harkin for \nmodifying his amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. \nThe original amendment would have eliminated construction money for the \nNational Ignition Facility (NIF) which is an essential component to our \nStockpile Stewardship Program. Any elimination of funding for the \nprogram would negate the nearly $1 billion Congress has spent on this \nproject thus far, and would cripple our nation's arms control and non-\nproliferation efforts. Still, the amendment agreed to does limit the \namount of funding for Fiscal Year 2001 which will make it increasingly \ndifficult to meet the goals of the project.\n  The United States has made a strong commitment against underground \nnuclear testing. In order to meet this goal and maintain the nuclear \ndeterrent of the United States, we must have a safe, reliable, and \neffective science based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP).\n  As a key element to the SSP, NIF will be the only facility able to \nachieve conditions of temperature and pressure in a laboratory setting \nthat have only been reached in explosions of thermonuclear weapons and \nin the stars. It is expected to provide important contributions to the \ngoals of stockpile stewardship in the absence of nuclear testing and to \ncontribute to the advancement of inertial fusion energy and other \nscientific research efforts.\n  I am proud that institutions and contractors throughout New York \nState have provided valuable services and tools for this project that \nare essential to its completion. Because New York companies and \nresearch institutions provide laser, optics, and other tools, \nunderground nuclear testing will no longer be necessary. That would be \na huge benefit to the entire world.\n  I understand that DOE has recognized that there are some problems \nwith NIF, but DOE is working hard to take the necessary steps to \ncorrect these issues. Project management has been restructured and has \ndemonstrated over the last six months that it is capable of managing a \nproject of this scope. It has already been determined that the \nunderlying science associated with NIF is sound.\n  Until DOE's investigation is complete, it is premature to cut funding \nfor this program. The cost increases should not override the importance \nof this project in our goal to ensure the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons.\n  Any repeal of this funding will cripple the valuable science and \nknowledge that is coming together from around the world in our effort \nto maintain the United States nuclear deterrent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4101) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 4024, 4032, 4033, 4039, 4040, 4042, 4046, 4047, 4057, \n4062, 4063, 4067, 4068, 4069, 4070, 4071, 4072, 4073, 4074, 4076, 4077, \n      4078, 4083, 4085, 4088, 4093, 4100, 4102, and 4103, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes \nabout my amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill now \nbefore the Senate. My amendment is needed to allow the Army Corps of \nEngineers to continue to work on a feasibility study to alleviate the \nchronic flooding in the Southwest Valley of Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n  First, I want to thank the chairman, Senator Domenici, the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Reid, and their fine staffs for \nall their good work on this Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This \nbill provides vital funding for a number of programs that are important \nto my state of New Mexico and to the nation, and I thank them for their \nefforts.\n  For a number of years the Southwest Valley area of Albuquerque in my \nstate of New Mexico has been prone to flooding after major rainstorms. \nThe flooding has caused damage to irrigation and drainage structures, \nerosion of roadways, pavement, telephone and electrical transmission \nconduits, contaminated water and soil due to overflowing septic tanks, \ndamaged homes, businesses, and farms, and presented hazards to \nautomobile traffic. In 1997, Bernalillo County approached the Army \nCorps Engineers to request a reconnaissance study of the chronic \nflooding problems\n  The study area encompassed 17.8 square miles of mostly residential \nneighborhoods along the banks of the Rio Grande in the Southwest Valley \nand the 50 square miles on the West Mesa, including the Isleta Pueblo, \nthat drain into the valley. The reconnaissance study began in March \n1998 and is now completed.\n  The conclusions of the reconnaissance study define the magnitude of \nthe continuing flooding problem in the Southwest Valley. The study also \nestablished a clear federal interest in the drainage project, found a \npositive cost to benefit ratio for the project, and identified work \nitems necessary to begin designing a range of solutions to alleviate \nthe chronic flooding problems in the valley.\n  In 1999, based on the positive findings of the reconnaissance study, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee authorized the Army Corps of \nEngineers to conduct a full study to determine the feasibility of a \nproject for flood damage reduction in Albuquerque's Southwest Valley. \nThe authorization is contained in section 433 of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999--P.L. 106-53. I want to thank the EPW committee \nfor authorizing this\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\nmuch needed feasibility study. The study began in March 1999 and is \nexpected to be completed in February 2002.\n  Currently, Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo \nFlood Control Authority and the Corps are working cooperatively on the \nfeasibility study. Last year, the administration requested, and the \nCongress appropriated $250,000 in federal funding for the feasibility \nstudy. This year, the request was for $330,000. I want to thank the \ncommittee for again providing the full amount requested.\n  Last July I had an opportunity to meet with the engineers from the \nCorps, the County, and AMAFCA to get an update on the study and to tour \nthe areas in the Southwest Valley that are subject to chronic flooding. \nAt the end of the tour, the Corps indicated to me that based on the \ninitial results of the feasibility study, the flooding there was quite \nsevere but the project did not seem to meet the Corps' required flow \ncriterion of 1800 cubic feet per second for the 100-year flood. These \nflow criteria are outlined in the Engineering Regulations established \nfor Corps. Because of the obvious severity of the flooding, the \nengineers requested a legislative waiver of the regulations. Without a \nwaiver, the Corps could not continue as a partner in the project. They \nalso indicated the Corps' regulations do not contain any provision to \nwaive the peak discharge criterion.\n  I would like to take a few moments to describe briefly the unique \nsituation in the Southwest Valley that necessitates a waiver of the \nCorps' standard regulations. The land along the west side of the Rio \nGrande is essentially flat. The river is contained by large earthen \nlevees, which were built for flood control. When a river is contained \nthis way by levees, the sediment accumulates in the river bed, slowly \nraising the level of the river. Of course, if there were no levees, \nwhen sediment builds up, the river would simply change course to a \nlower level. However, over the years, as the sediment has continued to \naccumulate in the Rio Grande, the level of the river within the levees \nis now higher than the surrounding land. Thus, when there are heavy \nrains during the monsoon season, the runoff has nowhere to go--it \nsimply flows into large pools on the valley floor, flooding homes and \nfarms. The water can't flow uphill into the river, so it stays there \nuntil it either evaporates or is pumped up and hauled away.\n  If the flood water sits in large pools and isn't flowing, it clearly \ncan't meet any criterion based on the flow rate of water. Indeed, given \nthe unique nature of the flooding in the Southwest Valley, most areas \nsubject to chronic flood damage do not meet the Corps' peak discharge \ncriterion.\n  During my visit in July, the three partners in the feasibility study \nspecifically asked me for help in obtaining a waiver of the Corps' \ntechnical requirements to deal with this special situation. My \namendment provides the necessary waiver the Corps needs to continue to \nwork in partnership with the county and AMAFCA on this project. This is \nnot a new authorization; Congress authorized this study last year. My \namendment is a simple technical fix to the existing authorization. \nSimilar language is already in the House companion to this Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. I do believe the unique situation in \nBernalillo County warrants a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations, \nand I hope the Senate will adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the amendments en bloc, I move to \nreconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Grassley from Iowa \nfor 2 minutes with reference to explaining an amendment in which he \nprocured a number of cosponsors, which was just accepted. He would like \nto talk about it.\n  Heretofore, Senator Kyl was referring to the Senator from Iowa, and \nthere were two Senators from Iowa on the floor. I believe it should be \nreflected that he was speaking of Senator Harkin from Iowa, not Senator \nGrassley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the first place, I ask unanimous consent, to the \namendment I have had filed at the desk that was just accepted, that the \nadditional cosponsors be added of Senators DeWine, Lugar, and Kerrey. I \nthank Senator Domenici and Senator Reid for accepting the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce a \ncritically important amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill, and I would like to thank Senators Grams, Voinovich, DeWine, \nLugar, Kerrey of Nebraska, and Snowe for joining me in this effort.\n  This amendment would require the administration to provide Congress \ntheir plan to address the increasing costs in home heating fuels by \nSeptember 30. Quite frankly, this plan is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, on July 3 of this year, I wrote President Clinton and \nEnergy Secretary Richardson to bring their attention to the ever-\nincreasing price of natural gas. I also shared my concern regarding the \ninadequacy of natural gas supplies to meet demand through the summer \nand into this winter. I requested that the President inform me of the \nactions he planned to take to address the higher-than-normal heating \nbills my constituents will surely face this winter.\n  Jack Lew, Director of the Office of Management and Budget responded \nto my letter on July 31. Regrettably, Mr. Lew thanked me for expressing \nmy concerns regarding the increase in fuel costs this past winter.\n  Let me repeat that. In response to my letter about the inadequacy of \nhome heating fuel for the upcoming winter to the President, I received \na letter thanking me for my concerns about the increase in fuel costs \nlast winter. Mr. President, it is this type of irresponsible behavior \nthat has led this country into the next energy crisis.\n  Today, natural gas is at a record high near $5.00 per million BTU's, \nwhile supplies hover below the five-year average. This 50 percent \nincrease will certainly impact the more than 80 percent of Iowa \nhouseholds which use natural gas to heat their homes.\n  Furthermore, home heating oil is near a 10-year high, at 98 cents per \ngallon, already 41 percent above the average price last fall and \nwinter. And crude oil remains near a 10-year high.\n  While testifying before the Senate Agriculture Committee on July 20, \nSecretary Richardson stated that the administration had developed a \nplan and was in the process of finalizing a plan to address potential \nhome heating oil and natural gas shortages. Mr. Secretary, I have not \nseen your plan. I want to see the plan.\n  I won't allow the Department of Energy to sit idly by as home heating \nfuels double. For this reason, I am offering this amendment to require \nthe Department of Energy to provide a report to Congress by September \n30, 2000, detailing their plan to address the high cost of home heating \noil and natural gas.\n  I believe this amendment will force the administration to take a much \nmore active role in remedying the home heating fuel crisis.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 4034, 4035, 4036, 4037, 4043, 4051, 4055, 4056, 4058, \n    4061, 4064, 4079, 4080, 4082, 4092, 4096, and 4112, En Bloc, as \n                                Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4105 that I offered \nlast evening, that Senator Durbin is now going to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Durbin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4105.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, strike lines 6 through 13 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 103. MISSOURI RIVER MASTER MANUAL.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     make final revisions to the Missouri River Master Water \n     Control Manual.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand correctly, we have 20 minutes equally \ndivided on this amendment. I will try to be brief.\n  I had a conversation with Senator Bond. We are perilously close to \nbeing in an agreement. I don't know if we will reach that point; \nperhaps we will. Let me suggest to him and to those who are following \nthe course of this debate, I think the debate last night between \nSenator Daschle and Senator Bond was a good one because it laid out, I \nthink, very clearly, both sides of this issue.\n  I come to this debate trying to find some common ground, if there is, \nand I don't know how much common ground one can find on a river. In \nthis situation, we are dealing with the question of the future of the \nMissouri River. It is not a parochial interest; it is an interest which \naffects the Mississippi River and many who have States bordering the \nMississippi River, and agricultural and commercial interests that are \ninvolved in the future of that river.\n  I listened to the debate yesterday and tried to follow it. I came to \nthe conclusion that the Senator from Missouri was arguing that he, with \nhis section 103, did not want to see the so-called spring rise occur \nnext year, in the year 2001, and that was the purpose of his amendment.\n  It is my understanding that if we did nothing, the spring rise would \nnot occur anyway because there is no intention to change the manual for \nthe river that would result in that as of next year.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to say that there would be no final \nrevisions to the manual that would take place in the upcoming fiscal \nyear, October 1, 2000, to October 1, 2001, but we would allow all of \nthe agencies that are currently studying the future of the river and \namending the 1960 manual the opportunity to consider all of the \noptions, to have public comment, to invite in the experts.\n  I went through the debate, read through the Congressional Record. My \ncolleague from Missouri, yesterday, I think, said something along these \nlines because he said:\n\n       Contrary to what you just heard, [referring to Senator \n     Daschle's debate] any other aspect of the process to review \n     and amend the operation of the Missouri River, to change the \n     Missouri River manual, to consider opinions, to discuss, to \n     debate, to continue the vitally important research that is \n     going on now in the river and how it can improve its habitat \n     will continue.\n\n  The purpose of my amendment is to say let us protect that. Let us \nprotect that study and that option. No final revision can be made to \nthe manual that would effect the change that I think is a concern of \nthe Senator from Missouri and others during the course of the next \nfiscal year. So we are preserving the right and opportunity to study \nthe future of the river, but we are saying you cannot make a change in \nthe manual that will change the policies on the river during that \nperiod of time.\n  I think that will give us an opportunity for better information and a \nfull opportunity for public comment. We will learn more in the process \nfrom the experts and the experts include not only the \nenvironmentalists, who are very important to this discussion, but also \nmany, many others, including those in the agricultural community and in \nthe navigation community. All of them should have an opportunity to be \npart of this debate about what the manual change will be. That is what \nI am trying to preserve with this amendment, to try to find, if you \nwill, a middle ground between 103 and where Senator Daschle was \nyesterday.\n  Let me also say that under my amendment the spring rise or low summer \nflows proposal would not be implemented next year. We have discussed \nthis with the Fish and Wildlife, as well as the Corps of Engineers. It \nis our understanding that if you prohibit a final revision in the \nmanual that you are not going to be able to change the manual as of \nnext year, and there is no proposal on the table that would suggest \nanything is going to occur before the year 2003.\n  I will concede to my friend from Missouri the letter from the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, and one particular sentence or two in it, leaves \nsome question. But our followup contact with the Corps of Engineers \nsuggests they are not going to authorize a spring flow next year.\n  I don't know if what I am suggesting by way of an amendment will win \nthe support of the administration. I don't know the answer to that. \nWhat I am offering is a good faith attempt to continue the study, \ncontinue the survey,\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nand not make any changes in the policy as of the next fiscal year; but \nto then be prepared to look at the results, consider the public \ncomments, and try to come up with a policy that is sound.\n  The Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Illinois both \nrepresent agricultural interests. We are constantly being asked to try \nto balance this, the commercial needs and environmental needs. \nCertainly the same thing applies to this debate on the history. We are \ntrying to balance the commercial needs for navigation and the needs for \nenvironment. I think we can do it.\n\n  I think if we are open and honest and have the public comment, which \nthe Senator from Missouri has invited, that it will occur. I will \nlisten carefully. As the Senator from Missouri said last night during \nthe course of the debate: Let the debates go on. We would like to see \nsound science. We would like to see the best information available. \nFish and Wildlife has not shown it to us. I concede during the next \nyear allowing that information to come forward.\n  Given the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently supports the \nspring rise and low summer flows profile, taking it off the table for \ndiscussion is a recipe for stalemate. Let us at least have the \ndiscussion about the spring flow. I think section 103 precludes even \nthat discussion. Let us not change the policy as to the spring flow in \nthe next year, but let us debate it. Let's try to find what the best \noutcome would be for the future of the river and those who depend on \nit.\n  Proposed revisions to the manual would continue to be developed under \nmy amendment. Studies would continue. Talks about alternatives to river \nmanagement among all the river's stakeholders could continue.\n  In addition, we want to get the best science we can from the National \nAcademy of Sciences, which is in the process of completing an important \nstudy on the future of the Missouri. We should not make any decisions \nabout the future of the river until that study is released, and I think \nmy amendment protects that possibility and gives you the opportunity \nduring this next year to listen to the National Academy of Sciences and \nto try to resolve that as well as to invite public input.\n  The Corps is working on a lot of alternatives to managing the \nMissouri River. I think it is fair for us to keep these proposals, \ndeveloped by farm and navigation interests and proposals developed by \nrecreation and environmental interests, all on the table and all open \nto debate.\n  This is important to my colleague from Missouri. It is really \nimportant in Illinois as well. The Missouri River feeds into the \nMississippi, and we have some 550 miles of Illinois border on that \nriver. A lot of people depend on it. I want to make certain we do the \nright thing for our farmers but also for this important piece of \nAmerica's natural heritage, the Missouri River and Mississippi River.\n  I am not here to argue about the management of the Missouri River. I \nam not competent to do it. But I think we have to bring the information \ntogether and make the most sound judgment we can about the future of \nthe river, and it is that particular approach I have offered in this \namendment. I hope the Senator from Missouri will consider it as a \nfriendly amendment, a positive and constructive alternative in the \ndebate between him and the Senator from South Dakota. I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois has said he did not want to see a spring rise in \n2001. That basically was what my amendment did.\n  When I looked at his amendment, I was very much concerned that it \nonly deals with a final revision of the master manual. What we have \nrequested--and as he has already pointed out, it has been proposed by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service in a letter that I believe has already \nbeen submitted for the Record. If not, I will submit it again for the \nRecord.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                        Denver, Co, July 12, 2000.\n     Brig.

Strock,\n     Commander, Northwest Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n         Portland, OR.\n       Dear General Strock: This letter is a result of our July \n     10, 2000, meeting in Washington, D.C. regarding the Missouri \n     River Biological Opinion attended by Assistant Secretary \n     Westphal and Director Clark. The following is a summary of \n     the discussions related to the framework of conservation \n     measures needed to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence \n     of listed species on the Missouri River.\n       The Service will recommend in our draft biological opinion \n     a spring pulse starting point of 49.5 kcfs (+17.5 above full \n     navigation service) during the first available water year and \n     an annual summer low of 21 kcfs from Gavin's Point Dam. As an \n     interim step, a spring pulse of 49.5 kcfs from Gavins Point \n     during the first available water year and a summer low of 25 \n     kcfs would be in effect each year, starting in 2001, until \n     the new Master Manual is in place or other appropriate NEPA \n     documentation. We would view this as an adaptive management \n     step that, in conjunction with robust monitoring of the \n     biological response, could help us refine a final set of \n     recommendations for implementation. A robust monitoring \n     program will be necessary to identify the desired beneficial \n     biological responses to listed species from these interim \n     measures and to provide a basis for any adjustments that may \n     be necessary. Corps representatives stated during the July \n     10th meeting that the Corps has significant discretion \n     regarding navigation and that there is flexibility in the 8 \n     month navigation season. They also stated that the length of \n     the navigation season and the flows provided during the \n     navigation season was an ``expectation'' rather than a \n     guarantee.\n       The Corps will provide a spring pulse from Fort Peck Dam as \n     discussed in our recent Portland meetings approximately one \n     year out of three beginning in 2002. As a test of the \n     spillway infrastructure, the Corps will perform a ``mini-\n     test'' in 2001. The parameters of the test will be described \n     by the Corps in your response to this letter and will \n     incorporate the direction agreed to from recent discussions \n     held in Portland.\n       The Service will identify acres of habitat (sandbar and \n     shallow/slow water) necessary to avoid jeopardy in the \n     biological opinion. We believe the Corps can use existing \n     programs and the likely expanded mitigation program to result \n     in the creation of at least one-third of these acres \n     necessary in the lower river system. The rest will need to be \n     restored through additional physical modification of existing \n     river training structures and through hydrological \n     modification. The Service believes that a majority of the \n     habitat can be created through hydrological modification.\n       The monitoring needs relative to piping plovers and least \n     terns are currently being adequately addressed by the \n     existing Corps program. The short-term monitoring needs \n     relative to the Fort Peck test for pallid sturgeon have been \n     outlined in a letter sent to the Corps on April 7, 2000. The \n     Corps is currently assisting the Service relative to these \n     short-term needs below Fort Peck. There is a need for a \n     comprehensive short-term monitoring of the response of \n     pallids to the interim flows recommended from Gavins Point. \n     The long-term needs for pallid sturgeon monitoring throughout \n     the system will be addressed in the draft biological opinion.\n       The Service has outlined the short-term propagation needs \n     (which could efficiently be fulfilled at Garrison Dam and \n     Gavins Point National Fish Hatcheries) necessary to reach \n     stocking objectives in a letter dated April 25, 2000. While \n     the Corps has indicated that they may not have authority to \n     assist in meeting these needs at Service facilities, the \n     Service believes that the Endangered Species Act would \n     provide the basis for such authority. The Service has also \n     sent a letter dated June 27, 2000, to the Corps outlining our \n     concern that a new facility at Fort Peck Dam would not meet \n     these short term needs.\n       There is agreement in principle regarding using the \n     adaptive management approach in implementing the actions and \n     goals identified in the opinion. There is also agreement \n     regarding the unbalanced intra-system regulation issues. The \n     final discussion of these two topics will be outlined in the \n     draft biological opinion which is expected to be delivered to \n     the Corps on or bout July 31, 2000.\n       The Service needs to know by July 19, 2000, if you accept \n     the six elements discussed in this letter as being reasonable \n     and prudent. We also need to know if you want to revise the \n     project description to incorporate these elements or if you \n     prefer to have them presented in the form of a RPA in a draft \n     biological opinion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------ ------.\n                                                Regional Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Their July 10 letter said to the Corps--I used the term \n``diktat'' as an authoritarian governmental directive. They tell the \nCorps of Engineers in the letter of July 12:\n\n       As an interim step, a spring pulse of 49.5 kcfs from Gavins \n     Point during the first available water year and a summer low \n     of 25 kcfs would be in effect each year, starting in 2001, \n     until the new Master Manual is in place or other appropriate \n     NEPA documentation.\n\n  Basically what Fish and Wildlife is saying is: Forget about the \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nYou, Corps of Engineers, start a spring rise in 2001.\n  That is what we are here about. We pointed out all the problems that \nthe spring rise would provide, the fact that there are very good, \nscientific judgments coming out of the Missouri Department of \nConservation, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and others, \nsaying that a spring rise would have a harmful effect, not only on \npeople along the river, on river transportation, but on endangered \nspecies. We have asked the Missouri Department of Natural Resources of \nthe State of Missouri how they view the proposal by the Senator from \nIllinois. The director of the Department of Natural Resources has just \nfaxed me a letter saying, in pertinent part:\n\n       Our conclusion is that the proposed Durbin amendment is not \n     protective of Missouri's interests. Nor is it protective of \n     Mississippi River states' interests. The amendment would \n     allow the spring rise and ``split season'' proposal to \n     proceed to the penultimate point of implementation--too late \n     to be stopped or even amended.\n\n  Basically, the view of the attorney general's office and the State \ndepartment of natural resources in Missouri is that striking section \n103 would open up to the dangers that I laid out last night and this \nmorning of the spring rise and the low summer flow.\n  If the Senator from Illinois agrees that we don't want to have that \nspring rise and the low summer flows next year, I suggest that we could \nreach a simple accommodation. Keep section 103. If he wishes to say \nthat studies should go forward on the Missouri River, which is what I \nfirmly believe section 103 does anyhow, we would have no objection to \nthat. But we need to keep that underlying protection that says that you \nshall not, during 2001, implement the spring rise. That is the purpose \nof the amendment. That amendment has been in the energy and water bills \n4 of the last 5 years, signed by the President.\n  There is no intent for us to stop the discussions. However, the \nNational Academy of Sciences has a very narrow study on the spring rise \nitself. The studies that are going forward are studies which should \ninclude the proposal of the Missouri Department of Conservation which \nis a 41,000-cubic-feet-per-second flow of the Missouri River which they \nthink will protect the pallid sturgeon and other endangered species and \nnot subject the people of downstream States--Kansas, Missouri, States \nalong the Mississippi, Illinois, down through Louisiana--from spring \nflooding and will not end the river transportation on the Mississippi \nand the Missouri.\n  If the only question the Senator from Illinois has is whether or not \nwe cut off studies, I will be happy if he asks unanimous consent to \nchange his amendment so it does not repeal section 103 and states that \nstudies of the Missouri River master manual, all of the studies, shall \ncontinue but there will be no spring rise in 2001 as provided in \nsection 103; then I think we can reach agreement.\n  The question has been raised as to whether, even with that \nmodification, that will be acceptable to Members of this body. There \nare some who appeared to say that would not be acceptable to them.\n  The question has been raised whether the President might veto the \nentire appropriations bill over section 103 after having signed it for \n4 years in a row. We have already shown there is strong bipartisan \nsupport in States affected by the Missouri River manual, that a spring \nrise would be very hazardous to the human life along the river, as well \nas to farmers who farm in the productive bottom lands, as well as to \nthe water supply, as well as to river transportation.\n  I do not think the President will ignore the strong voices of the \nflood control associations, the bipartisan, strong opposition of the \nDemocratic government of Missouri, the Democratic Governor and mayors \nof Kansas City and St. Louis who would be subjected to the dangers of \nflooding from a spring rise.\n  The President will have to look at the concerns of the people \ndownstream. I think he will realize the scheme is too risky as a result \nof the action we took today. If the President realizes we are not going \nto accept the risky scheme of a controlled flood, then maybe we can \navoid the need for a vote.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Illinois wants to leave section 103 \nand work with us to craft an amendment which says that investigations \ncan continue, which is what I believe section 103 will do, if we can \nmuster even greater support, then we will have much less a danger of \nhaving this bill vetoed.\n  With that in mind, I am happy to work with the Senator from Illinois \nbecause his State is at risk of flooding. A spring rise on the Missouri \ncan threaten flooding in Illinois. A low flow on the Missouri River in \nthe summer and in the fall in navigation season not only threatens and \nends barge transportation on the Missouri River, but it puts at risk \nthe river transportation on the Mississippi which carries a very \nsignificant bulk of the grain going to the export market.\n  If that is what we are talking about, if we can assure that studies \nwill continue--and I am concerned about the language of his amendment \nsaying we cannot have a final master manual development--that master \nmanual could be implemented so long as it does not include the spring \nrise--if he is willing to do that, then I say we are on the same page. \nBut I cannot accept and certainly our State governments, the agencies \ndirectly involved in the Missouri, cannot accept striking 103.\n\n  We went through that battle. We spoke, I thought, with a majority \nvote, saying there shall be no implementation of a spring rise during \nthe year covered by the bill, which is 2001. If we keep that in place, \nthen I will be happy to work with the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois to fashion a new section 104 which at least makes clear the \nagreement we may have reached.\n  However, if the Senator still feels the need to strike 103, I have to \nsay that is what we voted on; we have been through this. That is the \nrisky scheme of a controlled flood that we cannot accept, and I do not \nbelieve, nor do people in the State of Missouri believe, that his \namendment standing alone, unmodified, will do that.\n  I hope, having voted on this and having had the opportunity to tell \nour colleagues a whole lot more about the Missouri River manual than \nthey ever wanted to know, we might be able to avoid having them vote \nagain. If they vote again, I say to those who supported us, I wish them \nto continue to support section 103.\n  If the Senator from Illinois will accept keeping section 103 and work \nwith us to craft a section 104 that further clarifies it, I will be \nhappy to do so. Otherwise, I will just ask all the people who voted \nwith us this morning to vote with us again in opposition to the Durbin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand where we are, and we will \nbe ready with the remaining amendments very soon. Since there is time \nremaining, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are about to adopt a bill tonight \ncommonly known as the energy and water appropriations bill, but \neverybody should know that, at a minimum, it is an interesting set of \nwords--``energy and water.'' On the other hand, it is even more than an \ninteresting set of words. There is a great irony with reference to this \nbill.\n  First of all, believe it or not, by precedent, this bill contains all \nof the nuclear weapons research and development, preservation, and \nmanufacturing, and along with it are all the water projects--the Corps \nof Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and all the waterways--and a \nwhole group of nondefense-related science research projects.\n  What has happened over the years, it seems to this Senator, is that \npiling these kinds of programs together and then limiting the amount of \nmoney has, over time, yielded more attention\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nto the water projects because there are hundreds of House Members \nconcerned, and rightly so, and scores of Senators concerned, and here \nis our great nuclear weapons program. We have stood before the world \nand thanked our great scientists because they do not belong to the \nmilitary. These are free-minded Americans, some who have worked for 40 \nyears and are still at Los Alamos as the nucleus of scientists who \nunderstand the nuclear weapons.\n  What I tried to do in the last few years is build a wall in the bill \nbetween the defense money and the nondefense money so we can move ahead \nwith some of the things that are so desperately needed for the nuclear \nactivities of this country, especially since we continue to say we have \nto compete in that area in the world until we have no more nuclear \nweapons, which we hope will occur sometime.\n  In spite of this wall, and trying to hold the defense money harmless \nfrom domestic spending, what has happened this year in the House \nallocations just beats anything you could imagine. For the House \ndecided to underfund both, believe it or not. They decided to underfund \nthe President's defense requirements and underfund his nonnuclear, \nnondefense projects. We cannot expect to get a bill based on those \nnumbers.\n  I submit the Senate would have a lot of difficulty accepting that \nbill that would come from those kinds of numbers. Thanks to Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd, they have allocated $600 million more on the \ndefense nuclear side than the House. And we are still short somewhere \nbetween $300 and $400 million for the water projects. So many of you \nSenators know that your water projects could not be accepted.\n  We understand there are some new projects that have been new for 5 \nyears, maybe some for 7. It is awful to still call them new, but they \nhave not been started, so we call them new, and we cannot fund them. We \nare going to try to get some additional resources because every \nsubcommittee is being helped along. If we can, we can do better when we \ncome back.\n  But I want to just share a couple things that I think everybody \nshould know.\n  There are two huge problems that exist with reference to our nuclear \nweapons activities and personnel and physical plant--where they live \nand work and do the kinds of things that keep us up there, where we can \ncertify to the President of the United States, from these three nuclear \nlabs, that our weapons are safe and will do what they are supposed to \ndo. These lab directors--civilians--certify that based on what they \nhave in their laboratories.\n  To give you an example of how bad off we are on physical plant, I \njust want to cite to you a situation that you would find unbelievable \nat Y-12 over at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, part of that is nondefense, as you \nwell know. But part of it is defense and related to nuclear weapons. If \nyou went there tomorrow and said: The subcommittee that funds this \nasked me to come and take a look at one of the big buildings in Y-12 \nthat has some roofing problems, the first thing they would do to you, \nMr. President--especially considering the condition of your scalp, \nwhere you have no protection from hair--they would put a helmet on you \nas soon as you walked in this building. Did you know that? A helmet. \nAnd you would say: What's that for? And they would say: Well, \ndistinguished Senator, it is because if you walk around this building, \nthe roof falls in on you in pieces. So we don't want to hurt you. Even \nthough you're not doing anything that is harmful down here in your job, \nthe roof falls in on you in pieces.\n  This is a building, owned by the Department of Energy, which does \nnuclear deterrent work for the U.S. Government. It is a shame. We are \nrepairing it. We are putting the money in this year. But just as we do \nthat, there are 40- and 50- and 60-year-old buildings that are part of \nthe complex that we still have alive in some of our laboratories, from \nthe very first Manhattan Project, whenever that was. We have not \nrebuilt them.\n  So scientists are finding it difficult, in today's America, to \ncontinue working at some of our labs. We need a major new program if we \nare going to maintain this situation of safe and reliable nuclear \nweapons, with whatever number of warheads. We need a program to start \nreplacing these buildings. Either we are serious about this--we want \nthe very best for our best scientists--or we do not.\n  The second thing is there is a huge morale problem among the very \nbest scientists, who have been with us a long time and know everything \none could know about our nuclear weapons. There is a serious problem \nthat is objectively recorded that says the young brilliant scientists \ncoming out of our schools with Ph.D.s and post-docs are coming to the \nlaboratories in smaller and smaller numbers per year when we go out to \ntry to encourage them to come. In fact, it is tremendously off this \nyear.\n\n  The morale problem is so bad that the superscientists are beginning \nto quit. They are being offered an enhanced retirement program by the \nUniversity of California. The professors and the university want this \nprogram because the University has too many senior professors. They \nneed to tenure more new professors. But when this University program \ncomes along it applies to the great scientists, too, at our \nlaboratories.\n  There is a morale problem built around the FBI and Justice Department \nfrom this last episode at Los Alamos, making a whole group of \nscientists in one of the most secret, most sophisticated, most \nimportant operations in nuclear weaponry in America feel as though they \nare criminals. They just do not appreciate this. They do not like that. \nSome of them have been there 35 years. They just do not like the FBI \ntreating them all like criminals or even suggesting that, as patriotic \nscientists, they ought to take their lie detectors and be treated as if \nthere is some criminal in their midst. Frankly, some have decided they \nare just not going to do that.\n  I do not know where that ends up, but I submit it ought to end up \nsoon for those who are threatened by prosecution from that last episode \nof a hard drive being found behind some kind of a multipurpose machine. \nIf there is no evidence of spying and no evidence of distributing \ninformation, they ought to get on with this. They ought to get on with \nit. They ought to even talk to some of these scientists, who have been \nworking for us 30, 40 years, about their attorney's fees, because every \none of them has been looked at, and told: You might be the one we're \nlooking for. It couldn't be all of them.\n  When you put that kind of thing out, it labels everybody in a \nnational laboratory. It includes our most patriotic nuclear physicist, \nwho is one of the greatest design people in all of nuclear history. You \nare telling him: We are not quite sure about all this, but you may be \nthe one, you could go to jail for 24 months--or whatever number is \nused. There is no spying. So why don't we get on with it? I have not \nsaid this publicly, but I thought I would use this opportunity tonight.\n  It is serious business. Did you know that we keep saying the only \nthing the Soviet Union is doing well, in spite of their economic \ndepression and all the rest, is to maintain a pretty adequate and \nsophisticated nuclear delivery system? I could spend the evening \ntelling you about the difference between the two.\n  They can maintain their weapons much easier than we can keep ours, \nbecause they make nuclear weapons differently. We make them \nsophisticated, complicated, and that is part of their greatness. They \nmake them simple, robust, and re-make them very often, like every 10 \nyears. They are not as worried about us. We keep them for many years, \nand then we try to prove they will last longer with this new program we \nare funding called the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n  That is my little summary. There is much more to talk about. I \nthought it would be good tonight to put in perspective the significance \nof this bill. It is not just for the harbors of America. It is for \nthose laboratories and plants that harbor the scientists, the manpower, \nand the equipment to keep our nuclear weapons on the right path. That \nis pretty important stuff, it seems to me.\n  My job is to make sure everybody at least understands part of it, so \nthey will help us get out of the dilemma we are in and have a much more \nrobust, much more positive atmosphere around these laboratories soon.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n  In conclusion, there is a new man in charge. We ought to be hopeful. \nGeneral Gordon has been put in charge of this under the new law which \nyou helped us with, I say to the Presiding Officer--and many did--which \nput one person in charge of the nuclear weapons aspects at the DOE. We \nare so fortunate we got a four-star general, CIA oriented, Sandia Lab-\ntrained individual who in retirement took this job. If it is going to \nbe fixed, he will fix it.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4105, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n2 minutes and at the end of that time to withdraw my amendment, if \nthere is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, as well as Senator Reid and representatives from \nSenator Daschle's staff.\n  We just had a floor conversation about section 103, which has been \nthe subject of great debate over the last several days. We are, as I \nsaid, close to at least common ground on the floor, but I do not \nbelieve we are at a point where we can put language in the bill to \nsolve the problem between the administration and the committee. It is \nmy heartfelt intention to work with Senator Bond, Senator Domenici, and \nSenator Reid to try to do that.\n  This is an important bill. We don't want to go through and veto, have \na return of the bill, if we can work it out. I hope we can. But I don't \nbelieve my amendment, in and of itself, is going to solve that problem \nthis evening. Instead, I would like to, at the end of my remarks, ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, and pledge between now and \nthe conference and thereafter to work with all of the principals \ninvolved to see if we can work out the important question about the \nfuture of the Missouri River and the debate that took place both \nyesterday and today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. \n4105.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Illinois and my \nfriend from Missouri, I appreciate very much, as I am sure Senator \nDomenici does, resolving this temporarily at this time. Hopefully, the \ntemporary delay will allow us, by the time we get to conference, to \nhave a solution to the problem which will allow all parties to be \nsatisfied. I appreciate very much Senator Bond, who is a veteran in \nState and national politics, understanding the quandary we are in \ntonight. I say the same to the Senator from Illinois, who is the \nepitome of a good legislator.\n  Senator Domenici and I will do everything we can, before conference \nand in conference, to try to resolve this matter finally. We recognize \nthere is a veto threat on this bill, so it is in our interest to try to \nwork something out also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say to both Senators, I very \nmuch appreciate their efforts. I think while they were talking, I was \nexpressing to anyone who wanted to listen my heartfelt concerns about \nthis bill in terms of the future of our nuclear weapons.\n  It would not be good if we wasted a year operating under last year's \nlevels or operating under some kind of a veto. I join in not knowing \nwhat the veto threat really means. Nonetheless, it would be marvelous \nif we could work it out to their satisfaction so in some way the issue \nwere resolved.\n  There is going to be a year hiatus, one way or another, when nothing \nis going to happen. I don't think the President is going to be able to \ndeny us that. But I think if we worked it out where everybody \nunderstood and maybe we could convince him that that is a good idea--\nthat means his council on environmental quality and others--it would be \na very good thing for the United States. I hope it works out.\n  I compliment Senator Bond this evening and earlier on this bill. I \nthink he made a very strong case. It is pretty obvious this is a \ndifficult issue. As he knows, I have been on his side. I have similar \nproblems with endangered species and other things out in the West. We \ndon't have enough water. All our rivers combined don't equal the \nMissouri River. I think that is a pretty fair statement--maybe even \nhalf the flow for all of ours that we have. We don't quite understand \nhow the Missouri River is a problem. We see it as something fantastic. \nOne time we tried to get a little bit of it, take it west, and Scoop \nJackson stood in the way, I guess, from the State of Washington.\n  Anyway, I thank the Senator for what he has done. There is not going \nto be a vote tonight on that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, with whom I think we have reached an agreement that \nthere should not be a spring rise in 2001.\n  I believe there are some areas that go beyond the existing section \n103 on which we might be able to satisfy some of the legitimate \nconcerns raised by the minority leader. He was concerned about the \npossibility of cutting off debate, cutting off all consideration of \nother issues relating to the Missouri River manual. That was not our \nintent. If we can add language that will clarify that, maybe it will at \nleast satisfy some of these problems.\n  Also, we have a Governor and we have other congressional Members from \nStates affected who might want to communicate with the White House \nabout the workability of this.\n  To the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nevada, I \nappreciate the difficulties they faced. They have both been most \naccommodating on these issues. We don't want to make life more \ndifficult for them. The Senator from New Mexico may not have river \nproblems, but he has had controlled burn problems. We want to make sure \nwe don't have a controlled flood problem.\n  I am delighted we don't have to ask our colleagues to vote again on \nthis issue tonight. I think there may be further clarification that \nmight satisfy some of the concerns that were raised, certainly by the \nminority leader. I will be happy to work with them.\n  On behalf of the State of Missouri and the people of the State of \nMissouri, I express my appreciation to this body for making it clear \nthat there will not be a controlled flood on the Missouri River or \nabnormally low flows during the summer of 2001, the year to which this \nappropriations bill applies.\n  As always, we are more than happy to work with the committee leaders \nin trying to resolve these problems in the future. I thank my \ncolleagues for their understanding of the importance of this issue to \nthe people I represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe I have a unanimous consent \nrequest pending to withdraw amendment No. 4105.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4109, As Modified\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 4109, filed \nwith the clerk. It is my understanding that will be in the manager's \npackage. I do not, therefore, call it to the floor of the Senate at \nthis time.\n  I do wish for a moment to discuss with my colleagues the merits of \nthis legislation and to thank the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Nevada for their cooperation and their assistance.\n  Within this legislation is $27 million to deepen and widen the main \nchannel of the Delaware River. To the city of Philadelphia, the city of \nCamden, and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, this \nis of some considerable importance. The Delaware River is a major \nartery of maritime commerce. I have always supported, and I will always \nsupport that river being efficient and available to maritime traffic, \nbut there are serious problems.\n  When this legislation was considered in the House, my colleague, \nRepresentative Andrews from southern New Jersey, with the support of \nCongressman Kasich, offered an amendment to strike this funding. I will \nnot do that tonight because I believe, first, the votes are not \navailable and, second, I still hope the general problems with this \ndredging can be solved.\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\n  The problems are relatively simple. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nhas proposed to dredge 33 million yards of material from the Delaware \nRiver. Three States will benefit by this dredging. Primarily the \nbenefits will go to Philadelphia and the State of Pennsylvania, simply \nbased on the size of the economic activity in the region by these \nStates comparatively. Ten million of these 33 million yards will be \nused to replenish beaches in the State of Delaware. Twenty-three \nmillion yards will be placed on prime waterfront property in the State \nof New Jersey. Ten million goes to Delaware; 23 million occupies prime \nreal estate in the State of New Jersey. And although the principal \neconomic benefits of the dredging are for the city of Philadelphia, \nnone--I repeat, not an ounce--of the material goes to the State of \nPennsylvania.\n  Now I recognize we all have to share the burden, and we may not share \nthe burden equally; it may not be shared proportionally to the economic \nbenefit. But certainly accepting nothing, while the State of New Jersey \ntakes the overwhelming majority of the material, cannot be right and it \ncannot be fair. Let me make clear that Senator Specter and Senator \nSantorum have been remarkably helpful in this matter. They have \nunderstood the inequity. They want the three States to work \ncooperatively. I am very grateful to both of them that, while \nprotecting the interests of their State first and foremost, they have \nbeen good neighbors and have been cooperative.\n  I believe there are solutions to this problem: Primarily, ironically, \nthat while this material is being dumped on the shorelines of New \nJersey to our disadvantage, there is an enormous desire by construction \ncompanies and others in land development to have this material \navailable.\n  It is a strange and ironic, even tragic, situation. I hope by this \nexperience, which is also happening in the Port of New York, the Army \nCorps of Engineers will begin to understand and learn from the \nsituation. Contracting companies, land development companies, major \ncorporations, and communities want this material. Market it, sell it, \nuse it, but no longer use it as if it is a waste material to be dumped \non valuable real estate, on the unwanted.\n  Because of that, in my amendment, we reserve $200,000 for the Army \nCorps of Engineers to begin actively marketing this material for \nprivate and public projects--from road projects in south Jersey, to the \nfuture expansion of the Philadelphia Airport, to new construction in \nAtlantic City, there are willing users, even buyers. This $200,000 can \ngo a long way to solving this problem. Particularly, I thank Senators \nSpecter and Santorum for their help and cooperation. Of course, to \nSenator Biden, the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator from \nNevada, I am grateful that this is being put in the managers' \namendment. I thank them for this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will withhold that. We are within a \nfew minutes of having the last amendments ready that we have been \nworking on collectively and collaboratively. Then we will be ready for \nfinal passage very soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, does Senator Reid have anything further \nto add?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and to the chairman of this \nsubcommittee for the great work he has done. He has been a pleasure to \nwork with.\n  I also express my appreciation to your very excellent staff. David \nGwaltney and Lashawnda Smith have been tremendous to work with. My \nstaff complimented them through me on many occasions.\n  I also want to thank Steve Bell, chief of staff; and Drew Willison \nhas done such a brilliant job, assisted by your detailee from the Army \nCorps of Engineers from Vicksburg; and Elizabeth Blevins of the \nsubcommittee staff.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already mentioned today and on \nanother occasion the importance of this bill. I thank all Senators for \ncooperating. We did our very best on the numerous amendments, and we \nwill do our very best in conference. Everyone knows we are very short \nof money on the nondefense side. If we can get some assistance from the \nappropriations committee, we will be able to help solve many of these \nproblems in conference.\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n  In the meantime, I want to say to Senator Reid that it is always a \npleasure to work with him. We will go to conference and do the best we \ncan.\n  I want to thank Drew Willison of Senator Reid's staff. He is a \ntremendous asset, and we very much like working with him.\n  I thank the Senator for his thanks to the two members of my staff. \nThey are truly professional, and I am very grateful to them.\n  Mr. President, we have nothing further. I ask for the yeas and nays \non final passage of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       houghton lake in michigan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for Energy and Water Development, I wonder if \nthe Senator from Nevada would answer a question about funding for a \nserious problem with Houghton Lake in Michigan.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be pleased to offer any information \nabout this bill to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Is it correct that the Committee has \nprovided $6,700,000 for the Corps of Engineers' planning assistance to \nStates program and that only $200,000 of this funding is currently \nobligated to a specific project?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would ask if the Senator would be willing to consider in \nconference a request of $75,000 to conduct a comprehensive water \nmanagement study for Houghton Lake, MI. The Eurasian milfoil is a non-\nindigenous water plant that floats on the water's surface and forms \nlarge mats of plants, which lower the oxygen levels in the water below \nthem, killing fish and making passage by boat very difficult. A large \namount of the lake's surface has been infested by the milfoil.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that this matter is of great importance to the \nSenator from Michigan and the people he represents. I can assure my \nfriend that I will attempt to provide that funding in Conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the courtesy of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                   national synchrotron light source\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would first like to thank Senator Reid and Senator \nDomenici for their leadership and continued funding of science and \nresearch facilities.\n  I would like to take a moment to engage my colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator for his kind words and would be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with him.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, due to severe budget constraints in the \nFiscal Year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations, additional funding \nhas not been made available for the National Synchrotron Light Source \nat Brookhaven National Laboratory. The President's FY2001 Budget \nincluded $3 million for upgrades and enhancements to the NSLS at \nBrookhaven National Laboratory under the Basic Energy Science (BES) \naccount. The NSLS facility at Brookhaven, bringing 2,300 scientists \nannually is used for a whole host of issues, ranging from the first \nimages of the AIDS virus attaching itself to a human cell; landmark \nprogress in understanding the structure of the ribosome, the most \ncomplex component in each living cell; pivotal work on the Lyme disease \nbacterium, leading to a vaccine; and pioneering studies on hepatitis. \nThese additional funds will allow Brookhaven to begin construction of \ntwo experimental stations and to hire additional staff members, which \nare essential in handling the growing demand of this facility.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada that if additional funds are made \navailable for the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, that the \nenhancements to the NSLS be added to the current funding for \nBrookhaven.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator from New York that the additional \nfunding for the NSLS is a high priority and the enhancements will allow \nmore people to research and develop experiments that will effect the \nfuture of our world. Unfortunately funding constraints have prohibited \nthe Committee from including these essential funds. When additional \nresources become available, we will give the NSLS priority \nconsideration under additional science funding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Nevada for helping with this \npriority issue.\n\n\n                       the clinton river spillway\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for Energy and Water Development.\n  I thank the Committee for including an $100,000 appropriation for the \nClinton River Spillway for an evaluation to determine whether the \nClinton River Spillway in Michigan has a design deficiency requiring \nremediation.\n  During the 1950's, the United States Army Corps of Engineers \nconstructed a dam on the Clinton River and a spillway to alleviate \nflooding. Since the completion of the project, debris has built up at \nthe confluence of the Clinton River and spillway.\n  I agree with the Committee that a study must be conducted, however I \nask that the study include an analysis of the cause of the debris build \nup as well as a determination as to whether or not there is a design \ndeficiency. This is a continuing problem in this river basin and the \nCorps needs to examine the cause of the problem in order to devise a \nlong term solution.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan is correct. The cause of this \nproblem needs to be determined and the Corps needs to include causation \nas a part of this study. I assure the Senator that we will interpret \nthe study to include a causation analysis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                 the rouge river in southfield michigan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for Energy and Water Development, I wonder if \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada would answer a question regarding \nEmergency streambank and shoreline protection--sec. 14--funds?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be pleased to offer any information \nabout this bill to my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Is it correct that the Committee has \nincluded $8,000,000 for section 14, Emergency streambank and shoreline \nerosion protection?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would also ask if the \nSenator would be willing to consider in conference a request of $40,000 \nfor the Rouge River in Southfield, Michigan. A large slope area on the \nbanks of the Rouge River has collapsed and is currently threatening \npublic infrastructure. This area must be stabilized and restored before \nwinter sets in to prevent damage to the sanitary sewer and to eliminate \nthe threat of pollution to the Rouge River. This is a very urgent \nproject.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that this matter is of great importance to the \nSenator from Michigan and the people he represents. I can assure my \nfriend that I will carefully consider his request in Conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As always, I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n\n      THE BRUNSWICK HARBOR DEEPENING PROJECT IN BRUNSWICK, GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the \ncurrent situation of Brunswick Harbor, an issue which is very important \nto me. I hope that I can engage the Chairman and the Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee in a floor discussion of this \nkey matter.\n  The Brunswick Harbor deepening project, which was authorized in the \n1999 Water Resources Develop Act, has received a favorable report from \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has met all required cost-benefit \nand environmental reviews. Preconstruction engineering and design are \nin the final stages. In order to keep this project on schedule, it is \nnecessary to complete several administrative requirements before the \ndeepening project begins. Namely, the Corps of Engineers and the Non-\nFederal sponsor must initiate Project Cooperation Agreement \ndiscussions, complete the final project design, and develop contract \naward documents. I have requested a modest funding level of $255,000 to \ncarry out these tasks. Unfortunately, no funds were provided in the \nHouse or Senate bills.\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n  I believe it is important to take action on this issue immediately. \nNavigation channel restrictions in Brunswick have cost shippers and \nconsumers a significant amount in lost revenue. The current controlled \ndepth of 30 feet subjects 57 percent of the vessels to tidal delays, \nsub-optimal loading and inefficient port rotations. In fact, it is \nestimated that these delays result in an annual loss of $6.65 million \nin revenue. We can avoid incurring these losses another year by \nproviding nominal funding to complete the required administrative \nprocesses.\n  I would echo the remarks of the Committee's report language which \nnotes the importance of our waterways and harbors to our national \ntransportation system. The Port of Brunswick plays an integral role in \nsupporting the maritime transportation arm of our national \ninfrastructure. Additionally, I would say that the Port of Brunswick is \nvery much an intermodal facility. Brunswick is well-connected to our \nnation's system of highways and railroads, providing increased \nopportunities for commercial transportation.\n  I will go one step further in stating that the Port of Brunswick is \nnot only important to our national transportation system, but it is \nimportant to our national defense. Located between Savannah and \nJacksonville, Brunswick is readily accessible to the numerous military \ninstallations in the region. As a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and as a former Army Officer, I know very well the need to \nmove troops, tanks, and supplies as rapidly as possible. During a war, \nmore than 95 percent of all the equipment and supplies needed to \nsustain the U.S. military are carried by sea. The potential for the \nPort of Brunswick to play a major role in the movement of military \ncargo must not be overlooked, nor must it be hindered by administrative \ndelays.\n  I understand the tight budget restraints the Subcommittee faces this \nyear, and I respect the fact that there will be no ``new start'' \nprojects appropriated. However, we are not attempting to start dredging \nin Brunswick. We are simply trying to complete the administrative \nrequirements which are necessary prior to such action. I appeal to my \ncolleagues to help me keep the Brunswick Harbor deepening project on \nschedule through the inclusion of funds in Conference with the House. \nIn fact, I believe we can proceed with the Project Cooperation \nAgreement, the final project design, and the development of contract \nawards if the Conference Committee were to simply include favorable \nreport language to this effect. I thank my distinguished colleagues, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MILLER. I, too, would like to offer a few comments relative to \nthe Brunswick Harbor deepening project. Although I have been a member \nof the Senate for only a short while, I certainly understand the \nimportance of this project and I fully support the inclusion of funds \nto keep it on schedule. Brunswick handles cargoes important to the \nregion such as grain, gypsum, limestone, perlite, potash, oats, wood \npulp, and motor vehicles. As the region has grown, so has the size of \nthe vessels calling on the Port. I am very concerned that if we further \ndelay the deepening project, we run the risk of hindering economic \ngrowth. This concern is underscored by the fact that the number of \noperational delays has increased by 36 percent since 1984. I believe \nthat it is essential to stay the course and keep the project on \nschedule, and I join my colleague in urging the inclusion of $255,000 \nto support the administrative tasks which must be completed this year.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senators from Georgia. I share your concern for \nthe funding of this important project, and I assure you that I will \ngive this project due consideration in conference with the House. \nShould additional funds become available, as I hope they will, the \nBrunswick Harbor Deepening Project will be one of my chief priorities, \nand I will support the inclusion of the report language sought by the \nGeorgia Senators.\n\n\n                    bonneville power administration\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, on the floor. Our committee report on this \nbill includes language he recommended relative to the particular \nchallenges the Bonneville Power Administration status as a Federal \nagency presents to the BPA in its possible participation in a regional \ntransmission organization. Our report acknowledges that certain steps \nmay need to be taken to mitigate impacts on BPA employees, and that \nlegislation may be necessary. I understand that the Senator from \nWashington would like to comment further on this issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I appreciate his \ninterest in this matter and his willingness to consider legislative \nremedies, should they become necessary. I only want to make clear for \nthe record that if administrative remedies are insufficient to protect \nthe rights and benefits of BPA employees should they move into a new \nregional transmission organization, then any legislative remedy that \nmight be proposed will be developed in full consultation with other \nstakeholders in the region and other participants in the RTO. Since any \nlegislation that may be developed may very well be carried as an \nadministrative provision in this bill, I wanted to be sure the manager \nknew that this is my intent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate that elaboration, Mr. President, and look \nforward to working with Senator Gorton on this issue of great interest \nto his constituents.\n\n\n                fernald environmental management project\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, and floor manager of the pending bill, Senator \nDomenici in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator. Senator, last year we discussed the \ntremendous progress being made at the Fernald Site in my home state of \nOhio. It is in many ways a model of what can be done to safely and \neffectively clean-up a former weapons production site left from the \ncold war. The Fernald site is poised to be the first major DOE site to \nbe cleaned-up and in effect `taken off the books.' Wouldn't the Senator \nagree that this effort deserves both our appreciation and support?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely, I concur with the Senator.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chairman. In the event that additional \nresources become available, I ask the chairman to help secure \nadditional resources for the Fernald project to ensure that the pace of \nclosing the site by 2006 is assured. I further ask the Chairman if he \nwould support my call to the DOE to make an expeditious decision \nconcerning the site contractor. There is no competition--the site is \nrunning smoothly--let's give them the resources they need and \ndemonstrate that at least one project can be completed on budget and on \nschedule without any further delays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Committee once again recognizes the outstanding \ncontributions of the entire effort at the Fernald site-workers, \ncommunity leaders, and regulators. We will try to support the Senators \nrequest and encourage the DOE to make an expeditious decision \nconcerning the pending contract.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly engage Senator \nDomenici, Chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee \non an important energy issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to oblige the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. President, I would like to \nthank Senator Domenici for his hard work on this important bill. In \nparticular I would like to thank him for his actions in response to \nrequests by many, including this Senator, on behalf of renewable \nenergy. These funds will go far to help in many areas of science, the \nenvironment, national security and the economy. On a related topic, I \nwonder if I could briefly discuss the Consortium for Plant \nBiotechnology Research (CPBR) with the Chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would inform the Senator from Colorado that I am \naware of CPBR's work and would be happy to address the Senator on this \ntopic.\n  Mr. ALLARD. As I'm sure the Chairman knows, research that has been \nundertaken by CPBR's member universities, including the University of \nColorado, in conjunction with the Department of Energy has led to \nimproved biomass energy technologies that help develop a competitive \nbiomass-based energy industry and a safer, cleaner environment.\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the words of the Senator from Colorado and \nwould note that New Mexico State University is an important partner in \nthe consortium. Unfortunately, due to our subcommittee allocation, \nthere was not enough room in the Senate mark to cover many good \nprograms and projects.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his time and \nwould encourage him to consider the important work of CPBR when this \nbill moves to conference with the other body.\n\n\n      general investigations activities of the corps of engineers\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee regarding the General Investigations Activities of the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  The Corps of Engineers is authorized to repair the Goshen Dam/\nSpillway system on Lake Merriweather in Rockbridge, Virginia. This dam \nis classified as a ``high hazard'' dam according to the Federal Dam \nSafety Guidelines because its failure threatens the downstream \ncommunity of Wilson Springs. The Corps has completed a Technical Report \non the engineering and design specifications for the project's repairs \nand upgrades.\n  The House passed bill includes $150,000 for further planning and \ndesign activities for this important project. I call this situation to \nthe attention of the Chairman and respectfully request that he give \nfavorable consideration to this matter in conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Warner for bringing this matter to may \nattention. I am aware that this facility is utilized by the National \nCapital Area Boy Scouts organization. It is important that the non-\nfederal sponsor finance their share of the costs of these safety \nrepairs and I am aware that the Commonwealth of Virginia may become the \nnon-federal sponsor.\n  I know how important this project is to the Senator and I will give \nit full consideration during Conference.\n\n\n                        delta regional authority\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Mississippi River Delta possesses \nmany common characteristics and unique problems throughout the 7-state \nalluvial floodplain which it encompasses. The subcommittee report \nincludes funding for a new Delta Regional Authority, an economic \ndevelopment effort aimed at extending special help to an area of the \ncountry that I have long considered to be a special part of my state \nand this nation.\n  I am concerned that many of the real needs in the region never feel \nthe full impact of federal assistance efforts because of the centrally-\nplanned and bureaucratic delivery systems which accompanied some of \nthese initiatives. Because of this history, the people of the region \nhave become skeptical about new election year promises of federal \nassistance.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nfor clarification of the intent and purpose of this funding. First, how \nis the Delta defined for purpose of extending this proposed federal \nassistance?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The provisions included in the bill do not specifically \ndefine the Delta.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The historical Delta area is the Mississippi Alluvial \nValley, which includes only small portions of Tennessee and Kentucky, \nthe typically flat and gently-sloping land of eastern Louisiana and \nArkansas, Northwest Mississippi, the boot-heel of Missouri, and the \nCache River lowlands of Illinois. Is it the Committee's intent that the \nDelta, for purposes of the federal assistance in this appropriation \nmeasure, be defined as that land which underlies those communities, \ncounties, parishes and part-counties, which are geographically \ndelineated by the topography commonly recognized as the Delta alluvial \nfloodplain?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. It is my understanding that this is the area \nsuffering most in terms of economic distress.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. As the distinguished chairman knows, the Delta suffers \nfrom an acute need for infrastructure development that inhibits \neconomic growth.\n  In the Report to Congress by the Lower Mississippi Delta Development \nCommission, which was co-chaired by then-Governor Bill Clinton of \nArkansas, the Commission stressed that the ten-year goal of any plan to \nassist the Delta should emphasize, and I quote from page 92 of this \nreport, ``every Delta resident will have access to adequate water and \nsewer, fire protection, flood control, roads, streets, and bridges, to \nimprove the quality of life and provide for economic growth and \ndevelopment.''\n  Although there are many very important needs in the Mississippi River \nDelta region which are unique to that area, better roads, educational \nenhancements, protection from floods, natural resource conservation and \nequipment and instruction support for workforce training ought to be \nthe primary focus of this funding.\n  There are existing and proven delivery systems for these purpose \nwhich have the benefit of local planning and priority-setting by the \npeople who reside in the Delta.\n  Is it the intent of this committee that this founding be utilized in \nthis way for these purposes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, Senator, In fact, it is the interest of the \nsubcommittee to bring this federal support to the Mississippi River \nDelta region in the most timely and cost-efficient manner. It is my \nunderstanding that much like in your own State of Mississippi, the \nother six states have similar delivery systems in place through their \nlocal community colleges, universities, departments of transportation, \nand water resource agencies that should be used as the primary vehicles \nthrough which these funds are properly administered to provide the \ngreatest regional impact.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Chairman's response. Delta communities \nin my state have been unable to provide their local cost-share for \nrural water and sewer projects, road and railroad improvement projects, \ndrainage and flood protection projects, and other developments that are \nfundamental to a viable, local economy because they simply cannot \nafford the match. Unlike more affluent areas which can take full \nadvantage of the federal cost-sharing programs such as this, the Delta \ntypically lags behind even further. Is it the Chairman's view that \nthese funds could be used as a local match for other federal programs?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with your view that these funds could utilized \nfor the type of infrastructure support you have described. If \ndistressed communities in the Mississippi River Delta region are \nstruggling to qualify for federal assistance due to their inability to \nprovide the local match for infrastructure improvements, I think it \nshould be one of the highest priorities for these funds to be applied \nin this way.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my friend from New Mexico and I appreciate your \nsupport for the use of this funding through existing delivery systems \nto provide needed assistance to the Delta.\n\n\n   federal power marketing administrations and regional transmission \n                             organizations\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee and the senior Senator from Washington to clarify the \nintent of legislative language in Section 319 of H.R. 4733.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would be pleased to discuss this \nprovision with my friend, the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. GORTON. As would I, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one of the Power Marketing Administrations, \nthe Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is working with other \ntransmission-owning electric utilities to file a document with the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission in October evidencing an intent to \nform a regional transmission organization in the Northwest. It is my \nunderstanding that this language would give BPA the authority to engage \nin the activities necessary to making that filing. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. I concur, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is also my understanding that the Department of Energy \nis currently of the opinion that no further legislation would be needed \nin order for BPA to actually participate in a Northwest regional \ntransmission organization. However, issues may\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\narise as a result of the October filing, or otherwise, that would \nnecessitate further legislation before BPA participates in the \nNorthwest regional transmission organization. If such legislation is \nnecessary, would the Chairman and the Senator from Washington be \nwilling to work with me to enact it expeditiously, so as to not delay \nthe actual operation of the Northwest regional transmission \norganization?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to work with the Senator from Idaho, \nthe Senator from Washington, and other members of the Northwest \ndelegation to assure expeditious enactment of any such necessary \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GORTON. I too, am committed to prompt enactment of such \nlegislation, if needed. I think it is crucial that Congress facilitate, \nrather than impede or delay, the formation of a regional transmission \norganization for the Northwest.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senators.\n\n\n                           channel deepening\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Fiscal Year \n2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill prepared on behalf of myself, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Torricelli, that \nwould dedicate $53 million and $5 million, respectively, for the Kill \nvan Kull and Arthur Kill channel deepening projects in the Port of New \nYork and New Jersey. These are the amounts that the President's Budget \nrequests for the vital navigation projects. I will withhold from \noffering the amendment at this time.\n  I would just like to ask the Chairman and ranking Member, who are \nworking hard to stay within their allocations, if they agree that the \nredevelopment of the Port of New York and New Jersey to accommodate \nmodern container vessels is in the national interest. I would also like \nto inquire whether they will grant both of these projects priority \nconsideration in the event that additional funds become available under \nthe Army Corps accounts.\n  Mr. REID. I would agree with the Senator from New York that the \nauthorized Federal navigation projects for the Port of New York and New \nJersey are in the national interest, and that both the Kill van Kull \nand Arthur Kill projects should receive priority consideration if \nadditional general construction funding for the Army Corps of Engineers \nbecomes available.\n\n\n                    IMPROVEMENTS ON THE MISSISSIPPI\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President. I would like to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on an extremely \nimportant public safety project in St. Paul, Minnesota. As the Chairman \nmay recall, I have been a strong proponent of $3,000,000 in Federal \nfunding for the Mississippi Place project in downtown St. Paul. Not \nsurprisingly, I am quite disappointed that the Committee was unable to \naccommodate requests to initiate work on recently authorized projects.\n  This project, authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of \n1999, entails much needed improvements to the Mississippi River \nshoreline. For the past 100 years, this shoreline was virtually \ninaccessible to residents of St. Paul, cut off by a major parkway, \nindustrial property and a main rail line. However, much has changed in \nthe last five years, and the community now finds itself with an \nunprecedented opportunity to re-establish a physical connection to the \nMississippi River. The industrial property has been converted into a \nnew Science Museum and parkland, the parkway has been re-aligned and \nthe rail lines have been regraded.\n  As envisioned by the Corps, the project will consist of a series of \nimprovements to a section of river which contains some of the strongest \ncurrents on the Upper Mississippi. The need to initiate prompt work on \nthe project led the Minnesota State Legislature to allocate $3,000,000 \nin state matching funds to the 2000 Bonding Bill signed by the \nGovernor. An additional $3,000,000 in funding from local and other \nsources will be made available for parklands, trails and other \namenities. All told, the community has pledged two thirds of the \nfunding required for the project, far in excess of what is required by \nlaw.\n  But the most important work of all is the Corps portion along the \nshoreline, work which is critical to keeping the public (including 1.5 \nmillion annual visitors at the new Science Museum of Minnesota) away \nfrom the fast moving current. Without the funding I have requested from \nthe Committee, this project will not be initiated.\n  Mr. President, could the distinguished Chairman provide me with his \nviews on the upcoming conference with the House on this legislation, \nwith particular emphasis on the funding which I am seeking for this \nproject?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would be pleased to respond to the \nSenator's question. As my good friend pointed out, the funding \nallocation for the Energy and Water Subcommittee for fiscal year 2001 \ndid not afford us the luxury of initiating new construction projects. \nHowever, I am aware of the Senator's strong support and interest in \nthis project and, should the subcommittee receive sufficient additional \nbudgetary resources, I will assure my colleague that the project \noutlined by the Senator would certainly be considered along with \nnumerous other projects which have been brought to the subcommittee's \nattention.\n\n\n                        objectionable provisions\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the energy and water appropriations bill \nis fundamental to our nation's energy and defense related activities, \nand takes care of vitally important water resources infrastructure \nneeds. My colleagues are aware that I am a strong defender of our \nnational security which is, in part, funded through this bill. Taking \ncare of our national energy needs is also high in priority to our \ntaxpaying constituents who are concerned about ever-increasing gas and \nenergy prices.\n  That is why I am disappointed to report that this year's bill once \nagain fails to fulfill our responsibility to American taxpayers to \nexpend their tax dollars in a wise and prudent fashion that addresses \nthe nation's most critical needs. Instead, included in this year's bill \nand its accompanying Senate report is $508 million in unrequested and \nlow-priority earmarks. A number of legislative riders are also added \nwhich will effectively prevent a fair and deliberative consideration of \ncertain issues that should be determined in a legislative review \nthrough the appropriate Congressional committees.\n  I recognize the hard work that the managers of this bill have put \ninto moving this measure through the Senate. I thank them for their \ntireless efforts and appreciate that their jobs have not been easy. \nHowever, I must repeat a criticism I have made many times during \nconsideration of appropriations bills and will continue to make as long \nas the practice of earmarking continues--this bill inappropriately \nsingles out projects for funding based on criteria other than need and \nnational priority.\n  This year, earmarks account for more than $508 million in funding for \nlocal projects contained in the bill and the committee report. Yet, we \nhave no way of knowing whether, at best, all or part of this $508 \nmillion should have been spent on different projects with greater \nnational need or, at worst, should not have been spent at all.\n  Various projects are provided with additional funding at levels \nhigher than requested by the administration. The stated reasons include \nthe desire to finish some projects in a reasonable time-frame. \nUnfortunately, other projects are put on hold or on a slower track. The \ninconsistency between the administration's request, which is \nresponsible for carrying out these projects, and the views of the \nappropriators on just how much funding should be dedicated to a \nproject, is troubling. As a result, various other projects that may be \nequally deserving or higher in priority do not receive an appropriate \namount of funding, or none at all. Many of my objections are based on \nthese types of inconsistencies and nebulous spending practices.\n  Our current system of earmarking in order to fund national projects \nis fundamentally flawed. I hope that we will soon develop a better \nsystem, one which allows the projects with the greatest national needs \nto be funded first.\n  I remind my colleagues that I object to these earmarks on the basis \nof their\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\ncircumvention of our established process, which is to properly \nconsider, authorize and fund projects based on merit and need.\n  Although I was not present to vote on final passage of this bill, I \nwish to state for the record that I would have voted against this bill \nbecause this is not the honorable way to carry out our fiscal \nresponsibilities.\n  I reviewed this bill and report very closely and compiled a list of \nobjectionable provisions in H.R. 4733 and its accompanying Senate \nreport. This list is too lengthy to be included in the Record, but it \nwill be available from my Senate office.\n\n\n                            renewable energy\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier this year I joined many of my \ncolleagues in signing a letter supporting increased funding for \nrenewable energy. I am pleased today to see that the subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water Appropriations has honored our request with an $82 \nmillion increase in renewable energy funding, raising the total from \n$362 million to $444 million. That this substantial 23 percent increase \noccurred under severe budgetary pressures makes it all the more \ncommendable. I thank Chairman Domenici and Senator Reid for their \nefforts in producing this bill.\n  At no time has investment in renewable energy research and \ndevelopment been more important. As we have seen over and over again, \neven a slight imbalance between supply and demand can lead to rapidly \nescalating energy prices. Last winter, disruptions in oil supply caused \ngreat hardship to Mainers who depend on home heating oil. Mainers are \nalso suffering at the pumps from gasoline and diesel prices that hit \ntheir highest levels in decades. People across the nation are further \nsuffering from more and more frequent spikes in the price of natural \ngas and electricity.\n  Unless we act to diversify our energy supply, this volatility is only \nlikely to grow worse. For example, United States currently imports \nslightly over half of its oil. In less than 20 years, this number is \nexpected to grow to 70 percent. Unless we are content to live under the \nperpetual threat of energy disruptions from Middle East energy barons \nor other forces beyond our control, we must diversify our energy \nsupply. While renewable energy will not provide the whole answer, it \nholds the potential to help stabilize energy prices and to provide us \nwith an increased level of energy security. By investing in renewable \nenergy research and development, we enhance fuel and technology \ndiversity and help provide the United States with insulation from \nfuture energy shocks.\n  Investments in renewable energy have many other benefits as well. \nThese investments increase the U.S. market share of the growing \ndomestic and international markets for energy-supply products and \npermit the expansion of high technology jobs within the U.S. economy. \nResearch in biomass and biofuels helps farmers and foresters by \ncreating valuable new uses for agricultural products. Renewable energy \nhas important military applications and is currently used on many \nremote military bases. The funds contained in this bill will also lead \nto improvements in distributed generation, energy storage, and \nreliability of the electric grid. Finally, renewable are bringing extra \nincome to many farmers and local communities across the Nation.\n  My home State of Maine is a leader in renewable energy production and \ntechnology. In fact nearly 30 percent of our electricity comes from \nrenewable energy generated in Maine. Central Maine Power is selling \nrenewable energy from biomass to green markets in other states. And \njust next month, Endless Energy will be putting in a brand new wind \nturbine at a blueberry farm in Orland. This turbine was made possible \nin part by the renewable energy investments that I supported last year.\n  I again thank Senators Domenici and Reid for providing the increase \nin renewable energy investments that I and many of my colleagues in the \nU.S. Senate had asked for. This is a down-payment on future energy \ndiversity and a sound economy.\n\n\n                      red lake river flood control\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment that \nwould have provided $1 million in funding for the Red Lake River Flood \nControl Project at Crookston, Minnesota. This is a high priority of \nmine, and I regret the Committee's inability to fund new start \nconstruction projects. I understand there may be more flexibility to \nfund new starts in conference, and I want to continue to work with \nChairman Domenici at that time to ensure funds are available to begin \nconstruction of this important project.\n  Communities in the Red River Valley in Northwestern Minnesota have \nsuffered some of the worst flooding in our nation's history during \n1997. Many Americans watched the television coverage of Grand Forks, \nNorth Dakota and saw the burning buildings which destroyed a city \nblock, all in a sea of water. But just across the Red River, on the \nMinnesota side, is East Grand Forks, a town of nearly 10,000 people \nthat had no water, no electricity, and no sewer system.\n  This disastrous flooding has severely disrupted the lives of many, \nmany Minnesotans. Dreams of enjoying warm, spring weather after a \nbrutally long Minnesota winter were replaced with efforts to ensure \nfamilies and communities were safe, and that adequate food, water, and \nshelter was available.\n  Just 22 short miles east of East Grand Forks is the community of \nCrookston. Fortunately, through hard work and some luck, Crookston \nescaped major flooding in 1997. But Crookston's luck may not hold. The \nRed Lake River has flooded Crookston in the past, and without improved \nflood protection, it will flood the city again. The city has \nexperienced severe flooding as a result of the topography of the land, \nas well as agriculture drainage, loss of wetlands, and the construction \nof county ditch systems. In fact, all of which have altered the flow of \nwater adding to the risk of flooding. The threat to life and property \nin Crookston has increased since the 1950 flood when many homes were \ndestroyed. The city has constructed levees between 1950 and 1965, but \nthese levees are seriously deteriorating.\n  Mr. President, there is a plan for flood protection in Crookston. \nCity planners have suggested a combination of channel cuts and dikes. \nThe channel cuts would allow water to flow more quickly through town. \nThe dikes would hold back flood water.\n  The city needs federal funding for this project. Already, the State \nof Minnesota has appropriated $3.3 million for Crookston for the dual \npurpose of providing funds to match the pending federal money, and to \nbuy out homes in preparation for construction of the project. Local \ncontributions, thus far, have exceeded $1.5 million, a third of which \nwas used to meet the 50% federal requirement for the feasibility study, \nand the remainder is to be used as a part of the local match for the \nconstruction of the project that was authorized in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999. The cost benefit ratio for the project was \ndetermined in the Corps' feasibility study to be 1.6, far exceeding the \nfederal requirement of a 1:1 cost benefit ratio for flood prevention \nprojects.\n  It is my understanding that the city has met every requirement, \ncooperated with the Corps, and done everything asked of them to ensure \nthe federal funding they expected after the authorization.\n  I want to commend the leadership of Mayor Don Osborne, members of the \ncity council and city engineers in working on this important flood \ncontrol project for their community. It is my hope that federal funding \nfor this project be achieved so that work can begin to provide \nessential flood protection for the people of Crookston.\n  I urge the support of conferees for this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, in thanking the managers of this bill for accepting \nan amendment important to the residents of Kake, Alaska.\n  The city of Kake is a predominantly Tlingit Indian community of 850 \nlocated on Kupreanof Island in a remote section of southeast Alaska.\n  Since the recent collapse of the timber industry in southeast Alaska, \nKake's economy has been almost entirely reliant on a local salmon \nhatchery and a seafood processing plant.\n  The city water was supplied by the Gunnuk Creek Dam, a wooden dam\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nbuilt in 1946 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) at a cost of \napproximately $1.5 million.\n  In late July, after three days of severe storms dumped approximately \n24 inches of rain, several logs swept across Kake's water reservoir and \ngouged an 18-foot by 12-foot hole in the 54 year old dam. The reservoir \nemptied and within minutes Kake's residents, hatchery, fish processing \nplant, general store, city offices, school, and fire department were \nwithout water. For the next 10 days, residents were forced to boil \nwater before they could drink it. On August 10, the governor of Alaska \nissued a disaster declaration for Kake.\n  As an interim measure, small pumps have been installed in Gunnuk \nCreek to pump water to the filtration plant. Those pumps are highly \nsusceptible to storms, and must be monitored 24 hours per day for \ndebris and wear. The city purchased the small pumps with borrowed \nmoney, which must be repaid. Because of lack of water, the salmon \nhatchery has lost $2 million to date, primarily in loss of fish and egg \nharvests for next year's run. Also because of a lack of water, the cold \nstorage plant--the major employer in Kake--laid off its 70 workers and \nhas lost $500,000 in business.\n  Engineers from the Indian Health Service and a private consulting \nfirm have declared the dam a total loss and estimate that $7 million is \nneeded for a replacement.\n  The amendment included in this bill would provide the needed funding \nto replace the dam and I thank my colleagues for their support.\n\n\n                               rio grande\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my amendment to strike the language in \nsection 204 results from an agreement reached between myself and \nInterior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to delay implementation of a \nsolicitor's opinion concerning the ownership of water facilities and \nrelated use of Rio Grande water, and to work toward a long-term \nsolution to these water issues.\n  At issue is the relationship between ownership of water facilities \nand the desire to maintain flows in the Rio Grande.\n  Secretary Babbitt agreed to refrain from implementing a June 19 \nSolicitor's opinion, unless agreed to by the parties in litigation and \nthe state engineer, or as permitted by court order.\n  I committed to work with him to achieve a long-term solution to these \ncomplicated water issues, and we agreed the current allocation, \nownership and use of water in New Mexico have raised some issues of the \ngreatest magnitude and at this time the most appropriate forum for \ntheir resolution is Federal court.\n  I have moved to strike this language based on the good faith of \nSecretary Babbitt, and I also note that he agreed to continue to \nresolve water issues related to the Fort Sumner Irrigation District \n(FSID) and the Pecos River, recognizing that the FSID and MRGCD \nfacilities have different status.\n  However, based on our good faith discussions, I will continue to work \nwith him on the Pecos issue, and expect that the Department will not \ntake adverse action against that irrigation district in the meantime.\n\n\n                    the harding lake watershed study\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the bill \nfor accepting the amendment on behalf of Senator Murkowski and myself \nto help find a solution to the problem plaguing Harding Lake.\n  Harding Lake is the largest road accessible lake in the interior of \nAlaska. It holds significant recreation, fishery, natural resources and \neconomic value for interior Alaska.\n  In a recent Fairbanks Daily News-Miner article, state officials \nclosed Harding Lake to pike fishing due to dried up spawning grounds.\n  Harding Lake is suffering from a dramatic drop in water levels.\n  This drop in water level has impacted the shoreline--in some areas \ncausing a recession of as much as 700 feet.\n  This loss of water could cause problems with water quality, land use, \nand fishery harvests.\n  Residents of Harding Lake, have asked for help in identifying the \nsource of the water loss problem at the lake.\n  After discussions with the Corps of Engineers and officials at the \nsoil and conservation district, it appears a watershed study and plan \nis needed to protect the lake from further degradation.\n  My amendment would provide the necessary funding to begin the \nwatershed study and to develop a comprehensive plan to address the \nproblem.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their understanding and for \naccepting this provision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Research into the molecular basis of \ndisease using mouse models of human disease and a miniaturized version \nof PET (positron emission tomography) called MicroPET currently being \nconducted at the University of California Los Angeles School of \nMedicine's Division of Nuclear Medicine offers exciting new \npossibilities for development of treatments for human disease based on \nthe molecular disorders that cause it.\n  Among the diseases for which mouse models have already been developed \nare breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers, Parkinson's disease \nand diabetes. New funding will allow for development of mouse models \nfor lymphoma cancers and dementia/Alzheimer's disease and will allow \ndevelopment of extremely precise molecular diagnostics and molecular \ntherapies.\n  Added funding will allow development for the next generation of \nMicroPET imaging technology.\n  The new technology will combine MicroPET, which measures the \nbiological processes of a body, and MicroCT, which measures a body's \nanatomical structure into a single device for simultaneous and precise \nimaging of both biology and structure and will allow for the \ndifferential screening of biological, genetic and structural changes \ncaused by disease in living mice.\n  This will allow researchers to see precisely the effect of new \nmolecular, targeted treatments including gene therapies for a wide \nrange of diseases using human disease genes inserted into mouse models.\n  Because the mouse models are developed using human disease genes, the \nadded funding for these new technologies and procedures will lead to \nnew means of treating and tracking human disease using clinical PET \ntechnology.\n  The research will lead to the ability to both diagnose disease and \ntrack the effect of targeted molecular/genetic therapies on a broad \nrange of serious human diseases.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to address briefly the \nissue of funding for the fundamental science and engineering research \nsupported by the Department of Energy.\n  The DOE is the leading source of federal support for the physical \nsciences in the nation. Not many people know that, but it is true. DOE \nand its predecessor agencies developed this broad portfolio of physical \nsciences research in pursuit of the agency's statutory missions. To \nunderstand energy and its myriad transformations, you have to know a \nlot about the properties of matter, and of energy flows in matter, at a \nvery fundamental level. In order to conserve energy by, for example, \nrunning industrial processes at higher temperatures that have greater \nthermodynamic efficiencies, you have to know a lot about basic \nmaterials science. These are research needs that other science \nagencies, such as the NSF, cannot meet within their missions and \nfunding levels. It's an important reason why we have a Department of \nEnergy, to begin with.\n  DOE is also a crucial supporter of scientific research in the life \nsciences. In the life sciences, the DOE initiated the Human Genome \nProgram and co-manges this enormously important and promising effort \nwith the NIH.\n  DOE also plays a leading role in supporting other biological \nsciences, environmental sciences, mathematics, computing, and \nengineering. In all these areas, its basic research contributions \nrelate to DOE's energy missions.\n  As a consequence of these research investments, the DOE is \nresponsible for a significant portion of federal R funding to \nscientists and students at our colleges and universities.\n  In addition to the overall size of DOE's basic science funding, the \ntype of activities that DOE funds has a special character among the \nfederal science agencies. One of the primary responsibilities of DOE's \nOffice of Science is to support large-scale specialized user facilities \nfocussed on national scientific priorities. This particular mission \nmakes the Office of\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nScience unique among, and complementary to, the scientific programs for \nother federal science agencies, including the NIH and NSF. Each year \nover 15,000 sponsored scientists and students from academe, industry, \nand government--many funded by agencies other than the DOE--conduct \ncutting-edge experiments at the Department's research facilities. Every \nState in the country has scientists and engineers with a stake in DOE's \nuser facilities.\n  One of the challenges the Office of Science has faced during the past \ndecade is that its funding has been reduced by approximately 13 percent \nin constant dollars. Other science agencies, such as NIH, have been \ngrowing strongly, while the DOE Office of Science has significantly \nless funding today, in constant dollars, than 10 years ago.\n  These reductions have prevented the Office of Science from fully \nparticipating in new initiatives in exciting technical areas important \nto DOE's statutory missions such as high performance computing and \nnanotech- nology. More troublesome, the declining funding for the \nOffice of Science has reduced the number of scientists and students \nable to conduct research suing DOE's national user facilities. In fact, \nDOE's national and university-based laboratories are currently \noperating well below their optimum levels, especially in light of \ngrowing demand from the scientific community.\n  DOE's scientific user communities and DOE's own scientific advisory \ncommittees have completed a number of reports over the past year to two \nto put a number on what DOE's science budget should look like, in order \nto fully take advantage of the scientific opportunities that are out \nthere. They estimated that in FY 2001 alone a funding level of over \n$3.3 billion can easily be justified in order to support research and \nto fully utilize and modernize DOE facilities.\n  I am mindful that both the Chairman and the Ranking member of this \nappropriations subcommittee would like to make more money available for \nDOE's science programs. They have made statements yesterday that they \nwill seek additional funds for the non-defense side of this bill as it \nmoves forward. As they know, Senator Frank Murkowski, and I are \ncirculating a letter in the Senate for signature by Senators to \nindicate their support for this goal. It's a letter that I hope \nstrengthens their hand in getting a better allocation as we move \nforward. The letter is addressed to the bipartisan leadership of the \nSenate, and is already attracting strong bipartisan support.\n  I hope that when the Conference Report on this bill is finally \nwritten, the FY 2001 funding level for the DOE Office of Science will \nbe no less than the President's request level of $3.16 billion. I hope \nthat the funding level can be higher, in some areas, if at all \npossible. And I hope that both the President and Congress will provide \nsignificant increases in funding for the DOE Office of Science in \nfuture years in order to sustain the Office's steady growth. Such \nfunding increases are merited by the important and unique work being \nconducted by the DOE Office of Science. The funding increases would \nalso be consistent with the Senate's passage of a bill that both \nSenator Domenici and I were original co-sponsors of the Federal \nResearch Investment Act (S. 296) which calls for doubling investment in \ncivilian research and development efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LITTLETON\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the citizens of South Dakota are \nhonoring the heroism of Herbert A. Littleton, a 20-year-old Marine \nCorps private who died while performing acts of gallantry that earned \nhim the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Private First Class Littleton enlisted in Black Hawk, South Dakota, \nand served as a radio operator during the Korean War with the U.S. \nMarine Corps Reserve, Company C, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine \nDivision (Reinforced). This is the same Marine division that turned the \ncourse of the Korean War with its successful landing behind enemy lines \nat Inchon, Korea, 50 years ago this month.\n  Seven months after the Inchon landing, Private First Class \nLittleton's unit was in Chungchon, Korea. On the night of April 22, \n1951, Private Littleton, a radio operator with an artillery forward \nobservation team, was standing watch. Suddenly Company C's position \ncame under attack from a well concealed and numerically superior enemy \nforce. Private First Class Littleton quickly alerted his team and moved \ninto position to begin calling down artillery fire on the hostile \nforce. But as his comrades arrived to assist, an enemy hand grenade was \nthrown into their midst. Private First Class Littleton unhesitatingly \nhurled himself on the grenade, absorbing its full, shattering impact \nwith his own body and saving the other members of his team from serious \ninjury or death.\n  Following Private First Class Littleton's heroic death, the President \nof the United States awarded him our nation's highest military award \nfor bravery. The official citation says: ``His indomitable valor in the \nface of almost certain death reflects the highest credit upon Pfc. \nLittleton and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for \nhis country.''\n  Mr. President, today Governor Bill Janklow dedicated a granite \nmemorial to Private First Class Littleton in\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nSpearfish, South Dakota, near the town where this young man signed up \nto serve his country. This is a dignified and fitting tribute. But \nthere is another memorial to Private First Class Littleton on the other \nside of the Pacific Ocean, where a small, impoverished colony has \nblossomed into the Republic of Korea: a peaceful, democratic society \nthat ranks as one of the great economic success stories of the 20th \nCentury. His sacrifice helped make all this possible.\n  With this statement before the United States Senate, I join in \nsaluting Private First Class Littleton. As we conduct the nation's \naffairs in this chamber of the United States Capitol, we would do well \nto remember Private First Class Littleton. In our every deed, let the \nmembers of this body bear in mind the lesson of courage, honor, and \npersonal sacrifice offered to us by a 20-year-old man fighting for his \ncountry in the darkness, far from home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8188-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8188-S8189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FIRESTONE-FORD INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to deal with \nvery serious problems disclosed in hearings yesterday in the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. The hearing involved 88 \ndeaths that have resulted from Firestone tires shredding, and a great \nmany Ford vehicles--mostly Ford Explorers--rolling over and resulting \nin those 88 deaths.\n  The hearing yesterday produced substantial evidence that ranking \nofficials at Firestone and Ford knew about this problem, but subjected \nthe owners of Ford Explorer vehicles riding on Firestone tires to the \nrisk of death, which did eventuate for 88 people, and to very serious \nbodily injury formany more. These risks were foisted upon the American \ntraveling public at a time when both Ford and Firestone knew what the \nproblems were, at a time when, in October of 1998, customers in \nVenezuela had found the problem, and Ford and Firestone were alerted to \nit, with officials in Venezuela now talking about criminal \nprosecutions. In August of 1999, the Saudis had their tires replaced, \nso the people in Saudi Arabia were being protected while U.S. consumers \nwere not being protected.\n  An internal Ford memorandum on March 12, 1999, considered whether \nGovernmental officials in the United States ought to be notified, and a \ndecision was made not to notify Federal officials. The matter then came \ninto sharp focus in late July of this year, with the Ford executive \nwitness testifying that Ford did not know about the problem in its full \nimport until July 27 when Firestone turned over the information to \nFederal authorities. There was a representation by the Ford witness--\nwhich candidly strains credulity--and Firestone made representations \nthat they did not find out about this problem until they had conducted \nsome extraordinary tests--tests which obviously should have been \nconducted at a much earlier stage.\n  Yesterday, I questioned the Ford and Firestone officials on their \nwillingness to turn over all of the records to the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and they said they would; although, as I \nhad said at the time, I thought there ought to be a subpoena issued \nwhich made it an obligation. Failure to perform would subject anybody \nwho did not comply with the subpoena to charges of obstruction of \njustice. When cases of this sort have arisen in the past, there is a \ntremendous amount of experience that there is reluctance on the part of \ncompanies to turn over their documents, and they are found only after \nthe most detailed and excruciating discovery in litigation. So this is \na matter where the documents will be the best evidence as to who knew \nwhat, when that was known, and what action, if any, was taken.\n  The tragedy with the Firestone tires and the Ford Explorer rollovers \nis a matter that is going to have to be determined after very \nsubstantial investigation. The witnesses who testified yesterday were \nJoan Claybrook, President of the Public Citizen Organization, and R. \nDavid Pittle, Senior Vice President and Technical Director, Consumers \nUnion. Both of them felt that criminal prosecutions were appropriate, \nperhaps rising to the level of second degree murder because of a \nwillful disregard or reckless disregard of the safety of others, \nresulting in death, which is the legal equivalent of malice and which \nis the basis for a charge as serious as murder in the second degree.\n  Whether that is applicable to Firestone and Ford remains to be seen. \nHowever, we find a situation where the laws of the United States are \ninadequate to deal with this kind of situation. There is no legislation \non the books which establishes a prosecution in these terms.\n  Back in 1966, the House of Representatives considered similar \nlegislation. I have considered it for some time and have deferred \nintroducing such legislation because it seemed to me that perhaps it \nwas just a little harsh. But with the experience of Ford and Firestone, \nI do think it is appropriate for the Congress of the United States to \nconsider such legislation.\n  That is why today I am introducing a bill which would establish \ncriminal sanctions for any person who, in gross deviation from a \nreasonable standard of care, introduces into interstate commerce a \nproduct known by that person to be defective which causes the death or \nserious bodily injury of any individual, calling for penalties up to 15 \nyears where the requisite malice is shown resulting in death, and up to \n5 years where the requisite malice is shown for serious bodily injury.\n  This is a matter I have studied in considerable detail over many \nyears, having represented defendants in personal injury cases--some \nplaintiffs in personal injury cases--but, more specifically, as \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia seeing the impact and the effect of \ncriminal prosecutions and seeing to it that people pay attention.\n  When there are similar monetary awards, it costs the company and it \ncosts the shareholders, but it doesn't do anything to the individuals \nwho make these decisions. Before an individual could be held \nresponsible under my proposed legislation, there would have to be a \nshowing that the person knew there was a defect and that defect \nsubjected a person to death or serious bodily injury.\n  That kind of knowledge and putting the instrumentality into commerce \ndoes constitute gross disregard for the safety or the life of another, \nwhich is the equivalent of malice and justifies this kind of a \nprosecution.\n  As I noted, this is a subject I have studied for some time. Although \nthe Firestone-Ford issue came up only yesterday, the studies I have \nundertaken have shown me the desirability of this kind of legislation.\n  Last year, in Anderson v. General Motors Company, 1999 WL 1466627, a \nLos Angeles Superior Court jury ordered General Motors to pay a record \n$4.8 billion in punitive damages when six people were trapped and \nburned when their Chevrolet Malibu exploded after its fuel tank was \nruptured in a rear-end crash. General Motors had made a calculation \nthat it would cost in damages $2.40 per automobile if they left the \ndefect in existence, but to correct and redesign the fuel system to \nreduce the fire cost would have been $8.59 a car. So that cost analysis \ndid constitute actual malice.\n  That kind of an analysis was very similar to the punitive damages \nwhich were awarded in the famous case involving the Ford Pinto, which \ngoes back to a 1981 decision in Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company, 119 \nCal. App. 3d 757, where an analysis was made that it would cost some \n$49.5 million to pay damages resulting from deaths and injuries \ncontrasted with $137 million to pay for correcting the automobile.\n  In this particular case, the punitive damage award was $125 million, \nbut it was subsequently reduced to $3.5 million, which frequently \nhappens in punitive damage awards.\n  In a similar case, Ginny V. White and Jimmy D. White v. Ford Motor \nCompany, CV-N-95-279-DWH (PHA), a 3-year-old child was crushed to death \nunder the rear dual wheels of a Ford truck after it rolled suddenly \ndown a grade. Here, Ford had known of the defect and knew how to \ncorrect it easily but did not do so. Punitive damages in that case were \nawarded at $150 million but have since been reduced to $69 million.\n  These cases are illustrative of the kind of headlines punitive damage \nawards make in the newspapers but how they are very frequently reduced. \nBut again, the punitive damages do not really deal with the executives \nwho make these decisions.\n\n  In the case of Fair v. Ford Motor Company, Civil Action 88-CI-101, 27\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\npeople were killed when a school bus in which they were riding burned \nafter being struck by another vehicle. Punitive damages were upheld in \nthis case where the facts showed that the fuel tank failure was \npreventable and that Ford had the capacity and the opportunity to \nprevent it and failed to do so.\n  In another similar case, Toyota Motor Company v. Moll, 438 So. 2d 192 \n(Fla. App. 1983), a Toyota Corona was struck in the rear, causing its \nfuel system to rupture and three women were burned to death. The court \nfound malice on the part of Toyota because Toyota knew of the defective \ndesign of the fuel system and, in wanton disregard of the safety of the \npurchasing public, continued to market their 1973 Toyota Corona.\n  In Ford Motor Company v. Ammerman, 705 N.E. 2d 539 (Ind. App. 1999), \nthe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of Indiana imposed punitive \ndamages, finding malice on the part of Ford, when a Bronco slid \nsideways and rolled over causing very serious injuries, with the court \nsaying:\n  ``It is apparent to this court that Ford was motivated by profits \nrather than safety when it put into the stream of commerce a vehicle \nwhich it knew was dangerous and defective. Ignoring its own data and \nadvice of its engineers, Ford manufactured a vehicle prone to roll-over \naccidents in spite of being aware that such accidents result in more \nserious injuries than any other.'' 705 N.E. 2d at 562.\n  There are similar findings in the famous breast implant case, Hopkins \nv. Dow Corning, 33 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 1994), where they knew that long \nstudies of implants were needed before the product could be marketed \nbut concealed the information.\n  Similarly, in the Dalkon Shield case, Tetuan v. A.H. Robins Co., 738 \nP.2d 1210 (Kan. 1987), thousands of women were presented with life-\nthreatening and even fatal illnesses with the Kansas Supreme Court \nnoting that the company deliberately and actively concealed the \npotential dangers of the product, thereby violating their duty to the \npublic.\n  In the interest of time, I will summarize very briefly Batteast v. \nWyeth Laboratories, Inc., 526 N.E. 2d 428 (Ill. App. 1 Dist. 1988), \nwhere punitive damages were awarded where drugs were given to \nindividuals knowing of their dangerous propensity.\n  Similarly, in the case of Proctor v. Davis, 682 N.E. 2d 1203 (Ill. \nApp. 1997), a patient had a retina detachment and blindness following \nthe adverse effects of a drug which were known to the manufacturer but \nnot disclosed.\n  In the brief time available this afternoon, I have summarized a \nseries of cases which are only representative--where products have been \nput in interstate commerce, where there was knowledge on the part of \nindividuals who put those products on the market that they would \nsubject the individuals to risk of serious bodily injury or death, and, \nwhen death resulted, they were held liable, with the courts concluding \nthat malice was established by the reckless disregard of the life of \nanother.\n  When we have such a long sequence of cases, when we have the \noccasional imposition of punitive damages which are characteristically \nreduced and not really determinative or therapeutic anyway because it \ngoes only after the shareholders as opposed to the individuals who have \nthe ability to eliminate the problem, it is time there was adequate \nlegislation on the Federal books to deal with this sort of problem.\n  I repeat, the culpability of Firestone or Ford has not yet been \nestablished, but it strains credulity that the key officials, based on \nwhat we heard yesterday in the hearing, did not know of these defects, \nand with the documents already at hand failed to take action to correct \nthem. That is a matter to be determined.\n  But this legislation, if enacted, will certainly put the officials on \nnotice that they cannot recklessly disregard human life for profits.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8189-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I don't know whether other colleagues of \nmine have spoken today on this issue, but I would be surprised if some \nhave not. I have not had an opportunity to hear what anybody else has \nsaid. It is with some dismay that we are, once again, faced this year \nwith very high energy costs. The headline that I have in front of me \nfrom the Washington Post for today says, ``Oil Prices Hit a Ten-Year \nHigh; As Americans Face Costly Winter, U.S. Pressures OPEC on Output.''\n  In that headline, several things are considered: First of all, we \nhave the highest worldwide energy prices since the gulf war, and the \nwar was responsible for the high oil prices at that particular time--\nnot OPEC cutting back oil, not bad U.S. domestic energy policy. The \nother thing that hits us is that the consumer is going to end up paying \nfor this. Both points highlight that this administration has been \npromising us an energy plan to deal with this crisis situation. Let me \nbe clear on that--an energy plan not for the future but to deal with \nthe immediate crisis.\n  I had an opportunity to write a letter to the administration earlier \nthis summer asking them to put forth a plan to meet potential shortages \nof fuel oil, propane gas, and natural gas--all used in home heating--so \nthe health of our seniors is not threatened when we get cold weather. I \nhave not had a response to that letter. Nothing of substance has come \nfrom my request.\n  I had a chance during the month of July, when Senator Lugar had a \nhearing before the Agriculture Committee with Secretary of Energy \nRichardson, to ask questions of Secretary Richardson, and put forth the \nnecessity of his coming forward with just such a plan. Yet nothing has \nbeen forthcoming. I should say nothing but what the story in the Post \nreminds us of--that this Administration's energy policy seems to \nconsist of either the President of the United States or the Energy \nSecretary getting down on hands and knees to OPEC countries--and they \ntend to emphasize dealing with the Arab nations on this issue--to \nplease pump more oil, produce more oil, send more oil to the \nindustrialized parts of the world, particularly the United States. That \nis all we are seeing at this point. That is all we saw last spring from \nthis administration to get the price of energy down--begging the OPEC \nnations, and particularly the Arab oil-producing nations, to send more \noil. That is their response to the crisis.\n  This prompts me to tell my colleagues what I hope I will be able to \ndo tonight as we discuss the energy and water bill. Since I have not \nhad a response to my request to the Energy Secretary when he was before \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, and since I have not had a response \nto my letter to the President, as well as a letter to the Energy \nSecretary, I will be offering an amendment that will ask the \nadministration to get this plan that we have\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nbeen promised on the table. We need this plan so we can assure the \nconsumers of America, particularly our more vulnerable consumers, the \nsenior citizens, and particularly the most vulnerable senior citizens, \nthose who are living alone, that we have a supply of energy for \npurchase at any cost. Hopefully the administration will come up with a \nplan that has a supply of energy that they can afford to pay for, and \nparticularly a plan that doesn't require our senior citizens to choose \nbetween energy and food.\n  Also, I think it begs discussion of a bigger issue; that is, where \nhas this administration been for the last 7 years on developing energy? \nFor the most part, we have had a badly damaged oil exploration \nindustry, and we have had workers who work in that industry finding \njobs elsewhere. So even if that industry were to perk up and find \nplaces to drill and an incentive to drill, there are not enough workers \nto man the rigs because this administration has had a policy of \ndeemphasizing domestic production.\n  So much of the land in the United States and our continental shelf, \nhas been taken out of bounds for drilling, and in the case of natural \ngas, where two-thirds of the known supplies are available, there is no \ndrilling where we know it is available under public lands.\n  I know of the concern for the environment. It seems to me we can have \na balance between environmental policy and the domestic production of \nenergy. We can have that because it is possible. We can have that \nbecause it is a necessity. It is a necessity because we cannot be held \nhostage by OPEC nations, and we can't be held hostage by Arab oil-\nproducing nations and their leaders who want to put political pressure \non the United States when it comes to a peace agreement involving \nPalestine and Israel, and all those issues that are acquainted with it.\n  We do not have to have military action in the Middle East now as we \ndid at the time of the Persian Gulf war. But if we need to protect our \noil, the flow of oil from the Middle East to the United States, we \nwould not be able to put together that armada that we had 9 years ago \nto stop Saddam Hussein, what he was doing there, and what that caused \nin the energy situations in this country. That was the last time the \nenergy prices went so high.\n  So we need from this administration a plan of what they are going to \ndo to make sure there are not shortages in this country, what we can do \nto get the price down. We need that very soon. That is what my \namendment will call for that I will offer this evening. We also need a \npolicy of this administration to encourage the domestic production of \noil and natural gas that we have available here so we aren't dependent \nupon OPEC for our sources of oil and natural gas.\n  I hope some of these issues will be discussed in the coming political \ncampaign. I think on our side of the aisle, the Republican Party has a \ncandidate who is well aware of the shortcomings of this administration \non energy policy and will take steps, including fossil fuel \navailability, as well as renewable fuel availability to accomplish \nthose goals.\n  While Governor Bush was campaigning in my State of Iowa during the \nfirst-in-the-nation caucuses that we had, I had the opportunity to \ntravel throughout Iowa over the course of 4 or 5 days that I was \nhelping him with his campaign. I had an opportunity to discuss some of \nthese very tough issues and the direction that a new administration \ncould take on renewable fuels such as ethanol, for example, renewable \nfuel incentives such as wind energy and biomass and tax incentives that \nare necessary for them to get rapidly started and a balance between \nrenewable fuels and nonrenewable fuels.\n  I am satisfied that not only does the Governor of Texas come from a \nState where there is an understanding of the importance of fossil \nfuels--petroleum, natural gas, et cetera--but there is also an \nunderstanding that renewable sources of energy are very much an \nimportant part of the equation to make sure that the United States is \nnot held hostage to OPEC nations as we see the President of the United \nStates and the Energy Secretary begging OPEC to pump more oil.\n  I think with a new voice for energy independence in the White House, \nwe will not have this very embarrassing situation that we find \nourselves in, not just for the first time, but we found ourselves in \nthis position in March, we found ourselves in this position in June \nwhen the leaders of this administration were hat in hand dealing with \nan OPEC organization controlling prices and controlling production, but \nif they were CEOs of oil companies in this country, doing the same sort \nof price fixing, they would be in prison.\n  What a spectacle of the President of the United States and the Energy \nSecretary dealing with these OPEC nations. That is an embarrassing \nsituation. More important than just being embarrassing, it signals a \nnational defense weakness of our country which must be based upon \nhaving certain access to energy. If we are going to be strong \nmilitarily, we won't have this embarrassment when a new face gets in \nthe White House, if that new face is a person that is committed to the \ndomestic production of energy and committed to renewable sources of \nenergy, and committed to making a point with OPEC that we don't intend \nto be dependent upon these nations holding us up, particularly after \nthe American taxpayer gave $415 million of foreign aid to OPEC nations \nfor them to use to buy the rope to strangle the American consumer \neconomically and hurt our whole economy in the process. That is exactly \nwhat OPEC is doing when the price of our energy, the price of our fuel \noil, goes up 30 percent.\n  I hope we have a new day. I want to have a new day. I hope for a new \nday. A lot of that is what the people decide in the coming election.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8190-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8190-S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENIOR SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage passage of the \nSeniors Safety Act, legislation I introduced along with Senators \nDaschle, Kennedy, and Torricelli in March 1999. Eight additional \nSenators have signed on as cosponsors since then. Despite this broad \nsupport, however, the majority has declined even to hold hearings on \nthis bill to fight crime against America's senior citizens. As \nGrandparents' Day approaches this Sunday, and as this Congress comes to \na close, I urge the majority to join with us in our efforts to improve \nthe safety and security of older Americans.\n  During the 1990s, while overall crime rates dropped throughout the \nnation, the rate of crime against seniors remained constant. In \naddition to the increased vulnerability of some seniors to violent \ncrime, older Americans are increasingly targeted by swindlers looking \nto take advantage of them through telemarketing schemes, pension fraud, \nand health care fraud. We must strengthen the hand of law enforcement \nto combat those criminals who plunder the savings that older Americans \nhave worked their lifetimes to earn. The Seniors Safety Act tries to do \nexactly that, through a comprehensive package of proposals to establish \nnew protections and increase penalties for a wide variety of crimes \nagainst seniors.\n  First, this bill provides additional protections to nursing home \nresidents. Nursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--\nindeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will \nneed nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes \ndo a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply \nlooks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad \nproviders in operation. It does this by giving Federal law enforcement \nthe authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing \nhomes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This \nauthority is all the more important given the study prepared by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the \nNew York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail \nto meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient \ncare. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less \nstaff than necessary to provide optimal care.\n  Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from \ntelemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. My \nbill would give the Attorney General the authority to block or \nterminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud \nseniors. If someone takes your money\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nat gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses \ntheir phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect \nother victims by taking their phone away. In addition, my proposal \nwould establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would \nkeep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a \nsimple phone call, seniors could find out whether the company trying to \nsell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject \nof complaints or been convicted of fraud.\n  Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who \nhave worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-\nearned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. My \nbill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who \ndefraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft \nin connection with employee benefit plans.\n  Fourth and finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law \nenforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the \nNational Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud \nschemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the \nelderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to \ncomplain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law \nenforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, \ninvestigate, and prosecute health care offense in both criminal and \ncivil proceedings. It also protests whistle-blowers who alert law \nenforcement officers to examples of health care fraud.\n  This legislation is intended to focus attention on the particular \ncriminal activities that victimize seniors the most. Congress should \nact on this bill now--when it comes to protecting our seniors, we have \nno time to waste. I am eager to work with the majority on this bill, \nand would be happy to consider any constructive improvements. \nProtecting seniors should be a bipartisan cause, and I want to pursue \nit in a bipartisan way. So I urge my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to look at this bill and work with us to improve the security \nof our seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8191-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as you know, President Clinton recently \nannounced that he would further delay deployment of a national missile \ndefense system to protect the United States. Regrettably, although the \nPresident's decision was disappointing, it was not surprising given the \ntrack record of the Clinton-Gore administration. In fact, when one \nlooks back over the past 8 years it is clear that this latest decision \nis merely the capstone to a string of poor decisions by this \nadministration that have left us defenseless against a growing threat \nto America's security.\n  Time after time, the administration has taken steps to delay \ndevelopment of a system to defend against a missile threat that the \nRumsfeld Commission, our intelligence agencies, and the Defense \nDepartment have said is increasingly serious. The administration has \nfailed to pursue development of promising missile defense technologies, \nsuch as sea- and space-based defenses, has underfunded the limited \nprograms it has authorized, and has pursued misguided arms control \npolicies.\n  This week, Senator Thad Cochran released a report entitled ``Stubborn \nThings'' that chronicles the record of neglect by this administration \ntoward missile defense. The report contains ten chapters, corresponding \nto each year over the past decade. Each chapter includes a \nchronological recitation of events relevant to ballistic missile \ndefense, including the progression of the missile threat facing the \nUnited States, developments in arms control negotiations, as well as \ndata on the level of funding devoted to these vital programs.\n  Senator Cochran named the report after a quote from John Adams, who \nsaid in 1770:\n\n       Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, \n     our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they \n     cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\n\n  True to the spirit of John Adams' admonition, Senator Cochran's \nreport simply lays out fact after fact about what has transpired in the \narea of missile defense over the past decade. It is an excellent \ncompilation of the events and decisions that have led us to our current \nsituation.\n  For example, after the President announced that he would not \nauthorize deployment of a national missile defense system, \nadministration officials said the President had reached this decision \nin part because development of a booster for the ground-based system \nhas lagged. But as Senator Cochran's report points out, this is a \nlegacy of one of his administration's first decisions after taking \noffice. In February 1993, the administration returned unopened \nproposals by three teams of companies that had bid, at the request of \nthe Defense Department, to develop a ground-based national missile \ndefense interceptor.\n  The track record of the Clinton-Gore administration on missile \ndefense is clear: they were slow to recognize the threat, failed to \npursue the most promising forms of defense, underfunded the limited \nprograms they half-heartedly pursued, and have failed to exercise \nleadership in addressing the concerns of our allies and other nations \nlike Russia.\n  Senator Cochran and his able staff, Mitch Kugler, Dennis Ward, Dennis \nMcDowell, Michael Loesch, Eric Desautels, Brad Sweet, and Julie Sander, \nare to be commended for producing this excellent report. By presenting \nthe facts without rhetoric or spin they have significantly advanced the \nnational debate on this important issue. I highly commend the report to \nmy colleagues and to members of the public interested in this subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8191-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8191-S8192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this Saturday will mark the 150th \nanniversary of California's admission to the Union. As the people of \nour State prepare for this Sesquicentennial celebration, I want to \ncelebrate California's most distinctive characteristic: its tremendous \ndiversity.\n  California is ``a nation unto itself'' with great mountains and \nforests, vast deserts and fertile valleys, rolling hills and rugged \ncoastlines. Within its borders can be found virtually every climate, \nevery crop, every landform on earth.\n  But our greatest diversity--and our greatest asset--is the people of \nCalifornia.\n  California's diversity was apparent from the beginning. When the \nfirst Spanish pioneers crossed the Great Desert, they met Native \nAmericans from more than 300 tribal and language groups. By the time \nMexico and California gained independence from Spain, Alta California \nwas home to many Europeans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders as well as \nHispanics, North Americans, and Native Americans.\n  In 1849, when California held its constitutional convention, its 48 \ndelegates included men from England, Scotland, Ireland, France, \nSwitzerland, Mexico, and Spain. Thirteen of the delegates had been in \nCalifornia for less than a year; and William M. Gwin, who later became \none of our first two U.S. Senators, had been here less than three \nmonths. Seven delegates had been born in California: their names were \nVallejo, Carrillo, Pico, Dominguez, Rodriguez, Covarrubias, another \nPico, and de la Guerra.\n  The Gold Rush brought new waves of pioneers from all over the globe. \nIn their wake came workers from China, who built the great railroads, \nand Japanese farmers who fed the fortune hunters and made fortunes of \ntheir own.\n  During the Great Depression, thousands of internal immigrants fled \nthe Dust Bowls of Texas and Oklahoma for greener pastures in \nCalifornia.\n  During World War II, thousands of African Americans migrated from the \nrural South to work in California's shipyards and other defense-related \nindustries.\n  At the war's end, California had a wave of settlers from the U.S. \nArmed Forces: men and women who had shipped out of our beautiful ports \nand returned to stay when the war was over.\n  In recent years, new immigrants from Asia and Latin America have \nadded to California's rich cultural mix, making our state the \ncrossroads of the Pacific Rim and the new economy.\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n  Today California's great diversity is reflected in our Congressional \ndelegation, where our state is represented by people named Becerra, and \nRoybal-Allard; Feinstein, Waxman, and Berman; Dixon, Waters, and Lee; \nPelosi, Gallegly, and Radanovich; and Farr and McKeon.\n\n  On Wednesday, September 13th, Representatives Farr and McKeon will \nhost a Sesquicentennial reception for Members of both Houses and both \nparties. I look forward to joining my California colleagues in \ncelebrating our great state's proud history and bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Ken Lipper, the CEO of Lipper & \nCompany investment firm, is a man of many talents. Ken is a novelist, a \nfilm producer and one of the most profound thinkers with respect to the \nnew economy. In a February speech at the University of California \nTechnology Conference, he outlined the strategies we must employ to \naddress today's economic problems. Although he delivered the speech \nseven months ago, it is still valid. I ask that the text of the speech \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The text of the speech follows.\n\n                         Remarks of Ken Lipper\n\n       As of February 2000, the United States is in the 107th \n     month of an economic boom, the longest in history. Even as \n     this economic expansion continues, observers have been amazed \n     that inflation remains a low 2.5 percent. Ordinarily, at the \n     stage of ``full employment'' we are now enjoying--\n     unemployment is at 4 percent, and is projected at 3.8 percent \n     for the year 2000, with nearly 90 percent capacity \n     utilization--there would be serious labor shortages and \n     rising prices. As a result, the Federal Reserve would \n     intervene to raise interest rates and tighten the money \n     supply, causing the expansion to fizzle.\n       Why is this boom different? Currently there is an excess \n     world capacity in basic manufacturing of goods and \n     commodities, due in part to the Asian collapse combined with \n     high unemployment and relatively slow growth in Europe. More \n     important is the unprecedented and uninterrupted level of \n     U.S. capital investment. Productivity has been increasing at \n     historically high levels, an average of 2.5 percent each \n     year, so that with a 3.2 percent annual wage increase, there \n     is a real standard of living increase for workers without \n     significantly increasing unit labor costs.\n       In addition, the amount and efficiency of capital behind \n     each worker has increased. For example, in 2000, \n     manufacturers expect to increase revenues 7.7 percent with \n     only a 0.5 percent increase in their labor force; non-\n     manufacturing sectors will increase revenues 6.9 percent with \n     only a 1.4 percent labor force increase. These gains are \n     possible thanks to a high level of investment in plant and \n     equipment, which was up 21 percent in 1999 and is expected to \n     rise another 15 percent in 2000. In non-manufacturing \n     sectors, investment was up 4.7 percent in 1999 and expected \n     to rise 8.7 percent in 2000. And this increased investment \n     continues because a high consumer confidence level--now at an \n     index of 144, compared to an average of 115--encourages \n     corporations to expect growth in consumption.\n       Another factor keeping inflation low is heightened \n     competition, both domestic and, thanks to free trade, \n     foreign. The strong dollar magnifies the effect of this \n     competition, translating into cheaper prices for imported \n     goods. And buyers can also now compare prices by B-B \n     commerce. As a result, 81 percent of manufacturers and 67 \n     percent of non-manufacturers report that they cannot pass \n     along price increases to consumers. At the same time, low \n     interest rates worldwide and the buoyant U.S. stock market \n     have made for cheap capital availability, enabling the \n     investments in productivity. The strong dollar and stock \n     market have made up for the low U.S. savings rate--among the \n     lowest in the world--by encouraging record levels of foreign \n     investment, year in, year out.\n       Finally, the cost of investment capital has been held down \n     because the U.S. government budget surplus takes the U.S. out \n     of the bond market as an issuer competitive with businesses; \n     indeed, the U.S. is now buying back old bonds and liquefying \n     the market. U.S. and European municipalities are also \n     borrowing much less worldwide. These trends force investment \n     funds to be reallocated to the private sector, lowering the \n     cost of capital.\n       These are the reasons why some people feel that the old \n     economic paradigm the boom-to-bust cycle, is outmoded. But we \n     have not repealed the business cycle; we have only added \n     significant time to the boom equation. Ultimately, the laws \n     of supply and demand will still have their impact.\n       The risks to our economy are apparent, and rising. The \n     Asian economies are recovering. In Europe, unemployment is \n     falling and the pace of economic growth is rising, while the \n     Euro is beginning to take hold and compete for funds. This \n     means that over time there could be no cheap imports to hold \n     down inflation. These factors have expressed themselves \n     already, in conjunction with rocketing U.S. consumption, huge \n     oil price increases, an end to the decline in raw materials \n     prices, and rising intermediate-product prices. And these \n     pressures occur as a dwindling supply of new entrants to \n     the U.S. labor force will begin to push up wages.\n       Aggregate U.S. profit margins decreased in 1999, because \n     companies lacked pricing power. But as Asian and European \n     economic recoveries absorb excess worldwide capacity, \n     corporations will regain their pricing power to restore \n     profit margins and pass on increasing costs.\n       The Federal Reserve is already intervening, and will \n     continue to raise interest rates. Many have asked why these \n     interventions are necessary when there is no current sign of \n     rising inflation. One reason is that the Fed's actions \n     generally take about 18 months to filter through the economy. \n     But there are other justifications.\n       The first is labor. We have seen how labor has been able to \n     get real standard of living increases without large wage \n     increases, due to low inflation. But if labor anticipates \n     inflation from the causes discussed above, it will build \n     protective wage increases into multi-year settlements, in \n     order to hedge its potential loss of buying power. This would \n     accelerate the wage-price spiral that itself fuels further \n     inflation. Thus the Federal Reserve is signaling labor of its \n     determination to fight inflation.\n       Second, the Fed is also signaling Congress not to cut taxes \n     or increase programs using the budget surplus, thus putting \n     further pressure on available resources. The Fed's moves seem \n     to indicate that it wants the national debt repaid and Social \n     Security and Medicare funded.\n       Third, the Fed wants to dampen consumption due to the \n     ``wealth effect,'' the stock market gains which are \n     responsible for about 25 percent of the growth in U.S. GDP. \n     Currently, over 50 percent of American households own stocks, \n     with increasing numbers borrowing to carry them. People are \n     spending based on presumed wealth from the stock market, a \n     major difference from the time when consumption was directly \n     linked to more predictable earned income.\n       Nobody knows how fast or how steep a fall in the stock \n     market might be, given high debt levels, but consumption \n     would certainly be affected. When the Japanese bubble burst, \n     the stock market never recovered from its 50 percent loss, \n     and no government program has succeeded in reviving the \n     shocked Japanese consumer.\n       Fourth is the housing market. I expect housing starts to \n     decline by 6 to 8 percent in the second half of 2000 due to \n     rising mortgage rates, which will also affect existing \n     housing prices. At a time of historically minuscule savings \n     rates, how will the stock market investor and consumer react \n     when both his storehouses of wealth--stock and homes--start \n     to fall?\n       I expect that stock prices will recover during the first \n     quarter and perhaps the first half of 2000, as profits \n     reflect the high productivity investments already made and \n     consumption continues unabated. But the risks touched on \n     above will become increasingly evident, and the second half \n     should begin to anticipate and express them in declining \n     stock prices in the U.S. And the Federal Reserve will \n     continue to increase interest rates.\n       Nobody can reliably predict when a stock boom will end. But \n     this one seems to operate in an atmosphere of growing threat, \n     and from lofty heights. NASDAQ has an unprecedented 178X \n     multiple, which might be justified for a few companies but \n     cannot be sustained for an aggregate, 4,700 entities. So how \n     will it end?\n       Probably very suddenly, as other bubbles have burst; and \n     they often take years to recover. On May 4, 1990, Christie's \n     Evening\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\n     Auction failed to attract bids; art prices tumbled 50 percent \n     and the market evaporated. The price of gold reached a peak \n     of 665 in September 1980; in January 1981 it was at 505; in \n     March 1982 it had fallen to 320. The stock market plunged \n     from a peak of 2650 in October 1987 to 1770 two months later. \n     In Japan, the stockmarket collapsed from a peak of 39,000 in \n     December 1989 to 21,000 in September 1990. And Russia \n     defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt in August 1998, just two \n     months after borrowing it.\n       What does this mean as a practical matter? Anyone who \n     anticipates needing refinancing should do it sooner rather \n     than later. Those who wish to liquidate some of their \n     concentrated stock holdings should act now, to protect their \n     future lifestyles. Corporate strategies that are based on a \n     fast burn rate of cash, and that plan to get new money to \n     reliquefy, should modify these plans to slow the burn rate in \n     case refinancing is not easily available. And those who need \n     refinancing should cultivate venture capital sources in \n     Europe, where economic growth and an appetite for U.S. \n     venture opportunities should provide a fertile alternative to \n     a more subdued U.S. market.\n       Now I would like to turn from these dry ruminations on the \n     economy to more value-oriented thoughts on building a \n     business, based on my personal experiences as an \n     entrepreneur. Creating an enterprise for nothing should be a \n     reflection of your own values, fears, experiences, \n     intellectual insights, and sense of what is important--\n     becasue you, as the entrepreneur, must feel comfortable with \n     running it. There is no single formula, but certain \n     observations might prove applicable to your own situation.\n       Professor Bhide wrote in Harvard Business Review: ``Several \n     principles are basic for successful start-ups: get \n     operational fast * * * [and] don't try to hire the crack \n     team. * * *'' These precepts are not supported by my own \n     experience. The professor's recommendations place a huge \n     premium on the exclusivity and value of an idea, and the \n     notion that others could beat you out if you delay. These \n     beliefs are responsible for a large number of helter-skelter \n     business-launches-as-preemptive-strikes, premature \n     introductions that fail due to poor product quality, weak \n     delivery systems, inadequate customer support, or inadequate \n     internal financial controls.\n       Every shoe-shine man will freely share his ideas with you. \n     However, what counts is the implementation of an idea by a \n     quality team of people. My products were carefully crafted \n     and tested over two years, altered and risk-adjusted through \n     examining results. A crack team was put together, with the \n     first hire being Salomon's top accountant--because I wanted \n     to know the limits of my dream before I acted beyond my \n     resources, capacity, or risk profile.\n       Simply to the point: was it Prodigy's innovations, or \n     Lotus's being first in the market, that won the software \n     battle? Or was it Microsoft's better preparation for meeting \n     and servicing customers' needs that won the day? You \n     generally have one shot at the marketplace. And credibility \n     depends on predictability. Make sure everything is carefully \n     prepared in depth, no matter how long it takes, so that the \n     product and its supports work as promised. Getting started is \n     not the goal; permanency is!\n       Building many products and applications can be exciting in \n     concept, but it is difficult in terms of financial and \n     physical resources. I build my products narrowly and very \n     deeply, so that we could equal any competitor in a specialty \n     area. Editing out the many other opportunities is vital for \n     concentrating resources and talent on the very few things \n     that you can do best. Choose your product, refine it, and \n     continuously monitor it based on experience. I chose \n     specialty products that did not require muscularity of \n     distribution, capital, and related support inputs, all of \n     which favor existing large corporations. By developing a \n     few intellectually rich products at the beginning, we \n     weren't forced to compete head-on with the big boys, and \n     therefore we could get profit margins and cash flow that \n     provided fuel for further expansion.\n       I believe that many Internet retailers go into commodity-\n     oriented businesses in which price is the key determinant, \n     only to find that success means bigger losses and that old, \n     dominant players can enter internet distribution at will and \n     grab market share. Time is the most precious capital, so a \n     business should only enter growing markets with a superior \n     service or product, where decent profit margins are available \n     over a long period of time.\n       It was my experience that becoming a brand name quickly is \n     extraordinarily difficult. It requires a long period of \n     exposure and in-depth, sustained advertising. Few newcomers \n     have the necessary financial staying-power, so avoid spending \n     money on ineffectual ads. If your business strategy requires \n     you to promote the product enormously, then maybe it is the \n     wrong product choice. Remember that it is easier for GM or \n     Toys R Us to learn how to use the Internet than for you to \n     gain their brand images. And, conversely, once the \n     speculative fever recedes, why would anyone pay 9 times \n     earnings for Macy's and 1,000 times revenues for a wannabe \n     whose aspiration is to maybe become the Macy's of the Web?\n       It is also important not to gild the lily technologically. \n     Think of the customer's technical competence and how he will \n     actually use your product. My biggest recent error was \n     listening to a tech analyst who told me not to buy AOL at $26 \n     a pre-split share, because there were technically superior \n     products. The mix between technology and user friendliness is \n     vital. After all, do you use Betamax or VHS?\n       In building a business, it is crucial to put emphasis on \n     becoming an institution. I found that it takes two years for \n     a person to feel comfortable in a corporate culture, so it is \n     better to build a team in anticipation of growth than in \n     response to it. Invest early and heavily in support systems, \n     in the areas of client service, electronic information, and \n     financial controls. Let everyone know what is expected of him \n     or her through clear communication, so that employees are \n     moving in the direction of corporate goals. My company has \n     never been star-oriented, in a star-studded industry. Good \n     organization creates a whole that is more than the sum of its \n     parts.\n       Relationships are key to success, and that means knowing \n     the people in your arena. Biotech executives should know the \n     important people in the FDA, the universities, and the \n     pharmaceutical companies. And relationships should be \n     maintained for the long term. Remember, credibility equals \n     predictability; long relationships allow people to judge you \n     based on past interactions. It's too late if you only meet \n     people when you need them.\n       Personnel turnover is a significant problem today. The \n     mantra everywhere is stock options, the chance to get rich \n     quick. This leads to high turnover if a company has actual or \n     perceived problems, or, on the other hand, if it is too \n     successful and young people get rich quick. In my company, \n     which is family owned, we have low turnover. We build loyalty \n     in three important ways. First, all employees share in \n     profits; we have a flatter compensation scheme than many \n     technology companies. Second, there is justice in allocating \n     rewards over long periods of time. Our people know that we \n     have permanency; we give them a long-term horizon, with \n     expectation of growing rewards over time.\n       Third, our people feel safe. There are no politics, few \n     layoffs, and no acting out; people check their egos at the \n     door. We breed loyalty through civility. People are trained \n     and moved around the company to keep the interest level high, \n     and promotions are made internally. The culture is kept \n     strong by outsourcing and a small number of hires. And \n     finally, there is a single decision-maker; everyone has \n     input, but I make the final decision based on careful \n     research and many individual inputs. There is no ranting \n     or screaming by anyone; instead, there is a free flow of \n     ideas, tentative acceptance, and thorough investigations, \n     so that all communication moves back and forth.\n       A great business idea, or a great scientific idea, does not \n     just come about through hard work and incremental advances. \n     It is more like poetry. It is about having the imagination \n     and heart to strike out on a path that others didn't dare to \n     follow, or didn't see in its entirety. Implementation, \n     management skills, and the ability to anticipate customer \n     needs are built on a knowledge of how human beings react. \n     These types of imagination and understanding are more likely \n     to come from wellness than from frenzy. I don't subscribe to \n     the continuous-all-nighters, no-personal-life recipe for \n     success. For a super-successful entrepreneur, having broad \n     horizon--through reading fiction and biography, appreciating \n     art, and interacting socially with a variety of people--is \n     more important than working yet another Sunday.\n       But there is more at stake than business success. You want \n     to be a happy person, a good father, a community builder. I \n     find that I can only eat one tuna-fish sandwich at lunch, no \n     matter how many millions I have earned. Money can give you \n     time, and how you spend that time is key. And wise \n     expenditure of personal time on human development can also \n     help you make money, because knowledge, experience, and \n     wisdom are usually the key to the ``poetic'' business idea.\n       Young people are leaving college to make quick money, like \n     a gold rush. But life is about more than money or success or \n     technical achievement. It is critical that people see the \n     world in vibrant colors and in multiple shades. To raise \n     children, face the death of parents, appreciate beauty, even \n     make love well, people need emotional and intellectual depth. \n     These come from being exposed to the collective experience of \n     civilization, which is transmitted through books and a \n     liberal education.\n       In the scheme of your success, it will not make a \n     difference if you leave school two years early; but it could \n     alter your life greatly. Absorb the intangibles, not just \n     because they will give you the imagination to come up with \n     ``poetic'' business ideas to help you deal with customers, \n     but also because they will give meaning to the life you lead, \n     whether you succeed materially or not. After all, living life \n     well, in all its dimensions, is what it's all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8193-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8193-S8194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN APPRECIATION OF GENERAL TERRENCE DAKE'S SERVICE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my great honor to rise today to \npay tribute to a fellow Missourian who has served our Nation honorably \nfor more then three decades in war and peace. In October, General \nTerrence Dake, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps,\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nwill retire after more then 34 years of service as a Marine.\n  A native of Rocky Comfort in the Missouri Ozarks, General Dake earned \nundergraduate degrees from the College of the Ozarks and the University \nof Arkansas. From there he proceeded to Marine Corps Officer Candidate \nSchool in Quantico, VA. He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant upon \ngraduation from OCS in October 1966. With the echoes of conflict in \nSouth East Asia sounding here at home, Second Lieutenant Dake reported \ndirectly to aviator training in Pensacola, Florida. He received his \nwings designating him a Naval Aviator on the 25th of January, 1968. He \nwas tested in combat when he reported to South East Asia and piloted \nCH-53A Sea Stallion helicopters in Vietnam. Lieutenant Dake earned \nnumerous awards while accumulating over 6,000 flight hours in military \naircraft. Highlights of his extensive aviation experience include \nservice as the President's helicopter pilot and as the Commanding \nOfficer of Marine Helicopter Squadron One.\n  General Dake's distinguished career has been accompanied with a rise \nthrough the ranks, including service as the Director of Training and \nDoctrine with the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command and \nas Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations for the 3rd Marine Aircraft \nWing during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. It is significant to note \nthat this was the largest aircraft wing ever fielded in combat by the \nMarine Corps.\n  General Dake was promoted to Brigadier General in March, 1992. His \nassignments as a General Officer included service as Assistant Deputy \nChief of Staff of Aviation; Inspector General of the Marine Corps; \nDeputy Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; \nCommanding General, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing; and Deputy Chief of Staff \nfor Aviation. During his time as Deputy Chief of Staff for Aviation the \nMarine Corps embarked on its historic aviation campaign plan which has \nmanifested itself in the development of the V-22 Osprey and the Joint \nStrike Fighter.\n  General Dake assumed his present position as the Assistant Commandant \nof the Marine Corps on September 5, 1998. For his service as the \nAssistant Commandant, General Dake was awarded the Distinguished \nService Medal. General Dake also earned the ``Silver Hawk Award.'' \nPresented by the Marine Corps Aviation Association, the Silver Hawk \nAward is given to the active-duty Marine Aviator with the most senior \ndate of designation.\n  Not all of General Dake's achievements took place in aircraft or in \ncommand of major units. General Dake's commitment to his troops was \nevidenced in his efforts in tackling two of the most difficult issues \nfacing the Department of Defense today: health care and readiness. As a \nmember of the Defense Medical and Senior Readiness Oversight \nCommittees, General Dake worked to improve readiness and ensure that \nthe entire military family--active, reserve, and retiree--were provided \nquality health care.\n  Any tribute to General Dake would be inadequate without recognizing \nthe contributions of his wife and family. As with so many of our fine \nmembers of the Armed Services, his career would not be what it is today \nwere it not for their steadfast support throughout the years. Mrs. Dake \nis a recipient of the Distinguished Public Service Award, presented for \nher superior public service in support of uniformed personnel and their \nfamilies. As we pay tribute to him today we also commend and honor her \nfor her commitment and perseverance on behalf of Marines ``in every \nplace and clime.''\n  I also recognize the other members of General Dake's family. The \nDakes have two children, a daughter, Jana, and son, Joshua. Jana is \nmarried to Captain Ken Karika, USMC, and is the mother of the Dake's \ngrandchild, Jack. They too have taken part in the sacrifice required to \nbe a military family and deserve our gratitude.\n  The Marine Corps often states that there are no ex-Marines, only \nMarines who are no longer actively serving. It is comforting to know \nthat General Dake will continue to serve our nation and set an example \nfor others to follow long into the future.\n  As General and Mrs. Dake move from the active duty community to the \nretired community, it is appropriate that this body stop and honor a \nman and his family who made countless sacrifices for duty, honor, \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8194-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8194-S8195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF MONSIGNOR HENRY J. DZIADOSZ\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate Monsignor Henry J. Dziadosz, J.C.D., a beloved friend and \nrespected clergyman. Monsignor Henry was a priest for fifty-one years, \nincluding twenty-nine years as pastor at St. Bridget of Kildare Parish, \nmy home church in Moodus, Connecticut. He made numerous sacrifices for \nhis community and strove throughout his clerical live to instill a \nspirit of caring in the lives of his parishioners. At Monsignor Henry's \nretirement party several years ago, he stated, ``When I first came \nhere, I told them that the family spirit was my goal. No one should \nhave to cry alone and no one should ever laugh alone. In all the \naccomplishments, it is the creation of this spirit that I am most proud \nof.'' Everyone who know this remarkable man would agree that his \ndevotion to his parishioners has made a lasting impact on the lives he \nhas touched.\n  Monsignor Henry was destined to the priesthood from his early years. \nHe attended St. Stanislaus School as a young boy, graduated from \nMeriden High School, and enrolled in the St. Thomas Seminary, where he \nearned his associate's degree in philosophy. He continued his \ntheological studies at Catholic University of America in Washington, \nD.C., and was awarded the Basselin Scholarship. On May 26, 1949, then \nFather-Henry was ordained to the Priesthood in St. Joseph Cathedral in \nHartford and accepted an assignment as Assistant Pastor of the St. \nJoseph Parish in Norwich. Father Henry then moved to New London's Our \nLady of Perpetual Help Parish before returning to continue his studies \nat the Catholic University of America. It was his profoundly \ninquisitive nature and genuine thirst for knowledge that caused Father \nHenry to pursue a doctoral degree in 1955. He earned his degree in \nCanon Law, and was subsequently assigned to the Diocesan Chancery in \nNorwich, where he served as assistant to the chief judge of the \nDiocesan Tribunal and as the assistant chancellor. Always a bright \nstudent and quick study, Father Henry was soon appointed Officialis, or \nChief Judge, of the tribunal, and administrator of St. John's Mission \nin Fitchville. Father's Henry energy, compassion and achievement drew \nnotice from the highest levels of the Church and in 1965 Pope Paul VI \nnamed him a prelate of honor and awarded him the title of Monsignor.\n  Monsignor Henry first arrived at St. Bridget in 1969, and dedicated \nthe next twenty-nine years of his life to the service of the parish. \nSt. Bridget's landscape bears witness to the many tangible \naccomplishments Monsignor Henry has achieved, including the Lady of \nLourdes Grotto, the Religious Education Center, the Bicentennial \nPavilion, the Stained Glass Doors, the Skylights, the beautification of \nthe church grounds, and numerous other improvements. In honor of his \ndedication and commitment to St. Bridget, the education center, which \nhe was instrumental in founding, will henceforth be called the \nMonsignor Henry J. Dziadosz Religious Education Center.\n  At the Parish Mass for Monsignor Henry, Father Marek Masnicki \ndescribed a priest's duties, and expressed how Monsignor Henry was the \nepitome of what every priest strives to be. ``A priest is called to \nrespond to the poor and the broken and in this he touches the face of \nJesus Christ. We expect a great deal from our priests, and priests \nexpect a great deal from themselves. The priest makes sacrifices on \nbehalf of the community. He offers his humanity and that of the \ncommunity to Christ until he comes again. Priests take their cue from \nJesus Christ each day. All this can apply to the fifty-one years of the \npriestly ministry of Monsignor Dziadosz.''\n  Monsignor Henry was my pastor for a number of years. And while he was \nan accomplished man, a man whose priestly accomplishments were \nrecognized by the Pope, it was his compassion and humanity that made \nhim a truly remarkable shepherd for his flock, a flock of which I feel \ndeeply fortunate to have been a part.\n  There isn't a doctorate for ministering day in and day out to the \nspiritual needs of a community. There isn't\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\na grand award for caring deeply about one's neighbors. But you will \nfind that we often have a name for people who conduct themselves in \nthese ways: priest, rabbi, sheik or monk. These people dedicate \nthemselves to the service of God, and in doing so provide an example \nfor the rest of us to follow. Monsignor Henry was a wonderful priest \nand he took joy in the simple daily rituals of that life. He was dearly \nloved by the people of his parish and he will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8195-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF LANNY FRATTARE FOR HIS 25 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE \n                           PITTSBURGH PIRATES\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes of Senate business to recognize a man who I hold in the highest \nregard, Mr. Lanny Frattare. Mr. Frattare has been a tremendous figure \nand icon to the people of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has contributed \nenergy and timeless hours to the Pittsburgh community through his \ninvolvement with the Pirates, the Parent and Child Guidance Center, the \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation, Goodwill Industries, and Bob Prince \nCharities.\n  Lanny Frattare is celebrating his twenty-fifth year as ``The Voice of \nthe Pirates,'' announcing more than 3,500 games. Only Bob Prince has \ndescribed the action of Pirate baseball longer, 28 years. Mr. Frattare \nwas even gracious enough to let me join him in the announcer's box for \nseveral games over the years, which was definitely one of my greatest \nthrills as a Pittsburgher.\n  A native of Rochester, New York, Frattare received has bachelor's \ndegree in communications from Ithaca College in 1970. His baseball \nbroadcasting career began in 1968 with the Geneva Senators, a Class A \nteam in New York. Frattare's association with the Pirates organization \nbegan in 1974 and 1975 when he broadcast games for the Triple-A West \nVirginia team, the Charleston Charlies. He was also a radio DJ and \nSports Director at WBBF in Rochester before joining the Pirates in \n1976.\n  ``There was no doubt about it''--Lanny Frattare continues to make \nsignificant impact on his listeners and on the history of the \nPittsburgh Pirates. I feel privileged to know him and see the \ncontributions he's made to the Pittsburgh community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8195-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/07/senate-section/article/S8195-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2302.

To make technical amendments concerning contracts affecting \ncertain Indian tribes in Oklahoma, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  legislation concerning contracts affecting certain indian tribes in \n                                oklahoma\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation which will remedy a long outdated statute which impedes \neconomic development for the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma. For \nyears tribes have been required to seek approval by the Secretary of \nthe Interior before they may engage in contracts. Section 81, as it is \nknown, provides that a contract `relating to Indian lands' is not valid \nunless it is approved by the Secretary. This statute was enacted with \ngood intentions but unfortunately has outgrown its usefulness. Today \nthis provision constitutes a confusing legal obstacle for tribal \ndevelopment.\n  Early last year, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell introduced \ncomprehensive legislation to address the current problems associated \nwith this statute. That legislation has passed the Senate and now \nawaits action before the House. However, the Five Tribes have often \nbeen treated with separate statutes unique to eastern Oklahoma. The \nlegislation I propose simply corrects a technical oversight which \naffects only the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma which is commonly \nreferred to as Section 82a. Without this correction, the Five Civilized \nTribes of Oklahoma would be the only tribes in the nation which may \nstill be required to seek Secretarial approval for these contracts. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in correcting this oversight.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 3015. A bill to grant the consent of Congress to the Kansas and \nMissouri Metropolitan Culture District Compact; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n The Kansas and Missouri Metropolitan Cultural District Compact Act of \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to \ngrant the consent of Congress to the Kansas and Missouri Metropolitan \nCultural District Compact.\n  This bill would allow the people in 2002, or after, to consider \nadditional projects which contribute or enhance the aesthetic, \nartistic, historical, intellectual of social development or \nappreciation of members of the general public. This definition has been \nexpanded to include sports facilities. This compact has made the \nrestoration of Kansas City's Union Station possible.\n  The original enabling legislation, which passed in 1994 established a \nbi-state cultural district for the Kansas City metropolitan area of \nfive counties in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas. This provides a \nsecure source of local funding for metropolitan cooperation across \nstate lines to restore historic structures and cultural facilities. The \nFederal authority for this bi-state compact expires at the end of 2001. \nWe must see to it that a new compact is approved to continue this \nsuccessful venture.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does not cost the Federal government \nany money. It is funded through a \\1/8\\ sales tax, passed by the voters \nof Jackson, Johnson, Clay and Platte counties, and merely needs Federal \napproval. This measure is a perfect example of the appropriate \nrelationship between the Federal government and the states. This \napproval would allow these local communities to make decisions on how--\nand whether--their tax dollars are to be spent on cultural activities.\n  This bill has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The \ncompanion legislation, HR 4700, passed the House Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote and the full House also by voice vote. It is supported by \nthe Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, the Mid-American Regional \nCouncil, the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce, Kansas City Area \nDevelopment Council, Johnson County President's Council, Labor-\nManagement Council of Greater Kansas City, Jackson County Executive, \nKansas Governor Bill Graves, and Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Campbell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Lott, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Frist, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Grams):\n\n\n                 MEDICARE TEMPORARY DRUG ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, for the past two years, the Finance \nCommittee has been working on comprehensive Medicare reform--reform \nintended both to modernize the Medicare benefit package, which would \ninclude the creation of an outpatient prescription drug benefit, and to \nprotect the long-term solvency of the program. The Committee has held \n15 hearings on many different aspects of Medicare reform. We have \nlistened to testimony from scores of witnesses.\n  And we appreciate how important, but also how complex an undertaking \nMedicare reform is, as what we do will affect 40 million Americans who \nrely on the program.\n  Working closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this July \nI introduced an ambitious Medicare plan that took the best ideas from \nRepublicans and Democrats--a plan that would achieve the modern reforms \nwe all seek. I am committed to adding a comprehensive prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare program, coupled with other major reforms that \nare badly needed.\n  The plan that I have been working on includes not only comprehensive \ndrug coverage added to the basic Medicare benefit package, but \nimprovements to hospital and other benefits, low-income beneficiary \nprotections, access to medical technologies, private sector drug \nbenefit management, improvements to Medicare's long-term solvency and a \nstrengthened Medicare+Choice Program.\n  I have been working for several months to refine my bill and to get \nthe finalized estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that are \nnecessary to advance any major piece of legislation in the Congress. \nThese steps are also essential to make sure that the program is kept \naffordable for beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I intend shortly to \nshare the latest information with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee.\n  It is my intention to continue to work aggressively with my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee--as well as with all members of \nthis body--to build on my initiative introduced in July and to move \nahead with successful bipartisan reform. I appreciate the strong \ninterest and support our agenda for reform is receiving from both sides \nof the aisle.\n  However, there are real reasons why we don't yet have agreement on \nMedicare. Program reform efforts are enormously complex. In no small \npart because Medicare is such an important part of our social fabric. \nWe must work through extraordinarily diverse views on the proper role \nof government, how best to achieve affordability for beneficiaries and \ntaxpayers--all while ensuring stability and continuity in the program.\n  In view of the fact that at this time there is no clear consensus on \ncomprehensive reform, and that even if there were, such reform would \ntake two or three years to implement, I am today introducing \nlegislation that will help us see that low-income beneficiaries are not \ndenied prescription drug coverage while we continue to move forward \nwith long-term reform.\n  I call this legislation the Medicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, \nand it actually includes two versions--one that meets current budget \nguidelines and will only require a simple majority for passage, and a \nsecond version that is larger, covers more beneficiaries, but exceeds \nbudget guidelines and will thus require a sixty-vote majority.\n  I call this initiative the Medicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, \nbecause that's exactly what it is. This effort is not to be mistaken \nwith the lasting, comprehensive Medicare reform that we will continue \nto aggressively pursue--a reform effort that will build on our more \ncomprehensive plan offered in July. What this temporary legislation \noffers is an assurance to low-income seniors that they will be able to \nreceive the help they need while Congress completes the larger task of \noverhauling the Medicare program.\n  It's an assurance that their immediate needs will not be put on hold \nas we deliberate and debate the complex intricacies of long-term \nMedicare reform.\n  In testimony before our committee, the AARP repeatedly reminded us \nhow\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nimportant it is that we proceed carefully with long-term reform. AARP \nalso told our Committee that a program aiding low-income beneficiaries \ncould be achieved in a shorter time frame. I agree with their \nassessment and support the goal of providing immediate help to low-\nincome beneficiaries.\n  And this is what my legislation will do--it allows us to continue the \nintricate work of long-term reform without forcing Americans to dilute \ntheir prescription dosages or to choose between prescription drugs and \nfood.\n  It is my hope--as I believe there is sufficient bipartisan consensus \non the subject of prescription drug coverage--that we can come together \nto pass this legislation. Like I've said, the first version of this \nbill requires only a simple majority. It has been designed to fit \nwithin current budget restrictions.\n  Having my preference, Mr. President, I would like to see us pass the \nbroader version that will require sixty votes, as it will offer more \nextensive coverage. But either way, these bills--once enacted--will \nimplement a temporary, state-based, program to provide low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage outside the \nMedicare program.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of misunderstandings \nthat appear to surround this. First of all, I have heard concerns \nraised that this legislation depends on the appropriations process for \nfunding. This is wrong; they do not. Just like the State Children \nHealth Insurance Program, funding is mandatory under the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  Second, I know that some have tried to attach a welfare stigma to the \nnew program. Let me be clear: prescription drug coverage is not \nwelfare, it is common sense. Frankly, I am surprised that there are \nthose who would imply otherwise, because for years, we have worked to \nde-stigmatize important programs such as Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  The legislation I'm introducing is modeled on the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program--a solution designed to extend drug coverage \nto lower-income Medicare beneficiaries--beneficiaries with incomes \nbelow 150 percent of the poverty, and those with the highest out-of-\npocket drug costs. If we have sufficient support to pass the more \ngenerous measure, we can cover beneficiaries up to 175 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  State participation in the new program would be optional, as it is \nunder SCHIP. According to the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, 22 states have passed some type of pharmacy assistance \nlaw. Senior Pharmacy Assistance Programs currently are in place in 16 \nstates, and another five states have passed laws to create such \nprograms. Many of these states will likely opt to immediately \nparticipate in the new program--receiving federal funds to allow them \nto quickly expand their programs to provide drug benefits to even more \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Eligible beneficiaries living in states that choose not to \nparticipate in the new program would receive coverage through a fall-\nback option administered by the Health Care Financing Administration. \nHCFA would contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to provide these \nbeneficiaries with a drug benefit comparable to that offered to all \nFederal employees through the Blue Cross Standard Option plan.\n  Under either scenario, beneficiaries will receive immediate \nassistance. They will not have to wait, they will not have to wonder, \nand most importantly they will not have to worry about what happens in \nWashington.\n  Again, Mr. President, this effort is not to be mistaken with the \nlasting, comprehensive Medicare reform that we must continue to pursue. \nIt is best seen as a bridge--a bridge that will provide a low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries with prescription drugs--a bridge that the \nWashington Post acknowledged just today would be of material value to \nlower-income individuals while we continue our work on long-term, \nbipartisan reform.\n  I will continue to work in the Finance Committee toward long-term \nMedicare reform--reform which will include a comprehensive outpatient \nprescription drug benefit. If we can't pass such a package this year, \nwe will resume our efforts on the first day of the next session, and we \nwill not stop until we get the job done. But low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries should not have to wait for comprehensive reform to be \nenacted in order to receive prescription drug benefits.\n  This legislation will provide prescription drug coverage and peace of \nmind while Congress continues to work on the larger reform package. \nPassing it will certainly not obviate the need, nor diminish the \npressing objective that we will have to achieve Medicare reform. There \nis no argument on either side of the aisle that long-term reform is not \nnecessary. But in the interim, we should also take this step.\n  Then when we get the long-term reform initiative passed--when \ncomprehensive reform is enacted--this interim step will automatically \nbe repealed. In that way, it will not replace or compete with reform. \nBut it will provide valuable protection for many. Full enactment of \nthis legislation will ensure that 82 percent of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries will have prescription drug coverage, through the new \nprogram and through other sources of coverage. If Congress votes for \nincreased coverage, 85 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries would have \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me on this important \nissue. Our many successes in advancing the Medicare program these last \nthree years have been achieved through cooperation from both sides of \nthe aisle. We have seen what we can do when we move forward on those \nissues where we have a consensus. Now, let's join together to take this \nstep, as well. Let's implement a principle on which I believe we all \nagree--helping our neediest Medicare beneficiaries pay for their \nprescription drugs. Toward achieving this important objective, there is \nno legitimate reason to delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill I am introducing \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am announcing my support for the \nMedicare Temporary Drug Assistance Act, introduced by Senator Roth. The \nAct will immediately provide funding for prescription drugs for \nMedicare beneficiaries who are having difficulty paying for the \nmedicines that they need to live longer, happier lives.\n  Mr. President, we all know that as the baby boomers become eligible \nfor Medicare the program needs to be reformed due to the increased \npopulation. As a part of Medicare reform, we must have a broad \nprescription drug benefit that ensures that all Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to affordable medications. It doesn't make any sense for \nMedicare to pay for the cost of hospital stays, but not cover the drugs \nthat can keep patients out of the hospital. The best medicines in the \nworld will not help a patient who can't afford to take them. That is \nwhy I will continue to do all that I can, as the Chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and member of the \nFinance Committee, to assure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to \naffordable prescription drugs this year.\n  Today Chairman Roth has introduced two bills--one version that stays \nwithin the Budget Resolution, and one that exceeds our budget \nrestraints--and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, because I am convinced that it will immediately help \nmillions of Americans who need but can't afford their medications. My \nown state of Vermont, which has already acted responsibly by extending \nprescription drug coverage to many low-income seniors through the \nVermont Health Access Plan and the Vscript pharmacy program, will be \nrewarded with millions of federal dollars to extend its coverage to \neven larger numbers of Medicare beneficiaries. Under this bill, federal \ndollars will begin paying for prescription drugs for Vermonters on \nOctober 1 of this year--that's only about three weeks from now.\n  Mr. President, I commend Chairman Roth for his outstanding leadership \non this issue. Chairman Roth has worked tirelessly with me and the \nother members of the Finance Committee, clearly demonstrating that he \nsupports Medicare reform, including coverage of prescription drugs, and \nthat he believes that this can only be achieved through a bipartisan \nprocess. I have strongly supported his efforts to build a bipartisan \nconsensus on this issue through the Committee process.\n  Several weeks ago, Chairman Roth acknowledged the difficulty in \nfinding a bipartisan consensus during this election year, and announced \nthat if the Finance Committee is unable to report out a bipartisan \nMedicare reform bill, he would propose a plan to cover prescription \ndrugs for the most needy Medicare beneficiaries, through grants to the \nstates, as a stop-gap measure until Congress is able to pass larger-\nscale Medicare reform. He also acknowledged that even if we were able \nto enact a prescription drug benefit this year, it would be almost \nimpossible to implement such a plan for at least two years. The bill he \nhas introduced today addresses both of these problems.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. This proposal is a stop-gap measure \nthat will be put into place only until we are able to achieve broad \nMedicare reform, including prescription drug coverage that benefits all \nMedicare beneficiaries. This is not a substitute for Medicare reform, \nand it does not mean that we have given up on enacting Medicare reform \nthis year. We must also attack the problem of affordability by passing \nmy bill, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (S. 2520), which \nalready passed the Senate by a vote of 74-21 as a part of the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. These efforts will be undertaken \nsimultaneously. I consider this bill to be emergency aid for \nprescription drugs that will be the bridge to a comprehensive plan. It \nis a very important down payment that will benefit Vermonters and all \nAmericans immediately. That is why I am an original cosponsor of \nChairman Roth's proposal, I urge my colleagues support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Campbell, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 3017.

A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act with \nrespect to municipal deposits.\n\n\n           MUNICIPAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator \nJohnson to introduce ``The Municipal Deposit Insurance Protection Act \nof 2000.'' This legislation provides municipal deposits with one-\nhundred percent federal deposit insurance coverage by the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The lack of one-hundred percent \ncoverage for municipal deposits has stifled the ability of community \nbanks to invest in local families and businesses. By providing this \nmuch-needed coverage, this legislation ensures that local banks have \nthe resources they need to grow their communities.\n  Municipal deposits are taxpayer funds deposited by state and local \ngovernments, school districts, water authorities and other public \nentities. Due to the fact that the FDIC does not provide insurance \ncoverage to municipal deposits, many states require banks to provide \ncollateral for municipal deposits. Full deposit insurance coverage of \nmunicipal deposits could free up bank resources currently used for \ncollateral. These resources could be used to keep local public funds at \nwork in the communities in which they are generated.\n  Moreover, FDIC coverage helps build consumer confidence in their bank \nand helps attract the core deposits that are needed for community \nlending and a bank's survival. Without FDIC coverage, many independent, \nlocal banks are losing substantial deposits to large, corporate banks \nbecause of the perception that larger banks are safer. Providing \nmunicipal deposits with complete insurance coverage will strengthen \ncommunity banks by placing these banks in a more competitive position \nto attract municipal deposits. Our nation's independently-operated \nbanks are a valued part of our communities. It is important that these \nbanks are able to maintain their competitiveness and continue providing \ntheir communities with their characteristic attention to customer \nservice and investments in local farms and small businesses.\n  Finally, numerous taxpayers may be at risk municipal funds are placed \nin a failed bank. Recently, a bank failure in Carlisle, Iowa resulted \nin the loss of nearly $12 million in uninsured municipal deposits. Even \nthough the state of Iowa has a fund that guarantees the deposits of \nstate and local governments, there was an $8.4 billion shortfall in the \nfund. Consequently, this shortfall in funds will have to be made up by \nother Iowa banks.\n  This is why Senator's Johnson and I are introducing ``The Municipal \nDeposit Insurance Protection Act of 2000.'' The legislation will \nprovide one-hundred percent coverage for municipal deposits will free \nup bank resources currently used as collateral, enable local, \nindependent banks to attract municipal deposits, and will protect \nmunicipal taxpayers from losing uninsured public money. Senator Johnson \nand I look forward to working with our colleagues on this much-need \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3019. A bill to clarify the Federal relationship to the Shawnee \nTribe as a distinct Indian tribe, to clarify the status of the members \nof the Shawnee Tribe, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n                    SHAWNEE TRIBE STATUS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will modify \nthe relationship between the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma and the \nShawnee Tribe in Oklahoma. These two tribes were joined together by an \nAgreement entered into between them on June 7, 1869. This bill will \nallow the Shawnee Tribe to have an independent government, elect its \nown officials and do those things it believes necessary to protect its \nlanguage, culture and traditions. Since the two tribes will continue to \noperate in the same territory, the bill sets forth the conditions which \nshall govern those operations.\n  This legislation will have the effect of modifying the Cherokee-\nShawnee agreement by allowing the Shawnee tribe to operate \nindependently of the Cherokee Nation. The Shawnee Tribe will be \ngoverned by a separate constitution currently in existence. Membership \nof Shawnee Indians will continue to be permitted within the Cherokee \nNation, although Shawnee Indians who so elect will become members of \nthe Shawnee Tribe exclusively.\n  The bill also sets forth the manner in which the Shawnee Tribe will \nconduct its business within the Cherokee Nation and both Tribes have \nconcurred in this legislation through tribal resolutions of their \nrespective governing bodies. Although the Shawnee Tribe will be \noperating within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation, \nthe Shawnee people believe it is in their best interest to have a \nseparate tribal governance to protect and enhance their culture, \nlanguage and history and to pursue the goal of self-sufficiency for \ntheir own Tribe.\n  It is important to note that in changing the agreement between these \ntwo tribes there is no new tribal territory created nor is it proposed \nthat any additional land be taken into trust for either Tribe as a \nresult of the changes. The jurisdictional area of the tribes remains as \nbefore so that there are no impacts on communities within the Cherokee \nNation. The proposal is also revenue neutral as to the United States. \nTribal members of either tribe now receiving services will continue to \nreceive those services as they have in the past.\n  The Shawnee Tribe was never terminated nor can the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs cause the Tribes to be separated through the Federal \nAcknowledgment Process. The Agreement of 1869 between the two tribes \nwas ratified by the President and can only be amended by this proposed \naction of Congress.\n  In summary, this bill would recognize the long standing policy of the \nUnited States to respect the sovereignty of every tribe and to respect \nthe desire of the Shawnee people to be governed independently of the \nCherokee Nation so that Shawnee people can identify with their own \nTribe and work to maintain their culture, language, heritage and \ntraditions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Gregg, and \n        Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 3020. A bill to require the Federal Communications Commission to \nrevise its regulations authorizing the operation of new, low-power FM \nradio stations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n              radio broadcasting preservation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the ongoing dispute between advocates of low power FM radio and \nfull power FM radio broadcasters. I am pleased to be joined in this \nbipartisan effort by Senators Baucus, Inhofe, Gregg, and Hutchison. Our \nlegislation, the ``Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000,'' was \noverwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on April 13th by \na vote of 274-110.\n  On January 20th, the Federal Communications Commission narrowly \nadopted a proposal that would establish a new radio service known as \nlow power FM radio (LPFM). Under this program, the Commission would \nlicense hundreds of new low power FM\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nradio stations in two classes. The new service would license stations \nwith a maximum power level of 10 watts that would reach an area with a \nradius of between 1 and 2 miles, and a second class of stations with a \nmaximum power level of 100 watts that would reach an area with a radius \nof three and a half miles. Although the commission adopted first- and \nsecond-adjacent channel interference protections as part of its \nrulemaking, it chose to allow LPFM stations to be licensed on third-\nadjacent channels. The FCC began accepting applications for this new \nservice on May 30th.\n  Over the last several months, I have carefully listened to \nMinnesotans who care deeply about the issues involved in the debate \nover LPFM. In the absence of third-adjacent channel protection, \nincumbent FM broadcasters believe that low power FM radio stations \nwould cause interference to existing radio services. LPFM advocates \nargue that the Federal Communications Commission has conducted adequate \ntesting for interference and that requiring third adjacent channel \nprotections would unnecessarily limit the number of licensed low power \nFM radio stations. Further, they suggest that the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act has resulted in unprecedented concentration \nwithin the telecommunications industry.\n  Although I have many concerns about the impact of LPFM service upon \ncurrent FM radio broadcasting, I share the commission's stated goal of \nincreasing diversity in radio and television broadcasting. Earlier this \nCongress, I supported the enactment of the Community Broadcasters Act, \nwhich preserves the unique community television broadcasting provided \nby low power television stations that are operated by diverse groups \nsuch as high schools, churches, local government and individual \ncitizens. I also look forward to reviewing the findings and \nrecommendations from the ongoing survey of minority broadcast owners \nbeing conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration that will be used to analyze the impact of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act upon minority broadcast ownership in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I am also very mindful of the concerns about LPFM \nraised by radio reading service programs. In my home state, the State \nServices for the Blind sponsors the ``Radio Talking Book'' program. \nRadio Talking Book is a closed-circuit broadcast system which uses FM \nsubcarrier frequencies from radio stations in Minnesota and South \nDakota to deliver readings from newspapers, magazines and books on a \ndaily basis to more than 10,000 blind and visually impaired persons. \nSub-carrier signals are the most vulnerable to low power FM radio \ninterference because they are located at the outer edge of the \nfrequency space.\n\n  I am troubled by the Federal Communications Commission's decision to \nadopt LPFM without conducting field testing of subcarrier receivers. \nNearly eight months after the Commission approved LPFM, engineering \nstudies and field testing of these receivers have not yet been \ncompleted by the Commission, and it remains unclear as to how the FCC \nintends to address interference that may be caused to radio reading \nservices. The agency's inaction underscores the haste in which the LPFM \nplan was developed and gives credence to the view that the adoption of \nthe FCC rules was a rush to judgment. I ask unanimous consent that \nletters from Minnesota Public Radio, the Minnesota State Services for \nthe Blind and the International Association of Audio Information \nServices be inserted into the Record at this time.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to introduce the ``Radio Broadcasting \nPreservation Act of 2000.'' I believe this legislation represents the \ninterests of LPFM advocates, full power FM broadcasters, and most \nimportantly--radio listeners. This compromise bill will allow the \nFederal Communications Commission to license lower power FM radio \nstations while requiring additional third adjacent channel protections \nfor full power FM broadcasters.\n  Among its other provisions, the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act \nof 2000 would require that an independent party conduct testing in nine \nFM radio markets to determine whether LPFM without third adjacent \nchannel protections would cause harmful interference to existing FM \nradio services. The legislation would require the FCC to submit a \nreport to Congress which analyzes the experimental test program \nresults; and evaluates the impact of LPFM on listening audiences, \nincumbent FM radio broadcasters, minority and small market \nbroadcasters, and radio stations that provide radio reading services to \nthe blind.\n  Mr. President, some advocates of the low power FM plan adopted by the \nCommission argue that the Congress should simply allow the agency to \nmove forward on LPFM without any input or modifications from Congress. \nThose individuals apparently favor granting legislative authority to \nfederal regulatory agencies. Since the establishment of the Federal \nCommunications Commission through an Act of Congress in 1934, members \nof the House and Senate have consistently exercised appropriate \noversight of FCC rules and proposals.\n  As a member of the Senate, I have carefully monitored the \nCommission's activities to ensure responsible public policy and the \nwisest use of taxpayer dollars. Over the last few years, I have \nexpressed my concern over a number of issues considered by the \nCommission, including satellite television, rights-of-way management, \nuniversal service, the impact of digital television rules upon low \npower television and translator stations, and most recently low power \nFM radio. Congress should not abdicate its oversight responsibilities \nwhen considering the LPFM issue.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that the ``Radio Broadcasting \nPreservation Act of 2000'' will strengthen community broadcasting \nwithout sacrificing existing radio services. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of this bill and additional material be printed in \nthe Record and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n                                S. 3020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Broadcasting \n     Preservation Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO LOW-POWER FM REGULATIONS REQUIRED.\n\n       (a) Third-Adjacent Channel Protections Required.--\n       (1) Modifications required.--The Federal Communications \n     Commission shall modify the rules authorizing the operation \n     of low-power FM radio stations, as proposed in MM Docket No. \n     99-25, to--\n       (A) prescribe minimum distance separations for third-\n     adjacent channels (as well as for co-channels and first- and \n     second-adjacent channels); and\n       (B) prohibit any applicant from obtaining a low-power FM \n     license if the applicant has engaged in any manner in the \n     unlicensed operation of any station in violation of section \n     301 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301).\n       (2) Congressional authority required for further changes.--\n     The Federal Communications Commission may not--\n       (A) eliminate or reduce the minimum distance separations \n     for third-adjacent channels required by paragraph (1)(A); or\n       (B) extend the eligibility for application for low-power FM \n     stations beyond the organizations and entities as proposed in \n     MM Docket No. 99-25 (47 CFR 73.853),\n     except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress enacted \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Validity of prior actions.--Any license that was issued \n     by the Commission to a low-power FM station prior to the date \n     on which the Commission modify its rules as required by \n     paragraph (1) and that does not comply with such \n     modifications shall be invalid.\n       (b) Further Evaluation of Need for Third-Adjacent Channel \n     Protections.--\n       (1) Pilot program required.--The Federal Communications \n     Commission shall conduct an experimental program to test \n     whether low-power FM radio stations will result in harmful \n     interference to existing FM radio stations if such stations \n     are not subject to the minimum distance separations for \n     third-adjacent channels required by subsection (a). The \n     Commission shall conduct such test in no more than nine FM \n     radio markets, including urban, suburban, and rural markets, \n     by waiving the minimum distance separations for third-\n     adjacent channels for the stations that are the subject of \n     the experimental program. At least one of the stations shall \n     be selected for the purpose of evaluating whether minimum \n     distance separations for third-adjacent channels are needed \n     for FM translator stations. The Commission may, consistent \n     with the public interest, continue after the conclusion of \n     the experimental program to waive the minimum distance \n     separations for third-adjacent channels for the stations that \n     are the subject of the experimental program.\n       (2) Conduct of testing.--The Commission shall select an \n     independent testing entity to\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\n     conduct field tests in the markets of the stations in the \n     experimental program under paragraph (1). Such field tests \n     shall include--\n       (A) an opportunity for the public to comment on \n     interference; and\n       (B) independent audience listening tests to determine what \n     is objectionable and harmful interference to the average \n     radio listener.\n       (3) Report to congress.--The Commission shall publish the \n     results of the experimental program and field tests and \n     afford an opportunity for the public to comment on such \n     results. The Federal Communications Commission shall submit a \n     report on the experimental program and field tests to the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate not later than February 1, 2001. Such report shall \n     include--\n       (A) an analysis of the experimental program and field tests \n     and of the public comment received by the Commission;\n       (B) an evaluation of the impact of the modification or \n     elimination of minimum distance separations for third-\n     adjacent channels on--\n       (i) listening audiences;\n       (ii) incumbent FM radio broadcasters in general, and on \n     minority and small market broadcasters in particular, \n     including an analysis of the economic impact on such \n     broadcasters;\n       (iii) the transition to digital radio for terrestrial radio \n     broadcasters;\n       (iv) stations that provide a reading service for the blind \n     to the public; and\n       (v) FM radio translator stations;\n       (C) the Commission's recommendations to the Congress to \n     reduce or eliminate the minimum distance separations for \n     third-adjacent channels required by subsection (a); and\n       (D) such other information and recommendations as the \n     Commission considers appropriate.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Communication Center,\n\n\n                                 State Services for the Blind,\n\n                                  St. Paul, MN, February 11, 2000.\n       To Whom It May Concern: The Communication Center of \n     Minnesota State Services for the Blind, SSB, has provided \n     blind and visually impaired persons with access to the \n     printed word since 1953. The most popular and well-known way \n     we provide our customers with this access is via the Radio \n     Talking Book, RTB. The RTB is a closed-circuit broadcast \n     system which uses FM sub-carriers, or SCA's, to bring people \n     readings from newspapers, magazines and books, 24 hours a \n     day, seven days a week. We loan our customers special SCA \n     receivers, which only pick up the RTB signal.\n       The RTB, this nation's oldest and largest radio reading \n     service for the blind, was founded in 1969 and has over \n     10,000 users in Minnesota alone. It is also picked up by \n     other radio reading services around the country, for \n     rebroadcast, via satellite.\n       We rely on the SCA frequencies of approximately 40 radio \n     stations in Minnesota and South Dakota, to distribute our \n     programming to local listeners. Approximately 20 stations \n     used by us are operated by Minnesota Public Radio, MPR. \n     Further, the MPR stations we use are our main outlets. The \n     other stations we use are smaller and/or cover sparsely \n     populated areas. Consequently, the Radio Talking Book lives \n     and dies via the technical integrity and success of MPR.\n       While we support the principles of diversity and community \n     access for all, we cannot support these goals at the expense \n     of existing services. As you know, the Federal Communications \n     Commission, FCC, intends to create at least 1000 low-power FM \n     stations across the country. However, it is my understanding \n     that they have not tested the effects and implications of \n     these new services on existing FM SCA signals. This does not \n     seem right to us. Prior to authorizing a new set of services, \n     it seems to us, that you should know all the implications to \n     existing services.\n       Since the sub-carrier signal of an FM station is located on \n     the outside edge of its frequency space, it seems logical to \n     us that these are the signals which will receive the first, \n     and most harmful interference from new, untested signals. We \n     strongly urge the FCC to do more testing prior to proceeding \n     with the creation of new low-power FM services. Further, it \n     seems even more advisable to use to not create such a new \n     service at all prior to making long-term decisions about \n     digital broadcasting. The FCC may be creating a new service \n     that will be obsolete in a few years.\n       While we understand that the FCC must respond to a variety \n     of constituencies, their decision which doesn't adequately \n     consider the needs of SCA users, the majority of whom are \n     users of radio reading services, seems to be highly \n     disrespectful to blind and visually impaired persons. We urge \n     the FCC to reconsider its low-power FM policy. Thank you very \n     much for your consideration of our concerns.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                    David Andrews,\n     Director, Communication Center.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Minnesota Public Radio,\n\n                                  St. Paul, MN, September 6, 2000.\n     Senator Rod Grams,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Minnesota Public Radio supports your \n     efforts to protect high quality signal integrity for \n     America's radio listening public. Recent action by the \n     Federal Communications Commission will cause harm to the \n     broadcast signal of existing stations and interfere with \n     their ability to serve their listeners. Your legislation, a \n     bipartisan compromise, will protect the rights of the \n     listening public to receive the highest quality signal \n     available.\n       In addition to protecting the general listening public, \n     your legislation will protect a particularly vulnerable \n     segment of the radio listening public, the blind and visually \n     impaired.\n       More than 1 million blind and visually impaired people in \n     the United States are served by the joint efforts of radio \n     reading services and public radio stations. This service is \n     now threatened by a well meaning but highly politicized \n     action of the FCC.\n       Started in Minnesota in 1969 as Radio Talking Book (RTB) by \n     the joint effort of Minnesota Public Radio and the Minnesota \n     Services for the Blind, radio reading services have grown to \n     more than 100 locally controlled and operated reading \n     services around the country. They bring newspapers, magazines \n     and books into the lives of those who can't see by the use of \n     an FM radio subcarrier, or SCA. The SCA uses a sliver of the \n     FM signal, and basically ``piggybacks'' onto the regular FM \n     frequency. Reading service customers receive a special radio \n     receiver, which picks up only the SCA broadcast.\n       The FCC in January approved rules to add more local public \n     service broadcasting to America's airwaves. Unfortunately, it \n     rescinded decades-old protections given existing broadcasters \n     and the listening public. The removal of those protections \n     will, most certainly, cause interference to the broadcast \n     signal that are currently being delivered by the nation's \n     radio reading services.\n       Many in this country, including Minnesota Public Radio, \n     support the goal of licensing more locally owned low-power FM \n     stations. They would be a welcome addition to the voices and \n     opinions heard on the air. However, when government deals \n     with trying to solve problems, it should learn from the \n     medical profession's Hippocratic Oath: First do no harm. Your \n     legislation helps solve the problem of additional voices and \n     does no harm to America's general listening public and \n     specifically the services of Radio Reading Services.\n       Attached is an Opinion piece from the Fergus Falls Daily \n     Journal as well as a letter in opposition to the FCC decision \n     by the Minnesota Services for the Blind.\n       Congratulations to taking on this important issue for the \n     benefit of the people of Minnesota.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Will Haddeland,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                   Audio Information Services,\n\n                                     Pittsburgh, PA, May 20, 2000.\n     Senator Rod Grams,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: We are writing to ask for your help in \n     the urgent matter of Low Power FM service that is being \n     rushed into place by the FCC. There are millions of Americans \n     that may be dramatically and negatively impacted by these new \n     stations. They are blind, visually impaired, or have a \n     disability that prevents them from reading. Our association \n     members serve them with reading services on the radio, and \n     other print-to-audio services.\n       A reading service on the radio is the daily newspaper for \n     these men and women. It's where they learn what is on sale at \n     the local grocery store, what bus stops have changed in their \n     town, and who passed away. Without this valuable link to \n     their community, they are at grave risk of being isolated and \n     become very dependent.\n       Our association of these reading services, IAAIS, has asked \n     the FCC to ensure that reading services for the blind not \n     suffer interference from the coming new Low Power FM \n     stations. IAAIS is very concerned that the fragile sub-\n     carrier services will not be heard clearly when a low power \n     FM station is allowed in the 2nd adjacent space on the FM \n     dial. The radios we have to use to give blind listeners \n     access to the signals have very fragile reception \n     characteristics. The FCC's plan for low power stations brings \n     a potential of interference that never existed before.\n       We've taken radios from our members and supplied them to \n     the FCC for testing. These are the same special radios blind \n     listeners must use to hear the services. This entire class of \n     radio was not tested before the FCC authorized LPFM--so no \n     one knows if an LPFM station will impair the blind listeners \n     ability to hear their reading service. That's what really \n     concerns us.\n       The FCC does not know if Low Power stations will harm our \n     services, yet it is proceeding with the plans for \n     implementation. We think that's wrong and have asked them to \n     wait until the tests are done. In spite of our request and \n     others' at the end of this month, the FCC plans to begin the \n     application process to create Low Power stations. There need \n     be no rush. We think the FCC should at least wait for the \n     results of receiver tests before starting something that \n     might have devastating consequences.\n       We've also asked the FCC for a description of the procedure \n     they will use to resolve interference that occurs after Low \n     Power FM is implemented. They have given no indication that \n     they have such a procedure. We find this alarming to say the \n     least.\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\n       For all these reasons, we've endorsed the measures outlined \n     in the compromise legislation passed by the House in April, \n     HR3439. With the slow down in implementation and test roll-\n     out of low power sites that the bill affords, we feel there \n     will be a better chance that Low Power FM can be implemented \n     without damage to reading services for the blind.\n       We hope you'll help by supporting a Senate measure that \n     will echo the intentions of House Bill 3439. The Bill will \n     buy time while tests are completed. These test results, and \n     the procedure for resolving problems must be published before \n     adding new radio stations. It would help to ensure that the \n     listeners to reading services do not suffer the loss of their \n     ability to read a newspaper . . . for the second time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David W. Noble,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dodd, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 3021. A bill to provide that a certification of the cooperation of \nMexico with United States counterdrug efforts not be required in fiscal \nyear 2001 for the limitation on assistance for Mexico under section 490 \nof the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not to go into effect in that \nfiscal year.\n\n\n                   mexican decertification moratorium\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. I submit \nthis bill on behalf of myself, Senator Domenici, Senator Dodd, and \nSenator Feinstein.\n  The purpose of the bill is to put a 1-year moratorium on the \ndecertification process for Mexico as it relates to the illegal drug \ntrafficking issue that we have been dealing with for so long. The \nreason we are introducing this bill and hope for expedited procedures \nis that we have just seen a huge election in Mexico in which, for the \nfirst time in 71 years, there is a president from the opposition party, \nfrom the PRI, which has been the ruling party in Mexico all this time.\n  Democracy is beginning to be real in Mexico, and we want to do \neverything we can to encourage this democracy. We want to do everything \nwe can to have good relations, better relations, with our sister \ncountry to the south, Mexico.\n  Vicente Fox has visited the United States. He has opened the door for \nbetter relations. I know our next President, whoever he may be, will \nalso want to do the same thing.\n  It is a very simple bill. It is a bill that says for 1 year we are \nnot going to go through the certification-decertification process, and \nhopefully our two new Presidents will begin a new era of cooperation in \nthis very tough issue that plagues both of our countries. Having a \ncriminal element in Mexico and a criminal element in the United States \ncertainly is a cancer on both of our countries, and we want to do \neverything we can to improve the cooperation in combating this issue.\n  The inauguration of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico on December \n1st should usher in a sea change in Mexican politics as well as the \nU.S.-Mexico relationship. Not only will 71 years of rule by the \nInstitutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) come to an end, but hopefully \nso too will come an end to the flood of illegal drugs from Mexico into \nthe U.S.\n  Despite the promise of a new day in our relationship with Mexico, a \ndark cloud looms on the horizon--the annual drug certification ritual \nin which Congress requires the President to ``grade'' drug-producing \nand drug-transit countries each March 1 on their progress in the war on \ndrugs.\n  The facts have remained essentially unchanged over the past several \nyears. Mexico is the source of about 20-30% of the heroin, up to 70% of \nthe foreign grown marijuana, and the transit point for 50-60% of the \ncocaine shipped into the United States.\n  Mexico has never been decertified, but the thought of being in the \ncompany of Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan on this list, has done little \nexcept to antagonize their political leadership and thwart expanded \ncooperation. There is no reason to go through this exercise next March \nand grade President Fox after fewer than 120 days in office. Further, \nwith a new U.S. President taking office on January 20, there is no \nreason to set up a major confrontation between the two before they have \neven had an opportunity to work together cooperatively.\n  I am proud to introduce legislation with Senators Pete Domenici, \nChristopher Dodd, and Dianne Feinstein which will grant Mexico a 1-year \nwaiver from the annual certification process. I hope the Congress will \npass this waiver legislation before we adjourn.\n  This 1-year waiver will give President Fox the time he needs to \ndevelop and implement a new drug-fighting strategy in Mexico. And it \nwill give the United States the time we need to work with President Fox \nin the creation of this new strategy, and to finally put in place the \nlaw enforcement needed to stop the flow of drugs across our 2000-mile \nshared border.\n  The United States has enjoyed a long-term partnership with Mexico \nthat has grown closer and more cooperative over time. The North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement cemented and strengthened our \nrelationship--and our interdependence. Just last year, Mexico surged \npast Japan as our nation's second largest trade partner.\n  But partnership is a two-way exchange, and in recent years we have \ndrifted into tolerance of unacceptable conditions in the arena of drug \ntrafficking and the endemic corruption it causes in communities on both \nsides of the border. The border has been a sieve for drugs, and it has \nresulted in a degree of lawlessness in Texas and along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder that we have not seen since the days of the frontier. Even \nworse, the war on drugs plays out daily on nearly every schoolyard \nacross our nation.\n  I am more optimistic than ever, though, by the election of Vicente \nFox, that Mexico is prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to \ncontain the drug threat. And as he seeks to make progress on this \nalmost overwhelming issue, we do not need to poison the spirit of early \ncooperation by injecting drug certification.\n  Specifically, this bill waives for one-year only the requirement that \nthe President certify Mexico's cooperation with the United States in \nthe war on drugs. This waiver does not exempt Mexico from any of the \nreports or other activities associated with the certification process. \nIt simply says the President does not need to ``grade'' Mexico by \nchoosing between certification, decertification, or decertification \nwith a national interest waiver.\n  This 1-year drug certification waiver will give both the United \nStates and Mexico time to develop a process that will make us partners \nrather than adversaries in addressing the one issue that can make moot \nall of the promising opportunities between our two nations.\n  Still, President-elect Fox and the Government of Mexico should make \nno mistake about the priority the United States places on winning the \nwar on drugs. We will expect this to be a top priority of our new \nPresident, and we hope that this will be a priority of President Fox.\n  The Mexican government must take effective, good-faith steps to stop \nthe narco-corruption that infects and demoralizes both of our \ncountries. We ask them to take effective action to destroy the major \ndrug cartels and imprison their kingpins, implement laws to curtail \nmoney laundering, comply with U.S. extradition requests, increase \ninterdiction efforts and cooperate with U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n  President-elect Fox has shown every willingness to work with the \nUnited States in developing these objectives. He knows the challenges \nahead, and especially the ones that will come as Mexico's democracy \ncontinues to evolve and be tested. The United States should not add the \npressures of the certification process next year to a situation so full \nof risks and opportunities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend Senator Hutchison, along with \nSenators Dodd and Feinstein for introducing this bill today. I am \npleased to join in this effort.\n  The election of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico is a remarkable \nevent in the history of our neighbor to the south.\n  After 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, \nMexico is about to embark on an important test of its new democracy.\n  Mr. Fox has spoken very eloquently and persuasively in recent weeks \nand he has offered some interesting new ideas on critical issues which \naffect both of our countries, like immigration, trade and controlling \nillegal drugs.\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\n  Some of his ideas are quite impressive, and they certainly will spur \ndebate both in the United States and in Mexico.\n  I think it is important for our leaders in the United States, \nparticularly those in the border region, to engage Mr. Fox, talk with \nhim, listen to his ideas and offer our own thoughts to him.\n  In this spirit of cooperation and acceptance, I think it is critical \nfor the United States to suspend the drug certification process for \nMexico this coming year.\n  Mr. Fox needs time to build his administration, and to develop his \nown plan for dealing with the drug cartels.\n  As we all know, the history of drug cooperation between the United \nStates and Mexico has not been great.\n  Mexico remains the source of 70 percent of the foreign grown \nmarijuana in the U.S., 50-60 percent of the cocaine and 25-30 percent \nof the heroin.\n  In recent months, our federal law enforcement authorities have \ndismantled a major heroin ring operating out of Nayarit, Mexico, which \nwas responsible for much of the black tar heroin in the Southwest.\n  It is this heroin which has torn apart the northern New Mexico county \nof Rio Arriba, which has the highest per capita heroin overdose rate in \nthe Nation.\n  President-elect Fox has said that he will redouble his country's \nefforts to fight the drug cartels, and will increase the number of \ncriminals extradited to the United States to stand trial.\n  I have fought for years for more extraditions, and I am pleased that \nPresident Fox shares my goal.\n  I want to give Mr. Fox time to prove that he means what he says. \nEngaging in the certification process in March of 2001, within only 120 \ndays of Mr. Fox's first day in office, will only serve as a hindrance \nto developing mutual cooperation between the two new administrations.\n  The bill we have introduced today merely waives for one year the \nrequirement that the President make a certification decision about \nMexico.\n  This waiver would not exempt Mexico from any of the annual reports or \nother activities associated with the certification process, including \nreview by the State Department in its annual report to Congress.\n  It simply says that the next United States President need not grade \nMexico and its new President in his first four months in office by \nchoosing between certification, decertification or certification \nthrough a national interest waiver.\n  Mr. Fox should make no mistake--Senators from the Southwest care \ndeeply about the drug problem, which affects our communities, courts, \njails, hospitals and border region like no other issue.\n  We expect Mr. Fox to set concrete, measurable goals and timetables \nfor crippling the drug cartels and ending narco-corruption.\n  This is a fair bill, one that respects the new democracy in Mexico, \nand recognizes that the new administration needs time to set its own \nagenda.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the \nnew President of Mexico on this and other important issues of mutual \ninterest between our two countries.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Texas for this \nproposal. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it, along with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia. We hope others will join us and will soon be circulating a \ndear colleague letter inviting them to do so.\n  We believe that this is a very sensible and timely proposal in light \nof the dramatic changes that have occurred this past July 2 with the \nelection of Vincente Fox, candidate for the National Action Party, as \nthe next President of Mexico. His inauguration later this year will \nbring to an end 71 years of the office of the Mexican President being \nheld by a representative of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. \nClearly President-elect Fox has an enormous task before him to put in \nplace his new administration and to formulate policies and programs \nthat he believes are consistent with his campaign promises and \npriorities. Among the many issues that he has suggested will be \npriorities of his administration is enhanced counter narcotics \ncooperation with the United States.\n  I have made no secret of the fact that I believe that the annual \nunilateral drug certification procedures have been an obstacle to \nfurthering cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement \nauthorities. Rather than encouraging them to work closely together to \nthwart the corrupting impact of the drug kingpins in the United States \nand Mexico, the certification process degenerates annually to a \nshouting match across our southern border with respect to whether the \nMexican government has done enough to warrant a passing grade from us \non the counter narcotics front. Needless to say, Mexican officials \nresent the fact the they are being unilaterally graded on their \nperformance by us while U.S. policies and programs are never subject to \nsimilar review or criticism.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, this year elections on both sides of the \nborder give us an opportunity to start afresh with respect to counter \nnarcotics cooperation next year. By suspending the certification \nprocess for FY 2001, the climate for working more closely on these \nimportant programs will not be soured right off the bat by the March 1 \ngrading of Mexico. It is my hope that the new U.S. and Mexican \nadministrations will make it a high priority in the early days of their \nadministrations to put forward a joint plan for ensuring enhanced \ncooperation on counter narcotics issues that will replace the existing \nand counterproductive unilateral annual certification process with a \nmultilateral mechanism to monitor progress in combating drug \ntrafficking and related crimes in all affected countries. I would \ncertainly be prepared to support an additional suspension of the \ncertification process for a second year if additional time is needed to \nput in place a multilateral mechanism to ensure that international \ncooperation on such matters is working.\n  Mr President, this is an extremely important issue for not only \nMexico and the United States both for countries throughout this \nhemisphere. Certainly we need to address the problem of consumption \nhere at home. Our neighbors in this hemisphere, that are either \ninvolved in the production, in the chemical transformation of these \nproducts, or the transportation or the money laundering have a \ndifferent set of issues to address in our joint efforts to reduce both \nproduction and consumption of illicit drugs. It is vital that there be \na high level of cooperation if we are going to be successful in \nstemming the tide and flow of narcotics that pour into this country, \nthat result in the deaths of 50,000 Americans every year in drug-\nrelated deaths in this country. I believe that the certification \nprocedures are impeding that kind of cooperation. We believe that the \nlegislation we have introduced this evening will improve the prospects \nthat this will be done. I would hope that all of our colleagues will \njoin us in endorsing this approach.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to \nthe legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison.\n  Essentially, this bill would--for 1 year only--suspend the \ncertification process with respect to Mexico.\n  It is my hope that this one-year hiatus will be viewed as a sign of \ngood faith between our nations, and that our two countries will \ndramatically increase the level of our cooperation in the coming year. \nThe problem of drugs is as serious as any we face, and only with a true \npartnership with Mexico and other source countries can we hope to \nsucceed in the battle against illegal narcotics.\n  Mr. President, let me be very clear--my support for this legislation \nthis year should not be taken as a sign that I am any less concerned \nwith the rampant corruption and increasingly serious problem of illegal \nnarcotics flowing from Mexico into the United States. I sincerely hope \nthat President-elect Fox and the government of Mexico will with \ninnovation and commitment launch a new and effective war against the \ncartels that are currently of unparalleled strength and viciousness.\n  The Zedillo administration has made some progress in cooperating with \nthe United States in this fight.\n  For instance, the Zedillo administration:\n  Allowed, for the first time, the extradition of two Mexican Nationals \non\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\ndrug charges--although these were lower level participants in the drug \ntrade. This is a beginning, but just that--there is still a long way to \ngo.\n  Fired more than 1400 of 3500 federal police officers for corruption; \nand so far, more than 350 officers have been prosecuted.\n  Cooperated with the FBI late last year in an investigation on Mexican \nsoil.\n  And greatly increased seizures of illegal narcotics.\n  On the other hand, not nearly enough has been done:\n  Mexico is still the conduit to as much as 70% of the cocaine consumed \nin the United States (much of it originating in Colombia);\n  Mexico supplies the majority of marijuana to the U.S., and, according \nto the United States Forest Service, Mexican cartels are now sending \npeople across the border to grow marijuana in our national forests and \non other federal lands;\n  Despite recent successes in disrupting methamphetamine production in \nMexico, the meth cartels are now increasingly setting up meth labs in \nthe United States;\n  To date, not one major drug kingpin of Mexican nationality has yet \nbeen extradited to this country, nor has a major kingpin even been \narrested, with the exception of the Amezcua brothers, currently in \njail, while the Mexican government decides whether to extradite. Until \nthe cartel leaders are arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned, there \ncan be no real improvement.\n  In the meantime, Mexican drug cartels are becoming ever more vicious. \nTijuana, for instance recently saw its second police chief gunned down \nin less than 6 years, as dozens of judges, prosecutors and drug agents \nhave been killed in Tijuana alone in recent years.\n  Last April, the bodies of two Mexican drug agents and a special \nprosecutor for the Mexican Attorney General's anti-narcotics unit were \nfound in such a mangled state that identification--even by the spouse \nof one of the agents--was impossible. According to press accounts, one \ninvestigator who saw the photographs of the crime scene said ``They \ntold me it was a body. I've never seen anything like that.''\n  The Arellano Felix organization is responsible for many of these \ncrimes. They hold such a strong grip over their community that former \nDEA Administrator Thomas Constantine recently said that ``in Tijuana \nand Baja, they have become more powerful than the instruments of \ngovernment in Mexico.''\n  The Arellano Felix cartel operates with an estimated one million \ndollars in bribe money every day. With that money they pay law \nenforcement to look the other way, prosecutors to leave them alone, \njudges to let them go free, and for information about their enemies.\n  This leads to the largest single threat in this war against drugs--\nthe level of corruption within Mexican law enforcement and even \nextending into this country. Honest law enforcement officers cannot \nknow who to trust. Anyone who gets too close to capturing cartel \nmembers is subject to exposure and assassination. And the cycle of \ncorruption and failure continues.\n  The corruption is evident at all levels of Mexican law enforcement, \nand this is a problem that can only be solved through a concerted, \ncomprehensive effort on the part of the Fox administration.\n  Until the history of corruption is reversed and the drug cartels are \nbrought to justice, this nation will have no respite from the scourge \nof drugs flowing across our borders.\n  I cosponsor this legislation today as an experiment to see that, if \nby putting aside the contentiousness of a certification debate next \nMarch, there can be a new, more productive process. I will follow this \nclosely. If reports do not reflect substantial, positive change, we \nwill know clearly that decertification may be the only course.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if Senator Domenici would yield for 1 \nmore minute, I would like to, first of all, thank him for allowing us \nthe time to introduce this bill. If we are going to be able to pass \nthis by the end of the session, it is imperative that we get the bill \ninto the process. I also thank the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, and the Senator from California for being prime \ncosponsors because this will show the Mexican people and the new \nPresident-elect of Mexico that we do want cooperation.\n  I believe it is in our long-term best interests that we develop trade \nrelationships with our neighbor to the south, that we work with them on \ninvestments because as we increase the standard of living in Mexico, I \nthink many of the immigration problems and the problems dealing with \nillegal drugs will also be wiped away.\n  So this is a new era. I think this bill will signal that we do want \ncooperation and friendship. I have high hopes for President-elect \nVincente Fox. I have high hopes that our new President will focus on \nthis issue as well, to try to come up with a whole new process beyond \ncertification and decertification, which certainly has not worked very

Res. 349\n\n       Whereas modern communication has made television a central \n     reality in the lives of most Americans and one of the most \n     pervasive socializing instruments in American culture;\n       Whereas family members and American citizens of all ages \n     view an average of 17 hours of television per week;\n       Whereas there is a general consensus among researchers and \n     the American public that violence on television correlates to \n     violent and aggressive behavior in children and teenagers;\n       Whereas violent and antisocial behavior in American culture \n     have increased as television depictions of violent actions \n     and destructive attitudes have become more elaborate and more \n     common place in television programming;\n       Whereas television programming portraying responsible \n     conflict resolution and positive, meaningful role models have \n     a profound impact on the values that influence American \n     culture;\n       Whereas family oriented programming reinforces positive \n     attitudes and sound cultural values in our homes, schools, \n     and communities; and\n       Whereas the values and attributes portrayed in family \n     oriented programming promote positive social change and \n     movement away from the social apathy and moral deterioration \n     which are currently promoted by a wide variety of media \n     sources: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 7, 2000, as ``National Safe \n     Television for All-Ages Day''; and\n       (2) urges all citizens to observe ``National Safe \n     Television for All-Ages Day'' by encouraging family and \n     community members to advocate for socially responsible \n     television and area broadcasting that offers such \n     programming.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for 5 minutes as if in Morning Business. Mr. \nPresident, I rise to introduce a resolution which designates September \n7th of each year as ``National Safe TV for All-Ages Day.'' On September \n7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth, a young 21-year-old inventor in San \nFrancisco, transmitted the first all-electronic television picture. By \nthe time he died in 1971, Philo Farnsworth's invention had become one \nof the greatest innovations of the 20th Century.\n  Today, the modern television plays a central role in entertaining \nuntold millions world-wide, and no where has it made more of an impact \non society than in the United States. Television has become a fixture \nin almost every home. Americans view an average of 17 hours of \ntelevision per week. This medium enjoys unprecedented access into the \nAmerican home. Sadly, this access to the family has been abused as \nscenes of overtly violent and sexual acts on television have been on \nthe rise for decades. As a result, there is a general consensus among \nresearchers and the American public that violence on television \ncorrelates to violent and aggressive behavior in children and \nteenagers.\n  Given the continued rise of this negative behavior in American \nsociety--especially among young people--parents, teachers, law \nenforcement officials, sociologists, and politicians are looking for \nways to fight back. That is why I have publicly encouraged television \nexecutives and movie makers to take responsibility for the impact their \nprogramming and movies are having on viewers, regardless of age. While \nthe entertainment industry continues to market violence, families must \ndecide how to protect against a barrage of negative images.\n  My resolution encourages families and viewers of all-ages to turn off \nthe overtly violent and sexual programming and turn to safe, family \noriented programming which reinforces positive attitudes and sound \ncultural values in our homes, schools, and communities. Television \nprogramming which portrays responsible conflict resolution and \npositive, meaningful role models has a profound impact on the values \nthat influence American culture.\n  It is my hope that parents take matters into their own hands by \nmaking September 7th the day families use the remote control to send a \nmessage to the television executives that violent programming is not \nwanted in our homes.

We want to do business. \n     We cannot succeed in China without being a friend of the \n     Chinese people and the Chinese government.''.\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n       (2) The owner of Fox and Star TV networks has gained favor \n     with the Chinese leadership in part by dropping programming \n     and publishing deals that offend the Communist Government of \n     China, including the book by the last British Governor of \n     Hong Kong.\n       (3) The Chief Executive of Time Warner, which owns the \n     Fortune company that organized the Global Forum, called Jiang \n     Zemin his ``good friend'' as he introduced Jiang to make the \n     keynote speech at the conference. Jiang went on to threaten \n     force against Taiwan and to warn that comments by the West on \n     China's abysmal human rights record were not welcome.\n       (4) The Chief Executive of American International Group was \n     reported to be so effusive in his praise of China's economic \n     progress at the Global Forum that one Chinese official \n     described his remarks as ``not realistic''.\n       (5) The founder of Cable News Network, one of the world's \n     richest men, told the Global Forum that ``I am a socialist at \n     heart.''.\n       (6) During the Global Forum, Chinese leaders banned an \n     issue of Time magazine (owned by Time-Warner, the host of the \n     Global Forum) marking the 50th anniversary of communism in \n     China, because the issue included commentaries by dissidents \n     Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and the Dalai Lama. China also \n     blocked the web sites of Time Warner's Fortune magazine and \n     CNN.\n       (7) Chinese officials denied Fortune the right to invite \n     Chinese participants to the Global Forum and instead padded \n     the guest list with managers of state-run firms.\n       (8) At the forum banquet, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji lashed \n     out at the United States for defending Taiwan.\n       (9) On June 5, 2000, China's number two phone company, \n     Unicom, broke an agreement with the Qualcomm Corporation by \n     confirming that it will not use mobile-phone technology \n     designed by Qualcomm for at least 3 years, causing a sharp \n     sell off of the United States company's stock.\n       (10) When the Taiwanese pop singer Ah-mei, who appeared in \n     advertisements for Sprite in China, agreed to sing Taiwan's \n     national anthem at Taiwan's May 20, 2000, presidential \n     inauguration, Chinese authorities immediately notified the \n     Coca-Cola company that its Ah-mei Sprite ads would be banned.\n       (11) The company's director of media relations said that \n     the Coca-Cola Company was ``unhappy'' about the ban, but ``as \n     a local business, would respect the authority of local \n     regulators and we will abide by their decisions''.\n       (12) In 1998, Apple Computer voluntarily removed images of \n     the Dalai Lama from its ``Think Different'' ads in Hong Kong, \n     stating at the time that ``where there are political \n     sensitivities, we did not want to offend anyone''.\n       (13) In 1997, the Massachusetts-based Internet firm, \n     Prodigy, landed an investment contract in China by agreeing \n     to comply with China's Internet rules which provide for \n     censoring any political information deemed unacceptable to \n     the Communist government.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that in \n     order for the presence of United States businesses to truly \n     foster political liberalization in China, those businesses \n     must conduct themselves in a manner that reflects basic \n     American values of democracy, individual liberty, and \n     justice.\n       (c) Consultation Required.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall consult with American businesses that do business in, \n     have significant trade with, or invest in the People's \n     Republic of China, to encourage the businesses to adopt a \n     voluntary code of conduct that--\n       (1) follows internationally recognized human rights \n     principles, including freedom of expression and democratic \n     governance;\n       (2) ensures that the employment of Chinese citizens is not \n     discriminatory in terms of sex, ethnic origin, or political \n     belief;\n       (3) ensures that no convict, forced, or indentured labor is \n     knowingly used;\n       (4) supports the principle of a free market economy and \n     ownership of private property;\n       (5) recognizes the rights of workers to freely organize and \n     bargain collectively; and\n       (6) discourages mandatory political indoctrination on \n     business premises.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4124\n\n       On page 5, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following \n     new section and redesignate the remaining sections and cross \n     references thereto:\n\n     SEC. 103. ADDITIONAL CONDITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Permanent normal trade relations treatment would \n     ostensibly be granted to the People's Republic of China in \n     large part to promote political liberalization through free \n     trade and to open the exchange of ideas.\n       (2) The Broadcasting Board of Governors testified before \n     the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 26, 2000, \n     that the Government of the People's Republic of China jams \n     242 hours a day of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America \n     programs, which includes 100 hours of Mandarin language \n     transmissions, 34 hours of Tibetan language transmissions, \n     and 3 hours of Uyghur language transmissions.\n       (3) The Broadcasting Board of Governors testified before \n     the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 26, 2000, \n     that the Government of the People's Republic of China spends \n     at least $5,400,000 a year to jam Radio Free Asia and Voice \n     of America Mandarin language programs.\n       (4) The fact that the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China spends at least as much to jam Radio Free Asia and \n     Voice of America broadcasts as the United States spends to \n     transmit broadcasts to China indicates an intense commitment \n     on the part of the People's Republic of China to block the \n     free flow of ideas and news in China.\n       (b) Additional Certification.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, the extension of nondiscriminatory \n     trade treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the \n     People's Republic of China shall not take effect until the \n     President certifies to Congress that the People's Republic of \n     China is no longer jamming or otherwise interfering with \n     broadcasts of Radio Free Asia or the Voice of America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HELMS (AND WELLSTONE) AMENDMENT NO. 4125\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, H.R. 4444, supra;

The reports described \n     in subsection (b)\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\n     shall be submitted to Congress in order to evaluate the \n     progress being made in carrying out the agreement.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall report to Congress on the existing United States \n     agricultural trade deficit with the People's Republic of \n     China.\n       (2) Subsequent report.--Not later than 3 years after the \n     report described in the paragraph (1), the United States \n     Trade Representative shall report to Congress regarding the \n     size and status of the agricultural trade deficit with the \n     People's Republic of China and whether the People's Republic \n     of China has taken steps to eliminate all barriers to trade \n     in the agricultural sector.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--If the report described in \n     subsection (b)(2) indicates that 3 years after the date \n     nondiscriminatory treatment is permanently extended to the \n     People's Republic of China, the agricultural trade deficit \n     has not been reduced to one-third or less of the deficit \n     reported under subsection (b)(1), it is the sense of Congress \n     that the extension of nondiscriminatory trade treatment has \n     not produced adequate benefits for United States farmers and \n     the People's Republic of China is manifestly not implementing \n     its bilateral agreement with the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4128\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 702. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FORCED ABORTIONS IN \n                   CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For more than 18 years there have been frequent, \n     consistent, and credible reports of forced abortion and \n     forced sterilization in the People's Republic of China. These \n     reports indicate the following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion has no role \n     in the population control program, in fact the Communist \n     Chinese Government encourages forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization through a combination of strictly enforced \n     birth quotas, rewards for informants, and impunity for local \n     population control officials who engage in coercion.\n       (B) A recent defector from the population control program, \n     testifying at a congressional hearing on June 10, 1998, made \n     clear that central government policy in China strongly \n     encourages local officials to use coercive methods.\n       (C) Population control officials of the People's Republic \n     of China, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical punishment.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. According to \n     a 1995 Amnesty International report, the Catholic inhabitants \n     of 2 villages in Hebei Province were subjected to enforcement \n     measures including torture, sexual abuse, and the detention \n     of resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy, including \n     numerous examples of actual infanticide.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion has been used in Communist \n     China not only to regulate the number of children, but also \n     to destroy those who are regarded as defective because of \n     physical or mental disabilities in accordance with the \n     official eugenic policy known as the ``Natal and Health Care \n     Law''.\n       (3) According to every annual State Department Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices for the People's Republic of \n     China since 1983, Chinese officials have used coercive \n     measures such as forced abortion, forced sterilization, and \n     detention of resisters.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should urge the People's Republic of \n     China to cease its forced abortion and forced sterilization \n     policies and practices; and\n       (2) the President should urge the People's Republic of \n     China to cease its detention of those who resist abortion or \n     sterilization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               SMITH OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AMENDMENT NO. 4129\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. \n4444, supra; as follows:\n\n                               DIVISION I\n\n       On page 46, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 302A.

Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 2438, \nthe Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. This legislation is the \nproduct of many months of work by the members of the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation, as well as other members of \nthe Senate. Sadly, this legislation is in large part in response to two \ndevastating pipeline accidents that have occurred in the States of \nWashington and New Mexico during the past 15 months.\n  A total of 15 lives have been lost in these most recent accidents. \nThree young men endured fatal injuries last June 1999 in Bellingham, \nWashington, when 227,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from an underground \npipeline and were accidentally ignited. Last month, twelve members of \ntwo families camping in Carlsbad, New Mexico, lost their lives when a \nnatural gas transmission line ruptured. We simply must act now to \nremedy identified safety problems and improve pipeline safety. To do \nless is a risk to public safety and will perhaps result in more \nneedless deaths. I ask unanimous consent a recent editorial from the \nWashington Post calling for Congressional action be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my hope that passage of \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation can give the family members \nassociated with these tragedies at least a small bit of comfort that \ntheir losses have spurred Congressional action to strengthen pipeline \nsafety laws and help prevent future tragic accidents. I am aware this \nbill may not go as far as some would like, and also know it goes \nfurther than others can support. However, this legislation is a fair \nand balanced compromise and is a pro-safety measure that will result in \npipeline safety improvements. Its enactment is critical to public \nsafety and must be a top priority during the remainder of this \nCongress.\n  I extend my sincere appreciation to Senator Gorton for his help in \ndeveloping the bill before us. His tireless efforts to ensuring that \nthe Senate consider and pass comprehensive pipeline safety legislation \nis commendable. I also want to thank Senators Hollings, Lott, \nHutchison, Breaux, and Brownback of the Committee for their strong \ninterest in this legislation. Further, I want to recognize the \ndedication and hard work of Senator Murray throughout this process. She \nhas been a tenacious advocate for pipeline safety improvements. I also \nwant to recognize Senator Bingaman for his contributions to \nstrengthening the research and development provisions of this \nlegislation, and also Senator Domenici for his work. Finally, the input \nwe received from citizens, State pipeline inspectors, the National \nTransportation Safety Board, the Department of Transportation and its \nInspector General, industry and others interested in promoting pipeline \nsafety has been essential to our efforts to craft comprehensive \npipeline safety improvement legislation.\n  Significant attention has been directed toward pipeline safety issues \nby the Senate during this past year. In March, the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held a field hearing, chaired by Senator Gorton, in \nBellingham, Washington, during which 18 witnesses provided information \nand expressed views on the Bellingham accident. In May, the full \ncommittee held a hearing on a broad range of pipeline safety issues, \nincluding the three pipeline safety bills that have been introduced in \nthe Senate. We reported out a comprehensive bill in June and since then \nhave developed a manager's amendment to provide further clarification \nof the bill as well as additional provisions to advance pipeline \nsafety.\n\n  I will highlight some of the major provisions of the legislation \nbefore us. The bill would require the implementation of pipeline safety \nrecommendations recently issued by the DOT-IG to the Research and \nSpecial Programs Administration, RSPA. The legislation would \nstatutorily require the Secretary of Transportation, the RSPA \nAdministrator and the Director of the Office of Pipeline Safety to \nrespond to NTSB pipeline safety recommendations within 90 days of \nreceipt. The bill would require pipeline operators to submit to the \nSecretary of Transportation a plan designed to improve the \nqualifications for pipeline personnel. At a minimum, the qualification \nplan would have to demonstrate that pipeline employees have the \nnecessary knowledge to safely and properly perform their assigned \nduties and would require testing and periodic reexamination of the \nemployees' qualifications.\n  The legislation would require DOT to issue regulations mandating \npipeline operators to periodically determine the adequacy of their \npipelines to safely operate and to adopt and implement integrity \nmanagement programs to reduce those identified risks. The regulations \nwould, at a minimum, require operators to: base their integrity \nmanagement plans on risk assessments that they conduct; periodically \nassess the integrity of their pipelines; and, take steps to prevent and \nmitigate unintended releases, such as improving leak detection \ncapabilities or installing restrictive flow devices.\n  S. 2438 also would require an operator of a gas transmission or \nhazardous liquid pipeline facility to carry out a continuing public \neducation program that would include activities to advise \nmunicipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of pipeline \nfacility locations on a variety of pipeline safety-related matters. It \nwould also direct pipeline operators to initiate and maintain \ncommunication with State emergency response commissions and local \nemergency planning committees and to share with these entities \ninformation critical to addressing pipeline safety issues, including \ninformation on the types of product transported and efforts by the \noperator to mitigate safety risks. The Secretary would be directed to \nprescribe regulations to make certain emergency information publicly \navailable as well as direct operators to provide mapping information to \nmunicipalities in which the pipeline facility is located.\n  The bill would increase the level of maximum civil penalties for \nviolations as requested in the Administration's submission. It would \nalso provide for an enhanced state oversight role in pipeline safety \nwhereby States that have authority over intrastate lines could enter \ninto agreements with the Secretary to participate in the oversight of \ninterstate lines. The manager's amendment clarifies that the state \noversight be consistent with the Secretary's federal safety and \ninspection policies. The legislation further includes language to \nensure that the enhanced agreements will not adversely affect the \nState's responsibilities over intrastate safety and, in the event there \nis a negative impact, the Secretary is authorized to cancel the \nenhanced state agreements.\n\n  The legislation directs the Secretary to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive plan for the collection and use of pipeline data in a \nmanner that would enable incident trend analysis and evaluations of \noperator performance. Operators would be required to report incident \nreleases greater than five gallons, compared to the current reporting \nrequirement of 42 gallons. In addition, the Secretary is directed to \nestablish a national depository of data to be administered by the \nBureau of Transportation Statistics in cooperation with RSPA.\n  Given the critical importance of technology applications in promoting \ntransportation safety across all modes of transportation, the \nlegislation directs the Secretary to include as part of the \nDepartment's research and development (R) efforts a focus on \ntechnologies to improve pipeline safety, such as through internal \ninspection devices and leak detection. Further, the accompanying \namendment includes provisions from S. 3002, the Pipeline Integrity, \nSafety and Reliability Research and Development Act of 2000, introduced \nby Senator Bingaman, myself, and others earlier this week. This \nprovision provides for a collaborative R effort directed by the \nDepartment of Transportation with the assistance of the Department of \nEnergy and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n  In regard to funding for pipeline safety, the bill provides for a \nthree year authorization, authorizing $26 million for FY2001, $30 \nmillion for FY2002; and $30 million in FY2003 for federal pipeline \nsafety activities. It would further authorize the pipeline state grant \nprogram at the following levels: $17 million for FY2001; $20 million \nfor FY2002; and $20 million for FY2003. Efforts to provide further \nincreases in funding are under discussion and will be given careful \nconsideration as the legislation moves through the legislative process \nand on to a conference with the House.\n  In an effort to enhance the ability of the NTSB and DOT to complete \npipeline accident investigations in a timely and comprehensive manner, \nthe substitute amendment includes a provision requiring operators to \nmake available to the DOT or NTSB all records and information \npertaining to the accident, including integrity management plans and \ntest results, and to assist in the investigation to the extent \nreasonable.\n  Further, the legislation attempts to address the situation when \npipeline personnel involved in accidents continue to carry out the same \nfunctions as they did prior to an accident even though their job \nperformance may be at question during an investigation. Under the \nmanager's amendment, if the Secretary determines that the actions of an \nemployee may have contributed substantially to the cause of an \naccident, the Secretary must direct the operator to relieve or reassign \nthe employee, or place the employee on leave until the Secretary \ndetermines that the employee's performance did not contribute to the \ncause of the accident or until the Secretary determines the employee \ncan safely perform his or her duties.\n  To ensure pipeline employees are afforded the same whistle-blower \nprotections as are provided to employees in other modes, the \nlegislation includes whistle-blower protections for pipeline personnel. \nThe provisions are identical to those recently enacted in the Wendell \nH. Ford Aviation and Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century, P.L. \n106-181, with the exception of changing the words air carrier to \npipeline.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the full Senate to take action \nand pass legislation to strengthen and improve pipeline safety. We \nsimple cannot risk the loss of any more lives by lack of needed \nattention on our part. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nimportant safety legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 4, 2000]\n\n                          A Blast in the Night\n\n       Residents of Carlsbad, N.M., are mourning the 11 family \n     members killed when a natural gas pipeline exploded near \n     their campsite in New Mexico, Investigators still are trying \n     to determine exactly what caused the blast. While they work, \n     there is a job to be done here as well: Put more muscle into \n     federal regulation of pipeline safety.\n       Nearly all the nation's natural gas and about 65 percent of \n     crude and refined oil travel through a network of nearly 2.2 \n     million miles of pipes. Although pipelines remain \n     statistically safer--in some cases much safer--than other \n     means of transporting freight, the number of accidents \n     reported has been gradually growing during the past decade, \n     according to a General Accounting Office report prepared this \n     spring. In many places the infrastructure is aging; sprawling \n     development now encroaches on many of the remote rural areas \n     where pipes were installed decades ago. The federal agency \n     charged with policing the pipelines is tiny, underfunded and \n     possessed of a record that is not reassuring. The GAO found \n     that the Office of Pipeline Safety is years behind in \n     implementing some congressional mandates and safety \n     recommendations from the National Transportation Safety \n     Board. Things have improved in the last year but the NTSB, \n     the GAO report says, still is watching to see whether \n     promised actions will be carried out.\n       Bills are now pending in Congress that would address at \n     least some safety issues. Most important, legislation would \n     require periodic pipeline inspections. The NTSB has been \n     asking for that since 1987, and it hasn't happened yet. The \n     bills also would provide more information for the public, \n     would give state inspectors a bigger role in helping monitor \n     interstate pipelines and would require more rigorous \n     reporting of pipeline spills, which could help identify \n     possible trouble spots and help mitigate environmental \n     damage. Congress should pass a strong pipeline-safety bill \n     before this session ends. Along with it should come adequate \n     funding to carry out its mandates. And then members should \n     keep the heat on until it is clear the safety measures have \n     been carried out. There's no need to wait for another blast \n     in the night.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2438, the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, and to support the amendment \nto the bill. I urge my fellow Senators to adopt the amendment and to \nsupport passage of this bill. It, indeed, will make our Nation's \npipeline system safer.\n  The purpose of the bill is to ensure the safety of natural gas and \nhazardous liquid pipelines. I appreciate the considerable number of \nhours that went into creating this bill by all of the parties. I also \nam satisfied by the spirit of compromise that infused the parties' \ndiligent efforts. As a result of their admirable and cooperative work \nwe have a bill that reaffirms our efforts to regulate gas and hazardous \nliquid pipelines safely and effectively without interfering with the \npipeline operators and owners ability to provide service to our Nation.\n  With respect to concerns regarding the existing pipeline safety \nprogram, I want to share my concerns about the delays in issuing \nCongressional mandates. Some may find it hard to believe that the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety, OPS, has failed to issue final rules on \nmeasures that required rulemakings under its 1992 and 1996 \nreauthorizations. Unquestionably, the rules on environmentally \nsensitive and high density areas should have been completed by now. I \nhave been advised that a final rule is expected this year. But even if \nthis is the case, the fact remains that the final promulgation is still \nsignificantly behind schedule. The rules on operator qualification and \nperiodic inspections are not final either. One of the goals of this \nlegislation is to stimulate the finalization of these rules.\n  Over the past few years, we have experienced two major pipeline \naccidents, one in Bellingham, WA, and the other near Carlsbad, NM. \nWhile accidents happen, we need to take all necessary steps to ensure \nthat accidents are not waiting to happen. I think that this legislation \nwill increase the arsenal of tools available to OPS to ensure that our \npipeline system is as safe as possible. I ask that OPS use the tools \nthat we provide to ensure the aggressive oversight of pipeline safety \npractices.\n  While there were many who worked arduously to ensure passage of \nlegislation in this area, I would like to recognize, in particular, the \nefforts of Senators Murray and Bingaman. Senator Murray doggedly \npursued changes to increase the level of safety and public \nparticipation in pipeline safety, and she worked closely with other \nCommerce Committee members to ensure a reasonable and fair compromise. \nSenator Bingaman was instrumental in helping bolster the bills \nprovisions on research and development. We also were able to add \nprovisions he authored to focus our research on progressive areas that \nwill help us develop better systems of early detection, and to ensure \nthat we can avoid accidents such as those that occurred in Bellingham, \nWA, and near Carlsbad, NM.\n  This bill is good legislation. It will require our regulators to \nfinalize a number of overdue regulations. The bill also allows for a \ngreater degree of public participation in the process of pipeline \nsafety, updates the penalties that would be levied for misconduct and \nprovides whistle blower protection for employees who reveal misconduct. \nThe bill also helps us focus on long-term needs so as to make our \nfuture pipeline system even safer. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4130\n\n   (Purpose: To incorporate additional provisions in, and make minor \n        modifications to, the bill as reported by the committee)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there is an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. McCain, \n     for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 4130.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the managers' \namendment to S. 2438, the bill before\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\nthe Senate, to modernize our Nation's pipeline safety programs. The \nissue of our country's pipeline safety regime came to the forefront \nagain last year after the death of three teenagers in a pipeline \nexplosion near Bellingham, WA.\n  Since that accident in 1999, the Senators from Washington State have \nworked tirelessly to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a vote. I \nwant to commend Senator Gorton, Senator Murray, and the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator McCain, for their efforts on this \nlegislation. Without their work, patience and persistence, this bill \nwould not be ready for passage in the Senate.\n  As my colleagues know, in August of this year, New Mexico experienced \nits own tragic pipeline explosion. Just after midnight on August 19, an \nEl Paso Natural Gas pipeline exploded on the Pecos River near Carlsbad, \nNM. Twelve members of an extended family were camping near the \nexplosion, which sent a 350-foot high ball of flame into the air. Six \nof the campers were killed instantly, and the remaining six have since \ndied from their injuries. The horrific accident is the largest pipeline \ndisaster in the State's history and one of the worst in the United \nStates. While the NTSB is still investigating the cause of the \nexplosion, preliminary analyses indicate that the pipeline was highly \ncorroded, and that half of the internal wall of the pipe had been eaten \naway in places, apparently causing a prolonged natural gas leak.\n  Sadly, this accident has again placed the spotlight on the need for \nCongress to update our pipeline safety standards. The bill before the \nSenate represents a marked improvement in our existing pipeline safety \nprogram. The bill requires companies to conduct periodic internal \ninspections of their lines; authorizes and provides resources to allow \nthe States to exercise a greater role in pipeline inspections and \noversight; increases civil penalties against companies who violate \npipeline safety laws; and provides resources for greater research and \ndevelopment into pipeline safety technologies, including new internal \ninspection mechanisms, as well as enhanced leak detection technologies.\n  There are over 1.8 million miles of liquid and natural gas pipelines \nin the United States, including 7,000 miles in New Mexico. The Federal \nOffice of Pipeline Safety is responsible for 5,000 miles of pipeline in \nNew Mexico and the State must inspect the remaining 1,800 miles. Yet, \nthe New Mexico State budget for pipeline safety allows for only four \ninspectors, who can cover only a few miles of pipeline per day. Because \nof this resource shortage, hundreds of miles of underground oil and gas \npipelines go uninspected each year in my state.\n  The bill before the Senate authorizes more funding for State \ninspection activities, and provides the States with greater oversight \nauthority to inspect both intra- and interstate pipelines. States are \nan important partner in the regulation of oil and gas pipelines. With \nthis bill, Congress is stepping up to the plate to help reimburse \nstates for undertaking a greater responsibility for pipeline safety.\n  As my colleagues know, the bulk of the responsibility for pipeline \ninspection falls on the oil and gas companies themselves. In fact, the \nliquid and natural gas industries spend nearly $4 billion annually on \npipeline safety activities. Pipeline transportation is perhaps the \nsafest way available to move liquid and natural gas across the country. \nAmong all the methods of transport, including pipeline, highway, rail, \naviation, and marine, pipeline accident fatalities represent less than \n1/333rd of one percent of the total number of annual deaths related to \nthe industry.\n  Yet despite this safety record, tragic accidents do occur. I think \nthe industry, in partnership with federal and State regulators, can do \nmore to better protect our citizens from these kinds of accidents. This \nbill represents an extension of that partnership, and I believe that \nindustry should be commended for coming to the table and helping us \nreach this agreement.\n  This bill requires companies to file ``Integrity Management Plans'' \nwith the United States Department of Transportation. These plans will \noutline how the company will periodically assess the safety of their \npipelines, including the use of internal inspections, pressure tests, \ndirect assessments and any other available methods of identifying \nweaknesses in the pipeline and detecting leaks. In short, this \nprovision means that for the first time, companies will be required to \nconduct regular pipeline inspections, and to provide information on \nthose inspections to federal and State regulators.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill authorizes additional resources for \nresearch and development of new pipeline safety technologies through \nthe Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. It is clear \nthat we need to develop some new technologies to better assess the \nintegrity of pipelines and detect leaks before they cause disaster. One \nof the problems with the line which exploded in Carlsbad was that \nconventional ``pig'' devices, which detect corrosion and leaks, could \nnot be used to inspect that particular pipeline. We have tremendous \nscientific capabilities in our universities, national laboratories and \nin the private sector which could be tapped to help develop new and \nbetter technologies.\n  While everyone recognizes that Sandia and Los Alamos National \nLaboratories in New Mexico have great scientific capabilities which \ncould be brought to bear on this problem, a private sector resource \nalso exists in my home state. La-Sen Corporation in Las Cruces, NM has \ndeveloped an airborne laser mapping system which can inspect hundreds \nof miles of oil and gas pipeline per day. I know that some of the major \noil and gas companies, including El Paso Natural Gas, have seen the \ntechnology and have indicated that they would use it if it were \ncommercially available.\n  I plan to work in the next several weeks to help this company find \nfederal resources to complete development of this technology and make \nit commercially available as soon as possible. This is the kind of \nresearch and development that the federal government ought to \nencourage.\n  I am pleased to support passage of this bill. Even though the bill \nimposes new requirements on industry and provides for tougher penalties \nfor violating the law, there are some who will say that it does not do \nenough to get tough on pipeline companies. In my view, the Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, the Senators from Washington and other members \nwho have worked on this bill have done an excellent job crafting a bill \nwhich will receive the unanimous support of this Senate. I hope the \nHouse will take this bill up at the earliest possible date and pass it \nquickly so that we can send pipeline safety legislation to the \nPresident for his signature prior to the end of the session. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4130) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute be agreed to, as amended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Impelled by an explosion last year in Bellingham, WA, \nthat took three young lives and shook that community to its core, and \ngiven force by another recent tragedy in New Mexico, the Senate today \nis adopting the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. The bill \nbrings much-needed reforms to the regulation and oversight of the \npipelines that wind invisibly beneath our homes, parks, and schools, \nmost notably by providing more information to local governments and to \nthe public about the location and condition of pipelines and pipeline \naccidents; by requiring more accountability from the Federal Office of \nPipeline Safety and by authorizing more funding for that Office and for \nStates willing to assume additional oversight responsibility; by \nrequiring operators to assess the risks to their lines and develop \nplans to address threats to their integrity; by giving willing States a \nclearer and larger role in the oversight of interstate pipelines; by \ndirecting additional attention and resources to research and \ndevelopment programs to improve pipeline integrity; by increasing civil \npenalties for violations of pipeline safety standards;\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nand by requiring Federal attention to recommendations for improvements \nto pipeline safety by state citizen advisory committees.\n  The issue of citizens advisory committees has, to my surprise, been \none of the most contentious. The idea of creating an independent \noversight body that is not controlled by industry, and that can \nobjectively assess the state of pipeline safety and make \nrecommendations for improvements to Federal and State regulators, is to \nme perfectly sensible. The passion with which industry has opposed even \na pilot program for Federal citizen advisory committees has, I confess, \ndisturbed me and strengthened my determination to see that citizen \nadvisory committees are established and adequately funded.\n  While it has become clear to me that a Federal advisory committee \nwill not be part of any legislation that can be enacted this year--and \nI am absolutely determined to see that legislation is enacted--I am \ncommitted to seeing that Washington State receives adequate funding for \nits own Citizens Committee on Pipeline Safety, whose members were \nrecently appointed, but which I understand has been allocated only \nenough funds to pay for a meeting room four times a year, hardly the \nresources needed to meet the responsibility this committee has been \nassigned.\n  I will work through the appropriations process this year to see that \nnot only is funding increased for all Federal and State pipeline safety \nactivities, but that in addition to the $800,000 I am trying to direct \nfor Washington State's new responsibilities in overseeing pipeline \nsafety, Washington obtains sufficient funding to staff and pay for the \nactivities of the Citizens Committee on Pipeline Safety.\n  The issue of citizen advisory committees has not been the only \ncontentious issue in this bill. Getting here has not been easy, and \nwere it not for the efforts and dogged perseverance of Members of both \nsides of the aisle, most notably Senator McCain, and my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, we would not be here today. I am deeply \ngrateful for their work.\n  Another person who has made this happen, and for whom I have \ndeveloped a true respect, is Mark Asmundson, the Mayor of Bellingham, \nWA. Following the explosion on June 10, 1999, and with a commitment \nborn, I believe, of justifiable anger, Mark has devoted himself to \nimproving pipeline safety at the local, State, and Federal levels. It \nis people like Mark, who is committed to public welfare, passionate, \npractical, and resolutely good humored, and the many others who \nresponded to the tragedy in Bellingham by taking action not only to \nimprove their own safety, but the safety of people throughout this \ncountry, who constantly remind me how privileged I am to represent the \npeople of Washington State.\n\n  Since the Commerce Committee passed S. 2438 in June of this year, \nfollowing a factfinding hearing in Bellingham in March, I have been \nworking to secure passage of this bill by unanimous consent as an \nextended debate this late in the year is impossible. The manager's \namendment that was adopted today resolves concerns raised by some of my \ncolleagues in a way that I think is fair, and, unlike some of the \namendments offered and defeated in committee in a way that does not \nundermine the benefits of this bill.\n  S. 2438, as amended, is a marked improvement to the status quo. it \nrequires the Office of Pipeline Safety to implement the recommendations \nof the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation by \ncompleting rulemakings that are long overdue, collecting better \ninformation to determine the causes of pipeline accidents, and \nproviding better training to OPS inspectors. S. 2438 accelerates the \ndeadline for operators to prepare plans for training and qualifying \ntheir employees.\n  The bill imposes on operators of pipelines of any length, not just \nlonger pipelines as suggested by the administration, an obligation to \nconduct risk analyses and adopt integrity management plans for high \nconsequence areas--plans that provide for periodic inspections of \npipelines. It requires that information about pipeline incidents and \nsafety-related conditions be made available to the public and lowers \nthe threshold for reporting spills from the current 2100 gallons, to 5 \ngallons.\n  To give local officials a greater role in protecting their \ncommunities, the bill requires operators to work with local communities \nto educate them about the location and risks of pipelines and what to \ndo in case of an accident. The bill increases fines for violations and \nprotection for whistleblowers who report unsafe conditions. S. 2438 \nexplicitly provides a role for States in the oversight of interstate \npipelines and gives the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety the authority \nit needs to carry out the recent agreement with Washington State which \nwill enable Washington to hire more investigators and take an active \nrole in the oversight of interstate pipelines.\n  The bill provides not only more funding for the Office of Pipeline \nSafety and direction on areas of research and development to focus on \nimproved safety, but also incorporates the recommendation of Senators \nBingaman and Domenici to create a new cooperative research and \ndevelopment program for pipeline integrity that combines the resources \nof the Departments of Transportation and Energy under the auspices of \nthe National Science Foundation.\n  The bill, in sum, while not all that I would have wished, is a vast \nimprovement over the status quo. I am grateful to my colleagues for \npassing this very critical piece of legislation. And I am determined to \nsee that it is enacted into law before the end of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues this evening for \npassing the much-needed pipeline safety bill.\n  For too long, communities across the country--in tragedy after \ntragedy--have felt the impact of our Nation's inadequate pipeline \nsafety standards.\n  Today, the Senate has responded with a strong bill that will help \nmake our pipelines safer.\n  As pleased as I am today, I am reminded of another much darker day--\nJune 10, 1999.\n  On that day, a gasoline pipeline exploded in Bellingham, WA, killing \nthree young people, shattering a community's faith, and setting us on \nthe road of safety reform.\n  I know that we can't undo what happened in Bellingham. We can't \nrestore the loss of those families. But with this bill, we are putting \nthe lessons we learned in Bellingham into law--and taking a first step \ntoward ensuring America's pipelines are safe.\n  Unfortunately, it has taken another fatal pipeline explosion to reach \nthis day. But it is clear that the tragedy in New Mexico raised public \nawareness and increased the pressure on Congress to pass this bill.\n  This bill will go a long way toward improving pipeline safety. Back \nin January--when I introduced my own pipeline safety bill--I outlined \nthe areas that needed reform. I am proud that this bill embodies the \nprinciples I have been working for.\n  First, this bill will improve the qualifications and training of \npipeline personnel. It requires employees to demonstrate an ability to \ndo their job. And it requires periodic reexamination of pipeline \npersonnel. Second, this bill improves pipeline inspections and \nprevention practices. It requires operators to submit pipeline \nintegrity management plans, which State and local officials can \nevaluate and recommend changes to.\n  These plans will include: internal inspections, evaluation criteria, \nmeasures to prevent and mitigate unintended releases, and other safety \nactivities.\n  Third, and importantly, this bill expands the public's right-to-know \nabout problems with pipelines. It requires operators to make \ninformation about the pipelines and their safety practices available to \nlocal officials, emergency responders, and the public--including \nposting information on the Internet. It also requires more pipeline \naccidents to be reported to the Office of Pipeline Safety, by lowering \nthe reporting threshold from 200 gallons to 5 gallons.\n  Fourth, this bill raises the penalties for safety violators. It \ndoubles the current civil penalties for noncompliance, and it lifts the \ncaps on maximum penalties.\n  Fifth, this bill enables States to expand their safety efforts. This \nbill allows the Secretary of Transportation\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nto enter into agreements that will allow States to: ``participate in \nspecial investigations involving incidents or new construction'' and to \n``assume additional inspection or investigatory duties.''\n  Sixth, this bill invests in new technology to improve safety. It \nrecognizes the need for R for new inspection devices and practices, \nand it authorizes a coordinated research program.\n  Seventh, this bill provides protections for those who blow the \nwhistle on unsafe practices.\n  Eighth, this bill increases funding for safety efforts. It authorizes \nspending $13 million more on pipeline safety than we spend today.\n  Finally, this bill recognizes State citizen advisory committees and \nallows for their funding. These State citizen advisory committees would \nmake recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary \nwill be required to respond--in writing--to those recommendations. And, \nthe Secretary would have to detail what actions, if any, will be taken \nto implement those recommendations.\n  Further, the bill would allow appropriations for these State advisory \ncommittees.\n  This is a sound bill. Under this bill, pipelines will be inspected. \nOperators will be qualified. Whistleblowers will be protected, and \nviolators will be penalized. Pipeline companies will have to develop \ncomprehensive safety and inspection plans, and States will get new \nauthority. Citizen groups will have a role, and the public will have a \nright to know about the pipelines in their own communities.\n  This bill does not only raise pipeline safety standards. It gives us \nthe tools, the enforcements, and the funding to ensure that pipeline \ncompanies reach those standards.\n  I want my constituents and my colleagues to know that I plan on \nremaining vigilant on this issue and ensuring that future \nadministrations carry out the congressional mandate.\n  I do want to recognize tonight a few people who have helped make this \nday possible. First are the families of the victims of the Bellingham \nexplosion, Frank and Mary King, Katherine Dalen and Stephen Tsiorvas, \nMarlene Robinson and Bruce Brabec. They have testified and worked hard. \nThey have been courageous, and they were constant reminders of what has \nbeen lost and what this legislation will help protect.\n  Second, I thank the people of Bellingham, especially Mayor Mark \nAsmundson, who has done more than anyone I know to raise awareness \nabout pipeline hazards.\n  I recognize the work of our great Governor Gary Locke. And third, I \nthank those in the administration who have supported our efforts; in \nparticular, Vice President Gore, who learned about this issue during a \nvisit to my State and who got the administration's proposal to \nCongress.\n  I also thank Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. At my request, \nhe promptly stationed a pipeline inspector in my State after the \nBellingham explosion, and he has worked with us on this issue for more \nthan a year. His leadership has been critical to our efforts. I thank \nhim this evening.\n  I also thank DOT's Inspector General Kenneth Mead, Kelly Coyner, who \nis the administrator of DOT's Office of Research and Special Programs \nAdministration, and the director of the Office of Pipeline Safety, \nStacey Gerard, and her predecessor, Richard Felder.\n  I thank Jim Hall, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard.\n  Many groups played a role in moving this process forward. I thank the \nNational Pipeline Reform Coalition, SAFE Bellingham, and the Cascade \nColumbia Alliance. I also thank everyone who testified at the numerous \nhearings, and the many Federal and State officials who have worked on \nthis issue.\n  Finally, I thank my colleagues in the Senate, especially Commerce \nCommittee Chairman John McCain, who has been stalwart in his support \nand has been working with us every step of the way. I thank my \ncolleague Senator Gorton and his staff who have worked with us \ndiligently on this issue; Senator Hollings; Senator Inouye, all the \nmembers of the Commerce Committee and their staffs, and Dale Learn from \nmy office.\n  Senator Bingaman should also be thanked for his leadership. He made \nthe bill stronger by adding a needed research and development \namendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor.\n  I thank the many reporters and editorial writers who helped raise \npublic awareness about the need to improve pipeline safety.\n  While we have cleared a major hurdle, our work is not finished. This \nbill must now pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the \nPresident. We don't have much time. Let's use today's passage to \nenergize the efforts of the House so we can improve pipeline safety in \ncommunities across America this year.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a short statement about the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, which the Senate will pass \ntonight through unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, to understand this legislation, you must understand \nthe situation from which we started. The federal government, through \nthe Department of Transportation, regulates more than 2,000 gas \npipeline operators with more than 1.3 million miles of pipe and more \nthan 200 hazardous liquid pipeline operators with more than 156,000 \nmiles of pipe. To protect the public safety, the environment and \nmaintain reliability in the energy system over that massive system is \nan enormous challenge. I don't doubt that. The responsibility for \nmeeting that challenge, no matter how great it is, falls upon the \nindustry and federal government, specifically, DOT's Office of Pipeline \nSafety. It is clear that both OPS and the industry have failed to raise \nto that challenge, and we have paid a high price.\n  According to the OPS, since 1984, there have been approximately 5,700 \nnatural gas and oil pipeline accidents nationwide, 54 of them in my \nhome state of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, nearly 4,000 natural gas and \noil pipeline ruptures--more than one each day--caused the deaths of 201 \npeople, injuries to another 2,829 people, cost at least $780 million in \nproperty damages, and resulted in enormous environmental contamination \nand ecological damages. Two accidents in particular show us the tragic \nconsequences of pipeline accidents. On June 10, 1999, a leaking \ngasoline pipeline erupted into a fireball in Bellingham, Washington. \nThe fire extended more than one and half miles, killing two 10-year-old \nboys and a young man. The second accident took place in August in \nCarlsbad, New Mexico. A leaking natural gas pipeline erupted killing 12 \nmembers of an extended family on a camping trip. My sympathies go out \nto all those involved in these incidents. They are truly tragic.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee and others have investigated the cause \nof this tragic record. What we found, sadly, is that OPS was simply \nfailing to do its job. The head of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, Jim Hall, gave the OPS ``a big fat F'' for its work. And as we \nconsidered the legislation in the Commerce Committee, I found that OPS \nhad fallen short in the area of enforcement, in particular. Enforcement \nis the backbone of any system of safeguards designed to protect the \npublic and the environment. Without the threat of tough enforcement, \ncompanies, the unfortunate record shows, do not consistently comply \nwith safeguards. The resulting harm to people and places is \npredictable. I will not outline all of the details here today, but I \nrecommend to anyone interested that they read the General Accounting \nOffice's investigation into OPS dated May 2000.\n  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000 includes enforcement \nreforms and enhances the role of OPS and the Department of Justice in \nenforcement. These provisions, which I proposed in the Commerce \nCommittee, will, I believe, put some teeth into our pipeline safety \nlaws. They include raising the maximum fines that OPS can assess a \ncompany from $500,000 to $1,000,000; ensuring that companies cannot \nprofit from noncompliance; clarifying the law regarding one-call \nservices; and allowing DOJ, at the request of DOT, to seek civil \npenalties in court to ensure that serious violators can be punished to \nthe fullest extent of the law.\n  The bill makes other significant improvements to existing law. My \ncolleagues from Washington, Mr. Gorton and Mrs. Murray have outlined \nmany of these improvements and how they will improve pipeline safety. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nMr. President, S. 2438, despite significant improvements, also falls \nshort in some areas. This is, in part, a reflection of inadequacy of \ncurrent protections. It is my hope that further improvements can be \nmade in conference with House and in discussions with the Clinton \nAdministration. These improvements include allowing OPS to delegate \nenforcement to states as we do with the Clean Air Act and other laws; \nestablishing federal standards for testing, re-testing, and repairs, \nleak detection, emergency shut-off valves, and failsafe mechanisms to \nprevent over pressurization; establishing federal standards to improve \ncorrosion prevention; and removing the cost-benefit provisions \nincorporated into the law during the 1996 reauthorization, which may \nlimit development of pipeline safety standards by requiring any new \nstandards to meet economic and judicial tests that no other federal \nagency's regulations must meet.\n  I do not mean to detract from the hard work of Mr. McCain, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Domenici with \nmy remarks. They have done great work crafting this bill and bringing \nit before the Senate for passage tonight. The public and the \nenvironment will be better protected thanks to their work.\n\n\n                             section 10(b)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues Mr. \nBrownback and Mr. Kerry to make clear the intent of certain provisions \nin the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. It has come to my \nattention that there may be some ambiguities contained in the language \nof Section 10(b) of the proposed legislation (S. 2438). As you are \naware, Section 10(b) of the bill adds a new provision--Section \n60117(b)(3)--to the Revised Pipeline Safety Act. This provision \nrequires that, during the course of an incident investigation, a \npipeline owner or operator make records, reports, and information \nrelevant to the incident investigation available to the Secretary upon \nrequest within the time limits prescribed in a written request. The \nbill incorporates by reference this new section into both the civil and \ncriminal penalties sections of the Act, Sections 60122(a) and 60123(a), \nrespectively. Under the current proposal, failure to comply with this \nreporting provision can result in civil penalties of up to $500,000 for \neach violation and $1,000,000 for a related series of violations. And, \na separate violation occurs for each day the violation continues.\n  Civil penalties are capped at a maximum of $500,000 per day and \n$1,000,000 for a ``related series of violations.'' The information \nrequired to be produced during an investigation pursuant to Section \n60117(b)(3) is limited to information ``relevant to [a particular] \nincident investigation.'' I am seeking clarification that all \ninformation requests issued by the Secretary pursuant to a single \nincident investigation are considered ``related'' for purposes of \ncalculating the $1,000,000 civil penalty cap for a ``related series of \nviolations'' under Section 60122(a). In other words, the provision \nwould not treat each written information request as a separate and \nunrelated event for purposes of applying the $1,000,000 cap so long as \nall of the requests concern the same incident. Were that not the case, \na pipeline owner or operator that receives numerous document requests \nrelating to an incident, but is unable to assemble and provide all of \nthe information in time to meet the Secretary's deadline, could face \nfines far exceeding the $1,000,000 contemplated by this legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my friend, Mr. Hollings, for his question. It is \nthe intention of this legislation to treat all information requests \npursuant to a single incident investigation as ``related'' for purposes \nof applying the civil penalty cap under Section 60122(a). To increase \nthe incentive for pipeline companies to cooperate during an agency \ninvestigation, the cap has been increased to $1,000,000 for a related \nseries of violations. That $1,000,000 cap is not intended to separately \napply to each and every information request--of which there could be \nmany--but rather serves as a restriction on the total amount of civil \npenalties applicable to a particular incident for failure to comply \nwith the reporting requirement of Section 60117(b)(3).\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an additional \nprovision of the legislation. It is my understanding that Section \n60117(b)(3) is aimed at penalizing pipeline companies that either \nrefuse to turn over records, reports, or information concerning an \nincident that is identified in a written request from the Secretary or \nrefuse to produce the records, reports or information in a timely \nfashion. While it is critically important to ensure that companies \nactively aid the agency's investigative process by promptly providing \ninformation related to an incident, there may be situations where a \ncompany goes to great lengths to cooperate with an investigation, but \nfor a variety of reasons falls short of fully satisfying the \nrequirements of Section 60117(b)(3). For example, the information \nsolicited in a written request may be unclear or otherwise subject to \nmultiple interpretations. A company may promptly provide the \ninformation that it believes to be fully responsive to the request only \nto find out later that the information is somehow deficient either \nbecause it is incomplete, in a different form, or of a different \ncharacter than that contemplated by the agency. In these situations, \ndespite the best of intentions, a company may find out many days or \nweeks later that it is nonetheless subject to cumulative daily civil \npenalties. I am seeking clarification that Section 60117(b)(3) is \nintended only to cover those situations where the information that the \nSecretary seeks is clear, but the company refuses to provide the \ninformation at all or within the time prescribed in the written \nrequest--not situations where a company makes a good faith effort to \nmeet the requirement but is deemed to have failed because of a written \nrequest for information this is subject to interpretation or \nambiguously written.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr, President, my friend, Mr. Brownback, is correct that \nit is the intention of Section 60117(b)(3) to reach those companies \nthat don't comply with a clearly written request for documents and \ninformation from the agency, but thwart the investigative process \neither by refusing to turn over relevant information or by dragging \ntheir feet in providing it. The bill does not contemplate that this \npenalty provision will be applied to a company that actively cooperates \nin an investigation and makes a good faith effort to provide all of the \ninformation requested only to find out later that, because of an \nambiguously or poorly written request, the company technically failed \nto meet the requirements of Section 60117(b)(3).\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I commend Chairman McCain, Senator Hollings and the \nmembers of the Commerce Committee for moving expeditiously to pass this \nPipeline Safety Reauthorization bill. The bill includes requirements \nfor each pipeline to develop an integrity management plan to address \nthe specific circumstances of each individual pipeline. There is \nreference in the Pipeline Safety Act, and the amendments, to \ncircumstances such as pipelines in environmentally sensitive and \ndensely populated areas warranting special attention, but no reference \nto pipelines that are attached to bridges at such places as river \ncrossings or in other exposed circumstances. The tragic accident in my \nState of New Mexico was adjacent to a river crossing. The rupture \noccurred along a buried section of the pipe just before the pipe \nemerged and was attached to the bridge. I am very concerned that these \npipelines are vulnerable to many different types of damage, including \neven that from a hunter's stray bullet or an auto accident. I would \nlike to ask the chairman and members of the committee whether these \nexposed pipes on bridges are a category given special attention?\n  Mr. GORTON. Unlike inspections conducted on overland sections of \npipeline, the inspector would need specialized knowledge to properly \ndetermine the structural integrity and soundness of, say, a cable \nsuspension bridge, in addition to that of the pipeline. This would \nprobably include an understanding of and training in: steel \nfabrication, structural engineering fundamentals, pipeline behavior \nunder operating pressure, the characteristics of all cable types used \nin suspension bridges, and the characteristics of reinforced concrete \nfoundation structures.\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The committee has worked to ensure all pipelines are \ncovered under the provisions of this legislation, including the more \nuniquely located pipelines mentioned by my colleagues. The bill \nrequires the agency's technical experts, in conjunction with the \nindustry, to develop specific plans to ensure the integrity of all \npipelines. In addition, it requires that operators and inspectors are \nproperly trained to be aware of, and proactively assess, the \nvulnerabilities of such pipelines in different circumstances, including \nexposed pipelines.\n  Mr. GORTON. Regardless of location, type of pipeline, size or \nterrain, a program to maintain and inspect the integrity of all \npipelines is required to ensure the public safety, environmental \nprotection and reliability of the infrastructure. In fact, the agency \nshould be consulting with the bridge inspection specialists in the \nvarious other Federal and State agencies.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators for that clarification.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2438), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
