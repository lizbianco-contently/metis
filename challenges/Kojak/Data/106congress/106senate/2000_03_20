We thank You for the inspiring memory of Queen \nEsther who, in the fifth century B.C., threw caution to the wind and \ninterceded with her husband, the King of Persia, to save the exiled \nJewish people from persecution. The words of her uncle Mordecai sound \nin our souls: ``You have come to the kingdom for such a time as \nthis.''--Esther 4:14.\n  Lord of circumstances, we are moved profoundly by the way You use \nindividuals to accomplish Your plans and arrange what seem to be \ncoincidences to bring about Your will for Your people. You have brought \neach of us to Your kingdom for such a time as this. You whisper in our \nsouls, ``I have plans for you, plans for good and not for evil, to give \nyou a future and a hope.''--Jeremiah 29:11.\n  Grant the Senators a heightened sense of the special role You have \ngiven them to play in the unfolding drama of American history. Give \nthem a sense of destiny and a deep dependence on Your guidance and \ngrace.\n  On Purim, we renew our commitment to fight against sectarian \nintolerance in our own hearts and religious persecution in so many \nplaces in our world. This is Your world; let us not forget that \n``though the wrong seems oft so strong, You are the Ruler yet.''

Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business \nthroughout the day, and tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of \nH.R. 5, the Social Security earnings test legislation. Under a previous \nagreement, there will be approximately 4 hours of debate with three \namendments in order to the bill. I expect votes will occur during \nTuesday's session of the Senate on one or two of the amendments to the \nbill. However, I expect final passage will not occur until Wednesday \nmorning at approximately 10 o'clock. I will need to consult further \nwith the Democratic leadership as to the exact time for that vote.\n  During the remainder of the week, the Senate will also consider any \nof the following items: Crop insurance legislation that was reported \nout of the Agriculture Committee a couple of weeks ago, plus any \nnominations from the Executive Calendar that might be cleared. \nTherefore, votes should be expected throughout the remainder of the \nweek, certainly Wednesday and Thursday. Also, Senators should be on \nnotice that we expect to begin the budget resolution next week, the \nweek of March 27, and Senators may expect votes likely will occur on \nFriday, March 31.\n  We had indicated earlier in the year that if we saw a Friday where \nthere would very likely be some votes, we would let Senators know as \nsoon as we could, in order to comply with the budget resolution rules, \nwhich is up to 50 hours of debate and amendments in order. Senators \nwill recall that sometimes we have a number of amendments at the end of \nthe process, so it could take us into Thursday night or over into that \nFriday, March 31. Of course, if there is a change in that, we will let \nSenators know, but we need to conclude that budget resolution as soon \nas possible so the Appropriations Committee can go forward with its \nbills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1441-6", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1441-S1442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes of my \nleader's time to talk about the Social Security earnings limitation.\n  I am very proud that the Senate is going to be taking up that issue \nthis week and that we have a unanimous consent agreement which will \nlimit us to only two or three amendments. One of those amendments is a \ntechnical correction, and then we have one by Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska and one by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  We have talked for years about the unfairness of Social Security \nrecipients losing Social Security money if they need to continue \nworking or want to continue working. At a time when we have a need for \nseniors who are 65, 66, 67 years old to meet the demands of our \nincreased job availability market in America, it is the logical thing \nto do. Unfortunately, for many years we talked about it and did not do \nanything.\n  The House of Representatives deserves credit for taking the lead on \nthis issue, and now we find it is developing bipartisan support of \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate and an indication that the \nPresident will sign it. It is long overdue, and I think it is an \nimportant issue. I hope a number of Senators will comment on it today \nand that we will have debate on the two amendments tomorrow and \nconclude this no later than Wednesday morning.\n\n  So I am pleased we are able to proceed in this way, and I look \nforward to\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\ncompleting action on this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we on this side of the aisle look forward to \nworking on eliminating the Social Security earnings limitation. I just \nreturned from Nevada. It was amazing the number of people who came up \nto me and said, Are you going to do finally something about eliminating \nthe earnings test on Social Security? As the leader has said, we have \ntalked about this a long time but done nothing. It is time now that we \njoin together, as we are going to do Wednesday, to pass this important \nbill.\n  This legislation will pass overwhelmingly with both Democrats and \nRepublicans voting for it. Why? Because the America of today is much \ndifferent from the America of 1935 when Social Security came into \nbeing. People are living much longer lives, healthier lives, more \nproductive lives, and there is no reason in the world why we do not \nhave people working as long as they want and as hard as they want. We \nneed to remove this limitation. We have a problem in America today in \nits lack of productivity. This legislation will help a great deal \nbecause some of the most productive people in the world are people who \nare over age 65. So I look forward to joining Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle to make sure we pass this bill as quickly as possible. As the \nleader said, we should do it Wednesday afternoon.\n  In looking forward to next week, to the budget resolution, this is a \ntime where we have an opportunity to look at what the Nation is going \nto do financially for the coming year. I think it is important we all \nprepare for this debate. There is a limited amount of time we can \ndebate this issue. There is no limitation on the number of amendments \nthat can be offered. We certainly hope there is not an unlimited number \nof amendments, but that people will give thought and consideration to \nthe ones that are most important.\n  The Democrats today are going to take some time to talk about a \nnumber of issues, and leading the debate will be the chairman of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee, Senator Byron Dorgan. When he is called \nupon, he is going to talk about a number of issues.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has certainly been a leader on the \nissue of the Federal Reserve System, and there is no one who has been \nmore articulate when talking about the need to do something about the \nFederal Reserve System and its secretive nature, and the fact that, as \nan example, they have a $3.5 billion slush fund that is there to be \nused for many other programs in the Federal Government.\n  There is no need to have the Federal Reserve with this amount of \nmoney, this pot of money, this $3.5 billion that they simply have never \nused since its inception. This money can be used for education. It can \nbe used for many of the other programs for which we are searching for \nmoney. I hope during today we will have a good discussion on issues \nthat are affecting this country and that tomorrow we move forward on \nthe social security earnings legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1442-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, as we observe the arrival of the \nvernal equinox and, with it, the official arrival of spring, the words \nof the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge come easily to mind:\n\n     All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair--\n     The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing--\n     And Winter slumbering in the open air,\n     Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!\n\n  Washington has turned her smiling face towards spring as well. The \nroadsides, so recently painted gray-brown with grit and dirt in the \nwake of receding glaciers of snow mounded up by mastodon plow trucks, \nhave greened again. The brave crocuses have forced their way through \nthe still-cold Earth to offer their first bright promise of warmer \nweather, the merry forsythia mirrors the Sun's golden light, and the \npear and magnolia trees are softening the gray weave of bare branches \nwith their pink and white petals. Washington's famous cherry blossoms \nwill soon be adding their dainty petals to the spring breezes.\n  It is time for the soft whisper of falling snow to be replaced by the \nconversational patter of spring rains. It is time for the volume to be \nturned up from the quiet solos of solitary winter birds to the rousing, \nfull-throated chorus of springtime birdsongs.\n\n     I asked the robin, as he sprang\n     From branch to branch and sweetly sang,\n     What made his breast so round and red;\n     Twas ``looking at the sun,'' he said;\n\n     I asked the violets, sweet and blue,\n     Sparkling in the morning dew,\n     Whence came their colors, then so shy;\n     They answered, ``looking to the sky'';\n\n     I saw the roses, one by one,\n     Unfold their petals to the sun,\n     I asked them what made their tints so bright,\n     And they answered, ``looking to the light'';\n\n     I asked the thrush, whose silvery note\n     Came like a song from angel's throat,\n     Why he sang in the twilight dim;\n     He answered, ``looking up at Him.''\n\n  We have this full-throated chorus of springtime voices--the violets, \nthe roses, the robin, the thrush, the other bird songs--and it is time \nto spade up the garden, releasing the intoxicating perfume of rich, \nmoist earth. How my little dog, Billy, loves that scent. He stands \nwatch over the spade as I prepare the ground for my tomatoes, and his \nears are pricked up, his tail is wagging, his eyes are shining with \nanticipation, waiting to chip in with paws flying, heedless of the dirt \nhe will track into the house on his white coat. You see, he is a \nMaltese. This is Billy Byrd--Billy Byrd II. I used to have another dog. \nIt was a cocker spaniel, but it was Billy Byrd I.\n  It is also time to marvel at the mysteries of God's designs as we \nwatch daffodils burn their way through dense layers of last year's \nleathery leaves in order to put on their bright show. It is time to \nwonder how a tiny crocus bulb, no larger than a thumbnail and no \nheavier than a dust-dry clod of earth, can push aside frozen Earth, \nmelt its way through snow or ice, just to put out four colorful petals. \nI sometimes wonder for whom the crocuses' show is, for surely crocuses \nbloom too early for even the hardiest bee.\n  William Shakespeare observed that, ``There is no ancient gentlemen \nbut gardeners . . . They hold up Adam's profession.'' There is indeed a \nkinship among gardeners, whether serious gardeners whose gardens are \ntheir lifelong avocation, or the duffer with a few beds who buys plants \nat the local hardware store each spring. All gardeners are, at heart, \noptimists. They have to be. This season allows the gardener each year \nto fall in love all over again, and to wear on his smiling face a dream \nof spring and of greatness in the garden. He stands outside, shovel in \nnot-yet-blistered hand, and has visions. He sees, not the patchy lawn \nand unkempt flowerbeds worn by winter, but some grand turf flowing like \na green sea between islands of color, Sun, and shade.\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nHe foresees the abundance of the garden overflowing from his table to \nthose of his friends and family. In March, it is not possible to truly \nbelieve that there will ever be too many tomatoes, too many zucchini, \ntoo many cucumbers. Each seed in the brightly colored envelope, each \nsmall budding plant, is precious and deserving of an opportunity to \ngrow. Each is a gamble, but a gamble in which the gardener believes the \nodds are on his side. And why not? God is also on his side. Not all the \nplants will make it, but enough will, and those survivors will often \nexceed his most fecund imaginings.\n  West Virginia is full of master gardeners. Their pantries and cellars \nare treasure houses filled with jewel-tone quart jars of ruby tomatoes, \nemerald green beans, and sapphire blueberries. Crystal quilted jelly \njars hold not precious unguents, but the ambrosia of the gods--homemade \njams, jellies, and preserves distilled from the freshest strawberries, \nplums, cherries, quinces, apples, and blackberries. West Virginia's \nhome canners are well prepared to cope with the bounteous overflow of \nthe overambitious gardener.\n  To be a gardener is not only to be optimistic, but also to be \npatient. If something does not work out this year, there is always a \ndifferent scheme next year. Over time, even the most scraggly sapling \nwill reach majestic maturity, towering over the landscape and altering \nthe microclimate of the yard with its shade and its earthmoving roots. \nThe sun-loving flowers near it will gradually be replaced by those \nwhich tolerate increasing amounts of shade. No garden is a static \nplace--how could it be?--filled with so much polite but fierce \ncompetition among its denizens, and always under attack by invading \ninsects and dreaded diseases--black spot, to be sure, rather than the \nBlack Plague, but dreaded, nonetheless.\n  To be a gardener is to be close to the Creator, to follow in His \nexample. You see, God made the country; man made the town. To be, as \nShakespeare said, holding up Adam's profession, that is what it is to \nbe a gardener. We each try to create, at least in our dreams, our own \nsmall Eden. We learn the great lessons of life as we cultivate patience \nand nurture our optimism. In a garden one sees, up close--up close, up \nreal close--the great mysteries of birth, life, struggle, death, yes, \nand renewal, writ small enough to comprehend and only then, to \ntranslate into some larger understanding that may, with age, approach \nwisdom. My chaplain will say, in a garden, God speaks to us simply, in \nthe language of flowers.\n\n     The kiss of the sun for pardon,\n     The song of the birds for mirth,\n     One is nearer God's Heart in the garden\n     Than anywhere else on earth.\n\n  So said Dorothy Frances Gurney, and surely her words are even more \ntrue in the spring garden than at any other time of year. It gives me \njoy to watch the greening of the earth, once again, and to witness the \ntriumph of each little bulb and each little bud as it bursts forth, \nvictorious over the chill of winter. I am filled with warmth that is \neasy to share, as I and my colleagues in Adam's profession emerge from \nour winter hibernation into the soft spring air and, with smiling \nfaces, dream of spring.\n\n     The year's at the spring\n     And day's at the morn;\n     Morning's at seven;\n     The hillside's dew-pearled;\n     The lark's on the wing;\n     The snail's on the thorn;\n     God's in His Heaven--\n     All is right with the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. In many ways, you have never really heard spring described \nuntil you have heard it described by the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. It also fits with something I come to the floor to talk \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1443-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1443-S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have over 2,000 family farmers who have \narrived in Washington, DC, this morning. In other times and other \ncircumstances, they would be preparing for spring planting.\n  Spring is a time for farmers to begin thinking about getting to the \nfield to plant their seeds and do the work family farmers do. But \ninstead of preparing for spring planting, 2,000 family farmers are here \nin Washington, DC, today.\n  I intend to leave this Chamber and have lunch with them. They are \nholding a ``farmer's share lunch'', just steps from the Capitol on the \nlawn in the upper Senate park beside the Russell Building. A customer \nbuying this same lunch at a restaurant or in some other venue in \nWashington, DC would pay $10. These farmers are charging the portion of \nthe food dollar they get: From a $10 lunch, they get approximately 39 \ncents. So over in the park, farmers will be providing lunch for 39 \ncents to demonstrate how little of America's food dollar family farmers \nare getting.\n  We have such a serious problem on America's family farms. Two \nthousand of those family farmers have come to Washington, DC, to say to \nthe Federal Government that the public policy dealing with family \nfarmers simply isn't working. If it is in the interests of our country \nto preserve a network of family farms to produce America's food--if \nthose are our policy interests in America--then we must change public \npolicy because the current farm program does not work.\n  There is a fellow in North Dakota named Dave Smith. He is a farmer in \nMakoti, ND. Frankly, I have never met Dave Smith. He calls himself the \nFlying Farmer. He has developed a hobby of jumping over stock cars. He \nbuilds a ramp, jumps these cars, and dives over to the other side. He \nwears a helmet and performs at the county fairs and the State fairs.\n  I have seen him do these tricks a couple of times and have always \nwondered what would persuade someone to do these things?\n  Let me tell you how he got in the ``Guinness Book of World Records''. \nDave Smith, the Flying Farmer, from Makoti, ND, set a world record by \ndriving in reverse for 500 miles at an average speed of 34 miles per \nhour.\n  I am thinking to myself: Why would someone want to do that? But then \nI recognized that it reminds me of public policy as it affects family \nfarmers, an endurance race in the wrong direction.\n  The question is, What do we do to stop this movement in the wrong \ndirection and start it in the right direction? What do we do for family \nfarmers?\n\n  I have on previous occasions talked in the Senate about what one \nfinds when going to Europe. Go to the European countryside, visit with \ntheir farmers and go to the small towns that rely on families who live \noff the land. Get a feeling for how things are going in rural Europe.\n  Farmers are doing well in Europe. Small towns are doing fine in \nEurope. There is life; one can feel it. One can sense it. Why? Because \nEurope has decided that as a matter of public policy, the kind of \neconomy they want is an economy that has food production based on the \nfamily unit. They want to maintain and retain family farmers in their \nfuture. It is a deliberate public policy in Europe. They have been \nhungry, and they don't intend to go hungry again. They want broad-based \nownership of food production in Europe.\n  I found it interesting that the European trade representatives, who \nare often vilified--and perhaps I do it from time to time--talked about \ntrade in agriculture in the context of families and communities when I \nmet with them at the WTO meeting in Seattle. ``Multifunctionality'' is \nthe term they used. They talked about the impact on family farmers and \nthe relationship to building communities as a result of a network of \nfarms in the countryside.\n  Our trade negotiators look at trade through the pristine view of one \nword--markets, as though it doesn't have anything to do with families \nor communities. As if somehow there is no relationship between virtue \nand math when it comes to the question of profits and losses. I want to \ntalk for a couple of minutes about the fallacy of all of that.\n  These days, when there is so much economic prosperity in so much of \nour country, and we are blessed with so many things, we find that in \nthe granaries, garages and in the machine sheds of America's family \nfarms, families are gathering trying to figure out: How do we get this \nequipment ready for the field work in the spring to plant a crop? Will \nour banker lend us the money to buy seeds and fuel and fertilizer, for \nexample, to once again try\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nto make a living on the family farm? Or are we now going to lose our \ndream? Will we, after 30 years of trying, lose the opportunity to \ncontinue farming this year because prices have collapsed and our trade \nagreements have not been good for agriculture?\n  Interest rates are going up. So many other things are confronting the \nfarmer over which they have no control.\n  I will show a few charts that describe what is happening to America's \nfamily farms. The families who have come to town, the 2,000 of them, to \nsay there is something wrong that needs to be fixed, here is what they \nare confronted with. Look what has happened to the farmer's share of \nthe retail beef dollar. It has dropped precipitously.\n  This chart shows the farmer's share of the retail pork dollar--it is \nalmost interchangeable--a dramatic collapse in 19 years. For North \nDakota, where we raise a great deal of grain, this chart shows the \nfarmer's share of the cereal grains dollar. Some might say, well, we \nare importing a lot of food; consumers are able to access cheaper food. \nHave you been to the grocery store lately and taken a look at the bar \ncodes of hamburgers or bread or that which is made from cereal grain or \nlivestock? Have you noticed that food prices have come down? I don't \nthink so. Grain prices have collapsed.\n  For a while, we had a very substantial collapse in livestock prices. \nIn fact, at one point about a year ago, a hog that brought the hog \nproducer $20 on the market for an entire hog had its meat sold for \n$300. So what happened between the $20 the farmer got for selling an \nentire hog and the $300 that was charged at the grocery store counter \nfor the meat from the very same hog? The middle folks, the folks who \nhandle all of that, are making a lot of money. The farmer is left with \nthe carcass.\n  I will mention a couple of other items with respect to the family \nfarm. Farmers have come to the Nation's Capital to ask for a change. We \npassed a piece of farm legislation some years ago. I voted against it, \nbut nonetheless it passed. It essentially pulled the rug out from under \nfamily farmers. It said they should all just operate in the \nmarketplace.\n\n  That sounds good enough, if the marketplace were a fair marketplace \nand farmers were involved in fair competition with others who produce \nfood around the world. That is not the case. Our trade agreements \ninjure family farmers rather than help them. They don't have an \nopportunity to pay a fair interest rate because the Federal Reserve \nBoard is jacking up the cost of money in a manner that is totally \nunjustified. They deal with monopolies in every direction they turn. If \nthey want to put their grain on a railroad, the railroad is \novercharging them. What is going to happen is if they are going to sell \ntheir cattle to packing companies, three or four packing companies are \ninvolved in 80 to 85 percent of all the steer slaughter in this \ncountry. It is the same with pork and lamb. Family farmers are \ncompeting in a game in which the deck is stacked.\n  We have a policy establishment in Washington that views all of this \nthrough a very clear lens. It is a limited vision, but the direction \nthey look appears clear to them. This, in some of their minds, is kind \nof a ``stuff Olympics.'' Those who produce the most stuff get the most \nmedals, even if you are producing stuff you already have too much of \nand not producing what you need. For example, in rural America, if you \nare producing what nurtures and strengthens communities, that is \nirrelevant according to these folks. The policy establishment says that \nis not what we are about. We are about the ``stuff Olympics.'' Those \nwho produce the most stuff win.\n  Of course, that is not a proper way to look at who we are and what we \nwant to be. The markets are fine, but markets are not always fair. We, \nas a country, have a right, as Europe has a right and has done, to \ndecide what kind of economy we want. What kind of things do we want \nproduced from the arrangements of production? If we say we need better \ncommunities, stronger families living on the land and a network of \nproducers producing America's food, then we need to question whether \nour economic arrangements contribute to that end. Clearly, the answer \nnow is no.\n  Should we not support the form of agriculture that contributes to \nthat kind of economy and that kind of society? What is the farm program \nreally for? These farmers have come to town saying the farm program \ndoesn't work. What is it really for?\n  In my judgment, we don't need a farm program. We could abolish it if \nits goal is not simple and singular. We should have a farm program that \nis designed to support and sustain a network of families living on \nAmerica's agricultural land. If that is not the goal of the farm \nprogram, then we don't need one. If someone wants to farm an entire \ncounty, God bless them, but they don't need the Government's help. But \nwhen prices collapse, if families who are living on that farm don't \nhave a bridge across those price valleys, they are simply not going to \nmake it from one side to the other.\n  My belief is that the contribution a network of family farms makes to \nour country is irreplaceable and invaluable. Let me tell my colleagues \nabout that contribution, that lifestyle, because I come from a State I \ndearly love. It embodies those values that America needs more of.\n  We have a man and a wife in Sentinel Butte, ND, who own a gas \nstation. Perhaps I have told the Senate about this before. They are \nnear retirement age and don't want to keep the gas station open all \nday. This is a town of under 100 people. They decided that when they \nclose at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, they would hang the key on a nail. \nIf you need gas, you drive up and take the key, unlock the pump, and \nfill up. Then you are supposed to make a note that you did that.\n  Yes, that is true. Yes, that happens in my home State, a small \ncommunity of under 100 people who understand the value of the small \ntown cafe, the hub of life in a small community, and can't afford to \nkeep the small town restaurant open. How do they do it? A signup sheet. \nEverybody in town has to volunteer to work for nothing to keep the \nrestaurant open.\n  Yes, that is the way the restaurant works in Havana, ND. Tuttle, ND, \na town of under 100 people, lost their grocery store. What to do? They \ncould not find anybody to start a grocery store. So the town itself--\nthe community--built a grocery store. Yes, the town owns the grocery \nstore because that is the kind of town they want and the kind of life \nthey want.\n  I may have told the Senate about the woman who owns the flower shop \nin Mott, ND. A town 14 miles from Regent, my hometown. My parents are \nburied in the cemetery in Regent, ND, a town of 270 people. We always \nsend flowers to my mother's grave on Mother's Day from the Mott Florist \nShop. They are always apologetic for charging a couple of dollars extra \nto send them to the Regent cemetery, which is 14 miles away.\n  The Mott Florist Shop is quite a place. This year, my brother called \nthem--he or I usually call them--and he asked them to deliver flowers \nfor Memorial Day. He said, ``By the way, I forgot to call on Mother's \nDay when we usually order flowers for my mother's grave.'' She said, \n``That's all right. I figured you forgot so we sent flowers over to \nyour mother's grave anyway. I figured I would send you a bill later, \nand if you paid it, OK; if not, that's OK, too.''\n  Where does that happen in this country? It is pretty special to have \nthose kinds of communities and people.\n  About the same time that happened, I read an article in the \nnewspaper--and I don't mean to be pejorative about New York City \nbecause it is a wonderful city, but a fellow died on the subway and he \ncontinued riding 4 or 5 hours on the subway before somebody discovered \nhe was dead. Big difference. Rural values, community, responsibility, \nlooking out for each other, helping each other, knowing each other--\nthat is part of what we need to be as a country.\n  I worry so much that we are losing a great deal of that in the way we \ndeal with public policy. Thomas Jefferson used to say that the kind of \nagriculture we choose in this country affects the kind of communities \nwe have. It affects the kind of Nation we are going to be. He was dead \nright about that.\n  That is why the issue that these folks have come to town to discuss, \nthe 2,000 farmers, who otherwise would be in their machine shed getting \nready for spring's work, working on the transmission, greasing the \ntractor, going to town to get the seed, all excited about\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nbeing able to finally get that tractor started and getting out and \nplowing the ground and putting seeds in the ground, are instead over \nhere about a block away. And I am going to get there soon. They are \nhere to say family farming matters to this country and Congress must do \nsomething to help or we will be left with corporate agriculture from \nCalifornia to Maine, and it will be different. A part of America will \nbe gone forever. Some say: Well, that's the way it is. The family farm \nis like the little diner left behind when an interstate highway comes \nthrough, and it is too bad; it was a wonderful place to have soup and \nsandwiches. But that is life.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let us go back 2,000 years to the small \nfamily farms on the Italian peninsula. Those small family farms \nproduced the rugged soldiers who helped ancient Rome to conquer all of \nthe countries around the Mediterranean basin. Those family farms \nproduced men and women who believed in the gods. They were pagan gods, \nbut those ancient Romans believed in those gods, venerated their \nforefathers, their ancestors, taught their children to respect \nauthority, to respect law, to respect the state. And the ancient Romans \nfelt that the gods had in mind a particular destiny for their country. \nEach Roman felt that it was his duty to help to promote that destiny of \nhis state. And then came the latifundia, the great corporate farms. \nSenators bought up land. They became huge farms. The farmers, the \npeasants, left the land and migrated into the cities and became a part \nof the mob that sought the theater and free bread.\n\n  And when that happened, remember that the Roman legions, which \nconstituted the greatest military fighting machine of that time, were \nable to get their recruits from the farms. When the peasants left the \nland, left the home, and the home deteriorated and the belief in the \ngods dimmed and faded, the great Roman Senate weakened, lost its way, \nlost its nerve, and without being forced to ceded to the dictators--the \nCaesars, and later the Emperors--the power of the purse, that was the \nbeginning of the end. Rome collapsed.\n  The same thing has happened here in America. When we look at our \ncolonial forebears, they had the stamina, the stern discipline of the \nancient Romans. They believed in a creator, and the home was where the \nvalues were inculcated into the young people. They respected the law, \nthey respected authority, they respected their fathers and mothers, and \nthey took seriously the Biblical injunction ``honor thy father and thy \nmother.''\n  We can take a lesson from the ancient Romans and many a leaf out of \ntheir history because there were several parallels between those \nancient Romans and our colonial ancestors and the America that was--not \nthe America that is, but the America that was--up until 50 years ago, \nor some such.\n  I am in the very mood at this moment to commend my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, when he talks \nabout these farmers. They are the people who toil the earth. They have \nto depend upon the weather; it is uncertain. They can't count on, from \nmonth to month or year to year, what the weather is going to be, how \ndependable it is going to be. What a life they have to live. It is a \nrugged life, but it is a clean life--clean in that they understand what \nit is to be near the soil and near God's great tradition. I wish that \nmore of our young people grew up on the farm. There was a time in this \ncountry when 90 percent of the population was from the farms. That day \nis long gone.\n  I thank the Senator, who so often enlightens this great body on \nissues of importance to the country. He has his head screwed on right. \nHis heart is where it ought to be. He has sound wisdom. He has done a \ngreat service today speaking about the small farmers. I personally \nthank him for what he means to the Senate and to the people of his \nState.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from West \nVirginia that I am humbled by his words. I was on a radio talk show \nearlier this morning for an hour or so. When he said I had my head \nscrewed on right, I just say that is the nicest thing said about me all \nday.\n  I appreciate very much the comments the Senator made.\n  I also say this is not about nostalgia. It is about a country having \nto choose the kind of future it wants, a country measuring what it \nwants to achieve with its economy, and a country that determines what \nhas value.\n  It is so much a disconnection to me that we are the largest arms \nseller in the world by far--somewhere around $10 to 12 billion a year. \nA fair amount of those purchases are from countries that can least \nafford to purchase jet fighter planes, tanks, and weapons of war, and, \nyet, they do.\n  In those same Third World countries that are purchasing arms, people \nare desperately hungry. At the same time that people are desperately \nhungry for food in so many places in the world, and hundreds of \nmillions of people go to bed with an ache deep in their belly because \nthey haven't had enough to eat, then in Mohall, ND, in the morning \nsomeone will load a two-ton truck with wheat and drive to the elevator \nand will be told by the grain trade: Your food doesn't have value. Your \nfood just doesn't have value. Yet we know it costs you $4.50 a bushel \nto produce it, but it is only worth $2.30 a bushel because it just \ndoesn't have value.\n  What a serious disconnection. We need to find a way to create value \nin our country for that which matters: the production and work of \nfamily farmers and the risks of what family farmers produce; yes, food \nfor a hungry world, but also the social structure of a community and a \nrural economy.\n  Mr. Critchfield, a wonderful author, wrote a book called ``Those \nDays.'' He talked about the ``seed bed'' of family values in America \nfor over two centuries from family farms to small towns to big cities. \nIt was always the ``seed bed'' of family values.\n  When a man named Ernest in Regent, ND, collapsed of a heart attack \nright near harvest, his neighbors brought the combines over to take his \nwheat off the field? If his neighbors were in corporate America, they \nwould be called competitors. But on family farms, they are neighbors. \nAnd they are part of a social structure that works together. But they \ncan't work together and make a living when grain prices have collapsed. \nThey need a safety net of some type that says: You matter, you have \nvalue, and you are important to our country's economy.\n  I wish to mention two other quick items that affect family farmers in \na very significant way. They came to town today. In fact, I was on an \nairplane with some of them last evening. Most of them came by bus but a \nfew came on the airplane--last evening, today, and tomorrow.\n  Two things will happen here in Washington, DC: One, the Federal \nReserve Board will meet. When they do, it won't be as if they are doing \nit in front of television cameras. It will be behind closed doors. They \nwill make a decision in secret. We will not be a part of it. There will \nbe no discussion and no debate. These central bankers will make a \ndecision about whether to increase interest rates once again. All of \nthe evidence is that they will do so.\n  Those poor farmers who are coming to town asking for some assistance \nwhen prices have collapsed will find one more time that the Federal \nReserve Board has boosted their cost of production by increasing \ninterest rates.\n  What is the justification for that? The answer is none. There is no \njustification. Workers' productivity is up in this country--way up. Do \nworkers in this country not have a right to more compensation if they \nare more productive?\n  Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board are worried about \ninflation. The core inflation rate that has been recently announced in \nboth the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index, which \nindicates that inflation is not a serious threat in this country. As I \nsaid, productivity is growing. Yet, somehow, Mr. Greenspan fashions \nhimself as a set of human brake pads whose sole mission in life is to \ntry to slow down the American economy.\n  It is wrong for the Federal Reserve Board to believe that too many \npeople are working and that we are growing too fast. They are worried \nabout that because they believe it will provoke more inflation. They \nhave believed\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nthat for the last several years, and they have been wrong, wrong, wrong \nin every circumstance. But it has been used as justification to \nincrease interest rates. That adds to the burden these family farmers \nhave to bear as they go out to try to borrow money to buy the seeds, \nthe fertilizer, and the fuel with which to put in their spring crops.\n  The Federal Reserve Board tomorrow will add to the burdens of these \nfarmers, in my judgment, in a manner that is wholly unjustified. \nProductivity last year grew at a substantial 3 percent rate. That surge \npushed the unit labor costs down by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter \nin 1999.\n  I have talked at length about the Federal Reserve Board. I don't mean \nto cast disrespect on their motives as people. I have said that I \ncommend Alan Greenspan for his public service but disagree with him \nfrom a policy standpoint very significantly.\n  But there is no justification for this Federal Reserve Board, the \nlast dinosaur of our government, that does all of its business in \nsecret. What other unit of government closes its doors and then says, \n``Let's decide what we want to do next to the American people''?\n  If Mr. Greenspan, as has been the subject of some of his recent \npronouncements, believes that the stock market is moving too high--\n``irrational exuberance'' he once called it--then he can take action to \ndeal with that. He could increase margin requirements, which I think he \nprobably ought to do. But instead of doing that--and he doesn't want to \ndo that--he says: I will have all the American people, especially \nproducers, pay higher interest charges. It is unwise, unfair, and \nrisky, in my judgment, to raise interests at a time when fuel costs are \nrising and commodity prices all across the board have collapsed. I \nthink it risks a significant slowdown in this economy.\n  I regret that they will take that action tomorrow. If they do, I will \nbe here to speak again briefly about it.\n  Let me take 2 additional minutes to talk about one other issue that \nwill be announced tomorrow. In addition to the Federal Reserve Board \nmeeting, there will be an announcement tomorrow morning by the Commerce \nDepartment about America's trade deficit. I expect once again that the \nmonthly trade deficit will be near record level.\n  What does that mean? It means that those family farmers who are \ngathered today in Washington, DC, asking for some help will once again \nsee the consequences of a trade policy that has not worked.\n  We are not exporting nearly enough. We are importing too much. We \nfind closed markets for agricultural commodities all around the world. \nEven when we negotiate new trade agreements, the negotiations are not \nthe independent, kind of hard-nosed negotiations that you would expect \non behalf of our producers. We do not, as a country, stand up for our \nproducers' interests.\n  I will talk at some later time about the recent bilateral trade \nagreement with China. I have spoken at great length about the NAFTA \nagreement, and Canada and Mexico, and so on. But family farmers and \nothers have a right, in my judgment, to be very concerned about these \nkinds of policies.\n  I will show a chart about the trade deficit. This chart shows what is \nhappening to this country's merchandise trade deficit. It was $347 \nbillion in 1999.\n  Let me mention China. I want to mention it just in a microcosm. We \nreached an agreement with China only months ago. A significant part of \nthis $347 billion was nearly $70 billion with China alone.\n  Let me take automobiles, for example, because there is not a lot of \ntrade in automobiles between the United States and China. But in our \ntrade agreement with China, as I understand it, after a phase in, we \nreached an agreement by which China will have only a 25-percent tariff \non U.S. automobiles that will be sent to China. We would have a 2.5-\npercent tariff on Chinese automobiles into this country. So we reached \na trade agreement which says we will phase this in slowly. But after it \nis fully phased in, China, you can have a 10-times greater tariff on \nautomobiles going into China than we would have.\n  I ask a question: Who is negotiating, and on whose behalf? We should \nget some uniforms and jerseys that say ``U.S.A.'' on them. At least \nwhen they sit down we would understand who they are and we could demand \nthat they work for our interests and demand reciprocal agreements that \nsay treat us like we treat you. Open your markets.\n  I mention automobiles, because it is not of great consequence in that \nparticular trade agreement. But I am going to talk at greater length \nabout some of the other issues as well. I mention it, because tomorrow \nthe Commerce Department will, once again, announce the monthly trade \ndeficit. It will, in my judgment, signal the storm clouds that exist in \nthis area to which we must respond. Our economy is wonderful. We live \nin a great country. We are blessed with all kinds of good news. \nHowever, we must address this issue.\n\n  I finish by telling the Senator from West Virginia what happened to \nme at the WTO meetings in Seattle in December. Everyone remembers how \nraucous those WTO sessions turned out to be, especially with \ndemonstrators in the street. Something happened I will relate that \nreminds everyone once again of who we are and where we are. A group of \nHouse and Senate Members were meeting with a group of 10 or 12 European \nparliamentarians across an oblong table, talking about the differences \nbetween Europe and the United States in trade, the beef issue, and the \nRoquefort trade issue.\n  Mr. Rocard, the former Prime Minister of France, leaned over and \nsaid: Mr. Senator, I want you to understand something. We are talking \nabout disputes between the United States and Europe. I want you to \nunderstand how I feel about your country. I was a 14-year-old boy on \nthe streets of Paris, France, in 1944 when the Liberation Army marched \ninto my country and removed the Nazis from my country. When I was a 14-\nyear-old boy, standing on the streets, when those American soldiers \nmarched into my country, a young black American soldier reached out his \nhand and gave me an apple. I want you to understand that I will never, \never forget that moment and what it meant to me and what it meant to my \ncountry.\n  I got chills as I listened to that. We have, as a country, done so \nmuch for so many around the world. We are self-critical and tend to \nforget the remarkable things we have done.\n  This fellow said to me: I will go to my grave having very special \nfeelings about what your country, what your soldier, what your \ncommitment was to me, to my family, and to my country.\n  That is something we should understand. We have a great capacity to \ndo good things. As a democracy, we make some mistakes from time to \ntime. But we have a great capacity to do good things in our abilities \nto make choices regarding public policy, in developing the kinds of \npolicies that are produced in this Chamber. All of us must, from our \nvarious centers of interest around America, come here and with passion \nmake the case for the things we think are important.\n  The Senator from West Virginia makes passionate arguments on behalf \nof the families who have been mining America's coal in the hills of \nAppalachia. I listened with wonder to his description of what is \nhappening in those small communities. He understands that those from \nfarm country, from North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and elsewhere \nfeel the same way, with the same passion, about the people we represent \nwho are struggling and in many ways confront the same problems of \ncollapsed commodity prices. There is the notion by some that this is \njust all nostalgia, not hard-nosed market economics.\n  That is why, as we do all of this, as we engage in these debates, we \nmust as a country think through the public policy questions with better \nclarity, especially with the understanding that tomorrow's economy and \ntomorrow's country is what we decide it will be. We have a right to \nmake these decisions. Europe has decided it wants family farmers in its \nfuture. It wants rural Europe to be healthy and family farmers to make \nit. Why? Because they understand that family farms produce more than \njust grain or livestock. They produce something that is social in \nnature--community, a rural lifestyle and culture that is important. \nThat is something Europe is already reconciled to, and we ought to, as \nwell.\n  I have taken far more time than I intended. Let me end as I started. \nI will\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\ngo to the farmers' lunch near the Russell Building. They are serving a \n$10 lunch for 39 cents because farmers are here, 2,000-fold, saying: \nThis is our share of the food dollar. It is not enough. We cannot make \na living. We need help. We don't need charity. We need a little \nattention from Congress, better trade agreements, a better farm \nprogram, a little action on the antitrust front to deal with the \nconcentrations of monopolies that exist, and a little understanding \nthat we matter to America's future. We produce food. It is a hungry \nworld. Food matters. Congress, pay attention. That is all they are \nsaying.\n  With that, I will have lunch with friends of mine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before the distinguished Senator goes to lunch, would he \nagree with me that Oliver Goldsmith, writing in ``The Deserted \nVillage,'' must have had our family farmers in mind when he said:\n\n     Ill fares the land, to hastening ills of prey,\n     Where wealth accumulates, and men decay;\n     Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade;\n     A breath can make them, as a breath has made;\n     But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,\n     When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.\n\n  Is there anything more fitting by way of poetry than Oliver \nGoldsmith's words in ``The Deserted Village'' when he talked about the \nbold peasantry?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from West Virginia \nhas captured in just a minute, with verse that comes from memory, \nsomething that I have not been able to say in 45 minutes. He is \nabsolutely correct.\n  Again, let me thank him for being on the floor as I made the \npresentation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1447-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ELEVEN-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGEDY AT COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today marks the 11-month anniversary of the \ntragic school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. On April \n20, 1999, 2 boys walked into their high school, armed to the hilt, and \nkilled 13 students and faculty members before taking their own lives. \nDespite the horrible nature of this crime, and those that have followed \nit in Georgia, in Michigan, in the District of Columbia, and in other \nplaces throughout the country, the Congress has shown precious little \nleadership in exploring ways to help prevent mayhem in our schools.\n  Last May, in response to the Columbine shooting, this Senate passed \nthe Juvenile Justice bill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 73-\n25. Despite this strong show of bipartisan agreement, the legislation \nis bogged down in a morass of election year politics. Despite the fact \nthat the American people are crying out for some leadership on this \nissue, the Congress is proving itself to be uncaring, if not \nirrelevant.\n  There is plenty of controversy to go around anytime any measure comes \nbefore the Congress which deals with gun violence. We have all heard \nrepeatedly the cautionary slogan chanted by some, ``guns don't kill \npeople, people kill people.'' But increasingly in recent years it has \nbeen children who are wielding guns against their classmates. Perhaps \nthe slogan should be changed to ``guns don't kill children, children \nkill children.'' Sadly, that slogan now has the ring of reality, but, I \ndoubt that anyone will be lobbying for gun rights with those words \nimprinted on their lecture.\n  The Senate-passed legislation contained a number of important \nprovisions to not only crack down on violent juvenile offenders, but \nalso to reduce the potential for weapons to fall into the hands of \nchildren who may not understand all of the dangers that the weapons \npose.\n  The Senate legislation is a compromise between the rights of the \nindividual to keep and bear arms and the safety of the public to be \nprotected from those who should not have those guns. The bill would \nrequire that every handgun sold must have a trigger safety lock or \nsecure container. It would require background checks on all buyers at \ngun shows. The legislation would ban the youth possession of \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and their high-capacity ammunition clips. \nAnd it would bar anyone convicted of a violent felony as a juvenile \nfrom possessing a gun. These are commonsense provisions on which I hope \nparents and gun owners alike could agree.\n  Last week, the Nation's leading gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, \nimposed upon itself many of the provisions contained in the Senate \nversion of the Juvenile Justice bill, including trigger locks and \nbackground checks. If Smith & Wesson can see the wisdom of balancing \npublic safety with private ownership rights, why can this Congress not \ndo the same?\n  The last time--and, in fact, the only time--that the conference \ncommittee on the Juvenile Justice legislation met was last August. Time \nis of the essence. I urge the conferees on both sides of the hill to \nmeet and to settle their differences. The longer they wait, the longer \nthe delay, the better the chances are that some further tragedy will \ncome along and steal the lives of more innocent children. We might make \na difference. We might save a life. Why not have the courage to try?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, who always has most interesting remarks. I \nam pleased to associate myself with his comments as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1447-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1447-S1449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGH FUEL PRICES\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is hard to pick up a newspaper or turn \non a television set or read any kind of political commentary or watch \none of the Sunday morning talk shows without having the subject very \nquickly turn to the high price that we in this country are paying for \ngasoline. There is a certain amount of deja vu when you look at some of \nthese situations: Here we go again. Many Members remember quite well \nthe problems this country faced in the 1970s when we had the long lines \nat our gas stations around this country. People were screaming and \nhollering about the lack of gas for their automobiles and were also \ncomplaining about the price of that gas if they were lucky enough to \nget it.\n  Here we are in the year 2000, and basically the problem is very \nsimilar to what it was back in 1973. It is interesting to me to see so \nmany people wringing their hands, struggling to find out exactly what \nis causing this problem. It is not, indeed, a mystery at all. The \nproblem is one of supply and demand. We are using far more gas and oil \nin this country than we were in the past decade, than in the past 5 \nyears, in fact, more than we used last year. Yet we are producing \nsubstantially less than we are using.\n  During the 1970s oil embargo, many of us, particularly those from \noil-producing States, were saying the problem would only get worse \nunless we did something to become energy self-sufficient. In those \ndays, the 1970s, we were importing about 36 percent of the oil we \nconsumed in the United States. When the OPEC nations just slightly \ntightened their valves and started producing a little bit less, that 36 \npercent brought this Nation to its knees and created the long lines at \nthe gas stations.\n  Many of us at that time said it was only going to get worse unless we \nconcentrated on trying to be more energy self-sufficient in this \ncountry; we would have to concentrate on making sure we were producing, \nin an environmentally safe manner, the necessary energy to run this \nNation.\n  I wonder what people would say if we imported 50 percent of all the \nfood we needed to feed the citizens of our country. I bet that if we \nwere 50-percent dependent on foreign countries for food in this \ncountry, there would be long lines marching in Washington, people \nclamoring for our Nation to get its act together and become more self-\nsufficient, producing the food we need. I wonder why it is any \ndifferent when it comes\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nto producing the energy this country needs.\n  If food is important to our Nation and to our Nation's economy, to \nour Nation's well-being, to our security, certainly energy, which runs \nthis country, is important to the security of this Nation. Yet in the \nyear 2000 we are not importing 36 percent of the energy we use, as we \nwere in the last major crisis back in the 1970s. Today we are importing \n55 percent; 55 percent of all of the energy from oil and gas that we \nuse in this country is coming from other countries. We cannot depend on \nmany of these countries to give us the supply of energy we need in this \ncountry.\n  So I question why there is so much difficulty in figuring out why we \nhave this problem. In the last 13 years, our domestic oil production \nhas fallen by 2.7 million barrels a day. In the past 2 years, domestic \nproduction has fallen about half a million barrels per day. In the last \ndecade, there has been a 17-percent decline in the domestic production \nof oil and gas in this country, while at the same time our domestic oil \nconsumption has increased by 14 percent. It does not take a rocket \nscientist to figure out that we have a huge problem. We are producing \nless and less and we are consuming more and more. We are depending more \nand more on foreign sources for the energy we need to run America.\n\n  Whether you are a farmer in Louisiana or in Kansas or any other part \nof the United States, or whether you are a housewife taking the \nchildren to school, whether you are a small businessman who is \ndependent on deliveries, or whether you are an independent trucker \nanywhere in America, you are starting to feel serious economic pressure \nbecause of the dramatic and rapid increase in the price of oil, in the \nprice of gas at the pump.\n  The reason I bring this to my colleagues' attention is not any \nmystery. I have outlined why I think the problem is as it is. When you \nbecome over 50-percent dependent on other countries for something that \nis so important to your domestic survival and economic security, as we \nare dependent on oil, our country is facing very difficult times.\n  Some may ask: Senator, that is all fine and good. I understand what \nyou are saying. But is there any oil for us to produce in this country?\n  The answer is: Absolutely. The problem, however, is that so many of \nour Nation's most valuable energy areas have been arbitrarily shut off \nfrom any potential exploration and development by actions of \nGovernment, actions by the Congress, actions by the previous President, \nactions by this President. They have all said: There are certain areas \nwe are not even going to look for oil and gas. We would rather depend \non OPEC to be generous and give us all the oil we need at the price we \nwant.\n  In fact, that is not happening. On the chart I have here on the \nfloor, the orange shows the areas in the Outer Continental Shelf around \nthe United States where we have said, by Presidential edict or by acts \nof Congress: You cannot even look for oil and gas.\n  From Maine to Florida, from Washington State to the Mexican border, \nwe have said we are not going to look or explore or even offer for \nlease these areas where there are known quantities of oil and gas.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, talked about \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the fact that it has been \nclosed to any kind of production. An interesting fact is, our own \nDepartment of the Interior has estimated we have enough oil in that \narea to replace the amount of oil we are getting from the country of \nSaudi Arabia. Yet that area has been closed to even looking to see if \noil might be there and in recoverable quantities.\n  I remember the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge issue very well. I was \nin the House of Representatives when Congress made a decision as to how \nto handle that area, which is located right next to Prudhoe Bay, which \narguably has been one of the largest oil deposits anywhere in North \nAmerica.\n  I remember when we were doing the National Alaskan Interest Lands \nConservation Act in 1980. We were not sure about what to do with that \narea because not enough was known at that time, some said, to make a \ndecision on whether or not we should explore for oil in that area.\n  The House of Representatives--and it was also adopted in the Senate--\nsaid: All right, we are going to take this area and set it aside, and \nwe are going to study it.\n  A lot of times, when Congress does not know what to do, it studies \nsomething and delays it by having a study.\n  We required the Department, working with industry, to do a study \nabout whether, No. 1, there were resources there, and, No. 2, whether \nthey could be environmentally, safely produced by actions of industry \nif we allowed them to do it. That was in 1980.\n  In 1987, the studies were completed and the results were in. The \nDepartment of the Interior looked at the results of that study and \nrecommended the area be leased for exploration and development. But \nCongress would not let them do that. The administration would not let \nthem do that. Even though the Department of the Interior, based on the \nstudy we required them to do in this area, recommended the area be \nleased for exploration and development, there has been no exploration. \nWe will not even look to see whether there is any oil in that area for \nuse by the people of this country. Yet the estimate is that there could \nbe as many as 16 billion barrels of oil sitting there. By governmental \naction, by Presidential order, we are saying we are not even going to \nlook there.\n  Some say: Senator, are you advocating we have oil production in a \nrefuge? I only point out, we have oil production in my State of \nLouisiana in practically every wildlife refuge. In the congressional \ndistrict I represented, which is on the coast of Louisiana, we had oil \nand gas production on every single one of the wildlife refuges.\n  The test is whether it is compatible with the purpose of the refuge. \nThe question is whether they can be done together in an environmentally \nsafe manner. The answer has clearly been shown to be yes, it can, in \nmost circumstances. The wildlife refuge benefits from some of the \nroyalties from that oil and gas production, and the country benefits \nbecause we are producing oil where it is found. We can do both at the \nsame time.\n  The Department of the Interior said that in 1987 after this extensive \nstudy Congress required. People in Congress said: We will study it \nbecause we think the answer will come back no. But when the answer came \nback, yes, it can be done, Congress said: We are going to say no \nanyway.\n\n  If one looks at the map on the chart, they will notice that from \nMaine, up to the Canadian border, down to the middle of Florida, we \nhave 25 leases. That is it--25 leases. In the Gulf of Mexico off \nLouisiana and Texas, we have over 10,000 leases--oil that is being \nproduced on the Outer Continental Shelf that is being used by everybody \nin the United States. About 75 percent of our Federal oil comes from \noff my State and the States of Texas and Mississippi in the Gulf of \nMexico. Over 10,000 leases are producing oil every day, ensuring \neconomic security for this country.\n  We cannot do it by ourselves. Selfishly, I could say: Look, I hope \nthey do not do it anywhere else. It is great for Louisiana if we have \nall the production and we get all the benefits, all of the jobs, all of \nthe construction; that is fine for my State. But it is not good \nnational policy to say we are only going to do it off one State.\n  On the other hand, look at the west coast. There are a lot of cars on \nthe west coast. There are a lot of SUVs on the west coast. There are a \nlot of people hurting who want prices to be lower on the west coast. \nYet the entire coastline from Canada to Mexico is off limits. There are \nonly 83 leases from Canada to Mexico, and these are old leases which \nhave been there for years and years.\n  With regard to this orange area on this map, we are saying: No, don't \nlook at it; don't touch it; don't consider it. Are they saying that \nbecause we do not need it when we import 55 percent of our oil, or are \nthey saying things have to be done perfectly to proceed and, unless \nthings are done perfectly, we are never going to proceed?\n  It seems to me we have to have a balanced approach to energy \ndevelopment in this country. We cannot continue to send our Secretary \nof Energy--which is where I understand he is this week--to meet with \nOPEC hat in hand, saying to these foreign countries, please, please, \ngive us more oil, when at the same\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\ntime we are not doing nearly enough to develop the legitimate resources \nin our own country.\n  If we had an aggressive development and production program in our \ncountry, we would not be importing 55 percent of the oil we need to run \nAmerica. Yet when we say we are not going to do anything between Canada \nand Mexico and between Canada and Florida and we are only going to do \nit off Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, that is not a balanced \napproach to energy development in the United States.\n  Some say: We don't want to have it off our coast because it may \npollute the environment; we may have an oil spill from an offshore \nplatform. The truth is, it is far more dangerous to import oil in \ntankers every day than it is to produce in offshore waters. There was a \nstudy done by the National Academy of Sciences--and it is on the \nminerals management web site--which talks about where oil is coming \nfrom that is polluting the waters of the world. Does it come from \noffshore production? No. Offshore oil and gas development is actually 2 \npercent of the oil that is found in offshore waters around the world. A \nlittle less than 2 percent comes from offshore development.\n  Where does it come from? It is no surprise: Importing oil and moving \noil around the oceans of the world in ships. Marine transportation \naccounts for 45 percent of all the oil that is found in the ocean \nwaters that is not supposed to be there. Municipal and industrial waste \nand runoff, which comes from when it rains and the rain runs off the \nstreets and works its way ultimately to the oceans of the world, \naccounts for another 36 percent. Atmospheric fallout is about 9 \npercent, and natural seepage, which comes up from the ocean floor, is \nabout another 9 percent. But less than 2 percent of the oil that is \nfound in oceans comes from drilling for oil and gas off the coast of \nthe countries where oil can be found.\n  I do not know what the answer is. There is no simple answer. I know \nthe President made some proposals in a radio address this week. I \nencourage the administration to continue to seek solutions to the \nproblem.\n  I have a suggestion, and one of the suggestions is right from the \nminerals management office. They have a chart that talks about the \nundiscovered resources in areas that are currently under \nmoratorium. They make an estimate of how much oil is in areas of the \ncountry that we cannot even enter. Their estimate is probably the most \naccurate in the world.\n\n  For areas under moratorium--either congressional or Presidential \nmoratorium--they estimate there are 15.2 billion barrels of oil sitting \nout there in areas where we are saying: Don't even go look. And there \nis an additional 61.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that could be \nfound in these areas. But you know what. If we don't look, we will \nnever know. It would seem to me that as long as we have these huge \nareas where we have x'd out any ability to take a look to see what \nenergy is there, we are not on very solid ground when we blame OPEC for \nthe problems we are facing today.\n  With 55 percent of the oil used in the United States being imported, \nOPEC has the ability, by turning that faucet off just a little bit, to \nbring this country to its knees. Can you imagine what it would do if \nthey turned a full turn and really reduced it?\n  No nation should ever allow itself--certainly not a nation as strong \nas the United States--to become dependent on foreign sources for things \nthat are critical to our economic well-being and our national security \nand, indeed, our survival. Yet over the years we have allowed just that \nto happen with regard to energy.\n  We would not allow it to happen in the area of food. We would not \nallow it to happen in the area of planes or tanks or warships or \nanything else that we depend on for our national security--except in \nthis one area. We have made a conscious decision to say: It is all \nright to import over half of the energy we use.\n  It is unacceptable. It is bad public policy. It needs to be changed; \notherwise, every so often we will be faced with what we are faced with \ntoday.\n  In his radio address, the President has made some suggestions which I \nhave noted. One was the creation of an environmentally sound home \nheating oil reserve for the Northeast. My question is, Where does the \noil for that reserve come from? Are we just going to buy it from OPEC \nat $30 a barrel? That is not going to solve the problem of high energy \nprices for the Northeast if we are filling up their oil reserve with \noil coming from OPEC at $30 a barrel. It would come out of the reserve \nat the same price.\n  The second suggestion is to immediately reauthorize the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which is located in Louisiana and Texas, where we \nhave oil underground. I am all for doing that, but we are going to be \nputting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at $30 a barrel because \nof what OPEC has done to us.\n  Neither one of these two suggestions domestically produce any \nadditional oil. It will continue to be filled with 55 percent of oil \ncoming from foreign sources at $30 a barrel or at whatever price OPEC \ndetermines.\n  The President has some other suggestions on promoting energy \nefficiency. We are all for that. He has some suggestions for tax \nincentives for energy efficiency. I am for that. He has some \nsuggestions on promoting the use of alternative fuels--I am for that--\nand also support for domestic oil production, which I think is very \npositive.\n  But if you have all of these areas that are roped off, if you will, \nand you say, ``Don't go here,'' when we know some of these areas have \nas much as Saudi Arabia exports to us--such as, in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge--I suggest that as long as we have huge areas, thousands of \nmiles of areas where we are saying don't even look for energy, then we \nare never going to address the heart of the problem, which is a lack of \nenergy self-sufficiency for the United States of America. We cannot \never say we are going to be energy self-sufficient just by producing \nenergy off the coast of one or two States.\n  Certainly, the Congress in the past has accepted the fact that we \nwould let these areas be roped off. I guess the thought is always: \nLet's produce it somewhere else.\n  That is what we are doing. We are producing it somewhere else. It is \ncalled OPEC. Its nations have formed a cartel. They have done very well \nin controlling the price. They know they can bring this country--\nindeed, the world--to its knees simply by turning the valve off just a \nlittle bit. They will continue to do that.\n  I hope they open up the spigot just a little bit, but as long as we \nare importing 55 percent of the energy for the United States of \nAmerica, they will always have the ability to bring us to our knees. \nThat is something that should be unacceptable for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Americans today are leading healthier and \nlonger lives than ever before. By the year 2030, one-fifth of our \nAmerican population will be age 65 or older. Given the demographics of \nthe 21st century, it is clearly in our national interest to encourage \npeople to stay in the workforce longer. Today, however, older Americans \nage 65 through 69 are currently discouraged from working since they \nlose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn over \n$17,000. I am, therefore, very pleased this week the Senate will \nconsider H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, to eliminate \nthe Social Security earnings test that unfairly penalizes senior \ncitizens who need or want to keep working.\n  The elimination of this penalty will be particularly helpful to \nwomen. Women frequently have interrupted work histories because they \ntake time off to raise their families. Historically, unfortunately, \nthey also earn less than men. As a result, women are twice as likely to \nretire in poverty as men. Many women do not have sufficient savings or \na private pension, and they depend upon the money they earn to \nsupplement their Social Security benefits in order to make ends meet. \nThese low-income seniors are particularly hard hit by the earnings \ntest, which amounts to a 33-percent tax on their earned income over and \nabove what they are already paying in Federal, State, and Social \nSecurity payroll taxes.\n\n  Moreover, the Social Security earnings penalty takes money away from \nseniors that is rightfully theirs. According to the Social Security \nAdministration, 800,000 senior citizens sacrificed some of their \nbenefits last year by exceeding the earnings limit. These were benefits \nthey had earned through a lifetime of hard work in contributions to the \nSocial Security system.\n  Finally, this penalty is most burdensome for those seniors who have \nto work and depend upon their income for survival. More well-to-do \nseniors generally supplement their Social Security benefits with what \nwe refer to as ``unearned income'' from savings and investments, none \nof which is affected by the current earnings limit.\n  Earlier this month, in an overwhelming display of bipartisan \ncooperation, the House of Representatives voted unanimously to repeal \nthis unfair penalty on our senior citizens. They voted to say no to \ndiscriminating against seniors and discouraging them from working. It \nis my hope the Senate will follow suit this week with another unanimous \nvote on this historic measure.\n  Our Nation's seniors should be free to work without penalty. Older \nworkers have the skills, the wisdom, and the judgment that all \nemployers value. Given our tight labor market and our historically low \nrate of personal savings, it simply does not make sense for Washington \nto discourage the most experienced workers we have from remaining in \nthe workforce when they want to do so. I hope all of our colleagues \nwill join me in passing this important legislation before the end of \nthe week.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I associate myself with the eloquent \nremarks of the Senator from Maine regarding the elimination of the \nSocial Security earnings test.\n  I rise in support of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, H.R. 5. \nI am pleased the Senate is considering this legislation expeditiously \nand that the legislation reflects the intent of Senator Ashcroft's \nbill, S. 2074, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Arkansas is a State that has one of the highest percentages of senior \ncitizens in the Nation. We traditionally are just behind Arizona and \nFlorida--very high. When you look at the population of our State, there \nare about 2.6 million senior citizens.\n  But when you look at low-income or lower income senior citizens, we \nare easily at the top and by far the leading State as a percentage of \nour population that has senior citizens who are in economic deprivation \nor lower income. These are the individuals, as the Senator from Maine \nso eloquently said, who are most in need of equity in the way we treat \ntheir Social Security income.\n  Earlier today I had lunch with a doctor who is a dentist in Arkansas \nand has his practice in primarily a retirement population area. He was \nrelating to me how many of his patients are now 65-plus, many 70, 75 \nyears old, and about the remarkable health that they enjoy today and \nthe opportunity, from a physical standpoint, that they have to go out \nand be a part of our labor market. In being a part of that labor \nmarket, they can use the experience and the expertise they have gained \nthrough a lifetime in our society and contribute that to the economy of \ntoday.\n\n  I think this is long overdue. The law that we are proposing to change \nis truly a vestige of the 1930s. It begs for its elimination. Our \nNation's working seniors deserve immediate relief from the earnings \nlimit--a longstanding and outdated provision of law. Persons aged 65 to \n69 are losing $1 in program benefits for every $3 they earn beyond \n$17,000, creating a very clear and a very real disincentive to work at \nall.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, more than 800,000 \nseniors lose either part or all of their Social Security benefits \nbecause of the program's earnings limitation. That is almost one \nmillion working seniors. That is 12,755 people in the State of Arkansas \nwhose lives will improve if we pass this legislation and the President \nsigns it into law.\n  Since I was elected to Federal office on the House side a few years \nago, I have witnessed a steady commitment among the Republican \nleadership to provide greater flexibility, training, and financial \nrelief to our Nation's workforce. We have advocated legislation that \nwould provide private sector workers with the choice of flexible weekly \nwork schedules--a perk that has been enjoyed by all of us on the \nFederal payroll for over 20 years.\n  In 1998, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of America's job training \nlaws, giving more funding and flexibility to States, municipalities, \nand businesses to provide essential job skills to its employees. More \nimportantly, though, we have an impressive record for putting taxpayer \nmoney back into the pockets of those who need it most, the American \npeople.\n  The legislation before us complements our leadership's commitment to \ngiving advantages to the worker--in this case, our country's most \nseasoned and experienced employees.\n  This bill would end that longstanding practice of penalizing seniors \nfor working--something that we ought to encourage; something we should \ncommend. No different than providing tax relief to all working \nAmericans, we want to help senior employees who choose to remain in the \nworkforce.\n  I disagree with the notion that ``you can't teach an old dog new \ntricks.'' In fact, we could learn a thing or two from our seniors. We \ncould learn a lot from our seniors. That is why we are debating this \nbill.\n  This legislation would not just help our senior workers; it also \nbenefits employers, too. President Lincoln said: ``You cannot lift the \nwage earner by pulling down the wage payer.'' Social Security's \nantiquated barriers not only\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\npenalize seniors who want to work but employers who want to hire them. \nSeniors are turning down employment opportunities that business owners \nneed to fill in order to compete in the global economy.\n  America posts one of the lowest unemployment rates in four decades, \nmaking good, plentiful workers harder than ever to find. Employers and \nour most experienced employees stand to gain considerably from the \npassage of this legislation.\n  H.R. 5 passed the House of Representatives 422-0. I anticipate it \nwill pass the Senate with a similar kind of margin with great success.\n  The bill's language has the support of a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators who advocate comprehensive Social Security reform--reform \nbased on a continuation of existing benefits while ensuring the \nprogram's financial long-term solvency. In fact, H.R. 5 is part of many \nof the comprehensive reform packages introduced in the last 2 years. It \nhas been included in a lot of the plans to totally reform Social \nSecurity. We all understand that if left unchanged, the future of \nSocial Security is in jeopardy as the program begins running deficits \nin about 2013 when 71 million of my fellow baby boomers begin \ncollecting their retirement benefits. We know the number of retirees \nwill double between 2008 and 2018, narrowing the ratio of workers to \nbeneficiaries to less than 3 to 1. When Social Security first started, \nthere were 45 people working to take care of 1 retiree. In 1950, there \nwere 16 workers working for every beneficiary. We all know that all \ntrust funds will be completely exhausted in the next 30 years when the \nbeneficiaries far outnumber the working contributors.\n\n  I remember back in December 1998, when the President hosted the White \nHouse Conference on Social Security, Members of Congress were asked to \nparticipate and share their ideas, with the common understanding that \nrestoring the program's financial solvency was not only necessary but \nimminent. The Speaker and the majority leader reserved the first bill \nin the House and Senate for the President's legislation. It was to be \naccompanied by several bipartisan bills offered by our colleagues. \nAlthough several bipartisan bills were introduced by Members of this \nbody, H.R. 1 and S. 1 remain vacant.\n  Although H.R. 5 represents an important step toward equitable reform, \nit definitely sets aside provisions that would address the future \nfinancial stability of this vital program. We must not allow the \npassage of this legislation to be the ``last rites'' of Social Security \nreform. Frankly, I am disappointed by the President's lack of \nparticipation in this important debate.\n  The next step after passing H.R. 5 should be to lock up the Social \nSecurity surplus. Not only do our working and retired seniors need \npenalty relief, they deserve assurances that their future benefit \nchecks are not being spent on other Federal programs, no matter how \ngood those other programs may be.\n  The very reason Social Security has a solvency problem is that it is \na federally administered program that has IOUs disguised as trust \nfunds. Our Nation's seniors deserve a program that delivers long term \nand is based on real money. I am confident that passage of H.R. 5 will \nopen the door for more bipartisan legislation that enhances the \nstrength of the Social Security program.\n  In time, Presidential leadership will mean more than words and with \nit will bring forth reform that preserves the program's financial \nstability for our children and our children's children. I ask my \ncolleagues to continue supporting that cause and join me in supporting \nH.R. 5.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the floor this \nafternoon with my colleagues from Maine and Arkansas and others who are \nhere to discuss the Senate's consideration of H.R. 5.\n  It is an interesting moment for me because when I first came to \nCongress in 1981, one of the first pieces of legislation I cosponsored \nwas the elimination of the earnings limit test on those seniors who \nwere taking Social Security and, as we know, limited in the amount of \nmoney they could earn at that point in time.\n  In 1983, the Congress decided, along with then Speaker of the House, \nTip O'Neill, and President Ronald Reagan, that an entire reform of the \nSocial Security system was necessary and that there should be a \nsubstantial tax increase to create solvency in the Social Security \nsystem. It seemed reasonable to me and my colleagues in the House at \nthat moment; why should we not encourage those who were retiring and \ntaking their Social Security benefits at age 62 or 65 to go on and earn \nan income beyond the Social Security benefit and pay into the system.\n  We were still caught in the Depression-era mentality that somehow you \ntook an older person and shooed them away from the labor market by some \nkind of, what I called, perverse incentive; that is, we will tax you \nout of the labor market if you choose to be a productive citizen in it. \nAs a result, we did not put the reform into Social Security in 1983 as \nwe should have.\n  We know Social Security today is very solvent. It is solvent as a \nresult of that 1983 initiative that was a bipartisan effort on the part \nof the House and the Senate.\n  The reform we are here to discuss today is one that was clearly \ndebated at that time and denied, denied by a Congress that was still \nunder the control of groups in this country that had dominated labor \npolicy for years and believed that at age 65 you left the labor force \nand went into retirement and some younger person took your slot. They \nhad failed to recognize that economies expand and grow; If you treat an \neconomy right, there is not only always need for new hires, but there \nis oftentimes a tremendous demand for the kind of knowledge, what I \ncall institutional knowledge, that older workers bring to the \nworkplace. Of course, we know that is very much the case today.\n  I guess my mother would probably have called me strong willed in my \nyouth. That was a polite way of saying I was bullheaded. I would \npersist, if I could, until I won the issue in which I was interested.\n  Over the years, I and others of the House and the Senate have \npersisted. Every year, we went out and introduced the earnings \nlimitation elimination. Every year, we were either defeated or the \nappropriate committees simply would not recognize it. That was through \nthe 1980s and the early 1990s. Of course, as we know, the economy in \nlarge part has dramatically changed.\n  During that period of time, my father considered retiring from the \nfarming and ranching business in his midsixties. He found it was of no \nvalue to do so because he would have denied himself a substantially \nlarger income than he could have ever received from Social Security. So \nit wasn't until after age 72, when the earnings limitation did not \napply, that my father and my parents, along with a good many other \nseniors in our country who were self-employed and who were clearly \nentitled to receive Social Security benefits, simply denied themselves \nthe benefit because they couldn't afford to take it. They waited until \nmuch later in life to decide to retire or, as my dad said, slow down a \nlittle bit to 12-hour workdays instead of 18-hour workdays, which was \nquite typical of his generation in the labor force. Now, at age 84, he \nstill thinks a 12-hour workday is a modest effort for any one \nindividual to make in his or her contribution to society. I say that \nwith a bit of jest, but it is very true of that workforce.\n  It was only at that time I think they recognized that my persistency, \nalong with others of my colleagues in trying to eliminate the earnings \nrequirement, was the right and appropriate thing to do.\n  So we were saying to seniors, age 65 through 69, they could only \ncontinue to earn up to a certain limit, $17,000 a year, while receiving \nthe full benefits of Social Security. But for every additional $3 of \nearnings beyond that limit, the Government reduced their benefit by \n$1--in other words, again, still penalizing them, still saying: We want \nyou out of the workforce. Even if you are healthy, even if you are \nproductive and can be a major contributor to the workforce, get out, if \nyou want to receive the full benefits of the Social Security system \nthat you had paid into all of your productive life and that you were \ncertainly entitled to receive.\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\n  Well, as we have worked this issue over the last decade, one thing \nhas changed. The President, for example, instead of expressing open \nopposition, is now saying this is a bill he will sign. As my colleagues \nfrom Arkansas and Maine have said the House, in almost a unanimous \nvote, declared their support for H.R. 5 in the last several weeks. I \nthink the Senate will respond in kind this week.\n  I have set forth a lot of the reasons it is important. It is \nfundamentally important because it is fair. That is the No. 1 reason we \nought to be doing it. It is fair for an individual who has paid into \nthe system all of his or her productive life, at age 62 or 65, to gain \nthose benefits and go on to continue to work if they wish.\n  Do we say to a young Federal employee who has vested his or herself \nin the retirement program of the Federal system and who chooses to step \nout and gain those benefits that they can't go on working? Do we say \nthat to a military retiree? In fact, quite the opposite--we expect them \nto go on working.\n  Now, of course, as our seniors live longer and find out that some of \ntheir retirement benefits are simply not enough and they are outliving \nthem, there is not just the accommodation of fairness to a senior in \nthe workplace, there is the accommodation of necessity.\n  Many of our seniors find it necessary to work beyond age 65 to \nprovide for themselves, to try to sustain the lifestyle they had when \nthey were once full employees at a different period in their lives. So \na combination of other forces is now working out there. I am proud \nthat, as a Republican, I and many of my colleagues have worked over the \nlast several years to change the character of the workplace, to \nrecognize the flexibility that is necessary in a new and very different \nworld from 1935, or 1945, or 1955, or 1965, or 1975, or even 1985.\n  We know that the workplace of the year 2000 is even different than \nthe workplace of 1995. Now both spouses are working. Now we offer \nflexibility in kind. Now we allow people to stay home and work from \ntheir homes as major contributors in the workforce, and we offer \nflextime, and so forth. Yet we have said this up until now to a senior \nat the appropriate age of receiving full benefits from the Social \nSecurity system: If you go out and find a job, you can only earn up to \na certain limitation and beyond that we will penalize you substantially \nuntil you are probably old enough not to want to work anymore, and then \nyou can have the full benefits even if you do work.\n  Shame on us. Shame on a Congress and a Government that has held that \npolicy as long as we have. Now, of course, as my colleague from \nArkansas states, this is the longest sustained period of near full \nemployment that our country has seen in decades. Now we need the senior \nin the workforce more than ever, for all of the right kinds of reasons. \nAs the House has spoken, I hope the Senate will speak in a unanimous \nvote and that we can send this to the President and say: Mr. President, \nthe Congress of the United States is ready to knock down the decades-\nold law that no longer fits the American workforce or the American \nculture--if it ever did. And we have done this in a unanimous way.\n  That is the kind of expression I hope the Senate will make this week. \nThe House has already spoken. I think that is probably due to my \npersistence, along with many colleagues over the past decade and a \nhalf; we have argued that this is something that is right and fair, in \nthe first instance, and now is a combination of necessity, in the \nsecond instance, as the culture and economy of this country have \nchanged significantly over the period of time in which this provision \nhas been a part of the labor and Social Security laws of our country.\n  Madam President, I will proudly vote for H.R. 5 and encourage all of \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today in strong support for H.R. \n5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, which the Senate will \nbegin considering tomorrow.\n  Seniors in my home State of Utah and around the nation have waited a \nlong time for the relief H.R. 5 will bring. I am so pleased that not \nonly did the House pass this bill on March 1 by a vote of 422 to 0, and \nthe Senate is very likely to follow suit tomorrow, but also that the \nPresident has finally come around and has indicated he will sign the \nbill.\n  Under current law, over 800,000 Social Security recipients between \nthe ages of 65 and 70 are affected by the so-called earnings limit. \nOver 6,100 of these live in Utah. This limit provides that senior \ncitizens who this year earn more than $17,000 in wages or self-\nemployment income will lose some of their Social Security benefits. \nMore specifically, for every $3 earned over the $17,000 threshold, $1 \nin benefits is lost. The bill we will take up tomorrow will remove this \nunfair limitation.\n  There are at least five reasons why H.R. 5 should be passed by this \nbody with a resounding margin so this oppressive limitation, which \nholds back senior citizens to the detriment of everybody in this \ncountry, can be lifted.\n  First, the earnings limit is plainly unfair to senior citizens. What \nkind of a message does the current law send to a worker turning age 65, \nMr. President, when he or she learns that there will be a 33 percent \npenalty for continuing to work once his or her earnings exceed $17,000?\n  Yet, at the same time, senior citizens who are fortunate enough to \nhave interest, dividend, or capital gains income from stocks, bonds, or \nmutual funds, or income from a private pension, are not penalized, no \nmatter how much of these kinds of income they receive. Even if the \nearnings limit otherwise had merit, which it doesn't, it punishes the \nvery people who most need to work to makes ends meet.\n  Second, the earnings limit is outdated. The limit was a feature of \nthe original Social Security Act in 1935. It was included to encourage \nseniors to retire so their jobs would be available to the millions of \nyounger workers who were unemployed in the difficult job market of the \nGreat Depression. That was a different era. What was appropriate in \n1935 is clearly not appropriate in 2000, when it is workers, not jobs, \nthat are scarce.\n\n  Third, the earnings limit places extremely high marginal tax rates on \nworkers between the ages of 65 and 70 who continue to work. Consider \nthe example of a 66-year-old plumber I will call Howard. Along with his \nson, Howard has run a small plumbing business in Ogden, UT, for over 20 \nyears. Now that he is over 65, Howard has decided to turn the \nmanagement of the business over to his son. However, Howard still wants \nto work, and because of an aged mother whom he takes care of, he still \nneeds some income. Howard works three days a week and earns $35,000 per \nyear.\n  Believe it or not, when the earnings limit penalty of 33 percent is \ncombined with the income tax rate of 28 percent, the self-employment \ntax rate of 15.3 percent, and the effect of taxing his Social Security \nbenefits at 85 percent, Howard faces a marginal tax bracket of 88.8 \npercent, not counting the Utah income tax. This high a marginal tax \nrate is unconscionable and indefensible any way you look at it.\n  Fourth, the earnings limit is terrible for our economy. The biggest \nproblem our economy faces right now is a severe shortage of workers. \nThis is especially true in the high technology fields, where our \nshortages are so severe that we must increase the number of H-1B visas \nallowed this year so our high tech firms can stay competitive.\n  However, turning to overseas workers is only a temporary solution. We \nneed a long-term answer to this problem, which is only going to be \nexacerbated by current demographic trends, and the retirement of the \nbaby boom generation. Our senior citizens are a wonderful resource that \nis not being tapped enough. Only 17 percent of males over age 65 are \nnow working, compared with 47 percent in 1948. These workers are \nexperienced, and in many cases, they want to keep working. In\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\norder for this to happen, though, we need to scuttle outdated relics \nlike this Social Security earnings test.\n  Finally, the earnings limit is no longer relevant, considering the \ngrowing longevity of Americans. In 1935, when the earnings limit was \nadded to the Social Security Act, life expectancy in this country was \n62 years. Now, it is 77 years. Moreover, senior citizens are the \nfastest growing segment of our population. There is absolutely no \nreason these citizens cannot keep on working if they desire to do so. I \nhave read articles that the life expectancy of the American people may \nsoon be approaching 85.\n\n  Therefore, I am very gratified to see that this earnings limit repeal \nis about to pass the Senate. And again, I am especially pleased that \nPresident Clinton has agreed to put aside election year politics and \nsign this legislation.\n  As important and long awaited this earnings limit repeal is, I want \nto emphasize that it does not lessen the need for comprehensive Social \nSecurity reform. Besides the repeal of the earnings test, there are \nmany other vital issues that must be addressed to ensure the long-term \nviability of the system. These include the large and difficult question \nof how to best increase the system's rate of return in order to lessen \nthe need for any benefit cuts or payroll tax increases once the Social \nSecurity trust fund runs out of spending authority. Other important \nissues that need to be addressed in the context of fundamental Social \nSecurity reform include work disincentives for blind workers.\n  Many of our blind citizens are also subject to a type of limit on \ntheir earnings, in which they lose Social Security disability payments \nonce their earnings reach $14,040 per year. For many of the same \nreasons that the earnings limit is unfair to senior citizens, the \n``substantial gainful activity'' limit is unfair to those workers \ndisabled by blindness.\n  I wish H.R. 5 could accommodate this unfairness by ameliorating this \nearnings limit and removing the disincentive these workers face today. \nI wish President Clinton would have used some of his political capital \nin this final year of his Presidency to lead the way to major Social \nSecurity reform. Regrettably, the President has made it clear that \nbroad reform will have to wait for the leadership of another President.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes for H.R. 5 and let's finally \nrepeal the unfair earnings limit on senior citizens.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1453-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1453-S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING MY FRIEND MARSHALL COYNE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is with deep regret and personal \nsorrow that I come to the Senate today to report the death of my good \nfriend Marshall Coyne. He died in his sleep on March 16. He was 89 \nyears old. Marshall became my friend years ago. Actually, it was with \nformer Senator and Ambassador Saxbe that I first met Marshall Coyne. He \nhad served on the symphony board with my wife Ann. The two developed a \ngreat friendship. Following her death, he continued to be my friend, \nand has continued now for many years to be a dear and loyal friend to \nme and my wife Catherine, our daughter Lily, and our whole family. He \nwas a rare man.\n  First, let me state that in all the time I knew him, he never asked \nme how I voted, suggested how I should vote, or indicated that he had \nanything he wanted me to do on this floor. He did ask me for some \ninformation once in a while about various things going on in the city, \nthe District, that is. But he was a very different person.\n  We developed such a close friendship that as I chaired Senate \ndelegations going overseas, he would ask me where I was going, and he \nwould show up there. He showed up in Geneva when we were there for the \nSenate arms control talks with the Soviets--going back that far. He \nshowed up in London when we had the British parliamentary talks with \nMembers of the Senate. And he showed up in Paris when we were there for \nthe Paris Air Show. Marshall was the kind of friend who was always \nwelcome. I never knew any Senator to object to the fact he was there. \nThey all knew he was my friend and that he would come along.\n  We have had such a rare relationship. He had lunch with me every \nFriday that I was in the District of Columbia, I think, in the last 10 \nyears. He had been to my home either one or two times a month during \nthat whole time when we would be in Washington, DC.\n  He was the kind of friend I think every Senator needs and should \nhave. We fished together. We fished together in Alaska. I remember how \nsurprised he was one time when he saw a bear when we stopped at a \nstream. He, with my late friend Mike Joy, traveled around Alaska with \nme many times fishing. We fished off the coast of Costa Rica. We fished \nin Florida. He discussed his trips with me when I was not able to go. \nHe went to Mongolia once, and he came back very impressed with that \nplace.\n  Of course, our mutual interest was China, where I had served in World \nWar II. He was one of the first Americans to reenter China after \nPresident and Mrs. Nixon's historic visit. He personally once a year \nvisited Iceland. Another example of Marshall's interest in \ninternational affairs was his support for the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies (CSIS), a premier public policy institution \ndedicated to policy analysis on the world's major geographic regions.\n  He was, I think, a friend to many Members of the Congress and to many \nmembers of the military. Mr. Coyne organized the Ambassadors' Round \nTable at his Madison Hotel here in Washington so that new ambassadors \nto our country got to meet each other socially.\n  He also organized a series of meetings for former Cabinet members and \ndistinguished military leaders who had reached the top of our military \nstructure so they could come together and share their interests and \nremember old times together.\n  He said to me once: A person really was not your friend unless he \nreally remembered you after he left office. He developed friendships \nthat I think the memories of will last for a long time.\n  It is a difficult thing for me to think of not having my friend in \nthe Senate dining room with me for years to come. But I want the Senate \nto know that I think this is one man who contributed a great deal to \nthe friendships of our Senate. Oftentimes he had dinners at his home, \nat my suggestion, to help bring together some of the Members of the \nSenate and the House, so we might meet together socially and discuss \nnonbusiness subjects and get to know one another better.\n\n  I am hopeful that the District will remember that he was a member of \nthe board that controlled the District of Columbia before the District \nbecame independent and elected its own Mayor. Marshall served on the \nOpera Board at the Kennedy Center and he served on the Boards of both \nGeorgetown and George Washington Universities. He was proud to call \nhimself a Mason.\n  He had a collection of rare manuscripts and books. I will be very \ninterested to see what happens to them. He had signatures he collected \nof almost every well-known politician, President, and Cabinet officer \nin the history of the United States.\n  He obviously had a very large Lincoln collection, for he was a great \nadmirer of Lincoln. Since I have been Chairman, when one enters the \nanteroom of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they will see a bust \nof Lincoln--it is really a reproduction of a bust of Lincoln that Mr. \nCoyne gave me--so people might understand the importance of Lincoln to \nthe process we all are pursuing here; that is, equal justice for all.\n  I do hope other Members who have known Mr. Coyne will share their \nknowledge of his activities with us on the floor. But in any event, \nMadam President, thank you very much for the privilege of addressing \nthe Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article from March \n17 concerning Mr. Coyne be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2000]\n\n      Marshall Coyne Dies at Age 89; Developer Built Madison Hotel\n\n       Marshall B. Coyne, the Washington developer whose best-\n     known holding was the Madison hotel, which hosted prime \n     ministers and celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, died of \n     complications from a broken hip March 16 at his home in \n     Washington. He was 89.\n       Mr. Coyne was a New York native who moved to the Washington \n     area in the 1940s. With his late business partner, Charles \n     Rose, he started Roscoe-Ajax Construction Co. and built \n     apartment and office buildings, mostly in the District. They \n     opened the Madison luxury hotel at 15th and M streets NW in \n     1963, and Mr. Coyne later became the sole owner and \n     proprietor.\n       Rival hoteliers were skeptical of the Madison's potential, \n     predicting that no one would pay the $27 daily minimum to \n     stay in a place simply because it offered deep-pile carpets, \n     rosewood paneling and Czech crystal chandeliers. Rooms at the \n     Madison now average $465 a day.\n       Mr. Coyne hoped the hotel would rank with Claridge's in \n     London. He said, ``We'll start looking at the balance sheet \n     later, after we've built up the kind of clientele we're \n     seeking and after we have the hotel operating at capacity.''\n       He envisioned an attentive staff whose members knew their \n     guests by name and always had a cigarette lighter handy to \n     aid a smoker. In the first year, clients included newspaper \n     heir William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Robert Six, the former \n     president of Continental Airlines Inc.\n       Notable guests in recent years included the Russian \n     delegations during the 1987 and 1990 summits between the \n     former Soviet Union and the United States.\n       Because of his clientele, Mr. Coyne maintained a private \n     persona.\n       ``He was not the kind of guy who would stand on the street \n     corner shouting about how he had lunch with the Dalai Lama, \n     which he did a couple of times,'' said Sheldon S. Cohen, the \n     former IRS commissioner who was a longtime friend and estate \n     trustee.\n       Another close friend was Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who \n     described Mr. Coyne as ``the kind of friend every senator \n     should have. He never talked business. He talked fishing or \n     stamps or books, and often of his trip to Mongolia, because \n     of our mutual interest in China.''\n       Stevens said Mr. Coyne also organized the Ambassadors' \n     Round Table, an informal gathering of potentates who had \n     lunches and dinners at the Madison.\n       Hotel food, in fact, put Mr. Coyne in the news briefly in \n     1982, when he was fined $5,000 for buying Canada geese with \n     the intent to turn them into pate, a violation of the \n     Migratory Bird and Treaty Act. He denied charges that he \n     served the geese at the hotel's Montpelier Restaurant--he \n     said they were for private consumption--but pleaded guilty \n     and paid the fine.\n       His wealth then was estimated to be $50 million to $100 \n     million, and he told The Washington Post that the fine was \n     ``like a parking ticket. You pay the $3 and forget about \n     it.''\n       The Madison, with 353 rooms, is one of about 10 area \n     properties run by Madison Management and Investment Co., \n     which Mr. Coyne had headed since the 1970s.

Madam President, I congratulate the dedicated \nVermonters responsible for the grand opening of the Vermont Internet \nCrimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force's new office in downtown \nBurlington. This new office should build on the success of the Vermont \nICAC Task Force to coordinate between local, State and Federal law \nenforcement agencies from around the region in their efforts to combat \nthe emerging problem of computer crime.\n  Unfortunately, far too many State and local law enforcement agencies \ncannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes themselves. \nIn Vermont, there are few law enforcement officers among the more than \n900 serving in our state who have training in investigating computer \ncrimes and analyzing the evidence. Without the necessary educational \ntraining, technical support, and coordinated information, our law \nenforcement officials will be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down \non computer crimes against children.\n  But the Vermont ICAC Task Force is helping our law enforcement \nofficers meet this new challenge in the information age. Through the \ncollaborative training and public education programs of the ICAC Task \nForce, Vermont law enforcement officials are able to use the resources \nof the Department of Justice and the Vermont community to fight cyber-\ncriminals.\n  I have introduced Federal legislation, the Computer Crime Enforcement \nAct, S. 1314, to provide the Vermont ICAC Task Force and other Vermont \nlaw enforcement agencies with additional resources. My legislation \nwould authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to \nhelp states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under my bill \nmay be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs \nfor state and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the \nrapidly growing field of computer criminal justice.\n  It is hard for our law enforcement community to keep up with \ncriminals in the computer age. Lawbreakers have integrated highly \ntechnical methods with traditional crimes and developed creative new \ntypes of crime. They use computers to cross State and national \nboundaries electronically, creating jurisdictional problems. They also \nuse sophisticated equipment that makes them difficult to trace.\n  But we Vermonters can prevent, capture and prosecute cyber-criminals \nby following the model set by the Vermont ICAC Task Force. The Vermont \nICAC Task Force has done, and will continue to do, great work to \nprotect Vermont's children from Internet crimes in its new home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1454-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1454-S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TUNISIA'S 44TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to commend Tunisia \non its 44 years of independence and to congratulate the people of \nTunisia on their many successful endeavors.\n  In 1997, Tunisia and the United States celebrated the bicentennial of \nthe ``Treaty of Peace and Friendship.'' This celebration marked the \nlongest unbroken friendship treaty in the history of the two countries. \nThroughout our long relationship, the United States and Tunisia have \nexperienced cooperation based upon respect and mutual commitment to \nfreedom, democracy, and the peaceful resolution of conflict.\n  Tunisia has been a leader in promoting stability and peace in Africa \nand the Middle East. It was the first Arab state to host an Israeli \ndelegation and hold a multilateral meeting promoting peace. In 1996, \nTunisia and Israel opened interest sections in each country and \nestablished full diplomatic relations.\n  In addition to supporting peace in the Middle East, Tunisia has made \nimpressive economic strides. The people of Tunisia enjoy a high \nstandard of living, and the country has successfully graduated from \ndevelopment assistance\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nto self-sufficiency. These improvements have come about through the \ndevotion of vital resources to the promotion of its people, education, \nand economic reform. Tunisia's market-oriented economy has flourished \nunder increasingly privatized companies. And, Tunisia's membership in \nthe World Trade Organization is indicative of its willingness to engage \nthe world and maintain involvement with other nations.\n  Tunisia has been a friend and ally to the United States for many \nyears. I look forward to continued cooperation and friendship in the \nyears to come. As Tunisia celebrates its 44th Anniversary of \nIndependence, I offer my sincere congratulations on their many \nsuccessful accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1455-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE 190TH AIR REFUELING WING\n\n Mr. ROBERTS.

The enormous sacrifice and dedication of the \n190th personnel reflects great credit upon themselves, the 190th Air \nRefueling Wing and the Kansas Air National Guard. These dedicated \nAmericans participated in two consecutive deployments from February 24 \nto April 9, 1999 in support of Operation Northern Watch and Operation \nAllied Force. The 190th Air Refueling Wing deployed again from July 11 \nto August 20, 1999 in support of Operation Northern Watch. The 190th \nflew 209 combat support sorties and off loaded over 10 million pounds \nof fuel to coalition aircraft during the three deployments. Their \nservice directly impacted the success of Operation Northern Watch in \nIraq and Operation Allied Force in Kosovo.

GRANUZZO, USN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Rear Admiral Andrew A. \nGranuzzo as he prepares to retire upon completion of forty-two years of \ndistinguished service. It is a privilege for me to honor his many \noutstanding achievements and commend him for his devotion to the Navy \nand our great nation.\n  A native New Yorker, Rear Admiral Granuzzo's Navy career began in \n1958 upon his enlistment. During the years that followed, he was \ncommissioned as a naval officer and earned his wings of gold as a naval \naviator. His assignments included sea duty with helicopter \nantisubmarine squadrons on both coasts, service with an attack \nhelicopter squadron in Vietnam, and exchange duty in the United Kingdom \nwith the Royal Navy. He commanded Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron \n15, was navigator of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal and \ncommanded two ships, U.S.S. Inchon and U.S.S. Saipan.\n  Rear Admiral Granuzzo was selected for Flag rank in 1991, and \ncommanded Amphibious Group Two, leading a 22-nation NATO exercise at \nsea. Twice, he commanded Joint Task Groups interdicting the flow of \ndrugs through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Perhaps his most significant contribution to the Navy is the role he \nhas played in reshaping the Navy's diverse and often divergent aspects \nof safety, environmental protection, and occupational health. As \nCommander of the Naval Safety Center, he introduced the principles of \nrisk management to naval operations. During his tenure, accidents and \nfatalities, on and off duty, was dramatically reduced and the lowest \naccident rate in naval aviation history was achieved.\n  As the Director of Environmental Protection, Safety and Occupational \nHealth Division for the Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral \nGranuzzo provided dynamic, inspirational and brilliant leadership \nduring a critical, highly visible period for the Navy. As advocate for \nboth naval operations and the environment, he pioneered new \ninitiatives, including the first-ever, capped cost, commercially \ninsured, installation environmental clean up contract, which has the \npotential of saving tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars. \nAdditionally, he spearheaded savings in workers' compensation costs; \naccelerated field tests of a new bioremediation method for the \nbiohazard perchlorate; and conceived a program that reduced shipboard \noil spills. Rear Admiral Granuzzo's innovations have positioned the \nNavy to ensure its ships leave a clean wake, its facilities and \ninstallations preserve and protect the natural environment, and its \npeople embrace their role as good stewards of the environment.\n  From the beginnings of the cold war, through Vietnam, the gulf war, \nand beyond--forty-two years in all--Rear Admiral Granuzzo has served as \na warrior of uncommon valor. He is an individual of rare character and \nhis professionalism will be sincerely missed. I am proud, Mr. \nPresident, to thank him for his honorable service in the United States \nNavy, and to wish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he closes \nhis distinguished military career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1455-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE ROBINSONS ON THEIR 70TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. Individuals from strong families contribute to society. In an \nera when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union \ndissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important \nto honor those who have taken seriously the commitment of ``till death \nus do part'', demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of \nlove, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country \nstrong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Ramah and Herbert \nRobinson of Lee's Summit, Missouri, who on April 9, 2000, will \ncelebrate their 70th wedding anniversary. Many things have changed in \nthe 70 years this couple has been married, but the values, principles, \nand commitment this marriage demonstrates are timeless. As the \nRobinsons celebrate their 70th year together with family and friends, \nit will be apparent that the lasting legacy of this marriage will be \nthe time, energy, and resources invested in their children, church, and \ncommunity. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can \ncelebrate a similar milestone.\n  The Robinsons' commitment to the principles and values of their \nmarriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1455-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1455-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNITION OF MIKE KELLY OF GVEA, FAIRBANKS\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to recognize an Alaskan \nthat has done so very much for his state and his community. I am \nreferring to Mike Kelly, the President, General Manager and Chief \nExecutive of Operations of Golden Valley Electric Association of \nFairbanks, Alaska. You see Mr. Kelly retired last week after 33 years \nof service--the last 17 as President--service not just to his company, \nbut to the citizens of Alaska.\n  Mr. Kelly is a recognized leader within Alaska's utility industry. \nOver the past three decades he has grown Interior Alaska's sole \nelectric co-operative into a multi-million-dollar enterprise providing \nreliable electric service to more than 80,000 people. And providing \ndependable electric service in Alaska is no small feat. Keeping power \nflowing in a state where temperatures vary by 150 degrees between \nsummer and winter and where high winds, blizzards and harsh conditions \nare common, requires skill, organization and perseverance. And his \nleadership is even more remarkable in that he has accomplished this \nlevel of excellence without raising his company's power rates once in \nthe last 18 years.\n  Mr. Kelly has dedicated his career at GVEA to fighting for projects \nand progress that have benefitted consumers both in Alaska's Railbelt \nand in Alaska's remotest regions. He spearheaded GVEA's successful \npurchase of the Fairbanks Municipal Utilities System, has been the \nprime mover in the construction of the Northern (power) Intertie \nProject and has served well in many leadership positions within the \nindustry and in the community of Fairbanks.\n  He has volunteered to share his skills and leadership with many \norganizations, including the Board of Regents of the University of \nAlaska, the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club of \nFairbanks, and the Fairbanks Industrial Development Corp.,\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nalong with the Boards of Fairbanks Memorial Hospital Foundation and \nDenali State Bank.\n  He is the winner of the Northwest Public Power Association Raver \nAward (1986) for displaying outstanding community service through \nleadership. He was the 1999 recipient of the Mason Lazelle Award, the \nhighest honor awarded by the industry in Alaska. And he has been \nsingled out for well deserved recognition by the Associated Students of \nBusiness, the University of Alaska Fairbanks Alumni Association as the \nOutstanding Alumni of the Year, and by many other groups.\n  While Mr. Kelly now will have more time to spend on the river \nfishing, out hunting and with his family, I'm sure Alaska has not seen \nthe last of his efforts on behalf of Fairbanks and the state has a \nwhole. My congratulations go to him for his many accomplishments and \nNancy and I offer our best wishes for a wonderful retirement. Alaska is \na better place because of your service to your city and your \nstate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1456-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1456-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE TEXT OF A PROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES \nAND BANGLADESH CONCERNING THE PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 93\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153 \n(b), (d)) (the Act), the text of a proposed Agreement Between the \nUnited States of America and the People's Republic of Bangladesh to \nextend the Agreement for Cooperation Between the United States of \nAmerica and the People's Republic of Bangladesh Concerning Peaceful \nUses of Nuclear Energy signed at Dhaka, September 17, 1981 (the \nAgreement for Cooperation).\n  The proposed Agreement to extend the Agreement for Cooperation (the \n``Extension Agreement'') was originally approved and its execution \nauthorized by President Bush based on his written determination that \nthe performance of the Agreement for Cooperation for an additional \nperiod of 20 years would promote, and would not constitute an \nunreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. A copy of \nPresident Bush's written approval, authorization, and determination is \nenclosed. Also enclosed is a copy of the unclassified Nuclear \nProliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) prepared at that time by the \nDirector, United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n  The proposed Extension Agreement was effected by an exchange of \ndiplomatic notes at Dhaka on January 5, 1993, and February 6, 1993. The \nterms of the Extension Agreement condition its entry into force on each \nState notifying the other of the completion of its respective legal \nrequirements for entry into force. However, before the proposed \nExtension Agreement could be submitted to the Congress in 1993 for \nreview pursuant to section 123 of the Act, the Government of Bangladesh \nasked to consult with the United States regarding a possible \nmodification of the term of extension. These discussions proved to be \nvery protracted, but both Governments have now agreed that their \noriginal intention to extend the Agreement for Cooperation for an \nadditional period of 20 years from the date of the original Agreement's \nexpiration (i.e., to extend it until June 24, 2012) should stand, and \nthat the Extension Agreement should be brought into force as soon as \neach Party has notified the other in writing that it has completed its \nlegal requirements for doing so.\n  Section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277) now \nalso provides that each Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement \nprepared pursuant to the Act shall be accompanied by a classified annex \nprepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director of \nCentral Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information. The \nSecretary of State is submitting to the Congress under separate cover \nsuch a classified annex. It contains, inter alia, the Secretary of \nState's reaffirmation of the conclusions reached in the original \nunclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (a) that \ncontinued implementation of the Agreement for Cooperation is consistent \nwith all requirements of the Act, and (b) that the safeguards and other \ncontrol mechanisms and the peaceful-use assurances contained in the \nAgreement for Cooperation are adequate to ensure that any assistance \nfurnished under it will not be used to further any military or nuclear \nexplosive purpose.\n  I am pleased to reconfirm President Bush's approval of the Extension \nAgreement and authorization of its execution and implementation. \nBangladesh is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) and is fully in compliance with its nuclear \nnonproliferation commitments under that Treaty. In my judgment, \ncontinued performance of the Agreement for Cooperation between the \nUnited States of America and the People's Republic of Bangladesh \nConcerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy will promote, and not \nconstitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. \nApart from the proposed extension, the Agreement for Cooperation will \nremain in all other respects the same as that which was favorably \nreviewed by the Congress in 1982. The Department of State, the \nDepartment of Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have \nreconfirmed their favorable views regarding the original NPAS as well \nas the conclusions contained herein.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act.

A bill to assist in the development and implementation of \nprojects to provide for the control of drainage water, storm water, \nflood water, and other water as part of water-related integrated \nresource management, environmental infrastructure, and resource \nprotection and development projects in the Colusa Basin Watershed, \nCalifornia; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     COLUSA BASIN INTEGRATED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PLAN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \nwhich provides a comprehensive watershed plan to protect against \nflooding in the Colusa Basin. Last year such flooding caused \napproximately $4.9 million in damage. In 1995 a major flood caused an \nestimated $100 million in damages to public and private property and \ncrops.\n  This bill would provide the necessary authorization for the Secretary \nof Interior to participate in the Colusa Basin project on a cost-shared \nbasis. The Colusa Basin project would build the necessary \ninfrastructure (small impoundments) to catch flood water, control the \nrate of release, restore wetlands and vegetation and ultimately protect \nthe area against flooding. This authorization is needed for the project \nto continue.\n  I introduced an identical bill in the 105th Congress which passed \nboth Houses of Congress but fell victim to the politics surrounding the \nomnibus budget bill. This bill once again enjoys bipartisan support.\n  I urge Congress to consider this bill before the end of the 106th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 2249. A bill to amend title VII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the Commissioner of Social Security to provide Congress with an \nannual report on the Social Security program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\n         the social security reporting improvements act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the issue we \nare going to take up tomorrow, the Social Security earnings limitation, \nand the fact that we are going to pass a bill tomorrow which will \neliminate a limitation on the ability of people once they retire to \nmake money independent of Social Security benefits they receive and not \nhave their Social Security benefits reduced.\n  Under present-day law, unfortunately, a retired individual--or not \neven retired person, a person who has reached eligibility age for \nSocial Security benefits--the age for eligibility retirement is really \nthe wrong term to apply to that individual. That person is penalized if \nhe goes out and gets a job because his benefits under Social Security \nare reduced if he makes a certain amount of money under that job.\n  That is wrong. It is something I have tried to correct, and a number \nof Members of this Senate have tried to correct, for a number of years.\n  I have a bill, cosponsored by Senators Kerrey, Breaux, Grassley, \nThompson, Robb, and Thomas. It is a very bipartisan bill, obviously, \nand is strongly supported by many of the Members on the Finance \nCommittee. That bill is, in substance, a reform bill for the entire \nSocial Security system to allow us to have a Social Security system \nwhich is solvent for the next 100 years. It is a creative and \nimaginative piece of legislation, and it accomplishes that growth which \nis to create solvency in the Social Security system over the next 100 \nyears and do it without raising taxes.\n  One of the elements of that bill is the repeal of the earnings \nlimitation. It has been something I have supported and I have backed up \nwith legislative language, cosponsored by myself, as I mentioned, and \nalso by other Members of the Senate. Over the years, we have worked in \nthis area. It is a very appropriate area to go into. However, tomorrow \nwhen we take up the bill for repealing the earnings limitation, we are \ngoing to take it up as sort of an isolated event. We are not taking it \nup very much as an isolated event but as part of a Social Security \nreform package. I guess that is where I have my concern, because we \nknow the Social Security system, although solvent today and running \nvery large surpluses, is headed towards the disastrous crash.\n  When the baby boom generation, the Bill Clinton generation, arrives \nat retirement, which starts in the year 2008 and accelerates \naggressively so that by the year 2014 we actually are running a cash \ndeficit within the Social Security system, we will have so many people \nretired in this country during the post-2008 period that we will have \ntoo many people retired for the younger generation to be able to \nsupport them effectively under the present structure of the Social \nSecurity system.\n  It will cost the next earnings generation--that generation who are my \nchildren, the children of the Members of this Senate, and their \nchildren's children--over $7 trillion in general fund revenues. We are \nnot talking about Social Security taxes; we are talking about general \nfund revenues over the period from 2014 to 2034. It will cost $7 \ntrillion of general fund revenues to keep the Social Security system \nsolvent.\n  What does $7 trillion in general fund revenues mean? That means there \nwill have to be tax increases of $7 trillion in order to pay for those \nbenefits, or, alternatively, we will have to cut them.\n  Some of us have said let's not force this crisis on the next \ngeneration, let's not turn to our children and say, Here is the \nproblem; we are going to give it to you. Many of us have said let's \nlook at the problem today and try to solve it, let's try to put in \nplace systems that will allow us to build up a process which will \nprotect our children from having to face the catastrophe of having to \nsupport our generation in retirement at levels which they could not \npossibly afford to support and which would put an undue burden on the \nnext generation in the area of tax increases.\n  We have put together substantive pieces of legislation. The one I \nmentioned, for example, the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley-Thompson-\nThomas-Robb--Senator Roth is also on that--is one of the proposals.\n  There is another bill in the House called Kolbe-Stenholm, an \naggressive piece of legislation. Senator Moynihan has a piece of \nlegislation. Senator Gramm from Texas has a piece of legislation. The \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Congressman Archer, and \nCongressman Shaw have proposals. Congressman Kasich and Congressman \nSmith have proposals.\n  There are a lot of proposals out there. Many of them are very \nsubstantive and thoughtful. I would like to think ours is. Almost all \nof them will do a lot more than we are doing today trying to put in \nplace and under control a system that will address the Social Security \nproblem as it is facing us and as it is facing the next generation.\n  I see the pages down here. These folks are going to end up paying a \nhuge bill as a result of our inaction today in Congress. It is not fair \nand not right for us to put the next generation in this position.\n\n  As we take up the earnings limitation repeal tomorrow, it is \nnecessary and appropriate. It is something we should do. But we should \nbe much more aggressive on this issue. We should be addressing the \nfundamental problems that are facing us in the Social Security system, \nthe most fundamental of which is that it is an unfunded liability.\n  Essentially, the Social Security system says we promise you, the baby \nboom generation, all of these benefits. But we don't do anything about \ngetting the baby boom generation into a position where we can pay those \nSocial Security benefits. Rather, we go on a pay-as-you-go basis. One \ndollar taken in today is paid out today, or spent on some other \noperation of government today. So when the baby boom generation \nretires, there are no dollars available for them to support their \nbenefit structure.\n  We ought to address that. The best way to address it is to do \nsomething which will be called prefunding liability. That is probably a \ntechnical term which is sort of lost in its translation. It basically \nmeans giving people savings, assets, and gives people something they \ncan physically own and possess, so that when they retire, they will \nhave assets they can use to pay for their retirement benefits under the \nSocial Security system.\n  In our proposal, this is called a personal savings account. \nEssentially, we reduce the payroll tax today. We say let's reduce the \npayroll tax today because it is running a surplus, take that money we \nsave on payroll taxes and give it to all of the Social Security earners \ntoday, and allow those Social Security earners to save that money for \nthemselves. So that by the time they retire, they will have a nest egg, \na physical nest egg that is based in stocks, Treasury notes, and bonds, \nwhich will be available to them to spend on their retirement. It is \ncalled free-funding liability, so their actual assets are there when \nthey retire. They actually physically own something they can use to \nbenefit them in their retirement and to support the costs of their \nretirement structure in Social Security.\n  That is the essence of what we propose in our bill--to prefund the \nliability through personal savings accounts. It is an idea for which \nthe time appears to be coming.\n  I notice Governor Bush is talking about this aggressively. Other \npeople who are running for the Presidency are talking about this \naggressively. Regrettably, this administration has not been willing to \ntalk about this aggressively. This administration has walked away from \nthe opportunity to fundamentally reform and improve Social Security so \nwe can past on to our children a solvent system instead of passing on \nto them an insolvent system.\n  I and a number of Members on the other side of the aisle have great \nfrustrations. I know Senator Kerrey from Nebraska has on numerous \noccasions--and will tomorrow, I suspect, when he offers his amendment--\nexpressed the frustration he feels and many of us feel about the fact \nwe are unable to get White House leadership on this critical issue of \nmoving forward Social Security reform so the next generation isn't \npassed a sour lemon but is given an opportunity to have a lifestyle \nthat is equal to ours, or hopefully significantly better, and isn't \ninstead passed a huge bill from our generation that they have to pay \noff in order to support our generation's retirement. I believe\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\nthis administration refuses to take any aggressive action in this area \nfor political reasons because they want to keep the issue alive for the \nnext election cycle.\n\n  Clearly, there is bipartisan support in the Senate. As I mentioned, \nthe Members of the Senate supporting the bill are Senator Kerrey, \nSenator Breaux, and Senator Grassley--a bipartisan group. Their \nphilosophies are significantly different. We could build a coalition in \nthis Senate to pass substantial Social Security reform which would make \nthe system solvent for the next 100 years without raising taxes on the \nnext generation.\n  If we could get leadership and assistance from the White House, we \ncould do that. Unfortunately, we have not gotten that. Instead, we are \ngetting one little snippet of the Social Security issue, the earnings \nlimitation test. It has been passed by the Senate, passed by the House, \nand the President says he will sign it if it is a clean bill.\n  What is the effect of taking up one little part of the whole puzzle? \nThis happens to be a part of the puzzle that ends up costing more money \nto the system. In other words, when we repeal the earnings limitation, \nwe end up actually putting the system in a less financially sound \nposition than it is today. It is an appropriate thing to do because the \nearnings limitation is bad public policy. We should not be saying to \nsenior citizens: You shouldn't go out and work; or, if you do work, we \nwill reduce your Social Security benefit.\n  That is bad policy, especially bad policy when we have a potentially \nlarge soon-to-retire generation, the baby boom generation. When our \ngeneration retires, as a nation we are going to need to keep people \nworking even though they may be retiring. We won't have enough workers \nin this country. That is going to be a demographic fact.\n  The earnings limitation is bad policy. It has a negative impact on \nSocial Security long-term solvency. It aggravates the problem for the \nnext generation by repealing it as a freestanding event. It should, \nrather, be repealed in the context of an overall reform effort. By \ndoing that, we can adjust for the fact that this may negatively impact \nthe financial situation of the Social Security system, while other \nthings could positively impact it, and we can weigh them off.\n  But we are not going to do that. We are doing just Social Security \nlimitations. If that is all we can do, that is what we should do. But \nwe should be honest with the American people. We should tell them what \nthe effect of it will be. More importantly, we should tell them the \npresent status and the future status of the Social Security trust \nfunds. We shouldn't continue this babble about how solvent the Social \nSecurity trust fund is. Although it is running a surplus today, it is \nas predictable as night follows day, as the sun rises in the east and \nsets in the west, it is an absolute known fact that beginning in the \nyear 2008, as the large baby boom generation retires, we are going to \nsee the system head toward massive insolvency if we don't have massive \ntax increases or major benefit cuts.\n  We ought to tell the American people so they know it is coming and \nthey can plan. If the Congress isn't going to plan, if the White House \nisn't going to plan, at least give the American people the information \nthey need to plan.\n  I hope to have this bill agreed to because I think it is reasonable. \nI am introducing a proposal which was essentially the proposal put \nforward in November 1999 by the Technical Panel On Assumptions and \nMethods of the Social Security Advisory Board. It is a professional \ngroup, an independent bipartisan group set up by the Social Security \ntrustees for the purpose of reviewing what should be done with the \nSocial Security system. This Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods \nof the Social Security Advisory Board put out a series of \nrecommendations regarding information that should be available in plain \nEnglish--they stress ``in plain English''--to the American people. I \nhave suggested we amend this effort by putting in place that \nrecommendation, have the panel's recommendations become a requirement \nof law, and thus they will be disclosed to the American people.\n\n  What will be disclosed? The following:\n  What the program will cost each year;\n  What is the projected cash-flow deficit in dollars, real and nominal;\n  What are the benefits the system can actually fund as opposed to what \nwe tell the public;\n  What is the impact of all of the above on the Federal budget.\n  These are not complicated. These can be simply stated. But they are \nvery important facts for the American people to know.\n  Some don't want the American people to have this information. They \nrealize if people were actually informed about the significant \nfinancial crisis we are facing in the Social Security system beginning \nwhen the baby boom generation retires, people would get pretty upset. \nThey would ask: Why hasn't Congress acted? Why isn't the White House \ndisplaying leadership? Some would rather not have this information on \nthe table. It is ``vanilla'' information. It is information the \nAmerican people have the right to know. It is information I am \nsuggesting be made available. It is information the Social Security \nAdvisory Board is suggesting be made available. It is not a partisan \neffort on my part; it is simply a desire to, hopefully, further the \neffort to inform the American people of the problems we face if we do \nnot get on this issue of Social Security and begin to solve it.\n  That is the amendment I will offer. That is the bill I am introducing \ntoday. I see the Senator from Iowa, the ranking Republican on the \nFinance Committee. He has been a leader on the issue of Social Security \nreform in this Congress. I greatly appreciate his support, \ncosponsorship, and initiation in drafting the bill which solves the \noverall problem. I thank him for his support.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence, and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2252. A bill to provide for the review of agriculture mergers and \nacquisitions by the Department of Agriculture and to outlaw unfair \npractices in the agriculture industry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              The Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, \nagriculture is one of the most crucial industries to my State, Iowa. \nThe small, independent family farmer is a common thread running \nthroughout the cultural, economic and social fabric of my State. I \nfirmly believe that if that thread is pulled, the entire fabric of Iowa \ncould come unraveled.\n  All my life I have lived and worked on a farm. I recognize that Iowa \nand the world are changing and that agriculture cannot stagnate and \nstay the same decade after decade. If we are to continue to survive and \nthrive into the 21st century, Iowa must diversify and adapt. But the \nbest way to do that is not by throwing away the past and the present. \nThe best way to prepare for the future is to build on the best of our \nheritage. And the family farmer is one of the best things about Iowa's \nheritage. I am committed to preserving and supporting this valuable \nmember of Iowa's communities.\n  Any farmer knows that agriculture is a risky business. If you are \ngoing to be a farmer, you had better be prepared for ups and downs. But \nfarmers feel more vulnerable now than at just about any time I can \nrecall and with good reason.\n  We all know there's been a so-called ``merger-mania'' going on \nthroughout our nation's economy. Large corporations are joining forces \nwith other large corporations to form new business giants in every \nsector of the economy and agriculture is no exception.\n  In the last couple of years, the AG industry has seen a significant \nnumber of multi-million and multi-billion dollar mergers affecting \ngrain and livestock. In the face of all these mergers and new \nalliances, the independent producer farming a thousand acres or less, \nsees himself getting smaller and smaller in comparison to many of his \ncompetitors. He sees himself having fewer and fewer choices of who to \nbuy from and sell to. Yet, those farmers know, as I do, that the \nindependent farmer is one of the most efficient businessmen in our \nnation's economy. That's why the United States can feed itself and a \ngood portion of the world. So long as\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\nthe market place is fair and open, the family farmer can compete.\n  I am not suggesting that all mergers are in and of themselves wrong \nor unfair to family farmers. Businesses may be in situations where \ntheir survival and success is dependent on joining forces with another. \nThat right is a fundamental principle of a capitalist system and has to \nbe preserved. Indeed, I believe that farmers do not need to be \nprotected from the marketplace. But I believe we should protect their \naccess to the marketplace.\n  That is why I will be introducing legislation to guarantee greater \nopenness and accountability to the merger review process as it pertains \nto agri-business.\n  My bill will give USDA, the Federal department with the background \nand expertise in agriculture, a more prominent role in assessing AG \nmergers. Furthermore, my bill will provide a much-needed balance in the \nfocus of AG merger reviews.\n  Currently, when the Department of Justice assesses a proposed merger, \ntheir focus is weighted towards the impact a merger would have on \nconsumers. No one, certainly not I, would argue against ensuring that a \nmerger does not harm consumers. However, given the fact that AG \nmergers, more so than other kinds of mergers, impact a way of life, not \njust an industry, it is critical that we give equal importance to the \neffect these mergers have on producers.\n  My bill will do just that by requiring USDA to do an assessment of \nhow a proposed corporate union will affect producers and their access \nto the market. My bill will keep DOJ in the driver's seat on mergers, \nbut will make the expertise and knowledge of USDA a prominent part of \nthe merger review record.\n  I am aware other proposals reforming the agri-business merger review \nprocess are being crafted. I am certainly willing to consider all \nsuggested reforms. Nonetheless, I believe my bill is strong and \nbalanced in several respects. As I mentioned, my bill provides a \nheightened role for USDA in the merger review process, giving producers \na seat at the table when mergers and acquisitions are being reviewed by \nDOJ or FTC.\n  In addition, I would like to highlight the following provisions in my \nbill.\n  There is a requirement that USDA do a merger review that focuses on \nthe needs of producers and whether the transaction would cause \nsubstantial harm to farmers' ability to compete in the marketplace. \nThis review will be conducted simultaneously with the Hart-Scott-Rodino \nreview now done by DOJ. There is no disruption in the current DOJ/FTC \nmerger review process. My legislation allows for negotiations between \nUSDA and the parties to a proposed merger in order to work out any \nconcerns USDA has.\n  Under my bill, if USDA's concerns are not satisfied, USDA may \nchallenge the merger in court to either stop the merger or impose \nconditions on the transaction.\n  Furthermore, this measure calls for the creation of a special counsel \nin USDA for competition matters, which is subject to Senate \nconsideration. My bill provides money for additional staff at USDA and \nDOJ.\n  This measure also prohibits the enforcement of confidentiality \nclauses in livestock production contracts that prevent producers from \ngetting the advice they need to make business decisions in their best \ninterests.\n  My bill provides contract poultry growers the same protections under \nGIPSA that other livestock producers have.\n  Finally, under my bill, the competition protection authorities of \nUSDA's packers and stockyards division is extended to include \nanticompetitive practices by dealers, processors and commission \nmerchants of all AG commodities.\n  Several components of this bill are based on proposals by the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the largest organization representing producers \nof all commodities.\n  I believe that bringing to the table a greater understanding of AG \nproducers' needs when examining AG mergers is the biggest missing \nelement to make the merger review process as fair as possible. Closing \nthis gap is the heart of my proposal.\n  I realize that DOJ currently has consultations with USDA on AG \nmergers. But I believe the current process is not consistent or open \nenough to assure producers' their concerns are adequately addressed.\n  The approach I advocate will ensure that producers' concerns and \nneeds are fully discussed when Federal agencies examine proposed AG \nbusiness mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and openness for small, \nindependent producers, we can go a long way toward alleviating their \nunderstandable anxiety.\n  As my colleagues from rural states know, AG concentration is one of \nthe most important issues in agriculture today. It is imperative that \nwe make meaningful progress on this issue before this Congress \nadjourns. As I stated earlier, I am aware of other efforts, principally \nby Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy, to craft a legislative response \nto the recent wave of AG mergers.\n  I commend them for their hard work and I appreciate their efforts to \nkeep me informed of their progress. I did not feel I could offer my \nunreserved endorsement of the proposal they have crafted thus far and I \nhave chosen to introduce my own bill.\n  However, I believe our proposals are close enough in scope, direction \nand intent that we can achieve a bipartisan compromise sooner rather \nthan later. I want it to be clearly understood that it is my desire to \nwork with Members from both sides of the aisle to calm farmers' fears \nabout high levels of AG concentration.\n  I am certain Congress will need to take additional steps to secure \nthe freedom of small producers to compete in the marketplace.\n  But my bill will assure that when AG mergers are given the necessary \nreview, the small, independent family farmer who I am proud to serve, \nwill not be left out.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in holding the door open for farmers \nacross the country and I ask for the support of all those who want to \npreserve the best of our Nation's agriculture heritage and ensure the \nsuperiority of U.S. Agriculture for decades to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2253. A bill to authorize the establishment of a joint United \nStates-Canada commission to study the feasibility of connecting the \nrail system in Alaska to the North American continental rail system, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                     rails to resources act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nestablish a bilateral U.S. and Canadian commission to study the \nfeasibility of extending the continental railroad system to Alaska via \na land link through Canada.\n  Mr. President, there are three things critical to the establishment \nof long-term economic stability for any state, region or country. The \nfirst is the availability of resources necessary to the production of \ngoods. The second is the availability of labor to manufacture those \ngoods. And the third is the availability of transportation systems to \nget those goods to market.\n  My State of Alaska, unfortunately, remains deficient in the third of \nthese critical elements. We have the resources, and we have the labor, \nbut we do not yet have the same essential transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  The idea of connecting the transcontinental rail system to Alaska is \nnot a new one. The original congressional action to establish the \nAlaska Railroad called for laying 1,000 miles of track in Alaska, which \nwould have been sufficient to carry it to the Alaska-Yukon border. \nCanada has at various times also looked at rail connections to the \nnorth country. Unfortunately, none of these have been carried through.\n  During World War II, the United States actually surveyed a route from \nPrince George, British Columbia all the way through Alaska to tidewater \nat Teller, on Alaska's Seward Peninsula. But again, this effort was \nnever completed, largely due to wartime shortages of steel.\n  While someday it would be beneficial to follow through on that World \nWar II plan, what I am proposing today is far less grandiose.\n  My bill would create a process for appointing members to the U.S. \nside of a bilateral commission to study the feasibility of extending \nthe current continental rail system from its present terminus in \nBritish Columbia, through\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\nthe Yukon Territory, to the present terminus of the Alaska Railroad \nnear Fairbanks. The distance to be traversed is on the order of 1,200 \nmiles. Mr. President, this is not pie in the sky. I believe that the \nextension of the railroad would pay for itself, not immediately, but in \nthe forseeable future.\n  The area through which the rail line would pass holds some of the \nrichest mineral prospects in North America. The Yukon-Tanana uplands \nstretch from Fairbanks down through much of the Yukon. This heavily \nmineralized area holds gold, silver, copper, nickel, lead and zinc in \ngreat quantities, plus substantial amounts of other elements. Further \nsouth along the possible routes, there are large quantities of high \nvalue timber, and vast amounts of lower quality wood that we now \nutilize for paper, fiberboard and other products.\n  Mr. President, some individuals and organizations will no doubt argue \nagainst even exploring this prospect because of a bias against the use \nof natural resources, or opposition to ``development'' in the \nwilderness. To them I would suggest that the construction of a railroad \nis an opportunity to control development--to avoid areas of particular \nsensitivity--which would be impossible with other transportation \nsystems. A rail line has far less of a ``footprint'' than even a one-\nlane road, and its stops are known quantities. Properly constructed, a \nrail line would make possible the development of vast resources, \nwithout creating the kind of uncontrolled situation that can lead to \nthe degradation of highly valued wild lands.\n  Others may point to the current volume of freight moving to and from \nAlaska and say, ``There is no way such a tiny amount of freight can \nsupport a railroad.'' They would be missing the point. The question is \nnot whether rail is a more effective means to carry the existing \nvolume, it is whether access to rail would spur enough new economic \nactivity to support the venture. I suggest that it might. Experts have \nsuggested there may be the potential for up to 120 million tons of \nfreight per year, which would be more than enough to pay back any \ninvestment.\n  I am not an expert. I cannot verify that contention, any more than I \ncan refute it. That is why we need a comprehensive feasibility study.\n  In January, a conference to discuss the potential for such an \nextension was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. Participants were \nextraordinarily supportive, adopting a strong resolution in favor of \nproceeding with a joint U.S.-Canada study.\n  I have drawn from that resolution to prepare the legislation I am \nintroducing today. Specifically, it would provide authorization to for \na $6 million, five-year effort to refine our understanding of both the \npositives and the negatives of a rail extension.\n  This is in no way an attempt to second-guess the feasibility process. \nWe need an objective, thorough survey of both costs and opportunities.\n  To that end, I am suggesting that the United States component of the \ncommission include local government, business, academic and Alaska \nNative leaders with expertise in the relevant fields. I am confident \nthat Canada will choose similarly well-qualified individuals for its \nown side of the commission.\n  Let's make no mistake about this--it is not universally supported, \nand I want my colleagues to be aware of that from the very beginning. \nMost of those who currently operate companies carrying goods to and \nfrom Alaska by truck and by water will find all kinds of reasons to \nsuggest that there is no way a railroad can be made to work.\n  Mr. President, it is only natural that those with a vested interest \nin the status quo should oppose change. It is their absolute right to \ndo so. But it is wrong to stifle debate. We should be free to accept \nand explore new ideas. That is what this commission is all about.\n  If the railroad connection is economically and environmentally and \nsocially sound, then let's move ahead. If it is not, then let's drop \nit. But at the very least, let's give it an honest hearing. That's what \nthis bill is about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rails to Resources Act of \n     2000.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) rail transportation is an essential component of the \n     North American intermodal transportation system;\n       (2) the development of economically strong and socially \n     stable communities in the western United States and Canada \n     was encouraged significantly by government policies promoting \n     the development of integrated transcontinental, interstate \n     and inter-provincial rail systems in the states, territories \n     and provinces of the two countries;\n       (3) U.S. and Canadian federal support for the completion of \n     new elements of the transcontinental, interstate and \n     interprovincial rail systems was halted before rail \n     connections were established to the state of Alaska and the \n     Yukon Territory;\n       (4) Both public and private lands in Alaska, the Yukon \n     territory and northern British Columbia, including lands held \n     by aboriginal peoples, contain extensive deposits of oil, \n     gas, coal and other minerals as well as valuable forest \n     products which presently are inaccessible, but which could \n     provide significant economic benefit to local communities and \n     to both nations if an economically efficient transportation \n     system was available;\n       (5) per ton of freight moved, rail transportation systems \n     emit lower levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and \n     volatile organic compounds than other modes of freight \n     transportation;\n       (6) rail transportation systems are capable of moving cargo \n     with up to nine times the energy efficiency of highway \n     transportation;\n       (7) rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas \n     facilitates controlled access and reduced overall impact to \n     environmentally sensitive areas;\n       (8) the extension of the continental rail system through \n     northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory to the \n     current terminus of the Alaska Railroad would significantly \n     benefit the U.S. and Canadian visitor industries by \n     facilitating the comfortable movement of passengers over long \n     distances while minimizing effects on the surrounding areas;\n       (9) extension of the Alaska Railroad system to the Canadian \n     border is consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed \n     in the Alaska Railroad Organic Act of 1914, which called for \n     a system of up to 1,000 miles in length; and,\n       (10) ongoing research and development efforts in the rail \n     industry continue to increase the efficiency of rail \n     transportation, ensure safety, and decrease the impact of \n     rail service on the environment.\n\n     SEC. 3. AGREEMENT FOR A UNITED STATES-CANADA BILATERAL \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       The President is authorized and urged to enter into an \n     agreement with the government of Canada to establish a joint \n     commission to study the technological and economic \n     feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska to the \n     nearest appropriate point on the North American continental \n     rail system.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 275\n\n       Whereas the United States has a deep and sustained interest \n     in the promotion of deregulation, competition, and regulatory \n     reform in Japan;\n       Whereas new and bold measures by the Government of Japan \n     regarding regulatory reform will help remove the regulatory \n     and structural impediments to the effective functioning of \n     market forces in the Japanese economy;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will increase the efficient \n     allocation of resources in Japan, which is critical to \n     returning Japan to a long-term growth path powered by \n     domestic demand;\n       Whereas regulatory reform will not only improve market \n     access for United States business and other foreign firms, \n     but will also enhance consumer choice and economic prosperity \n     in Japan;\n       Whereas a sustained recovery of the Japanese economy is \n     vital to a sustained recovery of Asian economies;\n       Whereas the Japanese economy must serve as one of the main \n     engines of growth for Asia and for the global economy;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan \n     reconfirmed the critical importance of deregulation, \n     competition, and regulatory reform when the 2 Governments \n     established the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and \n     Competition Policy in 1997;\n       Whereas telecommunications is a critical sector requiring \n     reform in Japan, where the market is hampered by a history of \n     laws, regulations, and monopolistic practices that do not \n     meet the needs of a competitive market;\n       Whereas as the result of Japan's laws, regulations, and \n     monopolistic practices, Japanese consumers and Japanese \n     industry have been denied the broad benefits of innovative \n     telecommunications services, cutting edge technology, and \n     lower prices that competition would bring to the market;\n       Whereas Japan's significant lag in developing broadband and \n     Internet services, and Japan's lag in the entire area of \n     electronic commerce, is a direct result of a noncompetitive \n     telecommunications regulatory structure;\n       Whereas Japan's lag in developing broadband and Internet \n     services is evidenced by the following: (1) Japan has only \n     17,000,000 Internet users, while the United States has \n     80,000,000 Internet users; (2) Japan hosts fewer than \n     2,000,000 websites, while the United States hosts over \n     30,000,000 websites; (3) electronic commerce in Japan is \n     valued at less than $1,000,000,000, while in the United \n     States electronic commerce is valued at over $30,000,000,000; \n     and (4) 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to the \n     Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools \n     are connected;\n       Whereas the disparity between the United States and Japan \n     is largely caused by the failure of Japan to ensure \n     conditions that allow for the development of competitive \n     networks which would stimulate the use of the Internet and \n     electronic commerce;\n       Whereas leading edge foreign telecommunications companies, \n     because of their high level of technology and innovation, are \n     the key to building the necessary telecommunications \n     infrastructure in Japan, which will only be able to serve \n     Japanese consumers and industry if there is a fundamental \n     change in Japan's regulatory approach to telecommunications; \n     and\n       Whereas deregulating the monopoly power of Nippon Telegraph \n     and Telephone Corporation would help liberate Japan's economy \n     and allow Japan to take full advantage of information \n     technology: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the appropriate officials in the executive branch \n     should implement vigorously the call for Japan to undertake a \n     major regulatory reform in the telecommunications sector, the \n     so-called ``Telecommunications Big Bang'';\n       (2) a ``Telecommunications Big Bang'' must address \n     fundamental legislative and regulatory issues within a \n     strictly defined timeframe;\n       (3) the new telecommunications regulatory framework should \n     put competition first in order to encourage new and \n     innovative businesses to enter the telecommunications market \n     in Japan;\n       (4) the Government of Japan should ensure that Nippon \n     Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and its affiliates \n     (the NTT\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\n     Group) are prevented from using their dominant position in \n     the wired and wireless market in an anticompetitive manner; \n     and\n       (5) the Government of Japan should take credible steps to \n     ensure that competitive carriers have reasonable, cost-based, \n     and nondiscriminatory access to the rights-of-way, \n     facilities, and services controlled by NTT, the NTT Group, \n     other utilities, and the Government of Japan, including--\n       (A) access to interconnection at market-based rates;\n       (B) unrestricted access to unbundled elements of the \n     network belonging to NTT and the NTT Group; and\n       (C) access to public roads for the installation of \n     facilities.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to make two sets of comments \non Japan today. The first relates to Japanese telecommunications \nderegulation. The second involves a recently issued report about the \nlack of compliance by Japan with the trade agreements it has signed \nwith the United States.\n  I am introducing today, along with Senator Grassley, a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution designed to encourage the Japanese Government to \nderegulate and open the Japanese telecommunications sector. Intense \nnegotiations are going on between our government and Japanese \nauthorities, and I hope that the Senate, by speaking out forcefully, \nwill give support to the progressive elements in Japan as they do \nbattle with the eternal forces of protection.\n  The United States has worked tirelessly to promote deregulation and \nopenness in the Japanese telecommunications sector over the past 20 \nyears. These efforts have led to significant changes in the procurement \npolicies of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, or NTT, which used to be \nthe government owned, monopoly domestic telecommunications provider, \nand is still the 800-pound gorilla in the sector. The efforts included \nagreements on devices for interconnection, cellular phones, and \ninternational value added networks. It involved use of U.S. laws like \nsection 301 and section 1377, the MOSS talks, the GATT, the WTO, and \nthe Information Technology Agreement.\n  The United States has probably negotiated more on Japanese \ntelecommunications than we have with any other nation over one specific \nsector. We have made a lot of progress, going from almost no sales by \nAmericans in this sector in Japan two decades ago to several billion \ndollars today.\n  But considerable work remains, and the focus now is under the rubric \nof the Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation. Japan, despite a decade of \nstagnation, is still the world's second largest economy with incredible \ncutting edge technology. Nevertheless, its pattern of consumption of \nhigh tech telecommunications goods and services makes it look more like \na second tier economy. While Japan's penetration of cellular phones is \namong the highest in the world, it falls far behind in many other \nmeasures of high tech telecommunications usage. For example, Japan has \nonly 20 million Internet users, compared to 80 million in the United \nStates. Japan hosts two million web sites, while the United States \nhosts over 30 million. Electronic commerce in Japan is valued at less \nthan one billion dollars, versus at least 30 times as much in the \nUnited States. And only 19 percent of Japan's schools are connected to \nthe Internet, while in the United States 89 percent of schools are:\n  The explanation is that Japan has a non-competitive regulatory system \nin telecommunications that prevents market forces from fully operating. \nForeign telecommunications service and equipment providers are limited \nin their ability to do business in Japan. This means that Japanese \nconsumers are prevented from obtaining the highest quality \ntelecommunications technology at the lowest price. They are not allowed \nto choose from the incredible array of services and products available \naround the world. And they pay higher prices than they should. Japanese \nfirms also suffer for the same reasons in their procurement of \ntelecommunications goods and services. They cannot get the best, and \nthey overpay for what they can buy. Many modern services are simply \nunavailable in Japan.\n\n  If the Japanese Government wanted to follow a path that would lead to \nhigher economic growth, greater choice and lower prices for its \nconsumers, and increased efficiency for its industry, it would \nderegulate this sector immediately.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I am introducing today simply \nstresses the need for significant regulatory reform in Japan, supports \nUSTR in vigorously pursuing this, and sends the message to Japan that \nthe Senate is strongly behind such an effort. Deregulation serves \nAmerican and international business. It serves the Japanese economy. It \nserves the Japanese consumer. It serves Japanese industry. And it \nserves the regional and global economy which needs a growing Japan. In \nthe long run, everyone would be a winner if Japan let market forces \noperate.\n  The second issue I want to address today is a report issued earlier \nthis month by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, the ACCJ, on \nJapan's compliance, or, rather, insufficient compliance, with trade \nagreements. The study, ``Making Trade Talks Work 2000: An On-the-Ground \nAnalysis of US-Japan Trade Agreements by American Businesses,'' looked \nat 58 major United States/Japan trade agreements reached between 1980 \nand 1999. The ACCJ rates 51 of them on a numerical basis, using four \nmeasures. Their astounding conclusion was that 53 percent were fully or \nmostly successful, while 47 percent were rated as partially successful, \nsuccessful in only one or two ways, or unsuccessful.\n  This rating, performed by American companies and industry \nassociations on the ground in Japan, working every day in the trenches \nto penetrate the Japanese market, should be a wake-up call to all of \nus. Despite all the attention spent on opening the Japanese market \nduring the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, barely half of \nthe agreements signed actually worked. This is an utterly unacceptable \nresult. I commend this report to my colleagues. Not only is its \nanalysis excellent, but the ACCJ offers a range of recommendations for \nfuture action.\n  Compliance by other nations with trade agreements is a serious \nproblem for our country, and it will likely get worse. Many of the easy \ntrade barriers around the world, such as tariffs and quotas, have been \nsignificantly reduced or eliminated. Now, we face the tougher trade \nbarriers, such as anti-competitive practices and internal regulations \nand standards designed to keep out foreign goods and services. These \nbarriers are harder to identify, harder to get agreement on, and it is \nharder to measure the results.\n  I am very worried about our government's system of monitoring trade \nagreements and ensuring that our trading partners will comply with \ntheir commitments. The GAO has told us that there is not even a place \nin the government where you can go to get a list of all trade \nagreements. When the ACCJ did its earlier study in 1997, they spent \nmonths just assembling all United States-Japan bilateral trade \nagreements. If you don't know what agreements exist, how can you \nenforce them?\n  In its most recent report on this subject, the GAO concluded that the \nExecutive Branch needed a more integrated approach to monitoring and \nenforcing trade agreements and should pursue a process of comprehensive \nand sustained strategic planning. GAO also concluded that declining \nstaff levels have limited agencies' monitoring and enforcement \nactivities. Some of the special skills needed to deal with the new \ncomplex trade agreements is also lacking.\n  I deeply appreciate the ACCJ's diligence in presenting us with an \nobjective analysis of the Japanese market situation. But, as GAO \nindicates, this may be just the tip of the iceberg internationally. The \nproblem is pervasive, and I don't see any trends that will make it \nbetter.\n  That is why, among other reasons, I recently introduced the China WTO \ncompliance bill to make sure that, once China enters the WTO, we won't \nhave this massive violation of our trade agreements as has happened \nwith Japan. That is why I recently introduced a bill to establish a \nCongressional Trade Office to provide the Congress with precisely the \ntype of objective information that the American Chamber of Commerce in \nJapan has provided, and to help those of us in the Congress ensure that \ntrade agreements reached are trade agreements implemented. I call on my \ncolleagues to work with me to develop a system that will ensure that \nAmerican workers,\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nfarmers, and businesses will benefit from the trade agreements that our \ntrade officials so diligently negotiate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/20/senate-section/article/S1470-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.
